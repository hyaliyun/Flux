Countless homes were destroyed and lots of people became homeless after the earthquake which is believed to have a magnitude of 7. The quake was not as serious as the 7.9-magnitude earthquake in 2008 that left more than 70,000 people dead in the Wenchuan area. But villagers who work in Chengdu, about 100 miles away, hurried back home Sunday morning, many on foot, the lucky ones on motorbikes, to check on their homes. Song Yuanqing, 43, a worker, arrived back after a 22-hour trip and found his house was still there but had already been very unstable . \\"We would like to do something, but we can't do anything,\\" Mr. Song said as he sat with neighbors around an outdoor fire built by the village leader in his backyard. In all, the government sent about 7,000 soldiers and People's Armed Police officers to the earthquake-hit area. By Saturday evening, there were so many rescue workers in the area that the government asked volunteers to stop coming. Li Keqiang, China's prime minister, flew to the area and slept in a tent on Saturday evening in Lushan County. The earthquake shook Sichuan Province at 8 a.m., when people were getting up a little later than usual because schools and universities were closed. \\"We were just getting up and getting dressed in our dormitory when the building shook, and I looked outside from our window and saw a row of houses had collapsed,\\" Xu Yan, 22, a student at the Agricultural University in Ya'an, said in a telephone interview. \\" _ .\\" The Chinese government said early Sunday that the death toll was 174, and about 5,700 people had been injured. The earthquake was also felt in Chengdu, one of China's biggest cities and the capital of Sichuan Province. People described water getting out of home aquariums and things like balls falling to the floor. In the town of Longmen, another hard-hit area near Ya'an,... The answer is:","output":"Which of the following statements is true about the earthquake in YUXI, China? A) The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.9, similar to the one in Wenchuan in 2008.

Step 1: Extract relevant information from the article - Magnitude of the earthquake: 7 - Number of soldiers and police officers sent to the area: 7,000 - Many people chose to sleep in tents after the earthquake - Prime Minister Li Keqiang visited the area Step 2: Formulate question and answer choices based on extracted information - The question should focus on an important aspect of the event, such as the earthquake's magnitude, government response, or people's reactions. - The correct answer should be a statement that accurately reflects information in the article. - Incorrect answers should be plausible but clearly contradicted by the article. Step 3: Finalize the question - The question focuses on various aspects of the event and takes multiple statements from the article. - The correct answer is B, as 7,000 soldiers and People's Armed Police officers were sent to the affected area according to the article. - The other answer choices are either false or not mentioned in the article."},{"instruction":"Write an article with the title: \\"House Votes Against Bringing Guantanamo Detainees to U.S. Soil\\"","output":"Step 1: Research the topic To write an article on this subject, I will need to research the latest news, relevant facts, and arguments related to the House's vote against bringing Guantanamo detainees to U.S. soil. This information will be essential to provide an accurate and comprehensive account of the situation. Step 2: Create an outline Before writing the article, I will create an outline to organize the different sections and cover all the necessary points. This outline will serve as a guide and help me ensure the article is structured logically. Outline: I. Introduction - An overview of the House's vote and the key outcome II. Background on Guantanamo Bay Detention Center - A brief history of the detention center and its purpose - Controversies surrounding the facility III. Arguments for Closing Guantanamo - Human rights concerns - Financial costs - Impact on U.S. international standing IV. Arguments Against Bringing Detainees to U.S. Soil - Concerns about national security - Legal and logistical challenges - Public and political opposition V. Conclusion - A summary of the key points made in the article Step 3: Write the article Title: House Votes Against Bringing Guantanamo Detainees to U.S. Soil I. Introduction In a recent decision, the House of Representatives voted against a proposal to bring detainees from the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center to be tried and potentially imprisoned within the United States. This vote has highlighted the ongoing debate surrounding the future of the infamous detention facility and the fate of its remaining detainees. II. Background on Guantanamo Bay Detention Center Established in 2002, the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center was initially used to house suspected terrorists and enemy combatants captured during the War on Terror. The facility has seen its population dwindling since its peak and is now home to just 40 prisoners. Throughout its existence, Guantanamo has been the subject of controversy and criticism due to allegations of torture, inhumane treatment, and indefinite detention without trial. III. Arguments for Closing Guantanamo Proponents of closing the detention center argue that its existence is a stain on the United States' reputation and commitment to human rights. They also emphasize the high financial cost of maintaining Guantanamo, with estimates suggesting it costs over 13 million per prisoner per year. Additionally, they argue that the continued operation of the facility undermines the U.S.'s ability to advocate for human rights around the world. IV. Arguments Against Bringing Detainees to U.S. Soil Opponents of relocating Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. often emphasize national security concerns, fearing that the detainees may pose a threat to American citizens. They also cite the legal and logistical challenges that would arise from transferring detainees, as well as the fact that many of them have not been convicted of any crimes. Public opinion and political opposition also play a role in the reluctance to bring detainees to U.S. soil, with many Americans feeling uncomfortable with the notion of housing accused terrorists within the country. V. Conclusion The House's recent vote against relocating Guantanamo detainees reflects the ongoing debate surrounding the future of the detention center. While the arguments for closure focus on human rights, financial concerns, and restoring America's international reputation, the arguments against bringing detainees to U.S. soil emphasize national security, legal challenges, and public discomfort. Ultimately, the question of how best to address the issue of the remaining detainees in Guantanamo remains an unresolved and contentious topic."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who is hastily knighted? Movie plot title: The Court Jester Movie plot: During the main titles, Danny Kaye, dressed as a jester, sings the clever song, Life Could Not Better Be, with lyrics that are apropos to the actors or technicians who are being introduced. A narrator introduces the film while the audience sees a cadre of horsemen riding along the English coastline: \\"This is the story of how the destiny of a nation was changed by a birthmark, a royal birthmark, on the royal posterior of a royal infant child.\\" Roderick the Tyrant had killed all of the royal family except for a baby boy who survived and has been cared for by a group in the forest. This band of loyalists to the throne is lead by a Robin Hood-type outlaw, the Black Fox (Edward Ashley). The scene changes to the castle where King Roderick (Cecil Parker) is considering an alliance with Griswold of McElwaine in which the King would offer his daughter, Gwendolyn (Angela Lansbury), as Griswold's bride. Gwendolyn is completely opposed to this arrangement. Back in the forest, the audience is led to believe the Black Fox is singing \\"(You'll Never) Outfox the Fox.\\" He is assisted by a band of midgets, all in Black Fox outfits. However, soon the real Black Fox arrives and we learn that the person who was impersonating the Black Fox is Hubert Hawkins (Danny Kaye), a former carnival entertainer, and the midgets are his pals from the carnival. When the Black Fox reprimands Hawkins for wearing his clothes, he responds that he is only trying to improve the morale of the troops. Maid Jean (Glynis Johns), who is a Captain in the Black Fox's band of outlaws, enters to announce that a group of recruits is arriving. The Black Fox orders Hawkins to get the child - the royal child. Hawkins retrieves the infant and holds the baby on his shoulder to reveal the royal birthmark - the purple pimpernel - for the recruits to see so they will know the Black Fox and his gang are fighting to restore the rightful heir to the throne. The Black Fox orders Hawkins and the Captain to transport the baby to the Abbey in Dover for safekeeping. Hawkins...

Given the question \\"How would Austin feel afterwards?\\", is \\"prepared afterwards\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that Austin likely created a list of items needed from the store in order to be organized and to ensure that they didn't forget anything important during their shopping trip. With this in mind, it's reasonable to assume that Austin might feel prepared afterwards. However, understanding the full extent of Austin's feelings requires a more in-depth analysis of their emotional state and the factors contributing to it. Firstly, let's explore the possibility of Austin feeling prepared. Preparing a shopping list is a practical action that aids in streamlining the shopping process, saving time and reducing stress caused by forgetting necessary items. It's possible that Austin could feel empowered, knowing that they have a plan in place to make their shopping trip more efficient. Furthermore, feelings of preparedness often come from a sense of control over a situation. By creating a list, Austin is taking control of their shopping experience and making proactive choices to ensure that they won't be caught off guard or find themselves in a difficult situation. This agency can lead to increased confidence and an overall sense of preparedness. Additionally, it's worth considering other emotions that Austin may experience as a result of listing every item needed from the store. For example, they could feel a sense of accomplishment after completing the list, particularly if they're someone who struggles with organization or finds creating lists challenging. This accomplishment could boost their self-esteem and contribute to an overall feeling of well-being. On the other hand, there could be emotions unrelated to the list itself that factor into Austin's overall feelings. For example, if they are under financial strain, they might feel anxiety associated with spending money on the items listed. Alternatively, they could feel overwhelmed if there are many items on the list or frustrated if they're unable to find certain items in the store. In conclusion, while it is reasonable to assume that Austin might feel prepared after listing every item needed from the store, this alone does not provide a complete picture of their emotional state. It's important to consider the context in which the shopping list was created, as well as other factors such as Austin's personality and external stressors that could influence their feelings. In general, \\"prepared\\" could be a valid answer, but a more nuanced understanding of the situation could reveal additional emotions that Austin may be experiencing."},{"instruction":"Very tasty vegan patty! Chocolate Oreo shake was delish! Service was a little slow, other than that a really great experience. Choose: was this review given positively or negatively? pick from the following. (1). negative; (2). positive;","output":"Based on the information provided in the review, it would be correct to categorize this review as 'positive.' Let's dissect this review in detail to understand why it has been marked as positive. 1. \\"Very tasty vegan patty\\": The review mentions the expression 'very tasty' denoting a positive sentiment about the vegan patty. The choice of words such as 'very' amplifies the positive experience they experienced. 2. \\"Chocolate Oreo shake was delish\\": Again, the review uses the word 'delish', which is a positive expression indicating that the reviewer enjoyed the Chocolate Oreo shake. 3. \\"Service was a little slow\\": Although this is a point of criticism and indicates a less than perfect experience with the service, the language is fairly mild. The use of 'a little slow' instead of stronger, more negative terms keeps this as a relatively minor point of criticism, rather than a strongly negative aspect of their experience. 4. \\"other than that a really great experience\\": Lastly, the reviewer in general expressed that, apart from the slightly slow service, they had a great experience. The use of the word 'great' denotes a high level of satisfaction and conclusively indicates a positive sentiment about the visit. With three out of four comments in this review reflecting a positive sentiment, it would be fair to categorize this review as positive despite one minor point of criticism. This kind of review is not uncommon, as customers may experience minor points of dissatisfaction while overall enjoying their experience. So, even though the service was a little slow, the quality of the food and the overall experience seems to have left a positive impression on the reviewer, making the review a positive one (option 2)."},{"instruction":"Where would you carry a small folding knife? Options: - kitchen drawer - fishing boat - pocket - garbage bag - table Let's give stream of consciousness first:","output":"To determine the most appropriate place to carry a small folding knife, let's consider the practicality and usefulness of each option: 1. Kitchen drawer: A kitchen drawer would be a reasonable place to store a small folding knife, as this is typically where other kitchen utensils and tools are stored. However, this location might not be the most practical for carrying a folding knife with you in other situations and environments. 2. Fishing boat: A fishing boat may be a suitable location for a small folding knife, especially if you plan to use it for cutting fishing line or other tasks related to fishing. However, this location is specific to those who own or have access to a fishing boat, and it doesn't allow for easy transportation of the knife in other situations. 3. Pocket: A pocket is likely the best option for carrying a small folding knife, as it allows for easy access and portability. You can take the knife with you wherever you go, ensuring that it's readily available whenever you need it. Make sure to follow any local laws or regulations that pertain to carrying folding knives. 4. Garbage bag: This is not an appropriate place to carry a small folding knife, as it might get lost or damaged among the trash. 5. Table: While a table could be a temporary place to set the folding knife, it is not a practical place for carrying it over time or to different locations. Given the considerations for each option, carrying a small folding knife in your pocket would be the most practical choice, as it allows for easy access, portability, and use in various situations."},{"instruction":"Hong Kong Harbor Night Cruise Enjoy the delicious dinner on the ferry and watch the beautiful city lights Time : 6:30 p.m.- 9:30 p.m. Price : Adults : HK 180 Children under 12 : HK 100 Start / Finish : Kowloon Public Pier Tel : (852) 2853 3888 E - mail:enquiry@chinatravel1.co You are 8 years old, how much will you pay?

First, I will focus on understanding the context provided in the review: The reviewer mentions that they initially did not enjoy the movie after watching it once in the theater. However, after purchasing the DVD and watching it two more times, they found the movie to be impressive and emotional. The reviewer recommends others to watch the movie at least twice to appreciate its greatness and experience the wonders of Japanese cinema. They also suggest watching with subtitles due to the low volume of the actors' voices. 2. Next, I will assess the overall tone and sentiment: Although the reviewer mentions initially not understanding the movie and not finding it enjoyable, their sentiment changes after watching the movie multiple times. They eventually describe it as powerful and moving, and encourage others to watch it. This change in opinion suggests a positive sentiment towards the movie. 3. Finally, I will consider the weight of both positive and negative aspects mentioned in the review: The negative aspect (not initially enjoying the movie) is outweighed by the positive recommendations and praise for the movie after multiple viewings. Based on this analysis, I can classify the review as \\"POS\\" since the overall sentiment of the review is positive."},{"instruction":"Elwood (2005 – November 28, 2013) was the 2007 winner of the World's Ugliest Dog Contest, and had come in second in the contest the year before.

We have this equation: -30*c - 5005 + 4765 = 0 First, let's combine the numbers: -5005 + 4765, which is equal to -240. So now we have: -30*c - 240 = 0 Now, we need to get rid of that -240. We'll do this by adding 240 to both sides of the equation. This will give us: -30*c = 240 We're almost there! Now we need to solve for \\"c.\\" Since -30 is multiplied by \\"c,\\" we'll do the opposite and divide both sides by -30. This will look like: c = 240 / -30 Now, simply divide 240 by -30.

Perhaps you specialize in a specific chicken breed and feel you can market it to high end restaurants in your area. Or, you may be able to sell eggs at a lower price than your competitor. Do some research and visit your local farmer’s markets to see what types of eggs and meats are selling. You should also look at the menus of local restaurants and see if you can fill a gap in their supplies. You should also think about how you are going to get your products to your target audience. If your target audience seems to be more at local farmer’s markets, you should have all the supplies necessary to package and sell your products. If your target audience seems to be more in restaurants or the dining industry, you may need to consider using a nearby processing plant that is USDA-approved to ensure you can fulfill large orders for these clients. To turn a profit with your farm, you will need to focus on marketing your products to local food vendors and suppliers in your area. This will allow you to turn a bigger profit, selling larger units of your products, and to build working relationships with your buyers. Get the word out by advertising your products online and using local online databases that are setup to connect buyers with local farms. You can also create a Facebook page for your farm and update it regularly with announcements and photographs of the farm. This can act as free marketing for you and allow you to connect to buyers outside of your local area. You may want to consider creating business cards and a business website for your farm. This will allow you to advertise your farm and keep your customers informed on changes or updates in your products. Many chicken farmers will focus on local customers and sell their products at farmer’s markets in their area. This is a good option for beginning farms as it usually requires a very short travel time and you can build a customer base every week at the same markets. Your products should be properly labeled, with your farm logo or name, and notes on being locally farmed and preservative free. If you use organic feed for your chickens or if you pasture your chickens, you should also note this on the packaging. This will entice customers who are health conscious and environmentally conscious to buy your products. After several weeks to months of selling your products to your target audience, you should re evaluate your chickens. Note if one product from one chicken breed is selling more than the same product from a different chicken breed. Consider adjusting your chicken selection so you have more chickens who produce eggs and meat that sell well. This will ensure your farm is sustainable and responding to the needs of your customers.","output":"This article talks about how to sell chicken and eggs from your farm. First, think about your customers - maybe fancy restaurants or people at farmer's markets. Look around and see what people like to buy, and find a way to offer something different or better.

Make your farm popular by telling people about it online, like on Facebook, and making a website or business cards. Selling your stuff at local farmer's markets is a great start because it's close to home and you can see the same people every week. Make sure your packages look good and have important information like your farm's name and if the chickens are raised in a healthy, natural way. After selling for a while, see which chickens are the most popular and adjust your farm to make everyone happy.

Isn't on anyone's list of 2016 presidential candidates. And the local press thinks he's so bland they call him the \\"Oatmeal Governor.\\" But Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell deserves national name-recognition for one reason: He's taking on one of the most important issues of our time. He's trying to get Alaska to talk about the \\"resident evil\\" of rape. \\"It's culturally permissible to be silent about it,\\" and that must change, Parnell told me in a recent interview at the governor's office in Juneau. (You commissioned that trip, by the way, as part of CNN's Change the List project. More on that here.) For years, this state -- which has the highest reported rate of rape in the country, according to 2012 FBI crime estimates -- denied it had a problem. Politicos and advocates said maybe Alaskans reported rape more often than people in other states -- but, gosh, it couldn't be a bigger problem here than elsewhere, could it? Related: The rapist next door. Parnell has helped end that era of senseless denial. In our interview, he called violence against women an \\"epidemic.\\" Like an alcoholic must admit he has a problem in order to face it, he told me, the governor of the state with the highest rape rate must, too, fess up to the problem in order to solve it. \\"I can't wave a wand and solve alcoholism, I can't wave a wand and solve domestic violence, but I can work to create a climate where it's culturally permissible to speak about these things with our family and friends, get people to help who cross our paths, to stand up for those who are being abused and hurt,\\" he said. \\"To me that's a win in the end.\\" True enough. The cornerstone of Parnell's campaign is his \\"Choose Respect\\" initiative, which he announced in late 2009 after assuming the office from Palin. Now nearing the end of his first full term and seeking re-election in 2014, Parnell, a Republican, oversees a state that has increased spending on sexual violence treatment and prevention at a time when the overall state budget is shrinking. The \\"Choose Respect\\" program would receive 12.4 million in fiscal year 2015 if the governor's proposed budget were approved. That's only 0.1% of the total proposed budget, but it's still considerable. The laid-back 51-year-old governor, who looks like a kinder version of Sean Hannity plus Vladimir Putin, was born in California but moved to Anchorage at age 10, according to a biography on the Republican Governors Association website. His dad was in the Army and later served in the state legislature. Parnell, an attorney, once worked as a lobbyist for ConocoPhillips and other oil and gas interests. He served in the state legislature and then as lieutenant governor to Palin. Even liberals in the state, like Caren Robinson, who started the first women's shelter in Juneau, praise the fact that he has supported addressing domestic violence and rape since the 1990s as a member of the legislature. Parnell was elected to the Alaska House at age 29. I disagree with some of Parnell's policies -- he's not giving enough autonomy to Native Alaskan communities and courts, for instance, which may be well poised in some cases to handle cases of sexual and gender-based violence; his decision to block part of Obamacare is unwise; and, despite substantial efforts to change things, parts of the state is so remote they're almost totally lawless, which leads people to rape and abuse with a sense of near-impunity. The lawless 'end of the land' But the governor's efforts to get Alaska to talk about rape and violence against women are laudable in and of themselves. No policy will be able to fix this problem as long as silence and shame surround rape and abuse. Someone's got to speak up. I saw some results of the \\"Choose Respect\\" program firsthand:. â€¢ In Juneau, I met members of the Thunder Mountain High School basketball team, which participates in a program called Coaching Boys into Men. The team's coach, John Blasco, talks with his players regularly about healthy dating relationships and respect for women. A star shooting guard, Matt Seymour, 18, told me there have been instances when he's told teammates not to use demeaning language about women because of what he learned as part of the program. â€¢ In one small town in southwest Alaska, I met young people who are learning about the Yupik Eskimo culture in after-school programs at the Tundra Women's Coalition, which receives funding from the state. The idea is that traditional culture can strengthen society and, ultimately, reduce rates of sexual assault. I also met women who were flown into a shelter run by the coalition from outlying villages that are not connected to road systems. â€¢ Across Alaska, I saw the power of a statewide survey analyzed by the University of Alaska Anchorage Justice Center, and funded by the state. The survey effectively ended debate about whether Alaska has a problem with domestic violence and sexual assault, said Andre Rosay, director of the center. The 2010 survey of 871 adult women found 37% had suffered sexual violence and 59% had been the victim of sexual violence and/or intimate partner violence in their lifetimes. \\"It was shocking and distressing for many people\\" to see how common violence against women really was in Alaska, said Lauree Morton, executive director of the Alaska Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, a state-funded agency. That survey also has spurred change. 5 ways to help end rape in Alaska. Alaska shouldn't have needed those shocking numbers in order to act, but they do underscore the need for urgent action, and that information has won converts. Parnell told me he is convinced Alaska can change in part because his own grandfather was verbally and physically abusive to his family. But violence stopped with Parnell's father, who was never violent, he said. \\"That gives me hope for the future of our country, when I see people taking that responsibility to live larger than what they've been taught,\\" the governor said. Parnell is leaning on his people to spread the message that violence against women haunts Alaska and should not be tolerated. The state promotes a series of \\"Choose Respect\\" marches, which were organized in more than 140 communities across the state last year and will be held again in the spring. Those rallies help create a climate where \\"more people come to safety and more people are willing to speak about the unspeakable,\\" Parnell said. \\"That's been the hardest part about the evil among us: We haven't been willing to talk about it,\\" the governor added. \\"The 'Choose Respect' initiative has given Alaskans permission to speak about these things.\\" Meet Alaska's pioneer woman. He added: \\"I'm also sending a message as a man to women who have endured this shame that they are not to blame. They do not need to carry the guilt and shame -- and we are willing to embrace and love them unconditionally.\\" Parnell would like the \\"Choose Respect\\" campaign to spread across the country. He told me sports figures, in particular, have the power to raise awareness about ending sexual violence. \\"This is going to be won in the hearts and minds of our young people,\\" he said. \\"To have a nation where every person lives free of fear ... and every person has that hope and opportunity for the future, that's my dream. But it's going to take everybody -- it's going to take 'real-deal' heroes standing up and speaking out and giving people permission to speak about this.\\" Those \\"real-deal heroes\\" should include people like Sarah Palin, the woman still more associated with the governorship in the American public's mind than Parnell. And -- forget celebrity -- they should include you, too. Hold a \\"Choose Respect\\" march in your community and let me know about it by tagging your photos #chooserespect on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.

The article discusses the efforts of Alaska's Governor, Sean Parnell, in battling the state's high rape rates, which, according to 2012 FBI crime estimates, were the highest in the country. 2. His campaign centerpiece is the \\"Choose Respect\\" initiative, launched in 2009, which aimed at increasing discussions about rape and violence against women. 3. Parnell's administration has increased spending on sexual violence treatment and prevention, proposing a budget of 12.4 million for the \\"Choose Respect\\" program in fiscal year 2015. 4. Despite facing criticism for other policies, Parnell's efforts against domestic violence and rape have been commended by many, including liberals in the state. 5. Some successes of the \\"Choose Respect\\" program are illustrated through instances of awareness programs in schools, cultural strengthening initiatives, and a statewide survey that highlighted the gravity of the problem. 6. Parnell is campaigning for the \\"Choose Respect\\" initiative to spread nationwide and sees the role of sports figures as critical in spreading awareness about ending sexual violence. 7.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"In order to determine if you can see Stonehenge from a window in Dusseldorf, let's consider the following factors: 1. Distance: Stonehenge is located near Salisbury in England, whereas Dusseldorf is a city in Germany. The distance between the two places is approximately 750 kilometers (466 miles) as the crow flies. 2. Line of Sight: The Earth is not flat, meaning the curve of the Earth would obstruct the line of sight between Dusseldorf and Stonehenge. 3. Altitude and Obstructions: Dusseldorf lies at an elevation of about 45 meters (148 feet), and Stonehenge is at an elevation of around 100 meters (328 feet). This difference in altitude is not significant enough to provide a direct line of sight. Additionally, there are buildings, hills, and other obstacles that would obstruct the view. Considering these factors, it's not possible to see Stonehenge from a window in Dusseldorf due to the distance and the Earth's curvature, as well as any potential obstructions in between the two locations."},{"instruction":"In Senate Hearing, Goss Pledges Nonpartisanship Porter J.

However, he is spotted and held for the authorities.

I just didn't have the same experience that other people did. I ordered the link, the brisket, and the ribs. All three were dry. I'm enclosing a picture. I saw DDD and Guy holds up one of the links to the camera to show the juices coming out but mine was nothing like that. Most reviews say the food is moist so I'm guessing that I got a bad batch. A couple of less than average reviews say the meat was dry so maybe I was one of the unlucky ones. One thing I noticed right off the bat was that the food is kept in warming bins, which was surprising. When the server took off the lid to the links they just didn't look very appetizing. I noticed from other reviews is that a lot of other people ordered items that had sauce in it, like the pulled pork or the cut links. Maybe if you get 3 items that have no sauce there's nothing there to give it moisture.

Article: A new United Nations report shows that fish farming may soon be the world's most important provider of fish. The Food and Agriculture Organization says fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year. Fish farming now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish. That represents a forty-three percent increase from 2006. The report also said fish farming earned more money in 2008 than traditional fisheries. In fish farming, fish are raised in tanks or small bodies of water called ponds. They are also raised in cages or nets in oceans, lakes and rivers. The report says increased fish farming has helped people around the world eat record amounts of fish. The FAO says each person ate an average of almost seventeen kilograms of fish last year. However, the FAO says the current yearly wild-fish harvest of ninety million tons shows no improvement. Decreasing numbers of fish and stronger catch limits have reduced the possibilities for catching wild fish. The FAO report says about thirty-two percent of world supplies are overfished. It says these supplies of fish need to be rebuilt at once. Some scientists have criticized fish farming. They say the nets and cages permit fish diseases and pests to spread. Some fish farming critics doubt whether fish farming can keep growing at the current rate. But Wally Stevens of the trade group Global Aquaculture Alliance says the industry must continue developing to feed growing populations. Mr. Stevens says a one hundred percent increase in fish farming over ten years is necessary to keep providing for people at the current level. He notes that fish farming creates jobs and wealth, especially for people in coastal areas of China. Question: We learn that since the year 2006, fish farming has been _ . Options: A: earning more money than traditional fisheries B: developing rapidly around the world C: growing at a rate of 6.6 percent each day D: producing 46% of the world's supply of fish The answer is:","output":"B: developing rapidly around the world Justification: The article states that fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year, and it now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish, which represents a forty-three percent increase from 2006.

Given that economists were expecting a mark closer to 200,000, the figure represents a \\"huge round of job creation\\" to end the year, reports CNBC. The department also raised the number of jobs added in October and November, bringing the average monthly jobs gain for the year to 221,000, reports the Wall Street Journal. \\"That’s below 2014’s monthly average of around 260,000,\\" writes Kristen Scholer. \\"But it’s still above what’s been the psychologically-important 200,000 level.\\" The take from AP writer Christopher Rugaber: \\"The strong figures underscore the resilience of the US economy at a time of global turmoil stemming from China's slowing economy and plummeting stock market.\\" China's markets were much calmer Friday morning, notes MarketWatch, boding well for US exchanges. Expand this summary.","output":"The latest jobs report from the US Labor Department indicates that US employers added 292,000 jobs in December 2015, surpassing expectations and maintaining the unemployment rate at 5%. Economists had predicted an increase of around 200,000 jobs, so this report represents a significant boost in job creation at the end of the year. In addition to the December report, the Labor Department also revised its previous numbers for October and November upward, resulting in a 2015 average of 221,000 new jobs per month. While the 2015 average is below the previous year’s monthly average of approximately 260,000 jobs, it remains a crucial milestone, as it is above the psychologically significant 200,000 level, reflecting a consistent and sustained upward trend in the US job market. Several industries experienced notable job growth in December, with the construction industry adding 45,000 jobs, health care adding 39,000 jobs, and business services contributing 73,000 positions. The manufacturing and mining sectors, which struggled in 2015, showed modest growth in December. Average hourly earnings, however, remained unchanged, highlighting the continuing issue of wage stagnation in the United States. Despite the relatively positive outlook for the US labor market, global concerns, especially the economic slowdown in China, have raised concerns that the country’s troubles may eventually spill over to the US economy. The Federal Reserve will no doubt be keeping a close eye on these developments, as it may affect their plans for further interest rate hikes in 2016. This stronger-than-expected jobs report provides evidence that the US economy remains resilient amidst the turmoil and uncertainty in global financial markets and economies, particularly China’s slowing economy and fluctuating stock market. Although China's markets have started to stabilize, analysts are still cautious about the possibility of long-term effects on the global economy. In summary, the recent jobs report from the US Labor Department sets a positive tone for the US labor market, displaying continual growth in various sectors and signaling ongoing domestic economic recovery. The US economy has remained steady at a time when global challenges have the potential to impact other nations adversely. While the long-term effects of the global economic situation remain uncertain, this jobs report reflects a secure and strengthening US labor market for now."},{"instruction":"If \\"The woman is placing an orange rose as a boutonniere on the man's suit jacket collar.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A human in a jacket.\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"A human in a jacket\\" logically follows from the given sentence, \\"The woman is placing an orange rose as a boutonniere on the man's suit jacket collar.\\" To better understand how this follows logically, let's break down the components of the given sentence and relate them to the resulting statement. 1. \\"The woman is placing an orange rose as a boutonniere on the man's suit jacket collar.\\" This sentence contains several elements that are relevant to the statement in question: a) The woman: The presence of a woman implies the presence of a human, as a woman is a human by definition. b) The man's suit jacket collar: This part of the sentence implies not only the presence of a man (another human), but also that the man is wearing a suit jacket. The reference to the collar suggests that the jacket is being worn correctly, with the collar exposed and accessible for the boutonniere placement. c) Orange rose as a boutonniere: This detail does not directly relate to the statement \\"A human in a jacket,\\" but it does provide additional context for the action taking place in the given sentence. Now, let's consider the resulting statement: 2. \\"A human in a jacket.\\" This statement focuses on the presence of a human being, wearing a jacket. Based on the information provided in the original sentence, we know that there is indeed a human present, as there are actually two humans mentioned: the woman and the man. Furthermore, the man is specifically described as wearing a suit jacket, confirming that there is a human wearing a jacket. It is important to note that the resulting statement simplifies the action. The original sentence provides detailed context for an event wherein a woman places a boutonniere on a man's jacket, but the resulting statement does not convey this specific action. Instead, the statement \\"A human in a jacket\\" provides a simplified, overarching description of the situation. In conclusion, based on the presence of both a woman and a man in the original sentence, and the specific mention of the man's suit jacket collar, the statement \\"A human in a jacket\\" logically follows. The statement may not capture all the details and context of the given sentence, it does correctly identify the presence of a human being wearing a jacket."},{"instruction":"By. Ryan Gorman.

The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10, and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25. The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background. One of the circles was larger than the other, and these people were asked to identify the larger one. Four-year-olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time. Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time. Next, both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles, again of different sizes, were surrounded by gray circles. Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context. In other words, they will begin to process the whole picture at once: the tricky gray circles, as well as the orange circle in the middle. As a result, they're more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick. Question: According to the passage, we can know that _ .

The answer is:","output":"Title: Strawberry Shortcake: Rockin' The Sacred Genre: Music Drama/Comedy Plot: Set in the small rural town of Havenwood, the story revolves around a group of misfit musicians who inadvertently come together and form a rock band named \\"Strawberry Shortcake.\\" The five members - lead singer Daisy, guitarist Mike, drummer Olivia, bassist Ethan, and pianist Chris - each struggle with their mundane lives in the community and are yearning for something more than just their everyday routines. At one point, Daisy (a free-spirited and passionate singer) discovers her passion for singing while attending a local church's choir performance. She proposes the idea of \\"jazzing up\\" the church's music scene to her newfound bandmates. At first, the others are skeptical, feeling the conservative nature of the Havenwood community would not take kindly to such a drastic change. However, after a series of coincidences, they find themselves collaborating with the church's pastor (Pastor Thomas) and the aging choir director (Mrs. Whitaker). Together, the two groups work through their differences and experiment with combining traditional hymns with Strawberry Shortcake's more contemporary rock sound. Their collaboration starts turning heads and leads to a reinvigoration of the church's congregation size and excitement about attending Sunday services. As word of their unique sound spreads through the town, Strawberry Shortcake finds a renewed sense of purpose, while also helping to bridge the divide in the community and bring people closer together. However, not everyone in Havenwood is thrilled with the changes happening at the church. A group of conservative parishioners, led by the stubborn Eunice, feel the church is straying too far from its traditional roots and start a campaign to return things to the way they were, before Strawberry Shortcake's influence. Strawberry Shortcake and their supporters in the church band together to fight for their vision of a more inclusive, vibrant, and forward-looking community. A heated showdown between both factions unfolds – culminating in a high-stakes \\"Battle of the Bands\\" style competition where Strawberry Shortcake is challenged to prove they can bring church music into a modern era without losing its essence. The climax sees Strawberry Shortcake pouring their hearts out in an emotional performance, blending gospel, rock, and jazz into agenre-defying blend. Their music captures both the passion and the grace needed to win over the hearts of even the most hardened skeptics. In the end, the band excels, and the conservative faction pledges to give the new sound a chance, leading to a more united and harmonious Havenwood. In the end, Strawberry Shortcake not only rejuvenated the church's music scene, but also inspired the people of Havenwood to open their minds and hearts to embracing the beauty in change and diversity, showing the power of music to heal divisions, foster unity, and move everyone forward into a brighter future."},{"instruction":"Question: In addition to the final, signed treaty what else might arbiters review to establish the meaning of a treaty in context?

Redlich family.","output":"Title: \\"From Silesia to Savannah: The Redlich Odyssey\\" Step 1: Establish the setting and characters The movie is set in the 1940s, during World War II. Our focus is the Redlich family, consisting of the father, Walter; the mother, Maria; their two children, Karl and Hanna; and Walter's elderly father, Johann. The Redlichs were once respected in their town Leobschütz in Silesia (located in present day Poland), but as Jewish tensions rise, they are forced to flee. Step 2: Introduce the conflict Due to the increasing threat to the Jewish community in Silesia, Walter is compelled to protect his family. With great difficulty and using his connections, he secures documents that will allow them to flee to the British colony of Kenya. Step 3: Initiating the journey The family embarks on a difficult and dangerous journey across Europe, with the help of the network of people aiding in the escape of Jewish families. They attempt to keep their true identity hidden, facing close calls with authorities, creating tension and suspense for the viewers. Step 4: Acclimatizing to the new environment Upon arriving in Kenya, the Redlich family is faced with the challenges of adapting to an unfamiliar culture and climate. They struggle with adjusting to their new lives and forming relationships with the local population, while feeling the longing for their homeland in Silesia. Step 5: Introduce subplots During their time in Kenya, - Karl becomes interested in wildlife conservation and starts working with local groups to protect endangered species. This subplot will allow for breathtaking cinematography of Kenya's landscapes and wildlife while demonstrating Karl's growing commitment to his new home. - Hanna, facing her own coming-of-age battles, befriends an African girl of her age, leading to a storyline that deals with cultural differences and eventually understanding. - Walter and Maria cope with the consequences of leaving their home and their families behind, including news of the atrocities in Europe reaching them. Step 6: Introduce a challenge or climax News arrives that Johann, who at first was adapting well to the new environment, has fallen severely sick due to his age and new environmental conditions. The family must come together and search for a way to save him, which may involve seeking help from the local communities and understanding their traditional healing methods. The uncertainty of Johann's fate brings on feelings of vulnerability and guilt for leaving Silesia. Step 7: Resolution Johann makes a slow recovery.

It was discovered in September 1998 by the California and Carnegie Planet Search team using the highly successful radial velocity method . The planet is at least 24 % more massive than Jupiter . The mean distance of the planet from the star is slightly more than Earth 's distance from the Sun. However , the orbit is very eccentric , so at periastron this distance is almost halved , and at apastron it is as distant as Mars is from the Sun. In 2000 , a group of scientists proposed , based on preliminary data from the Hipparcos astrometrical satellite , that the planet would have an inclination of 175.8 ° and a true mass of 18 times Jupiter making it a brown dwarf instead of a planet . However these measurements were later proved useful only for upper limits of inclination . If the planet orbits in the same plane as the claimed circumstellar disk , which seems a plausible assumption , it would have an inclination of 40 ° and an absolute mass of 2.2 times Jupiter , however later observations failed to confirm the disk 's existence . - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. - HD 210277 is a 7th magnitude star in the constellation of Aquarius. It is a yellow dwarf star (spectral type G0V) with a mass around 0.92 times that of our Sun. Since its distance is about 70 light years, it is not visible to the unaided eye.

Translate to English","output":"These gigantic stars live fast and die young, burning hydrogen rapidly and eventually ending their lives in supernova explosions. Star clusters, such as NGC 3603, provide crucial information for understanding the distant universe, shedding light on the origins of the formation of massive stars in the early stages of development. These enormous stars have significantly shorter life spans than their smaller counterparts, as they consume their fuel – primarily hydrogen – at a much faster rate. Over their lifetimes, these stars undergo nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium and subsequently into heavier elements. This fusion process releases immense amounts of energy in the form of heat and light, far more than that of smaller stars such as our Sun. Due to the high mass and rapid rate of fusion, these massive stars develop highly unstable cores, leading to powerful outbursts of energy, such as supernova explosions, as they approach the end of their lives. These violent explosions not only mark the end of a massive star's life but also release a vast amount of energy and cosmic material into surrounding space, potentially serving as the catalyst for the formation of new stars and other celestial bodies. Star clusters, like NGC 3603, are essential for understanding the universe’s early development and the creation of these colossal stars. Located approximately 20,000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Carina, NGC 3603 is a highly active star-forming region containing myriad young, massive stars, as well as numerous smaller, cooler stars. Due to its diverse stellar population and intense star formation activity, NGC 3603 is an ideal laboratory for astronomers to study the processes governing the formation and evolution of massive stars. Observing and analyzing star clusters like NGC 3603 not only offers valuable insights into the early universe but also helps scientists refine and develop models of stellar formation and evolution. With improved knowledge and understanding of these processes, astronomers can make more accurate predictions about the lifecycles and eventual fates of various stars, as well as their influence on the cosmic environment. In conclusion, the study of massive stars and star clusters like NGC 3603 is paramount for increasing our comprehension of the universe's development and the processes behind the formation of these colossal celestial bodies. As we continue to refine our understanding of these enigmatic objects, we advance our ability to unravel the mysteries of the universe and its origins."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Cleaner for the following movie plot: In the fictional country of Lugash, a mysterious thief seizes the Pink Panther diamond and leaves a white glove marked with a gold-tinted \\"P\\".

The decision also provoked a storm of criticism, with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon calling the club's stance \\"simply indefensible\\". Muirfield hopes the new vote will take place by the end of the year. The club needed a two thirds majority to amend its rules on admission when it held its initial ballot on 19 May. However, only 64% voted in favour of allowing women members, which meant that no changes could be implemented. Club captain Henry Fairweather said the outcome had \\"damaged\\" the reputation of Muirfield and needed to be overturned. He said \\"a clear and decisive vote in favour of admitting women as members is required to enable us to begin the task of restoring the reputation of the club\\". Muirfield last hosted the Open in 2013 but was told it would never stage the competition again by the R&A, which jointly governs world golf with the United States Golf Association, unless it altered its stance.

The first quarter was all Steelers as they scored touchdowns in 3 different ways: Le'Veon Bell ran for a 1-yard, Antonio Brown caught a 12-yard pass, and then returned a punt 67 yards putting up scores of 7-0, 14-0, and 21-0.

He was included in the Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century where he was called \\"master poet, caustic social critic and intrepid, guiding spirit of the counterculture generation\\". In 2008, the Pulitzer Prize jury awarded him a special citation for \\"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\\" President Barack Obama said of Dylan in 2012, \\"There is not a bigger giant in the history of American music.\\" For 20 years, academics lobbied the Swedish Academy to give Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature. He received the award in 2016, making Dylan the first musician to be awarded the Literature Prize. Horace Engdahl, a member of the Nobel Committee, described Dylan's place in literary history: ...a singer worthy of a place beside the Greek bards, beside Ovid, beside the Romantic visionaries, beside the kings and queens of the blues, beside the forgotten masters of brilliant standards. Rolling Stone has ranked Dylan at number one in its 2015 list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, and listed \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" as the \\"Greatest Song of all Time\\" in their 2011 list. In 2008, it was estimated that Dylan had sold about 120 million albums worldwide. Initially modeling his writing style on the songs of Woody Guthrie, the blues of Robert Johnson, and what he termed the \\"architectural forms\\" of Hank Williams songs, Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it \\"with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry\\". Paul Simon suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: \\"[Dylan's] early songs were very rich ... with strong melodies.

Researchers at the University of Chicago who studied mother-child interactions found that the type of praise children receive affects their attitudes towards challenges later in life. Specifically, praise that focused on their behavior and the choices that kids made helped them deal with difficult experiences better five years later, compared with praise that focused more on the child himself, like \\"You're a good boy.\\" The study, which appears in the journal Child Development, is the first major study of praise and child development done outside of a lab setting. \\"It's exciting to see _ play out in the real world,\\" said Elizabeth Gunderson who led the study. \\"Praising the efforts, actions and work of kids is going to be more beneficial in their long-term persistence and desire to be challenged and work hard in the future.\\" Such \\"process praise\\" includes comments such as \\"You worked really hard\\", which emphasize a child's actions. \\"Person praise\\" includes comments like \\"You're so smart\\", which focus on a child's personal qualities. These distinctions aren't new in the field of psychology, but exactly how they affect children's development over the years hasn't always been clear. As part of the study, the researchers visited the homes of more than 50 kids between the ages of 1 and 3, and filmed their daily interactions with their parents during 90-minute sessions. Five years later, the researchers followed up with the families, measuring the children's attitudes towards challenges and problem solving. The children who grew up with more process praise were more open to challenges. Though person praise didn't seem to have any negative effect on the children, the study suggests that process praise teaches children that their talents and abilities can be developed and improved, while person praise sends the message that their abilities are fixed and therefore not easily changed. Which of the following can be the best title for the text? A) Praise is good for children's development. B) Praise is more beneficial than punishment. C) Person praise is better than process praise. D) Process praise is more beneficial in the long run.

The strain produced by his internal struggle and his intense hatred of criminals, leads him to make serious errors of judgement and to fail to recognise the need for any code of conduct to be adhered to in his dealings with people on the wrong side of the law. He has a track record of treating suspects and known criminals with gross brutality and this has brought him into conflict with his superior officers who have censured him for the amount of violence he has regularly used. Dixon cannot reconcile these calls for restraint with his own extreme and irrational hatred of all criminals. He is tormented by the fact that his father was a criminal and has been left with a powerful need to live down his father's reputation and to avoid fulfilling the low expectations that many people have of him as a consequence. When a rich Texan is murdered following an evening's gambling run by gangster Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill), Dixon is assigned to the case. Scalise tells Dixon's superior officer Detective Lieutenant Thomas (Karl Malden) that the victim had been accompanied by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his wife Morgan (Gene Tierney) and that Paine had committed the murder. Dixon goes to Paine's apartment and questions the suspect who is both inebriated and uncooperative and when Paine punches him, Dixon retaliates and Paine collapses and dies. Dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river. Paine's wife is questioned and after describing what had happened at Scalise's place, adds that her father had gone to Paine's apartment later that night to take issue with him about the fact that she'd returned home with facial bruising. Paine had previously attacked her on a number of occasions and her father, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), had threatened that if it happened again he would beat Paine up. This information leads to Taylor being arrested and charged with murder. Nobody accepts Dixon's explanation that Scalise had killed the Texan and then had Paine killed to eliminate him as a witness. Dixon continues to make various attempts to get Scalise convicted but eventually realises that the only way to successfully achieve his goal is to write a confession about his own role in Paine's death and the cover up. He does this and also records that he is going alone to confront Scalise so that the police can arrest the gangster for Dixon's murder. The confrontation with Scalise and the eventual means by which Dixon achieves his own redemption, provide a tense and fitting conclusion to this gritty thriller. Dana Andrews' strained and preoccupied expressions convey his character's perpetually troubled nature and his anxieties as he deals with a series of misfortunes which include and follow Paine's accidental death. Dixon, however, isn't the only one to experience misfortune as Morgan, a successful model loses her job because of all the trouble surrounding her. Her father, who'd some years earlier been awarded a diploma for assisting the police, unjustly finds himself charged with a crime he did not commit. Ken Paine who'd been a war hero had experienced unemployment and a loss of self esteem which led to alcoholism and wife beating and Scalise who'd been set up in business by Dixon's father also suffers his own misfortunes. \\"Where The Sidewalk Ends\\" is a thoroughly engaging tale involving a group of interesting and diverse characters and a main protagonist who is the absolute personification of moral ambiguity.

Here's a sentence in Spanish, along with an explanation of its meaning and grammatical structure. Sentence: \\"El perro saltó sobre la cerca para perseguir al gato que se escapó.\\" Translation: \\"The dog jumped over the fence to chase the cat that got away.\\" Explanation: In this Spanish sentence, the organization of words and the grammar utilized portray a clear image of an action taking place. Let's break down the different elements at play here: 1. \\"El perro\\" (the dog) - Here, \\"el\\" serves as the definite article (like \\"the\\" in English), while \\"perro\\" is the noun for \\"dog.\\" In Spanish, nouns always have gender, and \\"perro\\" is masculine. Therefore, it's accompanied by the masculine article \\"el.\\" 2. \\"saltó\\" (jumped) - \\"Saltar\\" is the infinitive form of the verb meaning \\"to jump.\\" It is in the past tense and conjugated to agree with the subject (\\"el perro\\"). The verb conjugation rule demands that -ar verbs drop the \\"-ar\\" suffix and replace it with \\"-ó\\" when referring to the third person (he, she, it) in the past simple tense. 3. \\"sobre\\" (over) - \\"Sobre\\" is a preposition that can mean several things depending on context, such as \\"over\\" or \\"on top of.\\" In this case, it describes the dog jumping over something. 4. \\"la cerca\\" (the fence) - The noun \\"cerca\\" translates to \\"fence\\" in English. In Spanish, the noun \\"cerca\\" is feminine and accompanied by the feminine article \\"la.\\" 5. \\"para\\" (to) - This preposition signifies the purpose of the action, similar to \\"to\\" in English. 6. \\"perseguir\\" (chase) - \\"Perseguir\\" stands for \\"to chase\\" in English. It is in the infinitive form because it follows the preposition \\"para.\\" In such constructions, verbs are often left in their infinitive forms. 7. \\"al gato\\" (the cat) - \\"Al\\" is a contraction of the preposition \\"a\\" (to) and the masculine article \\"el\\" (the), used in this context to refer to a specific cat. \\"Gato\\" is the noun for \\"cat.\\" As in the case of \\"perro,\\" \\"gato\\" has a masculine gender and needs the appropriate masculine article before it. 8. \\"que\\" (that) - \\"Que\\" is a relative pronoun that introduces a subordinate clause, creating a connection between the cat and the action that follows. 9. \\"se escapó\\" (got away) - The reflexive verb \\"escaparse\\" means \\"to get away\\" or \\"to escape.\\" It is conjugated in the third person past simple tense (\\"-ó\\" ending) and accompanied by the reflexive pronoun \\"se.\\" The latter indicates that the action was performed by the subject (the cat) upon itself. Taking all these elements into account, the Spanish sentence provided is a grammatically correct and detailed description of an event involving a dog, a cat, and their actions."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: There are two kinds of memory: short-term and long-term. Information in long-term memory can be remembered at a later time when it is needed. The information may be kept for days or weeks. However, information in short-term memory is kept for only a few seconds, usually by repeating the information over and over. The following experiment shows how short-term memory has been studied. Henning studied how students who are learning English as a second language remember vocabulary. The subjects in his experiment were 75 college students. They represented all levels of ability in English: beginning, intermediate , and native speaking students. To begin, the subjects listened to a recording of a native speaker reading a paragraph in English. Following the recording, the subjects took a 15-question test to see which words they remembered. Each question had four choices. The subjects had to circle the word they had heard in the recording, Some of the questions had four choices that sound alike. For example, weather, whether, wither, and wetter are four words that sound alike. Some of the questions had four choices that have the same meaning. Method, way, manner, and system would be four words with the same meaning. Finally the subjects took a language proficiency test. Henning found that students with a lower proficiency in English made more of their mistakes on words that sound alike; students with a higher proficiency made more of their mistakes on words that have the same meaning. Henning's results suggest that beginning students hold the sound of words in their short-term memory, and advanced students hold the meaning of words in their short-term memory.

He'd have to do what soon? Possible A: report for duty, wait for orders, fight for freedom, obay, receive orders Why is \\"report for duty\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Report for duty\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. As an AI, I must analyze the given context to provide a comprehensive understanding and aid the user in discerning which answer would be the most appropriate for the given situation. 1. Contextual understanding: The question revolves around Brian, a soldier who has just been called back to active service. In the context of military life, \\"active service\\" means that a soldier is expected to perform their duties and responsibilities as part of their country's armed forces. 2. Logical sequence of events: When a soldier is called for active service, they must first report to their assigned unit or base to receive further instruction and prepare for any upcoming missions or tasks. Reporting for duty is the initial step in this process and aligns with common human sense, as it shows the individual's readiness and commitment to perform their assigned duties. 3. Understanding of military structure and discipline: In the military, a hierarchical structure of command is followed, and discipline is crucial. \\"Report for duty\\" signifies not only the soldier's physical presence, but also their commitment to following orders and maintaining proper discipline. This answer aligns with human understanding of the importance of obeying orders and carrying out responsibilities in a military context. 4. Elimination of other answers: An analysis of the other possible answers helps clarify why \\"report for duty\\" is the choice that makes the most sense in this scenario. Here is a breakdown of the other options: - \\"Wait for orders\\": While waiting for orders may occur after reporting for duty, it is not the immediate next step that is expected to be taken by Brian. Reporting for duty is the first action that needs to be done before waiting for any further orders. - \\"Fight for freedom\\": This answer could be perceived as a more abstract concept or an overall objective of a military force. While it may be one of many reasons a soldier is called back to active service, it does not specifically denote the action that Brian needs to take in response to his call. - \\"Obey\\": This option is quite broad and generic. While obeying orders is a critical aspect of military service, it fails to pinpoint the specific action that is expected from Brian upon being called back. - \\"Receive orders\\": Similar to \\"wait for orders,\\" this option describes a step that happens after Brian has reported for duty. Based on the contextual understanding, logical sequence of events, comprehension of the military's hierarchical structure, and the elimination of other options, it becomes evident that \\"report for duty\\" is the answer aligned with human common sense, as it accurately depicts the appropriate action for Brian to take upon being called back to active service."},{"instruction":"Title: A bit advanced for a 2yr old Review: My 2.5yr old son owns almost all of the Brainy Baby DVDs (he's got 10 of them) so when I saw this DVD and read the positive reviews I bought it and Brainy Baby Art.

At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties.

Question What may happen before morning comes ? Answer:","output":"Before morning comes, several events and activities may take place, both in the individual's life and the world around them. Here are some possibilities: 1. Dreaming: As the individual goes to sleep, they may experience vivid dreams that are influenced by their thoughts and emotions from the day. Dreaming is a natural part of the sleep cycle, and it's believed to help with processing memories and emotions. 2. Tossing and turning: The individual may experience some degree of restlessness during their sleep, adjusting their position several times throughout the night. This can happen due to various factors, such as stress or an uncomfortable sleeping environment. 3. Late-night thoughts: Sometimes, even when we try to sleep, our mind continues to churn with thoughts and ideas. The person might spend some time reflecting on their day and planning for tomorrow, further processing their feelings of guilt, their hair color change, and their search for the perfect strappy shoes. 4. Nighttime routines: Others in the household might be completing their bedtime routines, such as brushing their teeth, reading, or watching a movie before finally drifting off to sleep. These activities can contribute to the background noise and ambiance of the night. 5. Natural occurrences: Outside, various natural occurrences can take place, such as changes in weather, the movement of nocturnal animals, or the lunar cycle impacting the visibility of the night sky. These events may go unnoticed as the person sleeps but are essential aspects of the world transitioning from night to day. 6. Early morning activities: Some people might start their day before the sun rises, engaging in activities such as exercise, meditation, or preparing for work. The individual in question might hear some of these early risers as they go about their morning, which could affect the quality of their sleep. 7. Unexpected events: There's always the possibility of unexpected events happening during the night, such as a power outage, a loud noise, or a sudden rainstorm. These unpredictable occurrences could potentially interrupt the individual's sleep and create a sense of anticipation or anxiety about what the morning might bring. In summary, as the night progresses, many events and activities can take place both within the individual's personal life and the world around them. From natural occurrences to mental processes and household routines, the transition from night to day is filled with countless experiences that shape the person's morning and overall well-being."},{"instruction":"Solve this math problem Solve 0 = 366*n - 370*n - 12 for n.","output":"To solve the given equation 0 = 366*n - 370*n - 12 for n, we first want to combine the terms with n in them. Let's start by stating the equation: 0 = 366n - 370n - 12 Now, we combine the terms with n: 0 = (366 - 370)n - 12 Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses gives: 0 = (-4)n - 12 Our goal is to solve for n, so we need to isolate n. We can start by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. To do this, we add 12 to both sides: 0 + 12 = (-4)n - 12 + 12 Simplifying both sides gives: 12 = -4n Now, to isolate n, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -4: 12 / (-4) = (-4)n / (-4) Simplifying both sides gives: -3 = n So, the solution for n in the given equation is: n = -3"},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - Malaysia is a federal constitutional monarchy located in Southeast Asia.

This time, rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares, Lynch provides a reflective, fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both. The simple true story of an Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) who rides a lawn mower to Wisconsin to visit his estranged, stricken brother, there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes (some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland, filmed by veteran cinematographer Freddy Francis) to make it an undeniable Lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable. Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet personable way, allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life, and Sissy Spacek turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet observant daughter (whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by John Roach and Mary Sweeney) but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers indelible performances, one of the most notable being Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing of a deer is both uproarious and sad at the same time.

Since Pat doesn't exercise as much as Brenda, their body might not be as conditioned and accustomed to intense physical activity. As a result, Pat may be putting in more effort to keep up with Brenda, which could increase perspiration. On the other hand, Brenda's body may be more efficient at handling the workout due to her regular exercise routine, leading to less sweating. It is essential to note that individual sweat rates can vary based on factors such as genetics, fitness levels, hydration status, and ambient temperature. Additionally, sweating alone is not an accurate indication of an individual's physical fitness or exertion level.

Only with the success of Cowboy was Van Sant now given license to make Idaho (a film he had originally pitched but was knocked back several times as the script was deemed 'too risky' by studios). Now New Line Cinema had given Van Sant the green light, he was on a mission to get the Idaho script to his first choices for his two young leads. After months of struggle with agents and managers over the content of the script, Van Sant finally secured River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves in the roles of Mike Waters and Scott Favor. Centering around the dealings of two male hustlers (played by Phoenix and Reeves), the film was a compelling examination of unrequited love, alienation, and the concept of family (a concept Van Sant repeatedly explores in his films). The film won him an Independent Spirit Award for his screenplay (he had won the same award for his Drugstore Cowboy screenplay), as well as greater prestige. The film also gained River Phoenix best actor honors at the Venice Film Festival among others. In addition, it helped Reeves--previously best known for his work in the Bill and Ted movies--to get the critical respect that had previously eluded him. Van Sant's next film, a 1993 adaptation of Tom Robbins' Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, was an excessive flop, both commercially and critically. Featuring an unusually large budget (for Van Sant, at least) of 8.5 million and a large, eclectic cast including Uma Thurman, John Hurt, Keanu Reeves and a newcomer in the form of River Phoenix's younger sister Rain (at Phoenix's suggestion), the film was worked and then reworked, but the finished product nonetheless resulted in something approaching a significant disaster. Van Sant's 1995 film To Die For helped to restore his luster. An adaptation of Joyce Maynard's novel, the black comedy starred Nicole Kidman as a murderously ambitious weather girl; it also stars Matt Dillon as her hapless husband and, the third Phoenix sibling in as many projects, Joaquin Phoenix, as her equally hapless lover (River had died from a drug overdose a year and half earlier). It was Van Sant's first effort for a major studio (Columbia), and its success paved the way for further projects of the director's choosing. The same year, he served as executive producer for Larry Clark's Kids; it was a fitting assignment, due to both the film's subject matter and the fact that Clark's photographs of junkies had served as reference points for Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy.

The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems. - Matthew Abram \\"Matt\\" Groening (; born February 15, 1954) is an American cartoonist, writer, producer, animator, and voice actor.

The relationship between the Southern Expeditionary Army Group and the Empire of Japan can be understood in terms of their common goal, organizational structure, and the role of the Emperor in their operations. 1. Common goal: The primary objective of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group was to advance and secure the interests of the Empire of Japan in Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific. They were tasked with attacking and occupying Allied territories and colonies to expand Japan's influence and control in the region. This goal was aligned with the broader strategic aims of the Empire of Japan, which sought to establish itself as a dominant power in Asia. 2. Organizational structure: The Southern Expeditionary Army Group fell under the command and control of the Imperial Japanese Army, which was one of the two principal components of the Empire of Japan's military forces, the other being the Imperial Japanese Navy. The army's structure and hierarchy were determined by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office and the Ministry of War, and during wartime, the Imperial General Headquarters (IGHQ) would oversee and coordinate efforts between the army and the navy. 3.

The conflict has ravaged the country for more than a decade, and countless lives have been lost or disrupted due to the violence. Representatives from various nations are gathering together in hopes of reaching a consensus on how best to bring about a much-needed end to the hostilities. Step 1: Addressing the Humanitarian Crisis Before progressing with any ceasefire plans, the first priority is for world leaders to recognize and address the humanitarian crisis that has resulted from the ongoing war. Millions of Syrians have been displaced and forced to seek refuge in neighboring countries and beyond. Ensuring the safety and well-being of those affected, as well as the provision of aid and resources to alleviate their suffering, is crucial. This step also involves discussing the role of various international organizations in providing support and resources to those in need. Step 2: Ceasefire Negotiations Representatives from countries involved in or affected by the Syrian conflict will engage in negotiations to establish the terms of a potential ceasefire. These talks aim to identify viable solutions and compromises that can satisfy all parties and facilitate a lasting peace. During this phase, it is essential for all parties to maintain open communication, express their concerns, and work together to achieve a common goal. This process may include discussions on possible power-sharing arrangements, economic incentives for stability, and the involvement of international organizations in ensuring compliance with the agreed-upon terms. Step 3: Implementation and Monitoring Once a tentative ceasefire agreement is reached, the next step involves the implementation and monitoring of its provisions. This would typically include the establishment of a joint task force comprised of representatives from conflicting parties and international observers. This task force is responsible for overseeing the cessation of hostilities, ensuring complete disarmament of armed factions, and monitoring for any violations of the ceasefire terms. The efforts of this task force are crucial in fostering trust between the previously conflicting parties and preventing a resurgence of violence. Step 4: Long-term Peacebuilding Lastly, the international community must uphold a long-term commitment to peacebuilding efforts in Syria. This involves continued support for reconstruction and rehabilitation projects and the mobilization of resources to help rebuild Syria's socioeconomic infrastructure. In addition, it is important to prioritize the political process and support democratic transition, which would include ensuring fair and transparent elections and promoting an inclusive political environment. All of these efforts are crucial to avoiding a relapse into violent conflict and establishing a sustainable peace in Syria. Conclusion: The meeting of world powers in New York is a vital opportunity to make progress on a ceasefire plan in Syria, which has been embroiled in a devastating conflict for more than a decade. By addressing the humanitarian crisis, engaging in productive negotiations, implementing and monitoring the ceasefire, and committing to long-term peacebuilding efforts, the international community can work together to pave the way for lasting peace and stability in Syria.

Sentence 2: The Ayuntamiento is built i the Hapsburg style due to German influences. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence can be considered entailed by the first sentence. Let's analyze both sentences in detail to understand the connection between them. In the first sentence, it is stated that the Ayuntamiento (City Hall) building represents the Hapsburg era and is characterized by its towers and slate spires, which are common features of 17th-century official buildings in Madrid. This sentence provides us with information about the architectural style and specific features of the Ayuntamiento building, as well as its connection to the Hapsburg era. The Hapsburg era refers to the time when Madrid, part of what was then the Spanish Empire, was ruled by the Hapsburg dynasty. The Hapsburg dynasty originated in modern-day Austria, and their territories included present-day Germany, so they had significant German connections. As a result, the architecture styles associated with the Hapsburg dynasty would likely have strong German influences. The second sentence states that the Ayuntamiento is built in the Hapsburg style due to German influences. This statement takes the information from the first sentence about the Ayuntamiento's connection to the Hapsburg era and its related architectural style and links it to the German influences on the Hapsburg dynasty and their architecture and design. In conclusion, the connection between the Ayuntamiento building and its Hapsburg style, which is mentioned in the first sentence, implies the influence of German architectural elements as noted in the second sentence. Therefore, the second sentence can be understood to be entailed by the first one."},{"instruction":"What is the missing first step of the following process: - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside - The nest is done.

The story of the mouse's walk through the woods unfolds in two phases; in both, the mouse uses cunning to evade danger.The mouse goes for a walk in the forest and on his way encounters several dangerous animals (a fox, an owl, and a snake). Each of these animals, clearly intent on eating the mouse, invites him back to their home for a meal. The cunning mouse declines each offer. To dissuade further advances, he tells each animal that he is going to dine with his friend, a gruffalo, whose favourite food happens to be the relevant animal. The mouse describes the outlandish features of the gruffalo's monstrous anatomy. Frightened that the gruffalo might eat them, each animal flees. The mouse gloats to himself; he knows the gruffalo is a fictional monster:Silly old fox/owl/snake, doesn't he know? there's no such thing as a gruffalo!After he has seen off the last animal, however, the mouse is shocked to encounter a real gruffalo, bearlike and hideous and with all the frightening features the mouse thought that he was inventing. True to his reputation, the gruffalo threatens to eat the mouse, but again the mouse is cunning. He tells the gruffalo that he, the mouse, is the scariest animal in the forest. Laughing, the gruffalo agrees to follow the mouse as he demonstrates how everyone is afraid of him. The two walk through the forest, encountering in turn the animals that had earlier menaced the mouse. Each is terrified by the sight of the pair and runs off, and each time the gruffalo becomes more impressed with the mouse's apparent toughness.

Buff the scratches. Peel off any tape, plastic or paper remaining. Polish your wheel.\\"","output":"Title: Unleash the Shine - A Comprehensive Guide to Restoring and Polishing Your Wheels Introduction: Whether you drive a vintage roadster, a sleek sports car or a reliable family vehicle, maintaining the appearance and resale value is of prime importance. One of the most crucial aspects of a car's visual appeal lies in its wheels. Over time, wheels accumulate dirt, scratches, and other blemishes that can detract from their appearance. In this article, we'll cover a step-by-step guide to restoring and polishing your wheels, turning heads wherever you go. Step 1: Gather Supplies and Prepare Your Work Environment Before you start restoring your wheels, gather all the necessary supplies and create a proper workspace. You'll need: - Soap and water - Clean towels or rags - A hose (if accessible) - A soft brush - Sandpaper (multiple grits ranging from coarse to fine) - Buffing compound - A buffer or drill attachment - A protective clear coat (optional) - Plastic, tape, or paper (to cover the surfaces) - A wheel polish - A microfiber cloth Choose a well-lit, well-ventilated environment, such as a garage or outdoor space, to work comfortably and prevent any disturbances. Step 2: Clean Your Wheels Thoroughly Start by cleaning your wheels with soap and water using a soft brush. Rinse them with a hose (if accessible), ensuring you remove any dirt or brake dust accumulated. Wipe the wheel dry with a clean towel or rag to prevent any water spots from forming. Step 3: Sand Any Dirt Spots Once the wheels are completely dry, identify any areas that require special attention, such as old dirt spots. Using coarse sandpaper (around 80-100 grit), sand the affected area to remove the dirt. Always sand in one direction to avoid damaging the finish. Gradually move to finer grit sandpaper (200-400 grit), continually sanding until the area is smooth. Wipe away any residue with a clean towel to prepare for the buffing process. Step 4: Buff the Scratches Now it's time to buff out any scratches on the wheels. Apply a buffing compound, following the product's instructions, to the scratched areas on your wheel. For best results, use a buffer or a drill with a buffing attachment to efficiently remove the scratches. Work in small sections and keep the buffer moving to avoid cutting too deep into the surface. Gradually increase the buffing compound, moving to a finer one until all the scratches are gone. Step 5: Protect Surrounding Areas When it's time to polish your wheel, first cover any surrounding surfaces— such as lug nuts, wheel bolts, or brake components—that shouldn't come in contact with the polish. You can use tape, plastic, or paper to tightly seal these areas. Step 6: Polish Your Wheel Finally, apply a high-quality wheel polish to your wheels, following the manufacturer's instructions. Begin by dabbing the polish onto a microfiber cloth and rub the cloth in a circular motion, ensuring even coverage. The brand and formulation of wheel polish you choose will significantly influence the final result, so investing in a premium product is recommended. Let the polish sit on the wheel's surface for a few minutes, or as recommended, before buffing it off to reveal a brilliant shine. (Optional) Step 7: Apply a Protective Clear Coat After polishing your wheels, you may consider applying a protective clear coat to keep them looking shiny and clean for a more extended period. Choose a wheel-specific clear coat, ensuring compatibility with your wheel material (e.g., aluminum, steel, or alloy). Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and drying times. Conclusion: Restoring and polishing your wheels boost your car's appearance and protect your investment. By following this comprehensive guide and performing regular maintenance, your vehicle will look its best, turning heads wherever you go. Keep in mind that wheel restoration should be done periodically, as maintaining your wheels is easier than fixing damage accumulated over time. So invest time and effort in polishing your wheels and enjoy the ride!"},{"instruction":"\\"Evander Holyfield ran across the field at 60 mph to bite the gazelle.\\" Is the above claim true?

Lead by scientists from University College London in the UK, the group were able to observe the surprisingly dense atmosphere of exoplanet 55 Cancri e using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and a swathe of new analysis techniques. The team’s research, soon to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, indicated that the atmosphere of 55 Cancri e comprised largely of hydrogen and helium, but the absence of water vapour suggested that finding life on this far-flung world was highly unlikely. “This is a very exciting result because it’s the first time that we have been able to find the spectral fingerprints that show the gases present in the atmosphere of a super-Earth” said Angelos Tsiaras, a PhD student who helped develop the techniques used to analyse the atmosphere of 55 Cancri e. “The observations of 55 Cancri e’s atmosphere suggest that the planet has managed to cling on to a significant amount of hydrogen and helium from the nebula from which it originally formed.” While 55 Cancri e is described as a ‘super-Earth’ due to its close approximation in size, that is where the comparisons end. A year on 55 Cancri e is just 18 hours long. (ESA/Hubble, M. Kommesser) Artists impressions of the distant planet, which orbits a different sun-like star to Earth, reveal an incredibly dangerous and hellish landscape, where a year is just eighteen hours long and where temperatures soar to over 2000 degress celcius – hot enough to melt titanium. Apart from hydrogen and helium, the data also revealed hints of hydrogen cyanide in the atmosphere, an extremely toxic and explosive compound that can kill humans within minutes. The scientists were able to make the observations by sweeping the Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) quickly across the parent star to reveal the spectrum of its starlight. The data was then analysed by software to reveal the spectrum of 55 Cancri e, illuminated by the light of the star it orbits. Little was previously known about 55 Cancri e before these close observations, only that it had a mass approximately eight times that of Earth, and that it was roughly 40 light years from Earth. The planet has made headlines in previous years after research determined that its interior is carbon-rich, leading to the nickname “the diamond planet”. Summary:","output":"Scientists from University College London have used the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and swathe of new analysis techniques to study the atmosphere of Earth-sized exoplanet, 55 Cancri e, for the first time.

Later Mr Abadi will join representatives from 21 countries, including US secretary of state John Kerry and French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, for talks which will focus on military support for fighters battling against ISIS - also known as Isil, as well as by its Arabic acronym Daesh. The Hammond is hosting the Small Group of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS at Lancaster House in London. Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hammond stressed the danger of terror attack in the UK by people inspired by events in Iraq and Syria. 'We have to regard Isil as probably the greatest single immediate threat to Britain's national security at the moment,' the Foreign Secretary told BBC1's Breakfast. 'There's a very significant risk of an Isil-inspired attack being planned and, if we are not successful in intercepting it, executed by Isil sympathisers who live in the UK but are inspired by what is going on in Iraq and Syria. 'Of course, our security and intelligence agencies, our police forces are working tirelessly around the clock to monitor, to identify, to intercept and to disrupt plots of this nature, and we've been very successful in doing so, but we mustn't be complacent. 'We know there are people out there who wish us harm and we have to be vigilant and we have to work extremely hard to make sure we identify and disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack.' David Cameron met Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in Downing Street ahead of the security summit in London. Mr Cameron vowed the UK would do 'everything we can' to stop the flow of foreign fighters who were travelling to join ISIS and cause 'mayhem' But he warned that Iraq's security forces will not be ready for months to take on ISIS fighters who have seized large swathes of the country. The Foreign Secretary acknowledged that despite huge sums spent by the United States and Britain on Iraq's security forces in the years following the ousting of Saddam Hussein, they had fallen back into a 'state of disarray'. 'There is a big challenge ahead of us,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'We are renewing and regenerating the Iraqi security forces - re-equipping them, retraining them, reorganising them - but it will be months yet before they are ready to start significant combat operations against Isil.' Air strikes by Britain and its allies had 'very effectively' contained ISIS while action was taken to 'rebuild' the Iraqi armed forces to enable them to drive the militants out of their country, he said, adding: 'They will be able to do it, the question is when they will be ready to start that process.'

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Although many species can reproduce asexually and use similar mechanisms to regenerate after severe injuries, sexual reproduction is the normal method in species whose reproduction has been studied. The minority of living polychaetes whose reproduction and lifecycles are known produce trochophore larvae, that live as plankton and then sink and metamorphose into miniature adults. Oligochaetes are full hermaphrodites and produce a ring-like cocoon around their bodies, in which the eggs and hatchlings are nourished until they are ready to emerge. What annelids dislike hermaphrodites?","output":"The question you asked is not quite suitable for the information provided in the article. Instead, I can explain to you what the article says. The article tells us that most polychaete worms (which are a type of annelid) reproduce sexually and produce trochophore larvae. It also says that oligochaetes, another type of annelid, are hermaphrodites, which means they have both male and female parts. They produce cocoons to protect their eggs and hatchlings. So, the article doesn't talk about annelids disliking hermaphrodites, but it explains two different types of reproduction in annelids."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Option 1: Upset the dog Cameron was running from the dog, which implies that he was afraid or uncomfortable. It is unlikely that Cameron would choose to upset the dog further, considering his previous actions of escaping from it. Option 2: Reach safety next Since Cameron was trying to evade the dog and had just successfully climbed the fence, his primary concern would be to ensure that he is safe. It makes sense that he would want to continue distancing himself from the threat and reach a safe place.

Arizona's measure stipulates that police can ask the residency status of people being investigated for a crime. \\"Although the law is not scheduled to go into effect until July 29, the ACLU is concerned that some law enforcement officers are already beginning to act on provisions of the law,\\" the ACLU said on its website. \\"We hope the alerts provide people with some measure of protection from illegal harassment from law enforcement and inform them of their rights should they encounter it.\\" The travel alerts -- issued by ACLU affiliates from as far away as Alaska and New York -- inform people of their rights when stopped by law enforcement in Arizona, the ACLU said. Critics say the new law will lead to racial profiling and prevent police from doing their jobs by undermining trust in the Latino community. City governments and organizations opposed to the law have targeted Arizona with protests and boycotts. But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and other state officials say the law is necessary because of the increasing number of people illegally entering the state from Mexico. In addition, Brewer has said the law does not target an individual's specific ethnicity. \\"It wouldn't matter if you are Latino or Hispanic or Norwegian,\\" she said last month. \\"If you didn't have proof of citizenship and the police officer had reasonable suspicion, he would ask and verify your citizenship. I mean, that's the way that it is. That's what the federal law says.

The question and answer pair are described below.","output":"Question: Is the bench made of brick, or a combination of brick and slab? To answer this question, let's analyze the two possibilities step-by-step: 1. The bench is made of brick: In this scenario, the bench would be constructed entirely of bricks. Bricks would likely be stacked and arranged in a way to create the structure and support for the bench. This could result in a sturdy, durable bench with a somewhat rough surface, unless additional padding or cushioning is provided. 2. The bench is made of brick and slab: Here, the bench would have a combination of brick and slab materials. Bricks might be used to create the base or supporting structure of the bench, while a slab (potentially made of materials such as wood, stone, or concrete) could be placed as the seating surface. This option could provide a softer, more comfortable seating area compared to the brick-only option, and might also offer a more aesthetic and finished appearance. In conclusion, the bench might either be made solely of brick or a combination of brick and slab.

Options: - halitosis - fullness - overeating - gas - gain energy The answer is \\"gain energy\\" because Answer:","output":"The primary biological purpose of eating breakfast is to \\"gain energy.\\" After a long period of sleep and fasting overnight, your body needs to replenish its energy reserves to function effectively throughout the day. By eating breakfast, you are essentially \\"breaking the fast\\" and providing your body with the necessary fuel to jump-start your metabolism and restore glucose levels. Glucose, a sugar obtained from the foods you eat, is the primary source of energy for your body. Consuming breakfast provides a steady supply of glucose to your brain and muscles, helping you maintain focus, productivity, and physical strength during the day. Skipping breakfast may not only lead to a lack of energy but also affect your mood, memory, and concentration. Furthermore, individuals who regularly eat breakfast have been shown to have better overall dietary habits and healthier body weights. Eating breakfast also prevents overeating later in the day, reducing the risk of developing obesity and associated health problems. In conclusion, the biological purpose of eating breakfast is to gain energy for your body's functions, including brain function and muscle activity, while improving overall health and promoting effective weight management."},{"instruction":"Read this: Bal Gangadhar Tilak, an Indian nationalist leader, declared Swaraj as the destiny of the nation.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: She's not a loner at all... Product review: I thought I was reading a book about a person who was a real loner, a party of one. Someone who saw the world from a different perspective than the usual family view.So imagine my surprise when on page 80, the author reveals that she is married, livng with her husband. I don't know about you, but I don't call that a \\"party of one\\" or a \\"loner.\\" I was annoyed at being misled by this person. She insisted that even though she lived in a house with her husband, she was a \\"loner.\\" I have edited my review to remove what subsequent review readers found offensive. I still say she is far from being a true loner.","output":"In order to decide whether this review would increase or decrease my chances of buying the product, I would first need to examine the review's content and make some considerations. Step 1: Identify the reviewer's main issue. The reviewer appears to be disappointed with the author's portrayal of the character as a \\"loner\\" despite being married. Step 2: Consider how relevant the reviewer's concerns are to my own interests and preferences. If the primary reason I am interested in the book is to read about a \\"true loner\\" or a character with a drastically different perspective from the typical family-oriented one, the misleading portrayal of the character in question might be a valid reason to avoid purchasing the product. In this case, the review would decrease my chances of buying the product. Step 3: Think about the overall sentiment of the review. Given that this reviewer had a negative experience with the product, it might be worth considering other reviews or looking into other factors that could potentially influence my purchasing decision. If the majority of the reviews are positive or if the book has received critical acclaim from trusted sources, it could increase my chances of buying the product despite the concerns raised in this particular review. Step 4: Reflect on whether the reviewer's concern is an isolated issue or a common concern among other reviewers. If many other reviews mention similar issues or concerns about the book, it would be more likely that the review would decrease my chances of buying the product. However, if most other reviews have different opinions or perspectives that align more closely with my preferences, this review may not hold as much weight in my decision-making process. In conclusion, whether this review would increase or decrease the chances of me buying the product would depend on the relevance of the concern raised to my own interests and preferences, the overall sentiment in the review, and the presence of similar concerns in other reviews. In this case, the review does raise some valid points that might be worth considering, but it would not be enough to definitively sway my decision either way without further information from other sources."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What does going to party with the opposite sex lead to? - get drunk - meet new people - drinking beer - enjoy yourself - having sex The best answer is The answer is:","output":"To find the best answer, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. Get drunk: This may be a possible outcome but it depends on the individual attending the party. Not everyone drinks or gets drunk at parties. Also, it does not encompass all aspects of attending a party with the opposite sex. 2. Meet new people: This is a likely outcome when attending a party, regardless of the gender of the attendees. This option is more general and can happen in a social setting like a party. 3. Drinking beer: Similar to getting drunk, this option is too specific and dependent on personal preferences. Not everyone drinks beer or even consumes alcohol at parties. 4. Enjoy yourself: This is another likely outcome of attending a party, as the goal of going to a party is usually to have fun and enjoy oneself. This answer is more encompassing and general, which makes it a strong contender for the best answer. 5. Having sex: Although this could be an outcome in some cases, it is not a guaranteed result of attending a party with the opposite sex. This option is too specific and does not apply to everyone's experience of attending parties. After analyzing all the options, the best answer is: \\"Enjoy yourself\\" because it is the most general outcome that applies to most party situations and aligns with the purpose of attending a party.

A propaganda video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man dressed in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Wright Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012. The masked executioner spoke in English, with what sounded like a British accent, and said the slaying came in response to the air strikes ordered by President Barack Obama against Isis 12 days ago. Isis, whose chief spokesman came under US state department sanctions on Monday, warned of further revenge – including on another man purported to be a captured US journalist, Steven Sotloff – and in the video the victim was made to read a statement blaming the US for his own murder. Foley has been missing in Syria since November 2012, where he went to report on the bloody struggle to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He was initially thought to have been captured by forces loyal to the Assad regime. Foley’s mother later released a statement saying her son gave his life to expose the suffering of the Syrian people. Diane Foley asked his kidnappers to release their other captives. “He was an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she said. “We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world. “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.” YouTube took down the gruesome video, but not before it sparked a debate on social media about the ethics of sharing it. Philip Hammond, the British foreign secretary, said the video appeared to be genuine, and that the killer could well be a Briton. He said that although further analysis would need to be carried out, the man “on the face of it appears to have been a British person” and that this would not be surprising given the “significant number” of Britons fighting with Isis in Syria and Iraq. Screengrab from the ISIS video showing the execution of James Foley Photograph: Youtube Foley, 40, a former Stars and Stripes reporter, was captured in November 2012 near the Syrian town of Taftanaz. It was not his first detention while reporting: in 2011, he was taken while reporting on the uprising against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi’s forces ultimately released him after six weeks in captivity. A friend of Foley’s and his fellow captive in Libya, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote in a 2013 essay that captivity was “the state most violently opposite his nature.” Gillis described Foley as gentle, friendly, courageous and impatient with “anything that slows his forward momentum.” In a January 2013 interview with local television news near her Rochester, New Hampshire home, Foley’s mother Diane said her son was “passionate about covering the story in Syria, passionate about the people there.” Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said US intelligence was working to determine the authenticity of the video. “If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said in a statement. A day after Obama declared that Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US warplanes had broken Isis’ hold on the critical Mosul Dam, US Central Command announced two strikes near it on Monday, to “further expand control of the area.” One strike was said to have destroyed an Isis checkpoint while the other was “not successful.” Obama has offered no timeframe for the length of his campaign against Isis. The US military has bombed over 90 targets attributed to Isis, including vehicle convoys, mobile artillery and fixed positions, since 8 August. Most of the strikes have come in the past few days, near the dam. The other strikes have occurred either to blunt an Isis advance on the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil or to lift an Isis siege on Mount Sinjar, where it chased thousands of Iraqi Yazidis whom it threatened to kill unless they converted to Islam. The US considers the siege broken. ||||| After Hurricane Maria, one family in Boston has been unable to speak to relatives in Puerto Rico.

The birth actually occurred in 2012. But it was only a few months ago that researchers published DNA evidence that Thelma — an 11-year-old, 200 pound, 20-foot-long female at the Louisville Zoo — was the sole genetic parent. Until then, zoo keepers figured it was much more likely that Thelma's body had held onto sperm from an unknown male for a long time before using it to fertilize her eggs. \\"We didn't know what we were seeing. We had attributed it to stored sperm,\\" the zoo's snake curator, Bill McMahan, told National Geographic. \\"I guess sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.\\" This is the first case of such a birth recorded in Thelma's species, but it's not the first seen in the animal kingdom — or even in the snake world. In a phenomenon called parthenogenesis, females who would typically use two-parent sexual reproduction are sometimes able to accomplish the deed on their own. Researchers say that Thelma's six female offspring were \\"half-clones,\\" National Geographic reports. That means that her egg cell probably interacted with something called a polar body — a cell made up of genetic material that's left over when the egg cell forms. These polar bodies usually just die, but sometimes they can meet up with egg cells and (if they form the right number of chromosomes once they're put together) an embryo can begin to form. Thelma's reproductive system may have triggered the rare phenomenon because of her unusually luxurious surroundings: She lived in a large habitat, surrounded by heating pads, and was fed massive quantities of food. With conditions so optimal for reproduction, what should have been a cellular fluke ended with six healthy babies. Of course, those healthy babies are still pretty inbred — and while they're doing just fine in their zoo enclosure, their keepers don't think they'd have survived in the wild.

Now, let's consider the possible choices: i. Wife: It is unlikely that a wife would require all of these services, especially baths, stories, and supervised outdoor playtime. ii. Dogs: While dogs might need some of these care services, such as outdoor playtime, they would not typically need assistance with baths and stories, nor would one typically cook breakfast, lunch, and snacks for them. iii. Kids: The tasks mentioned in the context, such as cooking meals, baths, stories, and outdoor playtime, are all activities commonly associated with children.

Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or \\"modules\\"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. The album also continued Brian's exploration of \\"party tracks\\"—a form of music which includes the sounds of people shouting and making noises, as if at a party. Brian had enacted this approach with Beach Boys' Party! in 1965, thereby mixing that record's style with the modular composition method he devised for \\"Good Vibrations\\". Most of Smiley Smile was recorded at Brian's improvised home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. The core instrumentation consisted of organ, honky-tonk piano, and electronic bass played by the Beach Boys themselves, rather than the session musicians employed in much of their previous work. Brian became obsessed with a three-tiered Baldwin organ during the album's recording, resulting in a more minimalist approach to the new arrangements. The organ gave the album its central timbre. Most of the piano was played by Brian, and most of the bass was played by Carl. Tape manipulation was another prominent feature, with varispeed being applied to a few miscellaneous vocals. On \\"She's Goin' Bald\\", a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer was used to raise the pitch of the group's vocals without affecting the tempo.It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: \\"He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'\\" When asked if Brian was \\"still the producer of Smiley Smile\\", Carl answered, \\"Most definitely.\\" Brian acknowledged: \\"We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the group whose vocal pitch was raised by a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer?, what is it ?

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, David Edward Hughes is considered one of the early pioneers in the development of radio technology. However, the invention of radio is credited to multiple inventors as it was a gradual process that involved various scientists and engineers working on different aspects of the technology. Some of the key figures in the invention and development of radio include: 1. James Clerk Maxwell: He developed the theoretical foundation for electromagnetic radiation, predicting the existence of radio waves in the 1860s. 2. Heinrich Hertz: A German physicist who demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves, specifically radio waves, in the late 1880s. 3. Guglielmo Marconi: An Italian inventor who is often considered the \\"father of radio\\" due to his successful development of the first practical wireless telegraphy system in the late 1890s.

Statement: Megan has a lot more money than Jessica because.... Option I: Megan just bought the winning lottery ticket or, Option II: Jessica just bought the winning lottery ticket. The statement is comparing the amount of money Megan and Jessica have, stating that Megan has more. Therefore, the proceeding clause needs to support this comparison. Option I: Megan's purchase of the winning lottery ticket would significantly increase her amount of money, supporting the assertion that she has more money than Jessica. Option II: However, if Jessica bought the winning lottery ticket, this would suggest that she should have more money than Megan, which contradicts the initial assertion.

Sports team - This phrase is the main subject of the sentence. The sports team is an organized group of individuals who typically play together in a particular sport. In this context, they are the ones performing the action described in the sentence. 2. Graze - This is the main verb, which indicates the action being performed by the sports team. Grazing typically refers to the action of animals feeding on grass or plant material, mostly in a meadow. However, it seems unusual for a sports team to graze, so this word helps us understand that the sentence is likely intended to be metaphorical, whimsical, or humorous. 3. Herd - A herd is a group of animals, in this case, horses. This word informs us of what is being cared for by the sports team during the grazing activity. 4. Horses - This specific type of animal is being grazed, so it is an important detail. Horses are large, hoofed mammals used for various purposes, such as riding, sports, and farming. 5. Overgrown meadow - An overgrown meadow refers to a field, likely with an abundance of grass and other plant life that has been allowed to grow without any maintenance or cultivation. This aspect of the sentence sets the scene where the entire action is taking place. In summary, the most important words in the sentence are \\"sports team,\\" \\"graze,\\" \\"herd,\\" \\"horses,\\" and \\"overgrown meadow.\\" These words convey the primary action, who is carrying out that action, and the setting in which it is taking place."},{"instruction":"Q: Is the following a factual statement? \\"Studio Ghibli creates works in the Anime genre.\`.\\" Options: - yes - no A: yes Explain how we arrive at this answer:","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Studio Ghibli creates works in the Anime genre\\" is factual.

Frankie Goes to Hollywood (FGTH) were a British band formed in Liverpool, England, in 1980. The group was fronted by Holly Johnson (vocals), with Paul Rutherford (vocals), Peter Gill (drums, percussion), Mark O'Toole (bass guitar), and Brian Nash (guitar). The group's 1983 debut single \\"Relax\\" was banned by the BBC in 1984 while at number six in the charts and subsequently topped the UK Singles Chart for five consecutive weeks, going on to enjoy prolonged chart success throughout that year and ultimately becoming the seventh best-selling UK single of all time. It also won the 1985 Brit Award for Best British Single. On the B-side to the group's first single, Johnson explained that the group's name derived from a page from The New Yorker magazine, featuring the headline \\"Frankie Goes Hollywood\\" and a picture of Frank Sinatra, although the magazine page Johnson referred to was actually a pop art poster by Guy Peellaert. The original group named \\"Frankie Goes to Hollywood\\" dates from 1980. The nucleus of the group emerged from the late 1970s Liverpool punk scene. Lead singer Johnson had played bass with Big in Japan and had also released two solo singles. Local musicians Peter Gill (drums), Jed O'Toole (bass), and O'Toole's cousin Brian Nash (guitar) initially joined Johnson, calling themselves the Sons of Egypt. This line-up secured a number of small local gigs before disbanding. The group was reprised when Johnson joined Mark O'Toole (bass) and Peter \\"Ped\\" Gill to form FGTH. During a particularly fluid period of personnel changes, Jed O'Toole joined FGTH on guitar, and a female vocalist, Sonia Mazumder, was also a band member for the first Frankie gig at the Leeds nightclub \\"The Warehouse\\", supporting Hambi & The Dance. Paul Rutherford - a member of the headline act who had also sung in seminal Liverpool punk band The Spitfire Boys - apparently got so caught up in Frankie's performance that he effectively replaced Mazumder that very night. The new all-male musical line-up subsequently toured locally with a leather-clad female duo known as \\"The Leatherpets\\" and managed to fund promotional videos and demos, despite being eventually turned down by both Arista Records and Phonogram Inc. In October 1982, the group recorded a John Peel Session for BBC Radio 1, comprising the originals \\"Krisco Kisses\\", \\"Two Tribes\\", \\"Disneyland\\", and \\"The World Is My Oyster\\". Around this time Jed O'Toole left the group, to be replaced by the returning Brian Nash. In February 1983, the group was invited to record a video for \\"Relax\\" by the Channel 4 show The Tube at the Liverpool State Ballroom. After the broadcast, the Peel session was repeated on radio, and a new session recorded for the BBC, comprising \\"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\\", \\"The Only Star in Heaven\\" and \\"Relax\\". These performances, along with a repeat of the Tube video, convinced Trevor Horn to sign the group for his new label, ZTT Records, in May 1983.","output":"This text is about the British band Frankie Goes to Hollywood (FGTH), which was formed in Liverpool, England, in 1980."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"Two individuals with their arms around each other walk down a marble-floored hallway with columns to the right side.\\" is it true that \\"Two dogs run down the hallway.\\"?

The answer is:","output":"The last step of the process is the formation of iron oxide, commonly known as rust. When iron is exposed to oxygen in the air, it undergoes a chemical reaction that causes it to oxidize. This oxidation process leads to a series of changes in the physical and chemical properties of the iron, ultimately resulting in the formation of iron oxide. To explain this process in greater detail: 1. Exposure to Air: Iron objects, such as tools or structures, are constantly surrounded by air. Air is a mixture of gases, primarily composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and traces of other elements. Oxygen makes up approximately 21% of Earth's atmosphere. 2. Contact with Oxygen: When the surface of an iron object comes into contact with oxygen, a chemical reaction can occur. Oxygen molecules (O2) in the air react with iron atoms (Fe) on the surface of the object. 3. Initiation of Oxidation: The reaction between oxygen molecules and iron atoms leads to the formation of iron ions (Fe2+). These iron ions are highly reactive and readily combine with other atoms or molecules, particularly oxygen. This marks the beginning of the oxidation process. 4. Formation of Iron Hydroxide: In the presence of water or moisture in the air, the reactive iron ions (Fe2+) combine with hydroxide ions (OH-) to form iron (II) hydroxide (Fe(OH)2). Iron (II) hydroxide is a greenish-blue compound, which is usually an intermediate product in the process. 5. Further Oxidation and Formation of Iron Oxide: Iron (II) hydroxide is an unstable compound and quickly reacts with more oxygen in the air to form iron (III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)3). As iron (III) hydroxide loses water molecules, it eventually transforms into iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3), which is a reddish-brown compound commonly known as rust. 6. Final Result - Rust Formation: Over time, as more iron oxidizes and rust accumulates, the iron object may become structurally weakened and may eventually disintegrate if not protected or treated. The last step of the process, therefore, is the formation of iron oxide, or rust, due to the continuous progression of the oxidation reaction between iron and the oxygen present in the air. This reaction is accelerated in the presence of moisture or water, leading to the eventual breakdown and disintegration of the iron object if left untreated."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Outside the window you can see an area of dirt that appears muddy from the rain.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"Its nice outside.\\" is true?

For those who love sports, adventure travel can have a whole different meaning than for those who like history. The physical travel types that you can find include such adventure travel as white water rafting , kayaking or climbing and hiking to some mountains somewhere. To the hiker, backpacking across Ireland might be their adventure. For this type of person, adventure travel almost always includes something physical.

Elgar was contemptuous of folk music and had little interest in or respect for the early English composers, calling William Byrd and his contemporaries \\"museum pieces\\". Of later English composers, he regarded Purcell as the greatest, and he said that he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvořák and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Saëns and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.Elgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889–91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the...

Small investors are flocking to a new toy aimed at compulsive fidgeters – now the makers just have to satisfy demand Fidget much? Ever get bored in meetings? Apparently you’re not alone. A product aimed at the untapped market of people who compulsively click pens, spin key rings or pop bubble wrap has so far attracted more than 3.4m in funding from crowdsourcing site Kickstarter and is on course to be one of its most popular fundraisers ever. The Fidget Cube, a cube with six different clickable, spinnable, flickable sides at varying degrees of annoying loudness, was designed by Matthew and Mark McLachlan through their company Antsy Labs. The cube, described as “a cube for people who fidget”, is a small, mostly vinyl, square with some satisfying-feeling metal pieces and rubber buttons to poke at and flick during tense or boring moments. Fidget Cube is currently Kickstarter’s fifth-most lucrative project and it’s still open to backers for another 37 days. For comparison, award-winning screenwriter and director Charlie Kaufman’s stop-motion film Anomalisa, which won the Grand Jury prize at the Venice film festival, raised about 406,000 on Kickstarter, an eighth of Fidget Cube’s haul so far. The Guardian described Anomalisa as “a masterpiece about the human condition – with puppets”. Fidget Cube is hot on the heels of the fundraising company’s most-funded project to date, a card game called Exploding Kittens. It raised 8.8m. Fidget Cube: It’s a cube for people who fidget In a video that parodies a TV ad for pharmaceuticals, Marc McLachlan stares soulfully at the camera and describes his battle with fidgeting; after a few minutes his brother takes over and shares some less dire-sounding quasi-medical jargon about the uses of fidgeting for people with short attention spans. The toy has caught on. The project launched on 30 August and had reached its modest 15,000 goal by the end of day one. By 8 September it had broken the 1m mark. By the end of last week it had attracted more than 2m. Over the weekend, it made over a million dollars more. Revealed: the biggest money makers on Kickstarter UK Read more The brothers are now in the awkward position of having to manage expectations as they attempt to ship out at least 60,000 Fidget Cubes; though they say the product design is done, they now have to scale up production to a level they hadn’t anticipated. “Fidget Cube is a finalized product that already has the kinks worked out, so we never expected to have issues with meeting this delivery date. However, at the time of writing this, we have about 60,000 backers – a thought that deeply moves us and motivates us to not let you down. We are working tirelessly on getting some concrete answers. What we can tell you is that we will be transparent about everything, especially the ship date. Please don’t perceive silence on any one issue as unwillingness to communicate (we’re working overtime on such issues so that we can provide solid answers, not just best guesses).” Luckily, the pair have a tool to help them manage the potentially stressful situation. ||||| Enlarge Image Antsy Labs Your desk is your sanctuary at work. It's where you sit (or stand) and while away your employment hours. Maybe you're really good at holding still. Or maybe you're the kind who taps your toes, flips pencils and bends paperclips. If that sounds like you, you might already be a backer of the Fidget Cube from Antsy Labs on Kickstarter. The Fidget Cube went from a modest 15,000 funding goal to topping 2 million (£1.5 million, AU2.6 million) in pledges, and it still has 40 days to run. What's so special about this vinyl cube? It's a fidgeter's dream. The box is stuffed full of tactile toys, including a rocker switch, buttons, a joystick, gears, a rotating dial and a ball in a socket. The cube even has a smooth indentation that acts like a worry stone. Some of the features make clicking noises. Some are silent so you can fidget quietly under the conference table during team meetings. It's a much more entertaining alternative to clicking your pen or nibbling on a pencil eraser. The project video makes a play on prescription pill commercials, offering help to serial fidgeters with addictions to flipping pens around and popping bubble wrap. A single Fidget Cube costs 19 (about £14, AU25) and is expected to ship in December. Keep in mind that not all crowdfunding projects deliver on time and as expected. With so much time left on the Kickstarter, the Fidget Cube may very well rocket into superstar fundraising status. It has more than 54,000 backers and the pledge numbers are constantly rolling upward. What's behind the viral-like success of the Fidget Cube? It probably has something to do with all that pent-up fidgeting energy channeling toward a desk toy that promises to provide hours of satisfying clicking, pushing, rolling and turning motions in a package small enough to slip into your pocket. It's no wonder fidgeters can't wait to get their hands on one. ||||| Fidget Family, Two weeks ago, when we launched Fidget Cube, we had no idea what the following days and weeks would turn into. We knew we had made a product that we personally loved, but we were unsure if we would be able to convey just how fun and helpful Fidget Cube has been for us. Your trust in us and Fidget Cube has gone well beyond what we could have imagined. We don't take this lightly. For the past week we have been working hard to put systems in place that will help us manage this burst of love for Fidget Cube. For example, there was once a time where we had planned on shipping your order personally, packaging up each reward with a small team made up of us and any family members who would accept payment in the form of pizza. As this doesn’t appear to be possible anymore, we are partnering with fulfillment companies that will assist in making sure your Fidget Cube gets to you, no matter which part of the world you’re in. All of these details add up to one conclusion: we are ramping things up at Antsy Labs! We have read your concerns regarding shipping and whether or not we will be able to ship by December. What we can tell you is it's STILL our goal and will remain our goal until we are proven otherwise. We plan to have a much clearer picture in the coming weeks and will keep you posted. That said, we do appreciate the countless comments saying that quality is more important than an earlier ship date. We agree and are glad to hear we are not alone! Which leads us to our next point: we would rather under promise and over deliver. For this reason, we are going to be making a new set of reward tiers with a ship date of March 2017. If you have already pledged, this will not affect you. However, we will be closing off current tiers so there will be no more pledges allowed on tiers with a December ship date. This is a common practice among projects that get a little bigger than planned ;). This change will take place tomorrow, September 14, at around 7pm EST. Many of you have been asking about our next stretch goal. The wait is over... We’ve been very intentional about our stretch goals for this project, as making Fidget Cube is of course our primary focus and we want to be careful to not add too many peripheral tasks that would take time away from that. It’s incredibly important that each stretch goal we announce adds actual value to Fidget Cube and satisfies a need/desire that has been voiced by the community. One thing we’ve heard repeatedly from many of you in the Fidget Family is that you’d like something to protect your Fidget Cube. Whether that’s because you’re planning on throwing it in your pocket along with keys, or just want a storage solution, we hear you! We’re excited to announce that when we reach 5.5M, each Fidget Cube will come with its own carrying pouch! We will post pictures as soon as we have them, but we think you’ll like it! The FAQs on the project page are a helpful resource, but we have been super impressed to see the interactions taking place in the comments. Community members are stepping up and truly helping answer questions. Thank you! We have put together a few questions you may have and have answered them below. Why are you standing by the December ship date? With how many Fidget Cubes you have to send, there’s no way your backers should expect their Fidget Cube by the holidays. The logistics of this project are immense but we are approaching it with the deadline of December in mind. This will drive us to not settle for a later date this early in the campaign - we truly are still doing our best to get you your Fidget Cube ASAD (As Soon As December)! That said, you have our commitment that we will be keeping you updated as soon as we have solid projections. Now that you are locking the current tiers, can I change my pledge amount? Of course - once the tier is locked, it doesn’t mean you can't change anything. It just means any new pledges will have to be done in the new tiers. This change will take effect tomorrow, September 14, at around 7pm EST. I want to hang my Fidget Cube on a keychain, is this going to be possible? This has been the ongoing debate, and there are backers that fall on both sides! We are designing a solution and you should expect to see this solution before the project is done ;). I want to add one, two, or three+ Fidget Cubes to my pledge, but don’t want to pledge for the next highest reward tier. Not a problem! Here’s what to do: 1) Pledge for the reward tier that is closest to the quantity of Fidget Cubes you want. 2) Once the project is finished and we’re ready to ship your rewards, we’ll send out your backer survey. As we’ve mentioned before, you’ll be able to choose your color scheme(s) and provide your shipping address in this survey. You’ll also have the option to add (and pay for) additional Fidget Cubes to your pledge at this time. Some notes on this: Adding additional Fidget Cubes at the time of filling out your backer survey will not change shipping costs or the order in which your rewards are shipped. Finally, some of you may have already customized your order by adding additional Fidget Cubes to your reward tier (and have already been in contact with us). If this describes you, there’s no need to change anything! Perhaps the most important question is being asked by fellow Fidgeteer, Will H. The answer is YES! Yes, we believe we'd owe you a few actually. Updates are an essential part of our communication. We see it as the best way for us to disseminate information effectively and efficiently. Because we put a lot of effort into our updates, we plan on doing them once a week - and more frequently if time permits. Thank you! Until next time, Fidget On! Team Antsy Labs (Matthew and Mark) ||||| Miss out on backing Fidget Cube? What is Fidget Cube? Fidget Cube is a desk toy for anyone who likes to fidget. 30 seconds of your time could make the difference in growing the Fidget Cube community. Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who can't stop fidgeting! How do I use it? It's simple. Fidget Cube (patent pending) has six sides. Each side features something to fidget with: Fidgeting that matches your style. Fidget Cube is available in 10 different color schemes: Dice, Graphite, Midnight, Aqua, Sunset, Berry, Fresh, Retro, Kickstarter Edition, and Backer Designed (design voted on by the Fidget Family!). Why fidget? We love this question. It's not uncommon to hear fidgeting being spoken about negatively. It's often labeled as unprofessional and deemed as anti-intellectual behavior. But in reality, the exact opposite has been suggested to be the case. Below are just some of many resources highlighting the work that's being done to learn more about this behavior: The Science Of Why We Fidget While We Work Squirm With Purpose Stress Toys: Mindlessness With A Purpose? The Benefits Of Fidgeting For Students With ADHD Why Do We Fidget? Using Stress Balls To Focus The Attention Of Students We believe that the way we look at fidgeting needs to change. This behavior isn't one that should continue to be stigmatized and mocked as unbecoming or inappropriate. We are passionate about the idea that fidgeting is a process that, with the right tools and outlet, can have positive and real-life applications. Where can I use Fidget Cube? It was incredibly important to us that the design of Fidget Cube was one that would look great on any desk, whether that desk belonged to a student or a CEO. There are really no limits to when and where you can use Fidget Cube. Use it while listening to a lecture, or while studying for that upcoming test. Use it in the next meeting you have to attend (or lead). Use it at your desk while working on projects. Enduring a lengthy commute and need to relieve some stress? Fidget away. Marathoning a Netflix series? Yep, you can fidget then too. But I already have a pen. Do I really need Fidget Cube? Pens (and the wonderful clicking they do) were a huge inspiration in the design process of Fidget Cube. They are probably one of the most commonly used fidget \\"tools\\". We like to see Fidget Cube as more of a fidget \\"toolbox\\". You don't have to be constrained to simple clicking, you can pick your poison based on your mood. Yes... We are very serious about our fidgeting. I don't really fidget. Would I enjoy Fidget Cube? We think so! Not everyone fidgets the same amount. But spending the last few years deeply interested in the process of fidgeting, we've observed the fact that almost everyone fidgets to some extent, in a variety of ways. Maybe you're not the type of person who uses objects like paper clips or pencils to fidget with. If that's the case, it's very likely you fidget in some other way, such as bouncing your knee up and down, tapping your foot, or picking at lint in your pocket. We believe that Fidget Cube provides a tangible way to capture your floating attention, regardless of whether you fidget consciously or subconsciously. Rewards.

Below, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with Fidget Cube, starting from the first discussion about it to when all of you joined the story (and where we go from here)! We are insanely excited to get Fidget Cube into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Fidget Cube has shipped.

International Backers This project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Fidget Cube worldwide! That being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below. In addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of Fidget Cube, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. We calculated shipping rates beforehand, and are able to swallow some of the shipping costs on orders of 1 or 2 Fidget Cubes. Please note that shipping becomes completely free when you pledge for 5 or more Fidget Cubes. Some Final Thoughts. While we strongly believe in the many benefits of fidgeting, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. Fidget Cube is a fun, unique way to customize your fidgeting. When designing Fidget Cube we were inspired by research that claims fidgeting might actually help individuals focus their attention. We have personally found that it helps us stay focused in boring meetings and while working on projects. ||||| Summary:","output":"The Fidget Cube, a small toy designed for people who fidget, has become the fifth-most lucrative project on crowdsourcing site Kickstarter, with 37 days still to go.

Since there is a 1-acre pond on Joyce's new property that is not suitable for growing vegetables, subtract this from the total size of her new property: Total Vegetable Growing Area = New Property Size - Pond Size Total Vegetable Growing Area = 20 acres - 1 acre Total Vegetable Growing Area = 19 acres So, Joyce now has 19 acres of land that are suitable for growing vegetables."},{"instruction":"What is the opposite of little?

The elegant ambiance, impeccable service, mouth-watering food, and a thoughtful wine selection—all combined to create an unforgettable dining experience that would delight even the most demanding palate. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough to anyone seeking a stellar dining experience. Upon arrival, we were greeted with the utmost genuine warmth by the attentive staff, who instantly made us feel like VIPs. The restaurant's atmosphere was a beautiful blend of sophistication and contemporary chic, with eye-catching chandeliers, tasteful artwork on the walls, and a subtle, soothing color palette that contributed to both our comfort and overall dining experience. Moreover, we were pleased with the acoustic design, as the noise level was remarkably low, permitting easy conversation and an intimate atmosphere. The menu was an outstanding showcase of culinary creativity that featured a rich variety of seasonal ingredients and exquisite flavors. The appetizer course presented us with an irresistible choice, and we opted for the crispy calamari and delectable lobster bisque. Both dishes exceeded our expectations with a perfect balance of flavors and heavenly textures. We could tell that only the finest and freshest ingredients were used to craft these culinary masterpieces. For our main course, we selected the Chilean seabass and the grilled filet mignon. The seabass was cooked to perfection—tender and succulent—accompanied by an exquisite lemon beurre blanc sauce that harmoniously elevated the dish. The filet mignon was a carnivore's dream, cooked to a perfect medium-rare with a divine red wine sauce and a delicious bouquet of roasted vegetables. Every bite melted in our mouths and left us craving more. No special occasion would be complete without sweet indulgence, so we treated ourselves to their decadent chocolate lava cake and refreshing passion fruit sorbet. The lava cake oozed warm and decadent chocolate, while the sorbet provided a perfect balance of tartness and sweetness. These confections were the perfect way to round off our extraordinary culinary journey. Apart from the exceptional food, the wine menu at The Gourmet Bistro deserves praise. Our server recommended an exquisite Cabernet Sauvignon that complemented our main courses superbly, showcasing the range and quality of their wine selection. The service throughout the evening was impeccable. Our server was knowledgeable, attentive, and provided excellent recommendations without being intrusive. The entire staff made our evening truly memorable, and it is clear that The Gourmet Bistro places a strong emphasis on customer satisfaction. In summary, The Gourmet Bistro exceeded our expectations in every way and turned our special occasion into an unforgettable evening. The exquisite cuisine, attentive service, and elegant ambiance created an unparalleled dining experience that won't soon be forgotten.

One is a dark colored dress and the other is a white dress. and a hint : Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. Please answer this question : Would the white coat absorb more or less sunlight?","output":"The white coat would absorb less sunlight. Light colors, like white, reflect more sunlight and therefore absorb less energy and heat compared to dark colors like black.

Options: +Yes. +No.","output":"-No. The question \\"How would you describe Sasha?\\" seeks an adjective or a series of adjectives, or a detailed explanation about Sasha's characteristics, qualities, behaviors, or her role. Such a question expects a response that paints a detailed picture of Sasha's personality, demeanor, or position, possibly including descriptions related to her appearance, mannerisms, and roles. The reply \\"curious to hear Bailey's response,\\" does not meet this requirement. This statement does not provide any information about Sasha - neither about her characteristics, her behavior nor her role. Instead, it suggests that the person being asked is eager or interested in hearing what Bailey's response would be to the same question, thus redirecting the focus from Sasha to Bailey. In essence, the response \\"curious to hear Bailey's response\\" is more of a deflection than an answer and provides no apparent or implied descriptive information about Sasha. Consequently, it would not serve as an adequate or valid reply to the question \\"How would you describe Sasha?\\". A valid answer could be something like, \\"Sasha is an empathetic, patient, and dedicated teacher who always seeks the best for her students,\\" considering that Sasha is a teacher.

This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

Yes or no? Answer: Extreme Tourette's in adulthood is a rarity, and Tourette's does not adversely affect intelligence or life expectancy . Question: how frequently does tourettes occur Answer:","output":"Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder that is estimated to affect about 1 in every 160 children and 1 in every 100 adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This prevalence, however, may be underestimated due to some mild cases that can go unnoticed or undiagnosed. The condition is more common in males than in females, at a ratio of approximately 3 or 4 to 1. It occurs in people from all ethnic groups. The syndrome usually starts in childhood, between the ages of 5 and 10, and it tends to improve as the child grows older. Many individuals with TS experience a significant reduction in their tics by late adolescents or early adulthood. However, this is not the case for everyone, and some people may continue to experience tics into adulthood, though severe Tourette's in adulthood is rare. Despite the often notable and sometimes even disruptive nature of the symptoms, it's important to note that Tourette syndrome does not generally affect a person’s intelligence or lifespan. Persons with Tourette's have a normal life expectancy and many lead high achieving lives. Each person with Tourette's syndrome has a unique symptom complex - the types and severity of tics and the presence of other co-occurring conditions, such as ADHD and OCD, vary widely among people with Tourette's syndrome, making some cases much more complex to manage than others. It's also significant to note that there currently is no cure for Tourette's syndrome, but the condition can be managed with a combination of medications, therapeutic interventions, and lifestyle changes to help control the symptoms."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence based on this summary: hurricane frances begins lashing florida","output":"As the formidable Hurricane Frances ominously approached the vulnerable coastline, it began unleashing its overwhelming fury upon the unsuspecting residents of Florida, leaving no area untouched by its unrelenting winds and torrential downpours."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that contains a fact.","output":"Bears, like big, furry animals, love to eat honey from beehives, and they're really good at climbing trees to find it!"},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: New Jersey Police Officer (Lieutenant) for the following movie plot: The film opens at a meeting of the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Ocean County, New Jersey in 2005.

There are so many barriers for it to get over. You've got to show that it's reliable, and there are real questions about whether that text is reliable.\\" Professor Bock expresses other concerns about the papyrus. For example, he says, there is not enough writing on it to establish the real meaning of the words. He says the word \\"wife\\" may not mean \\"wife\\" in the traditional way. And, he says the papyrus is just one text showing that Jesus might have been married. \\"And then you've got the fact that this is one text out of many, many, many texts that don't indicate that Jesus was married.

This is a trick commonly used in soccer. Bend your ankle so that your toe is pointed toward your plant foot and strike the ball with the outside edge of your foot, just behind your little toe. When you strike the ball, straighten out your foot to make it go in the other direction. This might not be the most practical way to kick a ball off the ground, but doing a spinning heel kick can be a great fake-out when you're messing around with your friends. It's hard to control, but with some practice you can learn to strike the ball accurately almost every time. As you step toward a ball on the ground, plant your non-kicking foot on the opposite side of the ball that you normally would, twisting your body around as you do it. Swing your kicking foot around, sweeping into the ball with your heel. If you're right-footed, you would turn clockwise and if you're left-footed you would turn counter-clockwise. Rainbows are one of the cornerstones of fancy soccer footwork. If you want to really improve your skills, pulling off a rainbow can help impress your teammates. There's not much cause to use it in a game, but it's an intimidating way to practice in front of the other team. As you're dribbling around, step with your kicking foot in front of the ball, stopping the ball with your heel. Use the instep of your non-kicking foot to trap the ball against your heel. In one fluid motion, do a little hop step with both feet, flicking the ball up and over your head, back in front of your body. It'll take some practice to get the right amount of hop and power into the kick to get it to go where you want it to go. Practice while stationary at first, then gradually try to do it at speed. Done properly, a bicycle kick can be one of the most spectacular shots in all of soccer. Think of it like a backwards punt, done when you've got your back facing the directions in which you want the ball to travel. To pull of a bicycle kick, lean your body backward and gently fall onto your back while you bring your kicking leg up for a kick. Strike the ball over your head as you fall, so it goes back behind you. You need to be extremely careful not to flat-back and hurt yourself, and to tuck your chin so you don't hit the back of your head hard on the ground. Do this on soft grassy surfaces and be extremely careful. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about some fancy soccer tricks that you can try when playing with your friends or practicing your skills.

'I think premiums are likely to go up,' she conceded under questioning, 'but go up at a slower pace' than they have already under Obamacare. President Obama famously promised in 2008 and 2009 that his health insurance overhaul plan would lower the cost of health care for an average family by 2,500 per year. And as a March 31 deadline approaches, the date when Americans will face fines if they don't have medical insurance, Sebelius told the panel that there will be 'no delay' in enforcing that so-called individual mandate. Scroll down for video A frustrated Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius fended off tough questions from Republicans who are still eager to cripple President Barack Obama's healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act 'How is that fair?' demanded Rep. Kevin Brady (R), talking about the administration's Obamacare delays affecting big businesses, but not individuals and families Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokeswoman Julie Bataille said during a conference call on Tuesday that 'we have no plans to extend the open enrollment period' that began amid fits and starts on October 1. 'In fact, we don't actually have the statutory authority to extend the open enrollment period in 2014,' she said. On Wednesday, Republican Ways and Means chairman Dave Camp asked Sebelius if she agreed. 'I haven’t seen their statements,' she replied, despite having been on the conference call, 'but there is no delay beyond March 31.' Republicans in Congress have castigated the Obama administration for failing to delay the individual mandate, even as it has made more than 35 changes to the Affordable Care Act, including some that defy date-specific deadlines in the written in the law's text. One of those changes was a year-long delay in the employer mandate, which requires companies with 50 or more employees to certify that their workers are covered by medical insurance plans that meet Obamacare's strict minimum standards. 'If you delayed this law because it’s not workable for businesses, why aren’t you delaying this law because it’s not workable for our families?' blasted Texas GOP Rep. Kevin Brady during Wednesday's hearing. 'How is that fair?' Georgia Rep. Tom Price demanded to know how many Obamacare enrollees have paid for their insurance plans, but Sebelius insisted 'I don't know that' Sebelius appeared before the House Ways and Means Committee in a hearing about HHS's budget request for 2015 Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer lashed out at HHS for its insistence that it is prohibited from delaying for individuals what it has already relayed for large companies. 'It is puzzling that Secretary Sebelius is now concerned with a lack of statutory authority when it comes to delaying the individual mandate,' Fischer said in a statement. 'The administration has already issued nearly two dozen Obamacare delays, including those for big business and the president’s political allies.' Fischer has introduced a bill that would explicitly give the White House the power to delay that individual mandate. In your face: Nebraska GOP Sen. Deb Fischer has crafted a bill that would give HHS the authority to push back the individual mandate deadline as far as it likes House Republicans are slated to vote this week on a similar bill, but the measure would face a certain veto at the White House. Sebelius also insisted that she doesn't know how many Obamacare enrollees have paid for coverage and are actually insured. 'I can’t tell you because I don’t know that,' she told Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price. The Obama administration trumpeted new numbers on Tuesday showing that 4.2 million Americans have selected medical insurance policies during the open enrollment period But a MailOnline analysis showed that in the seven states which have published both enrollment and payment numbers, insurers haven't seen payments from 21 per cent of those who have signed up. If that percentage were to hold true nationally, HHS's boast of 4.2 million enrollments would shrink by 900,000. Camp, a Michigan Republican, said Wednesday that the Affordable Care Act 'is not working as it was promised. And yet, the president’s budget doubles down on this law, requesting another 1.8 billion for its implementation.' Democrats, however – including President Obama – are insisting that the law is performing as well as it was expected to. ||||| ObamaCare's implementers continue to roam the battlefield and shoot their own wounded, and the latest casualty is the core of the Affordable Care Act—the individual mandate. To wit, last week the Administration quietly excused millions of people from the requirement to purchase health insurance or else pay a tax penalty. This latest political reconstruction has received zero media notice, and the Health and Human Services Department didn't think the details were worth discussing in a conference call, press materials or... ||||| This crawl of online resources of the 115th US Congress was performed on behalf of The United States National Archives & Records ||||| This crawl of online resources of the 115th US Congress was performed on behalf of The United States National Archives & Records ||||| The Obama administration will not delay ObamaCare's individual mandate or the March 31 deadline for enrolling in the new healthcare law, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Wednesday. Sebelius ruled out the changes during testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee, where Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) noted the administration has made dozens of other changes or delays to the law. ADVERTISEMENT Given the problems caused by ObamaCare's faulty website last year, Brady asked Sebelius directly if delays to the individual mandate or enrollment deadline would be next. “No, sir,” Sebelius responded. Republicans have denounced the administration's refusal to make changes to the individual mandate and enrollment deadline even as it made changes to the law to benefit other groups. Most notably, the administration has repeatedly delayed the mandate that employers offer their employees insurance. House Republicans have decried that as a \\"double standard,\\" and will vote this week on legislation that would delay the individual mandate for five years. The money saved from that action would be used to prevent a reduction in payments to doctors under Medicare. The vote is expected to be a tough choice for many Democrats, given ObamaCare's unpopularity. The defeat of a Democrat in Tuesday's special election in Florida is exacerbating worries that the new law will be a drag on Democrats in this year's midterm elections. Sebelius defended the delay of the employer mandate at Wednesday's hearing. She said that the great majority of business owners, 94 percent, have fewer than 50 employees and are not affected by the law, and argued that the employer mandate delay was minor in the overall scheme of things because it would only reach about 2 percent of businesses nationwide. Brady argued that delaying the employer mandate but not the individual mandate was unfair. “How is it fair that you’ve delayed this law because it’s not workable for businesses of all sizes, but it’s not workable for families?” Brady asked Wednesday. “Why aren’t they getting the same treatment?” On a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokeswoman Julie Bataille said even if officials wanted to, her agency didn’t have the authority to delay the enrollment deadline. \\"We have no plans to extend the open enrollment period,\\" Bataille said. \\"In fact, we don't actually have the statutory authority to extend the open enrollment period in 2014.\\" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) asked Sebelius, who was on that conference call, whether she agreed with that assessment. “I haven’t seen their statements, but there is no delay beyond March 31,” she said. More than 4.2 million people have enrolled in ObamaCare as of March 1. There are less than three weeks left in open enrollment, and it seems increasingly unlikely the administration will hit the original Congressional Budget Office projections of enrolling 7 million people between October and March. That projection was downgraded to 6 million following the early troubles with HealthCare.gov, and officials have sought to temper expectations since the botched rollout essentially shaved two months off the six-month open enrollment period. During Tuesday's conference call with reporters, Bataille was asked repeatedly if the administration expected to hit the 6 million mark. She declined to answer, saying only that the administration expects “millions more” will sign up eventually. Sebelius was similarly vague on Wednesday when pressed by Rep. Jim Renacci (R-Ohio) about what enrollment figure would constitute the rollout being deemed a success. In a September interview, Sebelius said success would be more than 7 million people signing up by March 31. “Success looks like millions of people with affordable health coverage, which we will have by the end of March,” she said at the hearing. ||||| Summary:","output":"Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told the House Ways and Means Committee that health insurance rates are expected to increase as the Affordable Care Act takes full effect.

Answer: No. Justification: A diet of only potatoes and water does not provide all the essential nutrients required for a human to maintain optimal health. While potatoes contain significant amounts of vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrates, they lack various essential nutrients such as certain essential amino acids, B vitamins, and other microelements. Additionally, potatoes lack a sufficient amount of fats and proteins to provide the necessary energy and cellular support needed for proper bodily function. Over the course of an entire year, such a limited diet would lead to nutrient deficiencies and a decline in overall health. Although some individuals have reportedly tried diets of mainly potatoes and water for weight loss in the short term, these cases don't prove the diet's feasibility or sustainability for longer periods, and it is not recommended by medical and nutrition professionals.

The first act of the film revolves around the administrators and officials of Cape Colony, notably the supremely arrogant Lord Chelmsford and the scheming Sir Henry Bartle Frere, who both wish to crush the neighbouring Zulu Empire, which is perceived as a threat to Cape Colony's emerging industrial economy. Bartle Frere issues an impossible ultimatum to the Zulu king, Cetshwayo, demanding that he dissolve the Zulu Empire. Cetshwayo refuses, providing Cape Colony with a pretext to invade Zululand. Despite objections from leading members of Cape Colony's high society and from Great Britain itself, Bartle Frere authorises Lord Chelmsford to lead a British invasion force into Zululand. The rest of the film focuses on the British invasion of Zululand and the lead-up to the Battle of Isandlwana. The invading British army, laden with an immense network of supply wagons, invades Zululand and marches in the direction of Ulundi, the Zulu capital. British forces, eager to fight a large battle in which they can unleash their cutting-edge military technology against the vast Zulu army, become increasingly frustrated as the main Zulu army refuses to attack the British, and fighting is restricted to a few small skirmishes between British and Zulu scouts. Concerned that their supply lines are becoming overstretched and that the main Zulu army is still at large, British troops begin torturing captive Zulu warriors in an effort to learn the location and tactics of the Zulu army. Halfway to Ulundi, Chelmsford halts his army at the base of Mount Isandhlwana, ignoring the advice of Boer attendants to entrench the camp and laager the supply wagons, leaving the camp dangerously exposed.

Roll the pasta dough twice through a standard pasta machine on the number 1 setting. Lay 1 pasta sheet on a work surface and, using a sharp knife, cut the sheet lengthwise into strips 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Roll up the strips into rods. Cut the rods into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. Using a wooden skewer or a thin metal rod (about the diameter of a coat hanger), place the cut pasta onto the skewer and roll it around the skewer into a noodle. Give a gentle twist and pull to remove the skewer and leave a small hole through the pasta.

Then, using a fork, slowly draw the flour into the egg-oil mixture. Continue to incorporate the flour until all of it is combined with the liquid and a shaggy dough has formed. Add more egg-oil mixture if needed to help the dough come together. Once the dough comes together, turn it out of the bowl onto a clean work surface and knead until it is smooth and has nice elasticity (it should spring back immediately when you press it with a fingertip), about 10 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest for 45 minutes before using. 2. Gnocchi \\"Gnocchi will always be on our menu in some fashion. We have a special board on which we roll the finished dumplings to create grooves in which the sauce can catch. For me, making the little potato dumplings is a form of meditation. Everything else falls away.\\" – Michael To make gnocchi: 4 russet potatoes 2 large egg yolks 15 grates fresh nutmeg Kosher salt and freshly cracked pepper 2 cups (10 oz/315 g) 00 flour To make the gnocchi, preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Using a fork, poke holes all over the potatoes. Put them on the oven rack and bake until very tender when pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes. Cut the potatoes open lengthwise across the top and let the steam escape. As soon as they are cool enough to handle, use a large spoon to scoop all of the potato flesh from the skins. Put the still-warm potato flesh in a food mill set over a bowl and turn the crank until all the potato flesh is in the bowl; do this quickly as you don’t want the flesh to cool completely before you make the dough. Using a kitchen scale, weigh out 2 lb (1 kg) of the potato flesh and place in a bowl. Add the egg yolks, nutmeg, a large pinch of salt, and 4 turns pepper and mix well with a wooden spoon or your hands. Add 11⁄2 cups (71⁄2 oz/235 g) of the flour and use your hands to incorporate it gently into the dough. Take care not to over-mix or the gnocchi will be heavy. Add additional flour a tablespoon at a time if the dough seems too wet. On a clean work surface, divide the dough into 4 pieces. Working with 1 dough piece at a time, shape it into a short cylinder. Place the fingers of both hands on the cylinder and roll it back and forth on the clean surface (flour on the surface will make it difficult to roll the cylinders), gradually shifting your hands to the ends, to form a log about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. Make logs out of the remaining 3 dough pieces. Next, using a knife, cut each log into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces. Roll each piece across a gnocchi board to create grooves in which the sauce can collect. If you don’t have a gnocchi board, gently press the tines of a fork into the top surface of each piece of gnocchi. 3. Pappardelle On this wide noodle that stands up to heavier ingredients, Andy says, \\"When I was growing up, my mom made the best pot roast with potatoes and carrots, and this recipe is an homage to that memorable dish. It was a perfect meal during cold-weather months, and I can remember coming indoors from playing football in the front yard and the house would smell like beef stew. Michael wanted to bring out the red wine in the dish, so we decided to start the pasta with wine rather than water.\\" To make red wine pappardelle 4 large eggs Extra-virgin olive oil About 2 cups (16 fl oz/500 ml) dry red wine 8 cups (21⁄2 lb/1.25 kg) 00 flour Semolina flour for dusting Crack the eggs into a large liquid measuring pitcher and add 2 glugs (about 2 tablespoons) of olive oil. Pour the wine into the pitcher until it measures 21∕2 cups (20 fl oz/625 ml) total liquid. Whisk the ingredients together. Put the flour in a bowl and make a well in the center. Pour the wine mixture into the well. Using your hands, work the liquid into the flour until the mixture starts to come together in a ball. Turn the dough ball out onto a clean work surface and knead the dough until it is smooth and has nice elasticity (it should spring back immediately when you press it with a fingertip), about 10 minutes. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. To form the pasta sheets, roll the pasta dough through a standard pasta machine to the number 4 setting. Working with 1 sheet at a time, dust it on both sides with flour and lay it on a work surface. Cut the sheet lengthwise into sections 8 inches (20 cm) long. Using a fluted or straight pasta cutter, cut down the length of the pasta sheet to make noodles about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. Place the noodles, not touching, on a semolina-dusted baking sheet. 4. Malfatti \\"Malfatti means 'poorly made' or 'misshapen.' We like the notion that not all food needs to be perfect to be delicious, so we purposely make our malfatti into slightly different sizes. Our favorite dough for malfatti is made from pumpkin puree, which we make in the fall and winter when we get fresh pumpkins from our local farm.\\" – Michael To make pumpkin malfatti Make the pumpkin malfatti dough as directed. On a clean work surface, divide the dough into 4 pieces. Working with 1 dough piece at a time, and covering the unused portions of the dough with a damp kitchen towel as you work, shape it into a short cylinder. Place the fingers of both hands on the cylinder and roll it back and forth on the work surface, gradually shifting your hands to the ends, to form a log about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. Next, using a knife, cut each log into about 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces. Roll each piece across a gnocchi board to create grooves in which the sauce can collect. If you don’t have a gnocchi board, gently press the tines of a fork into the top surface of each piece of malfatti. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When the water is boiling, drop in the malfatti and cook until they float to the top, then set a kitchen timer and cook for 5 more minutes. – Pumpkin Malfatti Dough Makes about 2 lb (1 kg) 1 cup (8 oz/250 g) pumpkin purée, homemade (page 235) or canned 1 cup (8 oz/250 g) good-quality fresh ricotta cheese 2 large eggs 1⁄4 cup (1 oz/30 g) freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Finely grated zest of 1 orange 12 grates fresh nutmeg Pinch of kosher salt 4 cups (11⁄4 lb/625 g) 00 flour Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. In a large bowl, combine the pumpkin purée, ricotta, eggs, Parmigiano-Reggiano, orange zest, nutmeg, and salt and mix well with a wooden spoon. Add the flour, 1 cup (5 oz/155 g) at a time, and use your hands to incorporate the ingredients until they come together in a ball. The less flour you add, the less dense the dough will be. You’re aiming for a texture that is slightly heavier than potato gnocchi but with a strong pumpkin flavor. 5. Strozzapreti \\"This little pasta has some interesting stories behind it's name, which translates literally to 'priest' stranglers.' Our favorite story is the one about a rotund priest in a small town in Emilia-Romagna who ate the pasta only once a year. Avoiding gluttony was not his strong suit, however, so on that day he would cram as much of the pasta as fast as he could down his gullet until he nearly choked to death. Our version of the dish (with rabbit ragu, pictured above) came from a play on rabbits eating carrots.\\" – Michael To make Strozzapreti Make the carrot-top pasta dough as directed. To form the pasta sheets, roll the pasta dough through a standard pasta machine to the number 4 setting. Working with 1 sheet of pasta at a time, and covering the unused portions of the dough with a damp kitchen towel as you work, cut the sheet lengthwise down the center. Using a sharp knife, cut the sheet crosswise into 1∕2-inch (12-mm) strips. To form the shapes, take 2 of the strips and, using your fingers, pinch them together in the center. Roll them back and forth in the palm of your hand, so that the pieces adhere in the center but the ends are still separate. The finished shapes will resemble a cross between cavatelli (oblong pasta shells) and bow ties. As the strozzapreti are formed, place them, not touching, on a semolina-dusted baking sheet. – Carrot-top pasta dough Makes about 2 lb (1 kg) 12 oz (375 g) carrot tops 8 cups (21⁄2 lb/1.25 kg) 00 flour 4 large egg yolks Extra-virgin olive oil Semolina flour for dusting Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil, add the carrot tops, and blanch just to set the color, about 30 seconds. Plunge the carrot tops into ice water to lock in the color, then drain and transfer to a blender. Add 2 cups (16 fl oz/500 ml) water and purée until smooth. Pour the purée through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring pitcher, add the egg yolks and 3 glugs (about 3 tablespoons) of olive oil, and whisk until blended. Put the flour in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Pour 2 cups of the carrot top–egg mixture into the well. Then, using a fork, slowly draw the flour into the egg mixture. Continue to incorporate the flour until all of it is combined with the liquid and a shaggy dough has formed. Add more carrot top-egg mixture if needed to help the dough come together. Once the dough comes together, turn it out of the bowl onto a clean work surface and knead until it is smooth and has nice elasticity (it should spring back immediately when you press it with a fingertip), about 10 minutes.

These pasta shapes include: 1. Sciatelli: A labor-intensive pasta traditionally shaped with broom bristles, later replaced by metal rods. It is made using a basic pasta dough, which is rolled into rods, cut into pieces, and wrapped around a wooden skewer or thin metal rod. 2. Gnocchi: Small potato dumplings made from russet potatoes, egg yolks, nutmeg, salt, pepper, and 00 flour. The dough is shaped into logs, cut into pieces, and rolled across a gnocchi board or fork to create grooves, making it easier for sauce to be absorbed. 3. Pappardelle: Wide noodles that pair well with heavier ingredients. It is made from a red wine pasta dough and is cut into wide strips using a fluted or straight pasta cutter. 4. Malfatti: Translates to \\"poorly made\\" or \\"misshapen,\\" and is purposely made in slightly different sizes. The pumpkin malfatti dough is made from pumpkin puree, ricotta cheese, eggs, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, orange zest, nutmeg, salt, and 00 flour. 5.

Bland was arrested July 10 after a traffic stop and died three days later in her cell, sparking questions about the manner of her death and outrage. An autopsy found that she died by asphyxiation and that she used a plastic trash bag to hang herself from a partition in her cell. \\"This is being treated like a murder investigation,\\" Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathis said Monday evening. \\"I want fingerprints run. I want...DNA tests run on the trash bag.\\" He also called for \\"any other valid scientific testing that we have so we can say with certainty what happened in her cell.\\" \\"There are too many questions that still need to be resolved,\\" Mathis added. The case is being run by the Texas Rangers and is being supervised by the FBI, Mathis said. But local church pastors say they and Bland’s relatives believe the case should be investigated by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Department of Justice. Her relatives have called for an independent autopsy to be completed as well, with the results expected by Tuesday. The DA's statement about the case came as Capt. Brian Cantrell, of the Waller County Sheriff's Office, gave a more detailed account of what happened after Bland's arrest as their department released three hours of footage from inside the jail. Cantrell said that Bland was taken to Waller County Jail after refusing medical attention on the scene after a confrontation with police. There, she was placed in a cell alone because she was deemed a \\"high risk\\" inmate to the safety of others based on the nature of the charge against her, Cantrell said. On the morning of Monday, July 13, jailers checked on Bland and she said she was \\"fine,\\" according to Cantrell. The jailer also said that she could use a phone that was located in the cell using a PIN number. There were no records of a call being made, Cantrell said. Just before 9 a.m., when jailers returned to see if she wanted to go to the recreation hall, they found her hanging from the privacy portion of her cell. According to Cantrell, they then put her on the ground to administer CPR. Preliminary information from the medical examiner's office indicated that she died from self-inflicted asphyxiation, Cantrell said. \\"The death of Miss Bland was a tragic incident, not one of... criminal intent,\\" Cantrell told reporters. He also expressed the department's \\"sincere condolences\\" for the death. In the wake of the incident, all trash bag liners were removed from the cells at the jail. No jailers have been disciplined as of yet. Dash cam footage of the traffic stop may be released Tuesday, Cantrell said. Mathis said that Bland appeared to be \\"very combative\\" during the traffic stop. \\"It was not a model traffic stop and it was not a model person that was stopped,\\" Mathis told reporters, referring to whether or not Bland was compliant. He noted that the dash cam footage may not clarify what happened because much of the activity takes place in Bland's car, of which there was a limited view. Supporters of Bland, a 28-year-old woman and Black Lives Matter activist who was arrested July 10 and found dead in her cell three days later, said today they have already seen the dash-cam video that they say shows an officer dragging Bland out of her car and chastising her for smoking in her vehicle. \\"She has the right to smoke in her car. That is her right,\\" the Rev. Jamal Harrison Bryant of Baltimore, who has been working to raise awareness of the case, said at a news conference in Texas this morning. Mathis said that the assertion that Bland was pulled out of her car window was untrue.

NBC Chicago's Regina Waldroup reports. (Published Monday, July 20, 2015) Authorities also said dashcam video of Bland's arrest is expected to be released Tuesday. Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathis said Monday the video is consistent with information the officer has provided about the traffic stop. The Texas Department of Public Safety has said Bland was arrested after she allegedly kicked an officer. But Mathis cautioned that the dashcam video shows only restricted views of the stop in Prairie View, Texas. The Chicago-area black woman's death at the Waller County jail in Hempstead, about 60 miles northwest of Houston, comes amid increased national scrutiny of police after a series of high-profile cases in which blacks have been killed by officers. The FBI and the Texas Rangers are investigating. \\"This investigation is still being treated just as it would be a murder investigation,\\" Mathis said. Bland's death been ruled a suicide by the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office, a finding that supporters and relatives dispute. Bland's family and others have called for a Justice Department probe and an independent autopsy. \\"This was not a case of suicide, but homicide,\\" Rev. Jamal Bryant, of the Empowerment Temple AME Church of Baltimore, said earlier Monday. He said he was in Hempstead at the Bland family's request. DPS has said the trooper who stopped Bland violated traffic stop procedures and the department's courtesy policy, but hasn't elaborated further. The trooper is on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. Bland may have been trying to text or email in the moments after she was pulled over for an improper lane change, Mathis said Monday. \\"Sandra Bland was very combative,\\" the district attorney said. \\"It was not a model traffic stop ... and it was not a model person that was stopped on a traffic stop. I think the public can make its own determinations as to the behaviors that are seen in the video.\\" The video from the jail released Monday shows no activity in the hallway leading to Bland's cell for about 90 minutes until an officer goes to check on her. It shows a deputy reacting to what she sees while looking in the cell, triggering a frenzy of activity involving other deputies. An EMT crew arrives with a wheeled stretcher. The video does not show the inside of her cell or even her cell door. Deputies and medical personnel are seen coming and going, but a body isn't visible. Capt. Brian Cantrell, head of the sheriff's department criminal investigation division, said the video was motion sensitive, indicating if nothing is taking place after a certain amount of time, it turns off. He said the FBI has been given hard drives to determine if there's been any manipulation. Cantrell said a guard checked with Bland about two hours before she was found dead and Bland told her, \\"I'm fine.\\" About an hour later, she asked to make a telephone call from her cell and was advised the phone was on a wall in the cell, according to Cantrell. There is no record of her ever making a phone call, he said. Mathis also said jail records show Bland was offered a medical checkup but declined. Cantrell declined to describe Bland's death in detail. He described the plastic garbage bag used as a ligature by extending his hands about 5 to 6 feet apart. The bags, he said, had been approved by a jail inspector, but have since been removed from all cells. Relatives and friends have insisted she was upbeat and looking forward to a new job at Prairie View A&M University, the school where she graduated in 2009. She was in the area to interview for the job and accepted it. Mathis also said the dashcam video doesn't provide a complete view. The trooper's dash cam shows a view forward toward Bland's car, but not inside and not to the side, where she wound up on the ground after authorities said she kicked the officer. \\"It doesn't show how she got on the ground,\\" Cantrell said. Copyright Associated Press / NBC Chicago ||||| HEMPSTEAD, Tex. — The authorities on Monday offered new details of the final hours of the life of a Chicago-area woman who was found hanged in a jail cell in Texas three days after she was arrested during a traffic stop. A Waller County sheriff’s official described a timeline for the jail cell of the woman, Sandra Bland, that started early in the morning of July 13, when she refused a breakfast tray around 6:30 a.m., until a jailer found her hanging shortly after 9 a.m. For about 90 minutes during that period, there was no movement by jail officials in the hallway leading to her cell, according to a video that the authorities released from a camera inside the jail. “This investigation is still being treated just as it would be a murder investigation,” the Waller County district attorney, Elton Mathis, said. He said the case is likely to be turned over to a grand jury expected to be impaneled in August. Mr. Mathis said he expected investigators to release a dashboard camera video of Ms. Bland’s arrest on Tuesday. “There are too many questions that need to be resolved,” Mr. Mathis told reporters, saying that the Bland family “does make valid points” that Ms. Bland seemed to “have a lot of things going on in her life for good.” Capt. Brian Cantrell of the Waller County Sheriff’s Office said that Ms. Bland replied “I’m fine” when a jailer was conducting rounds shortly after 7 a.m. and later inquired about how to make a phone call. But shortly after 9 a.m., a female jailer saw Ms. Bland hanging in her cell and summoned help. Other officers and emergency medical personnel tried unsuccessfully to administer CPR. The death of Ms. Bland has set off protests and calls for a federal investigation from her relatives and supporters, who have sharply disputed the official ruling by the Harris County medical examiner that her death was a suicide. They said Ms. Bland, who was black, was a vocal opponent of police brutality, and they have requested an independent autopsy. United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat, on Monday urged the Justice Department to investigate the death. Photo “Someone’s child died; some young woman died that this family loves, and we owe them an explanation,” Ms. Jackson Lee said in asking Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to begin an inquiry. “I cannot sense under the facts that I know now that a 28-year-old young woman, excited about a new job, posed a threat to anybody in Waller County, including any law enforcement officer.” The Texas Department of Public Safety has said the Texas Rangers and the F.B.I. are also investigating the case. Hempstead, the county seat of Waller County, is about 60 miles northwest of Houston. Ms. Bland had come to the county from her home in Naperville, Ill., for a job at Prairie View A&M; University. Ms. Bland was arrested on July 10 in Waller County by an officer with the Department of Public Safety on a charge of assaulting a public servant. She had been pulled over for failing to signal a lane change.

The authorities said she hanged herself with a plastic bag, resulting in death by self-inflicted asphyxiation. A handful of supporters of Ms. Bland gathered Monday in sweltering midday heat outside the Waller County Sheriff’s Office, which holds the jail cell where she died, continuing a vigil that began last week. Brandi Holmes of Houston held a sign reading, “What happened to Sandy Bland?” Another sign read, “State police profiling — you stopped her for what.” The Rev. David Madison, president of the A.M.E. Ministers Alliance in Houston, said the demonstrators were united behind the calls for a Justice Department investigation. “We’re not accepting the report of death suicide,” said the minister, who is pastor of the Greater Ward A.M.E. Church in Houston. “Sandra Bland had just moved from Chicago to Houston to start a new job. You don’t come all the way to Houston just to kill yourself.” The death has fueled additional tensions over the treatment of African-Americans in police custody and comes roughly three months after the death of Freddie Gray, 25, an unarmed African-American in Baltimore who died from injuries sustained while being transported in a police van. Photo Ms. Jackson Lee was among a bipartisan group of Houston-area officials who were in Hempstead over the week to express concern about the case and meet with members of Ms. Bland’s family. The group included Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican; State Senator Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat; and State Senator Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. |||||","output":"Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old Black Lives Matter activist, was arrested on July 10th after a traffic stop and found dead in her cell three days later. The case is currently being investigated by the Texas Rangers who are receiving supervision from the FBI. However, Bland's relatives and local church pastors believe the investigation should be handled by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Department of Justice. An independent autopsy has also been requested by Bland's family. Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathis has stated that the investigation into Bland's death is being treated like a murder investigation, despite preliminary information indicating suicide. Bland's death has recently been ruled a suicide by the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office, a finding that her supporters and relatives dispute. Investigations continue, and authorities released a three-hour video from a motion-operated camera which showed that there was no activity for 90 minutes in the hallway leading to Bland's cell before she was found. Dashcam footage of Bland's arrest is also expected to be released, although it may only provide restricted views of the traffic stop. The tragic case of Sandra Bland highlights the ongoing issues surrounding police treatment of African-Americans and has sparked further outrage."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following article and select the best answer.

She was the second daughter of Jose Maria Pinto da Cunha (17 February 1887 - 21 June 1938) and Maria Emilia Miranda (10 March 1886, Rio de Janeiro - 9 November 1971). In 1909, when Miranda was ten months old, her father emigrated to Brazil and settled in Rio de Janeiro, where he opened a barber shop. Although Miranda's U.S. popularity continued to increase, she began to lose favor with some Brazilians. On 10 July 1940, she returned to Brazil and was welcomed by cheering fans. Soon after her arrival, however, the Brazilian press began criticizing Miranda for accommodating American commercialism and projecting a negative image of Brazil. Members of the upper class felt that her image was \\"too black\\", and she was criticized in a Brazilian newspaper for \\"singing bad-taste black sambas\\". Other Brazilians criticized Miranda for playing a stereotypical \\"Latina bimbo\\" in her first interview after her arrival in the U.S. In the New York World-Telegram interview, she played up her then-limited knowledge of English language: \\"I say money, money, money. I say twenty words in English. I say money, money, money and I say hot dog!\\" On 15 July, Miranda appeared in a charity concert organized by Brazilian First Lady Darci Vargas and attended by members of Brazil's high society. She greeted the audience in English, and was met with silence. When Miranda began singing \\"The South American Way\\", a song from one of her club acts, the audience began to boo her. Although she tried to finish her act, she gave up and left the stage when the audience continued to boo. The incident deeply hurt Miranda, who wept in her dressing room. The following day, the Brazilian press criticized her as \\"too Americanized\\". Weeks later, Miranda responded to the criticism with the Portuguese song \\"Disseram que Voltei Americanizada\\" (\\"They Say I've Come Back Americanized\\"). Another song, \\"Bananas Is My Business\\", was based on a line from one of her films and directly addressed her image. Upset by the criticism, Miranda did not return to Brazil for fourteen years. Her films were scrutinized by Latin American audiences for characterizing Central and South America in a culturally-homogenous way. When Miranda's films reached Central and South American theaters, they were perceived as depicting Latin American cultures through the lens of American preconceptions. Some Latin Americans felt that their cultures were misrepresented, and felt that someone from their own region was misrepresenting them. Down Argentine Way was criticized, with Argentines saying that it failed to depict Argentine culture. Its lyrics were allegedly replete with non-Argentine themes, and its sets were a fusion of Mexican, Cuban, and Brazilian culture. The film was later banned in Argentina for \\"wrongfully portraying life in Buenos Aires\\". Similar sentiments were voiced in Cuba after the debut of Miranda's Weekend in Havana (1941), with Cuban audiences offended by Miranda's portrayal of a Cuban woman. Reviewers noted that an import from Rio could not accurately portray a woman from Havana, and Miranda did not \\"dance anything Cuban\\". Her performances were arguably hybrids of Brazilian and other Latin cultures. Critics said that Miranda's other films misrepresented Latin locales, assuming that Brazilian culture was a representation of Latin America. did she release any other songs","output":"Yes, Carmen Miranda released numerous other songs throughout her career. As a talented singer and performer, she contributed significantly to the popularization of Brazilian music and culture internationally. Besides the mentioned songs \\"Disseram que Voltei Americanizada\\" (\\"They Say I've Come Back Americanized\\") and \\"Bananas Is My Business,\\" Miranda's repertoire also included notable songs such as \\"Tico-Tico no Fubá,\\" \\"Cuanto Le Gusta,\\" \\"Mamãe Eu Quero,\\" \\"Aquarela do Brasil,\\" and \\"Chica Chica Boom Chic,\\" among many others. These songs were featured in her films, stage performances, and recordings, further solidifying Miranda's status as an influential artist in the entertainment industry."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you will be presented with an English sentence, and you have to translate it into Arabic.

He was the son of Luis Antonio and Balbina Acosta and lived most of his life in his native province far from the limelights of Buenos Aires and the academic world which he sincerely despised in favor of a bucolic and rural setting of his father 's cattle farm in Belén .

The attitude raised a few eyebrows in Buenos Aires and a relevant article was publish in the prestigious magazine Caras y caretas relating the story of this promising young author .

Luckily for Tinseltown's leading ladies, they can rely on expert advice from those whose sole job it is to pick out an outfit that's going to garner headlines for all the right reasons. One stylist shaking things up in Hollywood is Micaela Erlanger, a savvy 29-year-old who has the power to transform actresses from relative obscurity to global style icons. Scroll down for video. Micaela Erlanger (left), a savvy 29-year-old stylist, left, is shaking things up on the red carpet. She began working with Downton Abbey star Michelle Dockery (right) who then introduced her to Lupita Nyong'o. Her work on Lupita Nyong'o is a case in point. When the 12 Years A Slave star stepped out at last year's Oscars in a flowing blue Prada gown, with a slashed yet sophisticated neckline, she became a style icon. Of course, Micaela, whose first client was Joely Richardson for the Anonymous and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo press tours, was behind the look. Micaela and Lupita were introduced by another stylish screen star; Michelle Dockery. Lupita was a little-known Kenyan actress working on movie Non-Stop with Michelle, who said to her: ‘When you’re ready, I have the perfect stylist for you.' The rest was history. Michaela helped transform the red carpet, which, in the late 90s, was awash with prom dresses loved by Gwyneth Paltrow and the Princess look, as championed by Penelope Cruz. Michelle Dockery, resplendent in Rosie Assoulin, met Micaela through her make-up artist. When the 12 Years A Slave star Lupita Nyong'o stepped out at last year's Oscars, left, in a flowing blue Prada gown, with a slashed yet sophisticated neckline, she became a muse. Her red Ralph Lauren gown at last year's Golden Globes was also exquisite. Lupita Nyong'o looking chic in a Giambattista Valli couture dress at the Marie Claire Fresh Faces Party in 2014, left, and pushing the style boundaries in Prada at last year's MET Ball. The 31-year-old actress's striking minimalist style curated by Micaela has had the fashion world buzzing. Hits have included her silk Prada jersey maxidress with ethereal gold lattice embroidery at the Toronto Film Festival for the premiere of 12 Years A Slave. Her striking red Ralph Lauren number from the Golden Globes was simple yet stunning, while her punky Chanel gown at the MTV Movie Awards showed her ability to experiment with trends. Manhattan-born, Connecticut-raised Micaela, who studied at Parsons the New School for Design, turns to trusted and classic designers, such as Carolina Herrera, great Hollywood couturier Valentina and Chanel but works to pick a dress that reflects her client's personality and tastes. Lupita, for example, landed on every glossy magazine's best-dressed list thanks to her fresh, modern, and compellingly confident style; Micaela helps her take risks but in a wearable way. According to Vanity Fair, Micaela, who began working for the late Annabel Tollman, who was known for styling Scarlett Johansson, creates private Pinterest boards for each client. Here, as well as via text, she shares her ideas with them and what looks and styles she thinks would suit them. 'It's a conversation, a collaboration, down to a T,' she said of the process. Michelle Dockery, left, in a form-fitting Barbara Casasola dress at the Lovegold lunch last January, and, right, at 2013's Emmy Awards in a two-tone Prada gown in ruby-red satin and burgundy silk. 'We're always looking to tell a story through image. In some ways, I almost feel that the red carpet is the runway now and it’s up to, in some part, the talented actors and actresses that walk that red carpet to show the world what fashion can be.' Speaking about Micaela's influence on the red carpet, Lydia Jones, founder of wantherwardrobe.com, said: 'Micaela is what every A-lister wants in their life: a friend, fashion insider and super stylist all tied into one. 'She has all the best designers - both established and budding - on speed dial and actually takes the time to get to know her clients and figure out what works for them. She turns to fashion-insider favorites, such as Suno, power players like Prada and fledgling designers such as Rosie Assoulin, who Michelle Dockery looks phenomenal in.' Micaela, pictured with Olivia Munn, creates private Pinterest boards for each client and shares her ideas with them. Micaela, who studied at Parsons the New School for Design, turns to trusted and classic designers when dressing her clients. Micaela won't be the only stylist working overtime around awards season - and it seems most stars have a go-to fashion expert on speed dial. Elizabeth Olsen's on-trend red carpet style has often impressed the fashion pack. But the American Godzilla actress revealed it is thanks to no natural flair of her own. The 25-year-old admitted she was forced to seek the services of Cher Coulter, a celebrity stylist, in order to keep up with the fashionable Hollywood starlets that surround her when she first started out. The younger sister of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen told The Hollywood Reporter: 'There's no way you can figure it all out, especially when you are working on films. You literally have to use a stylist. 'Whatever you wear is like a huge statement out to the world so you have to have someone help you figure it all out.' Red carpet fashion in the 90s was a whole different story, as proved by Kim Basinger, left, in mint green Escada at the 1998 Oscars and Helena Bonham Carter, right, in an off-pink prom-esque gown at the same event. Gwyneth Paltrow in a candy coloured prom gown as she arrives for the 71st annual Academy Awards in 1999, left, and Uma Thurman at the same event. Fast-forward to 2007 and the red carpet was still all about feathers, drama and show-stopping gowns. The actress added that she 'had no clue' what to wear when she began making public appearances. She said: 'I didn't even like to wear dresses to begin with.' It wasn't until the late 1980s that the 'stylist' was born, with Giorgio Armani being hailed as the gamechanger. He dressed A-listers such as Julia Robers and Jodie Foster in his designs and others began to follow suit. The classic silhouettes of the Nineties were the strapless mermaid look, and the waisted ball gown, loved by Gwyneth Paltrow. Retro glamour was the order of the day but now, stars want to stand out from the crowd and are opting for more spontaenous and somewhat risque designs. Luckily for today's stars, red carpet fashion has come a long way since the 90s. Gone are the days when stars - Cate Blanchett (left, at the Golden Globes in 1999 and, Jennifer Aniston in 2003) - played it safe in black. Cher, left, at the Oscars in 1988, right, Celine Dion in a white tuxedo backwards to the Oscars in 1999. There are, of course, moments in red carpet history that will go down as game changers. Remember when Cher wore her barely-there Bob Mackie gown to pick up her Best Actress Oscar in 1988? Or when Celine Dion chose to wear a white tuxedo backwards to the Oscars in 1999? These moments of true individuality have, ultimately, paved the way for new stars to be able to express themselves on red carpets the world over. Now, we are all a little disappointed if Jennifer Aniston just wears black, or if Reese Witherspoon chooses another strapless number. We want more from our celebrities. And thanks to the efforts of designers, a lot of whom create up to six collections a year, there are thousands of bold, unique, and sometimes hand-embellished couture dresses to pick from. A prom-style dress, or something that is 'old school' (and not in a good way), won't cut it anymore. Stars such as Tilda Swinton, Kate Hudson, Julianne Moore and Lupita are very much led by creative stylists who push boundaries. And it has made the world a much brighter place, fashion-wise. Stars like Kate Hudson, left, at the Oscars 2014, and Julianne Moore, right, at the Golden Globes, are very much led by creative stylists who push boundaries, shunning standard black dresses for more daring cuts and textures. The more extreme dressers, like Lady Gaga and Rihanna, are pushing the envelope even further, often championing new and emerging designers; something we wouldn't have seen years ago. And we mustn't forget the late, great Joan Rivers - the one fearless, say-what-she-thought red carpet critic who single-handily turned red carpets into a thing to be watched by the whole world. Speaking about the shift, celebrity dresser and HTC selfie stylist, Alexis Knox, who has worked with the likes of Miley Cyrus and Rita Ora, said: 'Red carpet style makes me so happy because it's not necessarily about sticking strictly to trends but more about wearing what you love and letting it be an extension of your personality. 'We've seen everything from tuxedos to top and skirt combos and while I think it's important to dress appropriately, you only get one shot on the red carpet so you may as well maximise your experience through your outfit. Getting ready is half the fun!'. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Awards season is a time when famous people wear nice clothes on a red carpet. They do this with the help of special helpers called stylists. One stylist is named Micaela Erlanger, and she helps actresses look really good in their outfits.

Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.","output":"The last name of the person you are referring to is Thomson.

Question: The black hole has much more mass than the star so it also has (A) stronger gravity (B) weaker gravity Answer:","output":"A) Stronger gravity In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences between a black hole and a star, and to explain why a black hole has a stronger gravitational pull compared to a star, let's dive deeper into the nature of black holes and stars, as well as the concept of gravity in astrophysics. A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. They are formed when a massive star collapses on itself after reaching the end of its life cycle. The mass of the star results in such an intense gravitational force that it overcomes the internal pressure and fusion processes that were maintaining its structure. Once it reaches this critical point, there is no force that can counteract the powerful gravity, which causes the star to contract and collapse into a single point known as a singularity. At this point, the density becomes infinite and the gravitational pull is immeasurably strong. On the other hand, a star is a massive, luminous sphere of plasma held together by gravity. The gravity of the star results from its mass, and it’s the force that keeps the star together. Stars generate energy through nuclear fusion in their cores, converting light elements such as hydrogen into heavier elements like helium. The fusion process releases vast amounts of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light. The outward pressure from this energy balances the inward force of gravity, allowing the star to maintain a stable size and structure. Gravity, in general, is the force that attracts two objects with mass. In astrophysics, it plays a crucial role for celestial bodies like black holes and stars. The gravitational force between two objects depends on two factors: the mass of each object and the distance between their centers. The greater the mass of the objects and the closer they are, the stronger the gravitational force between them. This can be described using the formula: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between their centers. Now, let's compare the gravitational pull of a black hole and a star. Considering that black holes have much more mass than stars and typically occupy a significantly smaller volume of space, it's apparent that their gravitational pull will be stronger. In fact, the gravitational force near the event horizon, which is the boundary of a black hole beyond which nothing can escape, is so incredibly strong that not even light can overcome it. This is what leads to the defining characteristic of a black hole: its ability to trap everything, including light, once it passes the event horizon. In contrast, a star, although massive, has a more widely distributed mass, and the fusion processes taking place inside generate an outward pressure that balances the inward pull of gravity. While stars exert a strong gravitational force, it is not nearly as strong as the gravity of a black hole. In summary, a black hole has a stronger gravitational pull (A) compared to a star due to its immense mass concentrated in an extremely small volume, resulting in incredibly dense and powerful gravitational forces. While stars also exert gravitational forces, these are considerably weaker and counteracted by the fusion processes generating energy within them."},{"instruction":"Question: Read the article and select the best answer.

People sometimes describe grammar as the \\"rules\\" of a language; but in fact no language has rules. If we use the word \\"rules\\", we suggest that somebody created the rules first and then spoke the language, like a new game. But languages did not start like that. Languages started by people making sounds which evolved into words, phrases and sentences. No commonly-spoken language is fixed. All languages change over time. What we call \\"grammar\\" is simply a reflection of a language at a particular time. Do we need to study grammar to learn a language? The short answer is \\"no\\". Very many people in the world speak their own, native language without having studied its grammar. Children start to speak before they even know the word\\"grammar\\". But if you are serious about learning a foreign language, the long answer is \\"yes, grammar can help you to learn a language more quickly and more efficiently.\\" It's important to think of grammar as something that can help you, like a friend. When you understand the grammar (or system) of a language, you can understand many things yourself, without having to ask a teacher or look in a book.

Determine the following: a) The time it takes for the rocket to reach its maximum height. b) The maximum height reached by the rocket. c) The horizontal range (the distance traveled horizontally by the rocket before it lands). d) The time it takes for the rocket to land from the moment it is launched. e) The velocity components (in horizontal and vertical directions) just before the rocket lands. Use appropriate equations of motion and the given information to solve this problem. Assume the effects of air resistance are negligible, and take the acceleration due to gravity (g) as 9.81 m/s². Detailed Answer: First, we need to resolve the given initial velocity into horizontal (Vx) and vertical (Vy) components using the angle of projection (60 degrees). Vx = 80 * cos(60°) = 40 m/s (constant throughout the motion) Vy = 80 * sin(60°) = 69.28 m/s (at t=0) a) To find the time taken (t) to reach maximum height, we can use the following equation to find the time when the vertical velocity is zero (Vy = 0). Vy = u - g*t 0 = 69.28 - 9.81*t t = 69.28/9.81 = 7.07 seconds b) To find the maximum height (H), we can use the following equation: H = Vy² / (2 * g) H = (69.28)² / (2 * 9.81) = 245.03 m c) To find the horizontal range (R), we first need to determine the total time of flight (T) and then use the constant horizontal velocity (Vx) to calculate the range. For total time of flight (T), we can use the following equation: Vy = u - gT 0 = -69.28 - (-9.81 * T) T = 14.14 seconds Then, calculate the horizontal range (R) using: R = Vx * T = 40 * 14.14 = 565.67 m d) The time it takes for the rocket to land from the moment it is launched is equal to the total time of flight, which is calculated in c). So, T = 14.14 seconds. e) The velocity components just before the rocket lands can be found using the equations of motion: Horizontal velocity component (Vx) remains constant: Vx = 40 m/s Vertical velocity component (Vy) just before landing can be calculated using: Vy = u - gt Vy = 69.28 - (9.81 * 14.14) = -69.28 m/s (negative indicates downward direction) Thus, the final velocity components just before the rocket lands are Vx = 40 m/s (horizontal) and Vy = -69.28 m/s (vertical)."},{"instruction":"Read the bio below and try to give details on joseph gillespie 's: - profession - state house - state senate - death date - party - district - term end - birth date - term start - name - death place - birth place Bio: joseph gillespie -lrb- august 22 , 1809 -- january 7 , 1885 -rrb- was an american politician from new york . moving with his family to illinois at a young age , gillespie fought in the black hawk war before studying law at transylvania university . upon graduation , he was elected to a two-year term in the illinois house of representatives , where he once jumped out of a window with abraham lincoln to stop a quorum . he was elected to the illinois senate in 1846 , serving for twelve years . he was a founder of the illinois republican party and served on the illinois circuit courts for twelve years .

Continue the pattern like this. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! In more detail, this knitting instruction can be broken down into the following steps: 1. Begin the row by knitting 5 band stitches in garter stitch. Garter stitch is achieved by knitting every row, resulting in a fabric with a subtle texture that is the same on both sides. 2. Next, knit 1 stitch in stocking stitch. Stocking stitch, also known as stockinette stitch, is created by alternating knit and purl rows. On the right side, you will have knit stitches, and on the wrong side, you will have purl stitches. 3. Then, follow the diagram M.1A as specified in your knitting pattern until 11 stitches remain on the needle. The M.1A diagram will provide visual information about the stitch pattern you need to follow, including which stitches should be knits, purls, increases, or decreases. Ensure that you follow the diagram closely for the best results. 4. After completing the M.1A diagram, finish the row with the diagram M.1B. This diagram will include 6 stitches to complement the design established in M.1A. 5. Finally, knit the last 5 stitches in garter stitch again, completing the row. 6. Continue this pattern as described above for subsequent rows. Be sure to maintain consistency in your knitting tension throughout the project. Proper knitting tension will ensure that your final piece is even, well-shaped, and matches the desired measurements specified in your pattern. Remember, as you work on your knitting project, it's essential to consistently check your gauge and tension, especially if the pattern has specific size requirements. Maintaining an even tension throughout will result in a beautiful, finished piece that matches the original design. Happy knitting!"},{"instruction":"Translate \\"In this way a new blood feud would be established, and Ruathain might once again offer cattle and ponies to halt it.\\" to Czech?","output":"\\"Tímto způsobem by se mohl vytvořit nový krevní spor a Ruathain by mohl znovu nabídnout dobytek a poníky, aby jej zastavil.\\" In order to provide the most accurate translation, I've split the English sentence into several parts: \\"In this way\\" translates to \\"Tímto způsobem\\" in Czech. \\"A new blood feud would be established\\" translates to \\"Mohl by se vytvořit nový krevní spor\\". \\"And Ruathain might once again\\" translates to \\"a Ruathain by mohl znovu\\". \\"Offer cattle and ponies to halt it\\" translates to \\"nabídnout dobytek a poníky, aby jej zastavil.\\" When put together, the sentence reads: \\"Tímto způsobem by se mohl vytvořit nový krevní spor, a Ruathain by mohl znovu nabídnout dobytek a poníky, aby jej zastavil.\\" Note that Czech, like many other languages, has a flexible word order and is highly inflected, meaning that word endings change based on their grammatical role in the sentence.

The bigger the tire, the better, up to a point. While you want plenty of room for kids to sit in the tire, a really huge tire will be especially heavy and may weight too much for a standard tree branch. Use your good judgement about the perfect balance between size and weight for your specific branch. Give your tire a good wash down with heavy duty detergent, scrubbing all of the exterior surface and rinsing the inside as well. If a dirty tire cleans up well, then it should be okay to use. Use WD40 or a tire cleaning product to remove stubborn grease spots. People will be sitting on this tire, so the more gunk you remove, the better. Be sure to get any cleaner residue off as well! The tree branch itself should be thick and sturdy, around 10 inches (25cm) diameter minimum. Be sure the tree is large and healthy, with no signs of weaknesses that might indicate the tree is unstable. An isolated Maple or Oak tree usually works best. The branch you choose will impact the length of rope you'll need. Good dimensions for a tire swing branch are about 9 feet (2.7 meters) from the solid tree branch to the ground. The branch should stick out away from the tree far enough that when you hang your tire swing off of it, the swing will not immediately hit the trunk of the tree. While you don't want to place your tire swing out at the very end of a branch, you can't attach it within a few feet of the trunk. The higher the tree branch, the higher the tire swing will swing. So, if you are making a tire swing for a small child, you may want to chose a branch that is lower to the ground. Obtain about 50 feet (15.2 meters) of rope. It should be quality rope that won't fray or break when weight is applied to it. There are a variety of ropes you can use for your tire swing, such as heavy duty climbing ropes or utility rope, but you can also use chain if you like. On a simple tire swing galvanized chain will last longer but rope is easier to handle, will potentially do less damage to the tree branch, and is easier to hold onto for kids. As well as quality rope, fraying can be prevented by the application of tubing down the length of the rope where fraying is most likely (wherever it comes into contact with the tree, the tire, and hands). Since this will be left in the rain, water will accumulate inside the tire if left solid. To avoid any accumulated water, drill three holes in the tire at what will become its base. Be careful when drilling through your tire. There may be metal strands on the inside of the tire, which you may hit with your drill bit. Just be prepared that you may hit a different layer while drilling through. Be sure to position the ladder safely so that you don't topple off it. Having a friend hold it steady as you climb is a wise precaution. If you don't have a ladder, you will need to find another way of getting the rope over the branch. Find a roll of duct tape or something of equivalent weight and tie it too the end of the rope. Then throw the duct tape over the branch, so that the rope is now looped over the branch. Once the rope is looped over the branch, untie the duct tape or whatever you used as weight for the end of the rope. Position the rope so that it won't be rubbed by knots or imperfections on the branch. You may want to wrap the rope around the branch a few times, just to make sure it stays in place. If you bought tubing, this part of the rope should have anti-fray tubing at either side of it (where it rests on the branch). (Do not use a square knot. Square knots were designed as a first-aid knot. If you pull backwards on either lose end, it will fall apart.) Make sure that the knot is solid. If you can't figure out how to make one, find someone who can. If you have looped the rope over the branch from the ground, you will have to tie a slip knot from the ground and then tighten it up, so that it cinches up at the branch. Again, use a square knot to secure the rope around the top of the tire. Before you make your knot, judge how far you would like the tire to be off the ground. The tire should clear any obstacles on the ground and should be high enough so that your child's legs don't drag on the ground, so it should be at least a foot off the ground. On the other hand, it shouldn't be so high that your child can't get into it on their own. Be sure that the tire is at this height when you secure the knot. Remember to keep the drainage holes at the bottom, with the top of the tire opposite the side with the holes. Tie the tail of the rope up, so that it will not accidentally get in the way or come undone. Add mulch or dig over the ground to make it a softer surface for landing when jumping (or falling) off the tire swing. Check that the swing is sitting well for swinging. Before allowing others on the swing, test your handiwork with a spotter nearby in case anything goes wrong. If it works well, you, and your kids, are ready to start swinging.","output":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a tire swing. Key points include choosing a large, healthy tree with a sturdy branch, selecting the right size and weight for the tire, and cleaning the tire thoroughly before use. Use quality rope or chain to hang the tire and drill drainage holes at its base to avoid water accumulation. Make sure to position the tire at an appropriate height off the ground and secure it with strong knots.

Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. Ned runs up one flight of stairs in 11 seconds. 2. There are 20 flights of stairs to the top floor. 3. Ned has spent 165 seconds running so far. 4. The time bomb has 72 seconds left on the timer. First, let's figure out how many flights of stairs Ned has already climbed: 165 seconds spent / 11 seconds per flight = 15 flights of stairs So, Ned has climbed 15 flights of stairs already, meaning he has 5 flights left to reach the top floor: 20 total flights - 15 flights climbed = 5 flights remaining Now, let's determine how much longer it will take Ned to reach the bomb by calculating the time needed to climb the remaining flights: 5 flights remaining * 11 seconds per flight = 55 seconds Now, we know that Ned will spend another 55 seconds to reach the bomb. Let's compare the time remaining on the bomb with the time Ned needs to reach it: 72 seconds left on the timer - 55 seconds needed to reach the bomb = 17 seconds So, when Ned reaches the bomb, he will have 17 seconds left to deactivate it."},{"instruction":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

On the positive side, the app boasts seamless integration with other Google services, allowing for a more convenient and user-friendly experience. It also provides reliable location services, which I have found to be pretty accurate most of the time. However, there are a few drawbacks that make me give this app a 3-star rating. First and foremost, the app can be quite demanding in terms of battery usage. My phone's battery seems to drain faster when using this app, especially when utilizing location services and background updates. A focus on optimizing battery consumption would be a great improvement. Another issue I've encountered is that the app occasionally crashes or freezes, causing disruptions in my user experience. While this may not happen to every user, and it doesn't occur constantly, these crashes prevent me from fully enjoying the app and its benefits. Lastly, the app updates seem to cause some issues every now and then. Some updates result in temporary functionality problems or even slow down my device, though this tends to be resolved in subsequent updates. In conclusion, the com.google.android.gms app offers a solid set of features and services but could use some optimization. With better battery consumption, stability improvements, and more reliable updates, I believe this app can become a top-notch service for Android users."},{"instruction":"My mother's shopping lists were ordered by rules known only to her. As you slid your finger down the columns of groceries and toiletries, you would invariably be stopped by something along the lines of \\"2dozjumHerbal Essences\\" or \\"1pepperoni TC,\\" with the \\"TC\\" underlined twice and flanked by gnarled masses of pencil scratch-outs. When we were kids, we dreaded accompanying her to Wal-Mart, or worse, the Cosco at the edge of town, where the echoing rafters and limitless aisles seemed to mock the confusion into which we were inevitably thrown when handed torn-off fragments of the list. Of course, it was easy enough to see in hindsight that \\"2dozjumHerbal Essences\\" was merely the bastard child of two drunkenly weaving columns--we had been supposed to get two dozen jumbo eggs and a bottle of my mother's favourite brand of shampoo (ever inventive in creating proprietary abbreviations--\\"TC\\" standing for, what else, thin crust pizza--my mother scrupulously wrote out brand names in full). It was a little like ordering chemicals for a laboratory, sans any knowledge of chemistry--or, for that matter, laboratories, although my ignorance of the distinction between baking soda and baking powder cannot be entirely the root of my confusion. Eventually I--and my siblings--learned the difference between tomato paste and tomato sauce, and could readily distinguish one brand of laundry detergent from a similarly-styled knock-off, but my shame-faced trips back to the mothercart never ceased. I would track her down, most often in the produce section--she was usually loath to trust us with the delicate task of selecting the very best fruits and vegetables--and hand her back my portion of the list, asking for an explanation.

However, I will elaborate on each of the options to provide a fuller understanding of the author's perspective. 1. Disorganized: The author does describe the shopping list as being chaotic and hard to follow, with columns weaving in and out. This disorganization contributes to the difficulty of interpreting the list and can lead to confusion. 2. Confusing because of bad handwriting: Although the author does not specifically mention bad handwriting as a cause of confusion, the description of \\"gnarled masses of pencil scratch-outs\\" suggests that the writing could be difficult to read at times. This could contribute to the overall confusion in understanding the list. 3. Confusing because of the weird abbreviations: This factor is explicitly mentioned by the author as a significant source of confusion. The mother uses proprietary abbreviations, such as \\"TC\\" for thin crust pizza, which are not obvious to others. This forces the author to ask her for clarification on multiple occasions, adding to the confusing nature of shopping with the list. 4. Not enough information: This option is not directly stated by the author, but it can be inferred from the context. For example, when mentioning the kind of soap to get, the mother expects them to just know what they usually get without providing more information on the list. In conclusion, the author seems to consider their mother's shopping list confusing due to a blend of factors, including disorganization, potentially bad handwriting, the use of weird abbreviations, and a lack of specific information. These elements combined make it challenging for the author to accurately follow and comprehend the list when shopping."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: What would a paper be if the typing on the paper was made using foreign characters?

To answer this question, let's analyze each step of the mold formation process and explain the reasoning: 1. A mold spore floats through the air: The presence of more mold colonies increases the number of spores in the air, potentially increasing the chances of spores landing on bread. This is an indirect impact on this step of the process. 2. The spore lands on a piece of bread: The likelihood of a spore landing on a bread is affected by the number of spores in the air. With more mold colonies, more spores are present, increasing the chances of this happening. This is an indirect impact on this step of the process. 3. The spore grows hyphae into the bread: This step does not depend on the presence of other mold colonies, so it would not be directly or indirectly affected. 4. The mold forms a colony: The formation of more mold colonies on the bread has an indirect impact on this step, as more nutrients may be consumed by the existing mold, making it harder for new colonies to grow. 5. Sporangiophores grow upward: This step is not directly or indirectly affected by the presence of more colonies. 6. The mold sends out spores: More mold colonies will generate more spores, which will indirectly impact the chances of more mold forming on other pieces of bread. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the supposed perturbation of more colonies of mold forming on the bread would indirectly impact a step of the process. This is because the presence of more mold colonies would increase the amount of spores in the air and consume more nutrients, making it harder for new colonies to grow and indirectly affecting the spore landing and colony formation steps."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given two sentences(Sentence1 and Sentence2).

When a construction crew destroys a small wilderness area near the Alden home, Amy finds a nest of goose eggs. Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David (Terry Kinney) knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her fatherâs old barn to incubate. When the eggs have hatched, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local game warden Glen Seifert (Jeremy Ratchford) on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have imprinted on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that all domestic geese must have their wings pinioned (clipped) to render them flightless, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them. Thomas decides to use an ultralight aircraft to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry (Holter Graham), Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own, so she can teach the geese. David mentions knowing someone running a bird sanctuary in North Carolina, and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary. The birds have to arrive before November 1, or the sanctuary will be torn down by developers who plan to turn it into a coastal housing development.

Rinse off and scrape away any large food particles from the dishes, utensils, pots, and pans before loading them into the dishwasher. This helps ensure that the dishwasher can clean items effectively without getting clogged by food debris. 2. Load glasses and plastic wear on the top rack. Be sure to arrange them securely and upside-down, so they don't collect water when the dishwasher goes through its cycle. Plastic items are better suited for the top rack since the heating element on the bottom can cause plastics to warp. 3. Put plates, bowls, pots, and pans on the bottom rack. Make sure they are evenly spaced and not touching, as they need enough room for water and detergent to reach all surfaces. Place larger items like pots and pans at the sides or back of the bottom rack, so they don't block water spray. 4. Place all the utensils in the utensil basket. Separate knives, forks, and spoons to ensure that water and detergent can clean them well. Put sharp knives with the blade facing downward for safety reasons. 5. Put detergent into the detergent holder. Use the amount recommended by the dishwasher manufacturer or detergent instructions, as using too much or too little can affect cleaning performance. 6. Close the dishwasher door and make sure it is securely latched. This prevents water from leaking out during the washing cycle. 7. Push the start button or select the desired wash cycle, depending on your dishwasher model. Different cycles have varying degrees of cleaning strength, water usage, and duration. Choose the appropriate cycle based on the level of soil and type of items being washed. After following these steps, allow the dishwasher to complete its cycle, and then carefully unload and put away your clean dishes."},{"instruction":"Sauvignon Blanc - the white wine that smells of gooseberries - is Britain's favourite plonk, according to new research.

The Purdue Greek system, also known as the collection of fraternities and sororities at Purdue University, is a significantly large and thriving part of the campus life. Purdue University has over 80 fraternities and sororities in West Lafayette, Indiana. Collectively, these organizations are referred to as the Purdue Greek Life. Fraternities and sororities provide a support system and foster growth and development for students. They focus on academics, leadership, and community service, while also offering a sense of belonging and camaraderie among the members. The Purdue Greek community encompasses a diverse group of fraternities and sororities, which are divided into four main councils: 1. Interfraternity Council (IFC): This council represents the majority of traditional men's fraternities on Purdue's campus. Around 40 fraternities are a part of this council. 2. Panhellenic Association (PHA): This council coordinates the activities of 22 women's sororities at Purdue University, ensuring the efficient and fair management of member sororities. 3. National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC): It consists of nine historically African-American fraternities and sororities, of which six are present at Purdue. They are committed to community service and the promotion of unity among their members. 4. Multicultural Greek Council (MGC): This council comprises various culturally-based fraternities and sororities. At Purdue, the MGC has about 12 member organizations that promote cultural diversity, academic achievement, and community service. While the exact number of students involved in Greek life at Purdue can vary from year to year, it is estimated that around 20% of undergraduates are members of fraternities and sororities. This accounts for a significant portion of the campus population and demonstrates the size of the Purdue Greek system, which is an important aspect of the overall Purdue University experience."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Now, at age 20,I have a good job and a nice house, and I'm really proud of the independence I've achieved. Here's the problem: several of my friends who still live with their parents wish they had places like mine -- so much so that they make mine theirs. It started out with a couple of them spending the weekends with me. But now they seem to take it for granted that they can shou up any time they like. They bring boyfriends over, talk on the phone and stay out forever. I enjoy having my friends here sometimes-- it makes the place feel comfortable and warm-- but this is my home, not a party house. I was old enough to move out on my own, so why can't I seem to ask my friends to respect my privacy ?

Article: If California were not already so famous for Sillicon Valley and Hollywood, it might be well-known for the groups of water-technology firms in its San Diego County. The reverse-osmosis (RO) spiral module, the technique that supports turning seawater and waste-water into drinkable stuff, began in San Diego in 1964. Today dozens of firms in the area supply many of the world's approximately 13,000 RO plants in places from the Persian Gulf and Israel to Australia and China. Southern California itself, however, has not so far been a big user of its own technology. This is surprising, given that the whole American south-west faces a water problem. But now as the climate gets warmer and the population increases, there is more agreement that the existing infrastructure, consisting of vast pipes that carry water from the Sacramento Delta in the north and the Colorado River in the east, will not be enough. In places such as San Diego, which has inadequate and salty groundwater and currently imports 90% or its water, the answers must be greater conservation, reusing as much water as possible, and getting most of the rest from the sea. The first part, conservation, has been widely accepted by the public. San Diego today uses less water with a larger population than it did in 1989, the year water consumption peaked. The second part, water recycling has been a hard sell, because of an unpleasant factor. Americans still use the term \\"toilet-to-tap\\" for recycling, even though properly treated waste-water is nowadays completely clean. Singapore made its programme acceptable in part by renaming it as NEWater. This is where desalination comes in, which means taking the salt out of salt water. A firm called Poseidon Resources is now close to building the biggest desalination plant in America behind a power station by the beach in Carlsbad. The power plant sucks in 304m gallons of seawater a day for cooling, so Poseidon plans to change 104m gallons a day by using the RO spiral module. Lots of people like the idea. Once fully...

Introduction Throughout history, treaties have been utilized as instruments for establishing alliances, ending wars, defining territories, and resolving disputes between nations. They often involve agreements between sovereign states or international organizations to ensure cooperation, enforcement of rules, and fostering of peace. In this article, we will examine some notable treaties signed in history and understand the key players involved in these agreements. Step 1: Choose treaties to discuss To provide a comprehensive picture, we will discuss four significant treaties spanning different time periods and regions. 1. Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) 2. Treaty of Westphalia (1648) 3. Treaty of Paris (1783) 4. United Nations Charter (1945) Step 2: Explore the historical context of each treaty Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) In the wake of the Age of Discovery, European powers were scrambling to explore and conquer newly discovered territories. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed by Spain and Portugal to divide the New World between the two nations. The agreement, mediated by Pope Alexander VI, established a meridian line that would determine the spheres of influence for each nation. Who signed the treaty? - Spain: King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I - Portugal: King John II Peace of Westphalia (1648) The Peace of Westphalia was a series of treaties that marked the end of the Thirty Years' War in the Holy Roman Empire and the Eighty Years' War between the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Empire. The treaties established the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention in domestic affairs, creating the foundation of the modern international system. Who signed the treaties? - Representatives of more than 100 European polities, including the Holy Roman Empire, France, Sweden, and various German states. Treaty of Paris (1783) The Treaty of Paris ended the American Revolutionary War. The agreement recognized the independence of the United States and established the boundaries between the new nation and the remaining British North American territories. Who signed the treaty? - United States: Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and John Jay - Britain: David Hartley, King George III's representative United Nations Charter (1945) Signed in the aftermath of World War II, the United Nations Charter established the United Nations (UN) as an international organization to promote peace, security, and cooperation among nations. Who signed the charter? - The charter was signed by 50 of the 51 founding member countries of the UN. Poland, which was absent at the conference, later signed the charter on October 15, 1945. Conclusion Treaties play a vital role in shaping global relations, with numerous milestones marking significant points in our collective history. The Treaty of Tordesillas, Peace of Westphalia, Treaty of Paris, and United Nations Charter are just a few examples of the countless treaties negotiated by historical figures and nations. Understanding the context and key players involved in these agreements provides insight into the critical role treaties have had in shaping the world we live in today."},{"instruction":"1.

Having heard positive things about The Bistro, my expectations were heightened. Unfortunately, it turned out to be an absolutely dreadful and utterly disappointing experience from the moment we stepped in. First, we arrived on time for our reservation, but the hostess couldn't find the booking. Surely, that seemed like a trivial hiccup, but standing at the entrance waiting for an available table for over 30 minutes was disheartening. The lack of organization set a sour tone for the night ahead. When we were finally seated, we noticed that the table was sticky and dirty. I understand that restaurants can be busy, but basic hygiene expectations were completely neglected. Our seats were also ripped and uncomfortable, which made it harder to get settled. The ambiance was lacking. The dimly-lit room with outdated décor immediately gave off an uninviting and eerie vibe. In addition, the noise level was unbearable, making it impossible to have a conversation with my party. We assumed this was due to the over-packed room and lack of thought put into the establishment's acoustics. Our server finally appeared, rather unenthusiastically, to take our drink and food orders. It took ages to get our drinks, but we were somewhat appeased when they arrived until we realized that one of them was incorrect. Our server eventually replaced it after grumbling under her breath without so much as an apology. Now, let's talk about the food. Despite the attractive menu descriptions, the so-called culinary masterpieces were lackluster at best. The appetizers were served lukewarm, and the presentation was messy. The mains arrived with no synchronization as some guests received their meals five minutes after others—a clear sign of disarray in the kitchen. My seafood pasta was overcooked and drowning in a bland sauce. My friend's steak was undercooked, and the side portions were minimal, leaving us hungry for something more fulfilling. Throughout the evening, we received inadequate service. Our server was disinterested, inattentive, and left us feeling like a burden. Every request—whether for a glass of water or ketchup—took an unreasonable amount of time to fulfill. Plus, we were completely taken aback by the exorbitant surcharge tacked on to our bill for the poor quality food and service we received. In conclusion, this was an appalling dining experience at The Bistro. From incompetent customer service to subpar food and an uncomfortable environment, I cannot recommend this establishment to anyone. Save yourself the time, money, and frustration by steering clear of this disaster."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Martha: Hello! I need to borrow a blender for a day.

Passenger safety: Slowing down before reaching the station reduces the risk of accidents and collisions, providing a smooth and controlled stop for passengers to disembark or embark. 2. Staff safety: Train personnel often move around the platform performing essential tasks; a slow-moving train allows them to execute their responsibilities more safely. 3. Infrastructure preservation: Abruptly stopping or speeding through the station can cause damage to track or platform infrastructure. Slowing down ensures that the train interacts gently with the surroundings, minimizing the risk of infrastructure damage or derailment. 4.

In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.

An American track and field athlete, he was a two-sport stand-out in college in both track and football at Florida A&M University. He has one of the top 100 meter times by NFL players. Hayes was enshrined in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2001 and was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January 2009. Hayes was a highly recruited athlete, and accepted a football scholarship from Florida A&M University a historically black college, where he excelled in track & field. He never lost a race in the 100 yard or 100 meter competitions, but mainstream schools of the area still did not invite him to their sanctioned meets. In 1962 the University of Miami invited him to a meet on their campus, where he tied the world record of 9.2 seconds in the 100-yard dash, which had been set by Frank Budd of Villanova University the previous year. He also was the first person to break six seconds in the 60 yard dash with his indoor world record of 5.9 seconds. In 1963, although he never used a traditional sprinter form, he broke the 100-yard dash record with a time of 9.1, a mark that would not be broken for eleven years (until Ivory Crockett ran a 9.0 in 1974). That same year, Hayes set the world best for 200 meters (20.5 seconds, although the time was never ratified) and ran the 220 yard dash in a time of 20.6 seconds (while running into an eight mph wind). He was selected to represent the United States in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. His football coach Jake Gaither was not very high on giving Hayes time to train, which caused then president Lyndon B. Johnson to call him in order to allow Hayes time off and to keep him healthy. He was the AAU 100 yard dash champion three years running, from 1962-1964, and in 1964 was the NCAA champion in the 200 meter dash. He missed part of his senior year because of his Olympic bid for the Gold medal. In 1976, he was inducted into the inaugural class of the Florida A&M University Sports Hall of Fame. In 1996, he was inducted into the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Hall of Fame. In 2011, he was inducted into the Black College Football Hall of Fame. When did his college career end?","output":"The article does not provide a specific date or year when Robert Lee \\"Bullet Bob\\" Hayes' college career ended.

Molina, who self-identifies as \\"she,\\" passes the time by recounting memories from one of her favorite films, a wartime romantic thriller that's also a Nazi propaganda film. She weaves the characters into a narrative meant to comfort Valentin and distract him from the harsh realities of political imprisonment and separation from his lover, Marta. Valentin encourages Molina to have self-respect and opens her up to political commitment. Despite Valentin's occasionally snapping at Molina over her shallow views of film watching and unrealistic romance, an unlikely friendship develops between the two. As the story develops, it becomes clear that Valentin is being poisoned by his jailers to provide Molina with a chance to befriend him, and that Molina is spying on Valentin on behalf of the secret police. Molina has apparently been promised parole if she succeeds in obtaining information that will allow the secret police to break up the revolutionary group.

The factory is known for hiring young girls to work their looms, and it is seen as a way to earn an honest living to support their families. When 12-year-old Fatima dreams of joining The Dream Weavers, she is met with opposition for being too young. Fatima lives with her widowed mother and younger siblings, struggling to make ends meet. With the pressure to provide for her family, Fatima is adamant about working in the factory despite her age. However, the factory is already crowded with young girls working, and the management is reluctant to hire anyone younger, fearing scrutiny from labor rights groups. Undeterred, Fatima befriends some of the older girls working in the factory, hoping they could help her join their ranks secretly. The girls devise a plan to let Fatima work without drawing attention, allowing her to learn the trade and earn a small income. However, as they quickly discover, the working conditions within the factory are far harsher than they appear from the outside. As the girls grow closer, they begin to share their dreams and aspirations. Fatima's dream of her own fashion line inspires the other girls to look beyond the confines of the factory. Together, they start brainstorming ways to create a better future not only for themselves but for their fellow workers too. The girls' unity sparks an idea for a plan; they opt to work together after hours at the factory on Fatima's project, using their combined skills to create unique and beautiful clothing designs. As their creations come to life, the girls start to believe in their dreams and the potential of creating a life beyond the factory walls. However, when the factory management discovers their secret project, the girls face immediate dismissal, putting their families' livelihoods in jeopardy.

Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th.

His court opinions helped lay the basis for United States constitutional law and many say he made the Supreme Court of the United States a coequal branch of government along with the legislative and executive branches. Previously, Marshall had been a leader of the Federalist Party in Virginia and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1799 to 1800. He was Secretary of State under President John Adams from 1800 to 1801 and, at the age of 45, became the last of the chief justices to be born in Colonial America. In 1797, Marshall accepted when President John Adams appointed him to a three-member commission to represent the United States to negotiate with France which, during the midst of its Revolutionary Wars, had seized neutral American merchant vessels. This had prompted the United States to appropriate funds to equip and man three frigates. The other members of this commission were Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Elbridge Gerry. However, when the envoys arrived in October 1797, they were kept waiting for several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister Talleyrand. After this, the diplomats were met by three of Talleyrand's agents. Each refused to conduct diplomatic negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France. The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms. Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained. This diplomatic scandal became known as the XYZ Affair, inflaming anti-French opinion in the United States. Marshall arrived in New York on June 17. His handling of the affair, as well as public resentment toward the French, made him popular with the American public. He opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts, enacted by the Federalists in response to the crisis. In 1798, Marshall declined a Supreme Court appointment, recommending Bushrod Washington, who would later become one of Marshall's staunchest allies on the Court. In 1799, Marshall reluctantly ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. Although his congressional district (which included the city of Richmond) favored the Democratic-Republican Party, Marshall won the race, in part due to his conduct during the XYZ Affair and in part due to the support of Patrick Henry. His most notable speech was related to the case of Thomas Nash (alias Jonathan Robbins), whom the government had extradited to Great Britain on charges of murder. Marshall defended the government's actions, arguing that nothing in the Constitution prevents the United States from extraditing one of its citizens. On May 7, 1800, President Adams nominated Congressman Marshall as Secretary of War. However, on May 12, Adams withdrew the nomination, instead naming him Secretary of State, as a replacement for Timothy Pickering. Confirmed by the United States Senate on May 13, Marshall took office on June 6, 1800. As Secretary of State, Marshall directed the negotiation of the Convention of 1800, which ended the Quasi-War with France and brought peace to the nation. Elected as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830, John Marshall advanced his view that the electorate should be expanded in Virginia by the provision that any white male who had served in the War of 1812 or who would serve in the militia in the future defense of the country deserved the right to vote. who were the other 2 members?","output":"The other two members of the commission that John Marshall was a part of were Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Elbridge Gerry."},{"instruction":"Two bird islands in the Atlantic Ocean had very different climate changes during the last 5 years.

That journey was applying for something important. But don't worry! I am here to help you through this journey, step by step. Are you ready to go on this adventure? Let's begin! Step 1: Gather Your Magical Papers To begin your journey, you will need to find some special papers called \\"documents.\\" These magical papers will help prove who you are. You might need things like your birth certificate or a passport. Ask your mommy, daddy, or any trusted grown-up to help you find all the important documents you need to start your adventure. Step 2: Fill Out Your Adventure Application This part of your journey requires some writing skills.

What is the answer??","output":"The equation you've provided is 76d - 71d - 25 = 0. To solve for d, we must simplify the expression and isolate d on one side of the equation. First, we combine like terms. 76d and -71d are like terms, meaning they both have the factor d. When you subtract 71d from 76d, we get 5d. Our equation becomes: 5d - 25 = 0 Next, we want to get d all by itself on one side of the equation. In order to isolate d, we would need to undo the operations that are currently affecting d. In this case, d is being multiplied by 5 and 25 is being subtracted. To simplify the equation, we need to reverse the subtraction by adding 25 to each side of the equation: 5d - 25 + 25 = 0 + 25 This simplifies to: 5d = 25 Now, we need to undo the multiplication by dividing every term by 5: (5d) / 5 = 25 / 5 This simplifies to: d = 5 So, based on the initial equation given, the solution is d = 5."},{"instruction":"who won season 10 dancing with the stars??","output":"In Season 10 of Dancing with the Stars, the winner was Nicole Scherzinger, who was part of the Pussycat Dolls, a music group.

The encyclical is subtitled \\"On the Unity of Human Society.\\" It was the first encyclical of Pius XII and was seen as setting \\"a tone\\" for his papacy. It critiques major errors at the time, such as ideologies of racism, cultural superiority and the totalitarian state. It also sets the theological framework for future encyclical letters, such as \\"Mystici corporis Christi\\" (1943). The encyclical laments the destruction of Poland, denounces the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and calls for a restoration of independent Poland. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Pope Saint Pius X, born Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, (2 June 1835 20 August 1914) was Pope from August 1903 to his death in 1914. He was canonized in 1954. Pius X is known for vigorously opposing modernist interpretations of Catholic doctrine, promoting traditional devotional practices and orthodox theology. His most important reform was to order the codification of the first Code of Canon Law, which collected the laws of the Church into one volume for the first time. He was also considered a pastoral pope, in the sense of encouraging personal holiness, piety and a daily lifestyle reflecting deep Christian values. He was born in the town of Riese, which would later append \\"Pio X\\" (Pius X's name in Italian) to the town's name. - The Reichskonkordat (\\"Concordat between the Holy See and the German Reich\\") is a treaty negotiated between the Vatican and the emergent Nazi Germany. It was signed on 20 July 1933 by Cardinal Secretary of State (and later Pope Pius XII) Eugenio Pacelli on behalf of Pope Pius XI and Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen on behalf of President Paul von Hindenburg and the German government. It was ratified September 10, 1933 and it has been in force from that date right up until the current day. The treaty guarantees the rights of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. When bishops take office Article 16 states they're required to take an oath of loyalty to the Governor or President of the German Reich established according to the constitution. The treaty also requires all clergy to abstain from working in and for political parties. Nazi breaches of the agreement began almost as soon as it had been signed and intensified afterwards leading to protest from the Church including in the 1937 \\"Mit brennender Sorge\\" encyclical of Pope Pius XI. The Nazis planned to eliminate the Church's influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Pope Pius XI, born Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti (31 May 1857 10 February 1939), reigned as Pope from 6 February 1922 to his death in 1939. He was the first sovereign of Vatican City from its creation as an independent state on 11 February 1929. He took as his papal motto, \\"Pax Christi in Regno Christi,\\" translated \\"The Peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ.\\" - Pope Pius XII, born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli (2 March 18769 October 1958), reigned as Pope from 2 March 1939 to his death in 1958. Before his election to the papacy, Pacelli served as secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, papal nuncio to Germany (19171929), and Cardinal Secretary of State, in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with European and Latin American nations, most notably the \\"Reichskonkordat\\" with Nazi Germany, with which most historians believe the Vatican sought to protect the Church in Germany while Adolf Hitler sought the destruction of \\"political Catholicism\\". A pre-war critic of Nazism, Pius XII lobbied world leaders to avoid war and, as Pope at the outbreak of war, issued \\"Summi Pontificatus\\", expressing dismay at the invasion of Poland, reiterating Church teaching against racial persecution and calling for love, compassion and charity to prevail over war. - The Secretary of State of His Holiness The Pope, commonly known as the Cardinal Secretary of State, presides over the Holy See Secretariat of State, which is the oldest and most important dicastery of the Roman Curia. The Secretariat of State performs all the political and diplomatic functions of the Holy See and the Vatican City. - Luigi Maglione ( 2 March 1877 -- 23 August 1944 ) was an Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church . He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1935 and served as the Vatican Secretary of State under Pope Pius XII from 1939 until his death . Pius XII never replaced Maglione , opting to assume the responsibilities of the office himself , with the assistance of two undersecretaries . - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945.

However, I can offer some thoughts about how a star-rating might be determined based on this phrase. The phrase \\"Can't search for music\\" implies that the user is experiencing difficulty or is unable to search for music using the product or service. This indicates that the user is likely to be dissatisfied with the overall experience and might give a lower rating. However, there are a few factors to consider when assigning an appropriate star-rating for this review: 1. Context: Knowing the specifics of the product or service being reviewed is essential to assign a fair rating. For example, if this concern arises with a music streaming service or an app, it could be more critical, leading to a lower rating, as searching for music is the core functionality of such services. In contrast, if the product or service is not primarily focused on music, this issue might not have as significant an impact on the overall rating. 2. Other features or positive aspects: A single negative issue doesn't necessarily mean that the entire experience or product is terrible. If other features or aspects of the product/service have been significantly positive and satisfying, and the searching for music is just a minor part of the experience, then the overall rating might not be severely impacted. 3.

A's work rate: 1/20 of work per day B's work rate: 1/15 of work per day A and C combined work rate: 1/12 of work per day Now, let's find C's work rate: A and C's combined work rate - A's work rate = C's work rate 1/12 - 1/20 = 1/30 So, C's work rate: 1/30 of work per day In 2 days, A with B's help and A with C's help complete: (1/20 + 1/15) + (1/20 + 1/30) = (1/12 + 1/20) = 8/60 Now, let's call the total number of days to complete the work 'x'. So that means in 2x days, they would complete 8x/60 of the work 8x/60 = 1 (As the entire work comes to 1) x = 60/8 x = 7.5 So, in 7.5 days, the work will be completed.

When literature professor Humbert Humbert sends a lifeline of 13,000 to his estranged teenage stepdaughter Lolita, he sets in motion a series of life-altering events that will affect everyone around them as they confront their desires, fears, and secrets. Plot: Act 1: Introducing the world and main characters The movie begins by introducing the picturesque town of Gracewood. Through a brief montage, viewers learn about the town's history and its tight-knit community. Among the residents, we meet Professor Humbert Humbert, who teaches literature at the local university. He is newly married to the widowed Dolores Hayes, a real estate agent who has a teenage daughter, Lolita. Their family life seems picture-perfect, but there is a constant tension among the members. Lolita, a 14-year-old cheerleader, discovers a hidden stash of money in her stepfather's study. Intrigued, she asks her mom about the money, but Dolores feigns ignorance. Dolores and Humbert's marriage has been strained recently due to Dolores inheriting a significant amount of money from her late husband's life insurance policy. Act 2: Introducing the conflict As the story unfolds, viewers get a glimpse of Humbert's darker desires for Lolita, which he carefully hides from his wife and the townsfolk. On the surface, Humbert is a well-respected and admired professor, but he harbors an unhealthy and obsessive attraction to his stepdaughter. Lolita, who has developed feelings for a boy named Sebastian, begs Humbert to teach her how to drive so she can impress Sebastian. Torn between his love for Lolita and the growing animosity in his marriage, Humbert agrees. One day, after a brutal argument with Dolores, Humbert makes a decision. He writes Lolita a cheque for 13,000 - the same amount she found in his study - with a warning note attached, asking her to hide the money and not to tell anyone about it. Lolita discovers the cheque and the note after their driving lesson, leaving her confused and scared. The note hints at possible danger and advises her to leave town if anything were to happen to Humbert or Dolores. Act 3: Rising action and climax Meanwhile, the town is rocked by the sudden arrival of a mysterious figure named Charles, who is searching for the late Mr. Hayes' hidden assets. Charles claims to be an old business associate of Lolita's father, and he starts to question Dolores and Humbert about the life insurance payout. As Humbert's attraction to Lolita grows more apparent, Dolores becomes increasingly suspicious of her husband's motives. After confronting Humbert about his feelings towards Lolita, he assures her that he has no intention of hurting Lolita and that the money was simply a safety net in case anything happened to Dolores or him. They eventually agree to keep the truth hidden to protect Lolita and themselves. Tensions rise as Charles continues to pry into the family's affairs. Lolita turns to Sebastian for support, and they devise a plan to run away together using the 13,000. Humbert, suspecting that Charles's life is in danger and that Lolita might be involved in their plans, decides to hire a PI to protect his stepdaughter. Act 4: The Unraveling Everything comes crashing down when Charles kidnaps Dolores and demands the hidden 13,000, believing that it is part of Mr. Hayes' assets. Lolita and Sebastian decide to use the money to save Dolores from Charles's grasp, but in a dramatic showdown, Sebastian accidentally kills Charles. As their family deals with the aftermath, the PI discovers the nature of Humbert's feelings for Lolita and reveals them to Dolores and the town. Lolita, hurt and betrayed, elects to stay with her grandparents. Humbert is forced out of his job and shunned by the community. Act 5: Resolution Humbert leaves Gracewood, heartbroken but knowing it's the best course of action. Lolita, now living with her grandparents, starts a new life in a new town with the help of Sebastian. Dolores, with the help of her friends, rebuilds her life both professionally and personally, starts dating again, and eventually opens her own real estate agency. The movie ends on a lighter note, with the characters moving on from their traumatic past, finding solace in the strength of their relationships. The peaceful town of Gracewood slowly returns to normal, echoing the sentiment of forgiveness and growth that stemmed from the events surrounding the 13,000."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The inaugural games were held, on the orders of the Roman Emperor Titus, to celebrate the completion in AD 80 (81 according to some sources) of the Colosseum, then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium). Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus.

The Queen had a relatively balanced view of the conflict, and condemned atrocities on both sides. She wrote of \\"her feelings of horror and regret at the result of this bloody civil war\\", and insisted, urged on by Albert, that an official proclamation announcing the transfer of power from the company to the state \\"should breathe feelings of generosity, benevolence and religious toleration\\". At her behest, a reference threatening the \\"undermining of native religions and customs\\" was replaced by a passage guaranteeing religious freedom.

Options: - believe in god - work in teams - kiss each other - receive gifts - argue Explain why a human would choose \\"work in teams\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"work in teams\\" to answer the question above because it is the most appropriate and relevant option given the context of the question. The question is about group projects, which implies collaboration and working together with others to accomplish a task or goal. The other options are unrelated to the nature of group projects and, in some cases, are completely unrelated to the question's context. Working in teams while executing group projects has multiple advantages, such as the following: 1. Distribution of workload: When people work in teams, they can divide the tasks and responsibilities among team members based on their skills and expertise, which can help get the work done efficiently. 2. Collaboration and communication: Teamwork fosters collaboration, as members of the group can brainstorm ideas, share insights, and contribute to the group's overall understanding of the subject. 3. Problem-solving and creativity: Working in teams enables individuals to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to problems since they can leverage diverse perspectives and experiences. 4. Skill development: Working together on group projects allows individuals to learn from one another and develop new skills that might be valuable in their academic or professional careers. 5. Building relationships and trust: Working in teams can help strengthen personal and professional relationships, allowing for a greater sense of camaraderie and trust among team members. In summary, a human would choose \\"work in teams\\" as the answer to the question because it best represents the objective and desired outcome of engaging in group projects.

I went to eta for the first time last week on a Thursday and Lingo was behind the bar. Lingo was awesome, friendly and very attentive. I played the machines and just drank club soda with a lime which Lingo ensured my drink was never empty. Lingo informed me that they were having a party on Valentines night and encouraged me to check it out. On valentines day, My husband and I were at the sports bar having some drinks and the bartenders there were great and friendly, we ended up going back into eta for their party. I wanted my husband to experience the great service I have had the night prior.. That was until Amanda served us. We ordered 2 beers and Amanda told us the total, didn't even greet us, my husband made a comment about the beers being slightly higher than the race and sports bar, but I told my husband it was because eta offered entertainment. We paid for our beers without incident until Amanda stated to my husband \\"if you can't afford the drinks, go back to race and sports\\". I was shocked at this comment because my husband is a physician and money is not an issue for us. I told Amanda we weren't complaining and my husband was just confused. She continued to look at the gentleman next to us and say \\"I hate dealing with broke white trash\\". I told her she had no right to make those comments about us and that we paid without complaining and there was no reason for her to attack us. She proceeded to tell my husband and I that this would be our last beer there and told us to go to a bar that we could \\"afford\\". Needless to say, its unfortunate that 1 bad seed will ruin the great service that we received from Lingo. Judging by the other reviews, it looks like Amanda is an ongoing problem. I had requested to speak with a manager and waited almost a half hour with no manager to be seen. I encourage anyone who hasn't been there yet not to go there when Amanda is working. I have never been so disrespected by a bar tender before. Hopefully this casino will see this ongoing problem and handle it.

They have meat between the bones and on top of the bones, and are shorter, curved, and sometimes meatier than spare ribs. The rack is shorter at one end, due to the natural tapering of a pig's rib cage. The shortest bones are typically only about 3 in (7.6 cm) and the longest is usually about 6 in (15 cm), depending on the size of the hog. A pig side has 15 to 16 ribs (depending on the breed), but usually two or three are left on the shoulder when it is separated from the loin. So, a rack of back ribs contains a minimum of eight ribs (some may be trimmed if damaged), but can include up to 13 ribs, depending on how it has been prepared by the butcher.

But since the nation was founded, Americans have agreed to pay income taxes, to be drafted for war and to embrace desegregation, all by order of the federal government. Each was controversial; each was accepted once the public recognized that the alternative was worse. So it's no surprise that one reason many people are balking at health care reform is the still-new idea that they'll be required to have medical insurance beginning in 2014 or pay a penalty. Opponents of the law that created the mandate have seized the opportunity to turn people's reflexive wariness into furious opposition by painting the requirement as a terrible, socialistic threat to personal liberty. That's handy rhetoric for the fall campaigns, but if the requirement goes into effect, Americans will likely come to view it as just another fact of life, much the same as we regard insurance on our cars or our homes. Gut-level irritation and ideological squabbling aside, the practical question is what will you get for your money? The short answer is medical security and peace of mind. Even if you lost your job, you'd have guaranteed insurance coverage. The obnoxious practice of raising rates dramatically for people who get sick would be banned. So would insurance companies' habit of denying coverage to people with existing conditions. All this is possible only if everyone is insured, spreading the risk and cost. The price is that people would have to do the responsible thing: protect themselves rather than wait until disaster strikes, potentially bankrupting their families and forcing them onto public assistance. People could opt for a minimal plan (or hundreds of other plans), but they couldn't ride free on everyone else. Opponents see this as such a threat to personal liberty that attorneys general or governors in 21 states, overwhelmingly Republicans, have filed suit to block the requirement. In time, their arguments will likely be heard by the Supreme Court. But the mandate has become as central to the GOP catechism as tax cuts, and for some, neither the Constitution nor the political process is enough. If they can't have their way, they promise to obstruct. This is deeply hypocritical. Odd as the notion might sound, before health reform became so polarizing, an insurance mandate was a conservative value— an alternative that preserved private insurance rather than resorting to a government-run system like Medicare. Why should the rest of us have to pay when someone who refuses to buy insurance goes to the emergency room? Many conservatives were all for requiring these \\"free riders\\" to pay their own way. Some still are. \\"I've always said you should have a choice between either having insurance or posting a bond, but that every American should provide for their medical future,\\" former GOP House speaker Newt Gingrich told Esquire magazine in a recent interview. Republicans have some good ideas for changing the health care system — malpractice reform, for example — but their only major bill would have extended coverage to just 3 million of the uninsured, barely a tenth the number covered by the plan that passed. Requiring medical insurance is no threat to Americans' independence. It's a responsible way to help guarantee that fewer of us die without coverage or go bankrupt with it.

Step 3: Identify the movie's standout aspects I will focus on the outstanding performances by the lead actors, the powerful story, and the emotional depth of the film. Step 4: Write the movie review \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is undoubtedly a cinematic masterpiece that dives deep into the human spirit and tells a powerful, heart-wrenching tale of friendship, hope, and redemption.

The duo's exceptional performances breathe life into their characters, making them relatable and drawing us into their world. The story, based on Stephen King's novella \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\\" is expertly adapted for the screen by director Frank Darabont.

The WHO says Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Spanish Flu are examples of what to avoid because they mention specific locations. Instead, names should contain generic terms that are \\"easy to pronounce\\". The WHO said several new human infectious diseases had emerged in recent years and some had stigmatised certain cultures, regions and economies. Dr Keiji Fukuda, assistant director general for health security at the WHO, said: \\"This may seem like a trivial issue to come, but disease names really do matter to the people who are directly affected.\\" Dr Fukuda said certain disease names had created a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities.

They include using specific or generic descriptive terms if they are known, such as 'severe', 'progressive' or 'respiratory disease' and making names short and easily pronounceable.

The answer to this question is:","output":"In Thailand, the primary language spoken is Thai, also known as Central Thai or Siamese. Thai is a member of the Tai-Kadai language family and serves as the official language of the country. It has its own script, derived from the Brahmi script called the Thai alphabet, which was introduced in 1283 by King Ramkhamhaeng. Thai is a tonal language, which means that the meaning of a word can change based on the tone in which it is spoken. There are five tones in the Thai language: mid tone, low tone, falling tone, high tone, and rising tone. This tonal aspect makes it challenging for non-native speakers to learn. In addition to the standard Central Thai dialect, there are various regional Thai dialects spoken across the country. These include Southern Thai, Northern Thai (also known as Lanna or Kham Mueang), and Northeastern Thai (also known as Isan, which is closely related to the Lao language). Although these regional dialects exhibit differences in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, they are mutually intelligible to some extent. Moreover, English is widely taught and used throughout Thailand, particularly in urban areas, major tourist destinations, and in the business sector. Other minority languages spoken in Thailand include Chinese dialects (mainly Teochew, Hokkien and Hainanese), Malay (spoken in the southern provinces near the Malaysian border), and various ethnic languages spoken by hill tribes, such as Hmong, Akha, Lisu, and Karen. Thailand is known for its rich cultural heritage, which heavily influences its language. Thai literature, such as the national epic Ramakien, is deeply rooted in Buddhist traditions and Hindu mythology. Therefore, Thai vocabulary and expressions often reflect religious and philosophical concepts, making the Thai language unique in its essence and cultural significance."},{"instruction":"Please add spaces between words: SkyMoonTourbillonRef.5002isthemostcomplicatedwatchmanufacturerPatekPhilippeisalsothebrand'sfirstone-sidedwatch.Movementcontains686parts,someofwhichisextremelysmall.Collapse","output":"The phrase provided appears to be a description of a highly sophisticated watch from Patek Philippe; it needs appropriate spacing to be comprehensible.

HarperCollins in Britain and America have now signed the talented author following her phenomenal internet success. Miss Gibbs, from Brixham, Devon, who is about to start studying English at Oxford University, is the first author to be discovered on Wattpad. Wattpad is an online writing platform which allows subscribers to upload or read other people's stories.

Miss Gibbs finished her book at the age of 16, just two years after she started writing it and it will now hit the high street. She posted each chapter after she had written it on the internet site, until she got to five chapters before the end when she stopped. She said: 'I stopped because I had signed with an agent and he basically said don't post anymore or the ending to keep readers in suspense. 'That was tough because I disappeared off the site for a year and there were a lot of fans asking where I was. 'There was a lot of temptation to tell them but I kept it all up in wraps.

Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide, accounting for a significant percentage of cancer cases and deaths. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths globally. 2. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer. The majority of lung cancer cases are attributed to cigarette smoking. Tobacco smoke contains thousands of harmful chemicals, many of which are known carcinogens (cancer-causing agents). 3. The risk of developing lung cancer increases with the duration and intensity of smoking. The more cigarettes a person smokes and the longer they smoke, the higher their risk of developing lung cancer. 4. Passive smoking, or exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke, can also increase the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers. 5. Despite the significant contribution of smoking to lung cancer incidence, it is crucial to note that not all lung cancer cases are linked to smoking. Other factors, such as exposure to radon, asbestos, and air pollution, are known to contribute to the development of lung cancer as well. In summary, smoking is indeed a major contributor to lung cancer cases in the world. However, it is not the only risk factor, and other environmental and genetic factors also play a role in the development of this disease."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

As one of the strongholds of extremist factions, the city's capture has been crucial for maintaining a semblance of power and control in the country. This latest strike represents a significant escalation in the conflict between the Iraqi government and the militant groups that have plagued the nation for years. Background: Tikrit is a city with critical historical and geographical importance in Iraq. It is most famously known as the birthplace of the former Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein. Since the fall of Hussein's regime in 2003, different factions and foreign players have been vying for control over its rich resources and strategic location. The rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) in 2014 saw a rapid and brutal takeover of Tikrit and other major cities in Iraq, leading to a protracted battle with the Iraqi army, Kurdish forces, and the international coalition led by the United States. Though the group was declared defeated in 2017, remnants of its once-powerful army have been reconstructed into smaller insurgency groups that continue to carry out attacks and destabilize the region. The Aerial Assault: The Iraqi government, backed by international coalition forces, have increased their efforts to eliminate militant groups from the country. The latest attack, which specifically targeted Tikrit, involved the use of helicopter gunships to strike key militant strongholds and bases in the city, with the goal of dismantling their power structure and fortifying government control. This strategic choice of aerial warfare allowed Iraqi forces to minimize the risk of collateral damage and civilian casualties, while simultaneously enabling them to target militants with increased precision and efficacy. Additionally, the use of helicopters provides a mobile and flexible platform to counteract the guerrilla warfare tactics often employed by extremist groups in the region. The Significance of the Strike: The attack on Tikrit holds both symbolic and strategic importance in the ongoing conflict. Firstly, it signals a commitment on the part of the Iraqi government to assert its control over the entire country, a task that has been hindered by the presence of lawless militia factions that thrive in the power vacuum. Furthermore, the strike indicates a level of confidence in the capabilities of the Iraqi armed forces, as well as cooperation with international allies. Secondly, the city of Tikrit finds itself in a unique position, both as a vital crossroads for transportation and trade, and as the heart of a region known for its rich oil resources. The regaining of control over Tikrit would, therefore, not only diminish militant influence in the region but also help to reestablish economic stability and strengthen the central government's grip on power. The Road Ahead: While the aerial strike on Tikrit marks a critical moment in the battle against militant factions in Iraq, it is clear that the overall conflict is far from being resolved. The persistence of insurgent movements and the pervasive presence of foreign actors continue to create complex challenges for the Iraqi government. In order to ensure lasting stability and prosperity, it will be essential for the government to focus on consolidating its power and strengthening its institutions while also addressing the legitimate grievances that arise from factors such as political fragmentation and socio-economic disparities. This task is undoubtedly ambitious and requires both a well-coordinated internal effort and sustained support from the international community. Nevertheless, the recent strike on Tikrit serves as a sobering reminder of the potential for progress and the importance of unity in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"Solve 173*l - 262 = 257 for l..

Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Question: When will the tax plan be made law? Options: - Before the plea deal between Michael Flynn and Mueller - Before economic growth and jobs occur due to the plan? - After the start of the Russia investigation. - not enough information === The correct answer is A:","output":"- Not enough information While the passage talks about House and Senate negotiators working on the tax plan with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks, there is no specific date or timeline provided for when the tax plan will be made into law.

Along the way, she forms unlikely bonds, faces terrifying foes, and discovers her true identity, gradually embracing her destiny as a hero and protector of her people. Act I - The Beginning: Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Astralwyn, a royal celebration marks the 18th birthday of Princess Rose. She is adored by her people, yet something is missing - her history. Her background is unknown to everyone, including herself, as she was found in the palace garden as a baby by the King and Queen. Despite the joyous occasion, Rose feels an unshakable sense of emptiness. One night, Rose stumbles upon a hidden chamber within the castle, where she discovers an ancient relic containing a cryptic message of her past. Aided by her trusted advisor and magical counselor, Master Lumos, she realizes that deciphering this message is the first step in understanding her true origins. Act II - The Adventure: The message, now revealed to be a map, points to a forgotten realm veiled in darkness. Determined to reclaim her past, Rose forms a group of unlikely heroes. Alongside the brave knight Sir Lanceworth, the quick-witted thief Nym, and the enigmatic sorcerer Shadowyn, they embark on a perilous journey. As they venture into uncharted lands and face deadly creatures, Rose manifests unique abilities — powers that seem to be triggered by the very darkness they face. However, these newfound powers stir fear in the hearts of her companions, causing tension within the group. Complex relationships evolve, and the party learns to trust one another despite their initial apprehensions. As they venture further into the unknown, they encounter the Sisters of the Five Realms, mythical guardians of time and space, who hint that Rose's powers could drastically alter the future of Astralwyn. Act III - The Revelation: Determined to uncover the truth, the group delves deeper into the dark realm, only to make a horrifying discovery. A malevolent sorceress named Obscuria has been harnessing the energy of ancient magic, intending to destroy Astralwyn, infiltrate the other realms, and claim ultimate power for herself. Obscuria reveals that she is responsible for erasing Rose's past to hide the truth of her origins. Princess Rose is not only the rightful ruler of Astralwyn but also the last in a powerful lineage of enchantresses whose bloodline serves to protect and maintain balance between the realms. In a final battle, Obscuria attempts to exploit Rose's powers for her own nefarious ends. Risking everything, Rose unlocks the full extent of her abilities to defy Obscuria and protect Astralwyn. Overcoming her fears, Rose defeats Obscuria, thus restoring light to the forgotten realm and rescuing her kingdom from annihilation. Act IV - The Return: With the revelation of her heritage, Princess Rose now embraces her true legacy as the Enchantress of Light. Returning to her kingdom, she is embraced by her people and her family. The kingdom rejoices in the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy, as the Enigmatic Rose takes her place as the ruler and protector of the five realms. Master Lumos and the Sisters of the Five Realms remove the veil of secrecy surrounding Rose's past, revealing the heroic deeds of her ancestors. Rose, now equipped with a clear vision of her purpose and endearing friendships, is determined to create a prosperous and harmonious future for Astralwyn. Years later, the legend of The Enigmatic Rose spreads across the lands, as she becomes the embodiment of newfound hope, strength, and unity for the people of all five realms."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question.

People to People arranges for American students to travel all around the world to learn about other cultures, and to help others understand American culture. The program was founded by former President Dwight D. Eisenhower to promote peace through understanding. I had to put in many hours of special work to get to this point. First, a teacher nominated me, and then I attended an informational meeting about the program. The application process included an interview, and finally, I was accepted. That's when the hard work really began. In addition to attending monthly meetings to prepare for the big trip, my parents encouraged my twin sister Beth (also participating in the program) and me to raise 2,000 each to help pay for the cost. And so the fund-raising began. We did everything from selling candy bars to selling an old car to decorating people's mailboxes during the holiday season. We also babysat, washed cars, held a yard sale, and washed windows. After months of hard work I had raised a total of 2319.87! Combined, Beth and I raised over 4500.00! Now I have a problem-packing. Yes, I know it sounds unimportant, but my suitcase seems to have shrunk as I placed my belongings inside.

For a person who likes to wear a different outfit every day, packing all my clothes into such a small space seemed an impossible task. However, I have lessened my load and my suitcase which started out weighting overweight now checks in at a mere 36. Apart from a slightly bloated carry-on bag, my luggage is definitely manageable.

After the Eagles punted on their first drive, Oakland drove to the Eagles' 42, but failed convert on fourth down. Eagles quarterback Nick Foles, playing for the injured Carson Wentz, then led the team down the field and opened the scoring on a 17-yard touchdown pass to Jay Ajayi to put the home team up 7-0. After the teams traded punts, Carr threw a 63-yard touchdown pass to Amari Cooper to tie the game up early in the second quarter. Philadelphia found themselves in scoring position late in the half, but rookie kicker Jake Elliott missed a 33-yard try right before the half leaving the game tied at seven. Starting the second half, the Raiders moved into Philly's red zone, but were held out of the end zone and forced to settle for a field goal by Giorgio Tavecchio to take a 10-7 lead. On the Raiders' next possession, Carr was intercepted by CB Patrick Robinson ending the Raiders promising drive. Two plays later, Ajayi fumbled and the Raiders took over. However, on the first offensive play for the Raiders, Marshawn Lynch to lost his first fumble of the season and resulting in three turnovers in four plays. The Eagles used that possession to kick another field goal to tie things up at 10-each. Defensive efforts and poor offense by both teams caused them to trade punts again going into the fourth quarter. The Raiders, taking over close to midfield, marched into Eagles territory, but Tavecchio missed a 48-yard field goal to leave the game tied. On the Eagles' next drive, Foles threw an interception and the Raiders drove deep into Philadelphia territory poised to take the lead. However, Jalen Richard turned the ball over on a fumble, the Raiders third turnover of the game. Following punts by both teams, the Raiders took over near midfield with the opportunity to set up a potential game-winning drive. However, with less than a minute to go, Carr threw another pick, the Raiders fourth turnover in the game. Philadelphia used the momentum to close into field goal range, and Elliott connected on a 48-yard try to give the home team the lead with 22 seconds left. Oakland took over on their own 40 with all three timeouts, but moved nowhere. On fourth down, with three seconds left, the Raiders began to lateral the ball as the clock expired attempting to score, but ended up fumbling the ball and the Eagles Derek Barnett returned it for a touchdown. The Eagles took a knee on the extra point try. The Raider defense played well, allowing 216 yards to the Eagles, but the Raider offense lost three fumbles in the game and Carr threw two interceptions. With the loss, the Raiders fell to 6-9 on the season, their third losing season in four years with Derek Carr as QB, and to third place in the division. How many more field goals did Jake Elliot miss than score?","output":"In the given context, Jake Elliott missed one field goal (the 33-yard attempt before the half) and successfully scored one field goal (the 48-yard attempt that gave the Eagles the lead with 22 seconds left). Therefore, he missed the same number of field goals as he scored, so the answer is 0 (zero) more field goals missed than scored."},{"instruction":"What debate topic are the following sentences about? 1.

Payment refers not only to the exchange of money for goods or services but also to other forms of sacrifices or investments made, including time, effort, or emotional commitment. To analyze whether this premise entails the hypothesis \\"You always pay for something,\\" let's break down each statement and compare their implications: 1. Premise: \\"you're always paying for something you know\\" This statement implies that there is always a cost or payment associated with the acquisition of knowledge or familiarity with something. In essence, it suggests that the process of learning, experiencing, or being aware of something comes at a cost. For example, consider a person who is learning a new skill. The cost of acquiring that skill may come in the form of time spent practicing, money invested in classes or materials, or the emotional investment made in overcoming challenges and setbacks. The premise suggests that this cost is an inevitable part of the learning experience. 2. Hypothesis: \\"You always pay for something.\\" The hypothesis is essentially an extension of the premise. While the premise focuses on the cost associated with acquiring knowledge or familiarity, the hypothesis broadens the scope to include any situation where an exchange or investment of resources occurs. This encompasses not only situations that involve learning and knowledge but also situations in everyday life and various human experiences. For instance, when one purchases groceries, they are paying with money; when someone helps a friend fix their car, they are paying with time and effort; and when someone decides to stay in a relationship despite its hardships, they are paying with emotional investment. The hypothesis asserts that any decision or action involves some form of payment or sacrifice. Now, let's examine whether the premise entails the hypothesis. By comparing the meanings of both statements, it can be observed that the hypothesis broadens the scope of the premise to include all situations where an exchange or investment of resources takes place, not just those that involve knowledge or familiarity. In summary, the truth of the initial premise \\"you're always paying for something you know\\" does implicitly reaffirm and support the hypothesis \\"You always pay for something\\" since the latter serves as an overarching principle encompassing all life situations where any form of payment or sacrifice is made. Therefore, we can conclude that the premise does entail the hypothesis to a certain degree by extending the idea of paying for knowledge to a more universal context."},{"instruction":"Complete the passage: pick from possible candidates.

The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They’re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it. I then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop® Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are.

Shumai, also known as Siomay, is a traditional Chinese dumpling often served in dim sum cuisine. It is made from a delicate, thin dough wrapper filled with various ingredients such as ground pork, shrimp, or a combination of both, along with vegetables such as shiitake mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts. Shumai dumplings are usually steamed, resulting in a soft, light texture, and served with dipping sauces like soy sauce, chili oil, or hot mustard. On the other hand, Batagor is an Indonesian dish that is a variation of the Chinese Shumai, showcasing the fusion of Chinese and Indonesian culinary influences. The name \\"Batagor\\" is derived from the words \\"bakso\\" (meatball), \\"tahu\\" (tofu), and \\"goreng\\" (fried), indicating the main components of the dish. Batagor's preparation involves a fish paste mixture, commonly made with Spanish Mackerel fish that is combined with tapioca starch and various spices. This mixture is then stuffed into tofu or used as a filling for wonton wrappers, akin to the Shumai dumplings. Once filled, the Batagor is deep-fried, resulting in a crispy exterior and a flavorful, tender interior. Both Shumai and Batagor, though having similarities in their core components and being variations of each other, offer distinct flavors and textures that cater to different preferences. Shumai lovers will appreciate its delicate, steamed dumplings and an array of succulent fillings, while those who crave a more indulgent, crispy treat can indulge in Batagor's deep-fried, savory goodness.

If living in space affects the production of enzymes in the liver, then this would have a direct impact on the steps involved in cleaning the blood and creating bile. b. If the synthesis or function of liver enzymes is altered due to changes in external conditions (e.g., gravity, radiation levels, or other environmental factors), the efficiency of blood-cleaning and bile production could be affected directly. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: a. If living in space colonies leads to changes in diet or lifestyle that, in turn, affect the liver's ability to produce and use enzymes effectively, this would indirectly impact the blood-cleaning and bile production processes. b. Possible genetic adaptations or mutations in response to a new space environment may lead to changes in liver function and enzyme production or efficiency.

Even Bollywood sci-fi movies like Ra.One cost a good chunk of what it has taken to get Mangalyaan to Mars. 74m Cost of India's Mangalyaan mission 671m Cost of Nasa's Maven Mars mission Launched on 5 Nov 2013 Weighs 1,350kg Closest point to Mars 366km So how has India done it? For sure, people costs are less in this populous nation, and the scientists and engineers working on any space mission are always the largest part of the ticket price. Home-grown components and technologies have also been prioritised over expensive foreign imports. But, in addition, India has been careful to do things simply. \\"They've kept it small. The payload weighs only about 15kg. Compare that with the complexity in the payload in Maven and that will explain a lot about the cost,\\" says Britain's Prof Andrew Coates, who will be a principal investigator on Europe's Mars rover in 2018. \\"Of course, that reduced complexity suggests it won't be as scientifically capable, but India has been smart in targeting some really important areas that will complement what others are doing.\\" Mangalyaan has gone equipped with an instrument that will try to measure methane in the atmosphere. This is one of the hottest topics in Mars research right now, following previous, tantalising observations of the gas. Earth's atmosphere contains billions of tonnes of methane, the vast majority of it coming from microbes, such as the organisms found in the digestive tracts of animals. The speculation has been that some methane-producing bugs, or methanogens, could perhaps exist on Mars if they lived underground, away from the planet's harsh surface conditions. It is a fascinating prospect. So, even though Mangalyaan has a small payload, it will actually address some of the biggest questions at the Red Planet. Western scientists are excited also to have the Indian probe on station. Its measurements of other atmospheric components will dovetail very nicely with Maven and the observations being made by Europe's Mars Express. \\"It means we'll be getting three-point measurements, which is tremendous,\\" says Prof Coates. This will enable researchers to better understand how the planet lost the bulk of its atmosphere billions of years ago, and determine what sort of climate it could once have had, and whether or not it was conducive to life. I have read a lot about the criticism of Mangalyaan and India's space programme. There's an assumption among many, I guess, that space activity is somehow a plaything best left to wealthy industrial countries; that it can have no value to developing nations. The money would be better spent on healthcare and improved sanitation, so the argument goes. But what this position often overlooks is that investment in science and technology builds capability and capacity, and develops the sort of people who benefit the economy and society more widely. Space activity is also a wealth generator. Some of the stuff we do up there pays for stuff down here. The industrialised nations know it; that's one of the reasons they invest so heavily in space activity. Consider just the UK. It has dramatically increased its spending on space in recent years. The government has even identified satellites as being one of the \\"eight great technologies\\" that can help rebalance the UK economy and drive it forward. India wants a part of this action, too, and in Mangalyaan and its other satellite and rocket programmes, the nation is putting itself into a strong position in international markets for space products and services. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the successful launch and orbiting of India's Mangalyaan satellite around Mars, which was achieved at a significantly lower cost than similar Western missions, such as NASA's Maven Mars mission. The article examines how India managed to keep costs low by prioritizing home-grown components, technologies, and lower people costs, as well as reducing the complexity of its payload. Despite its reduced complexity, Mangalyaan is equipped to answer important scientific questions about Mars, such as the presence of methane in its atmosphere. The article also addresses criticism of India's space program and argues that investment in science and technology leads to benefits for the economy and society. It emphasizes the importance of participating in the international market for space products and services as a wealth generator."},{"instruction":"You just got done with a long run. You are gasping for air. Why does your body react this way? What is the purpose of breathing? All the cells of your body need oxygen to work properly. Your bodys circulatory system works with the respiratory system to deliver the oxygen. Your blood carries red blood cells. The main job of red blood cells is to carry oxygen throughout your body. The red blood cells get oxygen in the lungs. The lungs are the main organs of the respiratory system. The respiratory system is the body system that takes in oxygen. It then releases carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide is the waste material from the cells. Do you have any questions?","output":"When you go for a long run, your body needs more energy. To get more energy, it needs more oxygen. So, your body starts to breathe faster and deeper. This way, it can get more oxygen to your muscles and organs. Breathing has a very important job. It brings in oxygen, which your body needs to work and play. When you breathe in, air (which has oxygen) goes into your lungs. Your lungs help to move the oxygen into your blood. Inside your blood, there are red blood cells. They act like little delivery trucks. They pick up the oxygen in your lungs and carry it to other parts of your body. When your body uses the oxygen, it makes waste called carbon dioxide. The red blood cells carry this waste back to your lungs, and when you breathe out, you get rid of the carbon dioxide. So remember, when you run and feel out of breath, it's because your body is working hard to get more oxygen and get rid of waste. And that's why breathing is so important!"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: This is also called diffusion, and the process is much faster in gases than in liquids, because the particles in gases are further apart.

Some younger kids may have them because their parents see it as a matter of safety and convenience. For example, a kid can call mom and dad when sports practice is over. And a cell phone can give kids almost instant access to their parents if something goes wrong or they need help. It can give parents quick access to their kids so they can check on them and make sure they're OK. If you do get a cell phone, make some rules with your parents, such as how many minutes you're allowed to spend on the phone, when you can use your phone, when the phone must be turned off, and what you will do if someone calls you too often, and so on. You'll also have to learn to take care of the phone in your life. Keep it charged and store it in the safe place so it doesn't get lost. And whatever you do, don't use it in the bathroom.

A:","output":"The passage is most probably written by someone who is knowledgeable about parenting and children's needs, such as a parent, a teacher, or an expert in child development. The focus of the article is on when it is appropriate to get a cell phone for a child, the potential safety and convenience benefits of having one, and creating rules and responsibilities around its use. This suggests that the author is experienced in dealing with children and their developmental stages and is offering advice to parents and children about cell phone usage. As for the answer \\"Someone who works for children's education\\", it is possible but not necessarily definitive. The author indeed shows concern for children's well-being and safety and may have some background in children's education, but the primary focus remains on parenting and cell phone use rather than on education directly.

An enraged posse of men descend on the isolated Seven Doors Hotel deep in the swamps. They grab an artist called Schweik (Antoine Saint John), who is cloistered there. Accusing him of being a warlock, Schweik is dragged down to the cellar where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid, and crucified with his wrists nailed to a cellar wall, despite his dire warnings of evil to be unleashed.New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York City to claim the hotel as her inheritance. No sooner has architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) begins to show her around the property, strange incidents begin to happen. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his rig and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and babbling about, \\"the eyes, the eyes.\\" Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital, and offers Liza some sympathy. Next, a plumber, named Joe, attempts to repair a major leak in the flooded cellar. However, he is murdered by a presence that emerged from behind a slim-caked wall.

What is the oldest western religion? Do those questions have the same meaning? Available options: [i] no [ii] yes","output":"i] no The questions \\"How old is the oldest religion?\\" and \\"What is the oldest western religion?\\" do not have the same meaning, as they refer to different aspects of religious history. To answer the first question, \\"How old is the oldest religion?\\", we need to look at the origin of religious beliefs and practices in human history. The oldest known religion is often considered to be animism, which dates back to the Paleolithic period (from around 2.5 million years ago to about 10,000 BCE). Animism is the belief that every natural object, such as trees, rivers, and even rocks, has a spirit or life force. This belief is thought to have originated from the earliest human attempts to understand and make sense of the world around them. In terms of organized religions, Hinduism is one of the oldest religions still practiced today. The roots of Hinduism can be traced back to the ancient Indus Valley civilization (circa 2500-1500 BCE) in modern-day Pakistan and India. However, some aspects of Hinduism, like the Vedic religion, which was the precursor to Hinduism, developed around 1500–500 BCE. It is important to note that the exact date and origins of Hinduism can be hard to pinpoint, as it is a complex, diverse, and evolving tradition. For the second question, \\"What is the oldest western religion?\\", you are asking about the earliest religion that emerged within Western or European cultures. To answer this, we need to focus on the ancient religions practiced in Europe and the near East, such as early polytheistic belief systems. One of the oldest Western religions is the ancient Egyptian religion, which dates back to around 3100 BCE when the Egyptian civilization emerged in the Nile River Valley. This polytheistic religion encompassed a complex system of gods and goddesses, along with rituals and ceremonies designed to maintain the balance and order of the universe. Another ancient Western religion is Zoroastrianism, which dates back to around 1000–600 BCE, founded in ancient Persia (now Iran). Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion, focused on the worship of the supreme deity, Ahura Mazda. While it significantly influenced later Western monotheistic religions, such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, Zoroastrianism itself is rooted in earlier Aryan and Indo-European beliefs. In summary, the two questions address different aspects of religious history. The first question pertains to the age and origin of the oldest religious beliefs and practices, while the second question is concerned with identifying the oldest religion in Western cultural tradition."},{"instruction":"Choose the next sentence for this paragraph.

The context or the text clearly advises against this, suggesting instead that while one's clothing should emphasize their best features, they should still maintain an element of mystery. The advice implies that one should avoid revealing everything through their attire, and instead provoke curiosity and intrigue. To elaborate, this style of dressing leaves something to the imagination, which can be an effective way to capture attention. Dressing in this way prompts the viewer to think and imagine more, engaging their curiosity and maintaining their interest over time.

When it becomes less humid outside people are more likely or less likely to sweat? Answer:","output":"When it becomes less humid outside, people are more likely to sweat. Explanation: The passage states that as humidity increases, the rate of transpiration decreases. Transpiration is the process by which plants lose water through their leaves, which is analogous to sweating in humans. When humidity increases, the air is holding more water vapor, and it becomes more difficult for additional water to evaporate from the leaf surfaces. Similarly, when the air is more humid, it is harder for the human body to evaporate sweat from the skin, which slows down the cooling process. Consequently, when conditions outside become less humid, the evaporation of sweat from the skin is more effective, and people are more likely to sweat to cool down their body temperature."},{"instruction":"Kai used their judgment to decide not to buy the car.

Lets say an organism \\"mutates\\" due to a new allele for a gene that determines coat color. There are, theoretically, only three outcomes of that mutation:. Q: What are the key to species evolving? Choices: - microbes - parasites - radiation - mutations A:","output":"The key to species evolving, as mentioned in the given paragraph, is mutations. Mutations refer to the changes in the DNA sequence of an organism, which can result in diversity and contribute to the process of evolution. When an organism undergoes a mutation, it may produce a new allele for a gene, such as the one determining coat color mentioned in the example. Mutations can be caused by several factors, such as errors during DNA replication or the exposure to certain chemicals and radiation. They lead to genetic variations within a population, allowing species to adapt to their environment over time. This adaptation process, coupled with natural selection, drives evolution and promotes the survival of the fittest. While microbes, parasites, and radiation may have indirect impacts on the evolution of a species, they are not the primary driving forces behind it. Microbes and parasites could contribute to the selective pressures that impact evolution, but the fundamental mechanism remains the genetic mutations. Similarly, radiation can cause mutations and impact the evolutionary process. However, it is not the key factor in the overall process of species evolving; it's the mutation that affects an organism's genetic material that serves as the primary driving force in the concept of evolution. In conclusion, the key to species evolving is mutations as they are responsible for genetic changes and variations in a population. These genetic variations provide the basis for adaptation and eventually lead to the evolution of species over generations. Other factors like microbes, parasites, and radiation may have an indirect role but are not the central elements promoting evolution."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to count the number of vowels (letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') / consonants (all letters other than vowels) in the given sentence.

Options: a ) 299 , b ) 190 , c ) 276 , d ) 270 , e ) 281","output":"Let's first calculate the distance covered by the train while crossing the platform in 22 seconds. Total distance covered = (Speed of train) * (Time taken to cross the platform) Let's convert the speed of train from km/hr to m/s: 72 km/hr = (72 * 1000) / 3600 = 20 m/s Total distance covered = 20 m/s * 22 s = 440 m Now, the distance covered is the sum of the lengths of the train and the platform. Let the length of the train be x meters. x + 250 = 440 x = 440 - 250 x = 190 So, the length of the goods train is 190 meters. The correct answer is option b) 190."},{"instruction":"What happens next?

Answer the above question based on the context below: Cinderella and the Prince are having a picnic to celebrate their one-year anniversary. Meanwhile, at the Tremaine mansion, Cinderella's stepsisters Anastasia and Drizella are bitterly doing Cinderella's old chores. Anastasia wanders off to avoid work and stumbles upon the picnic. When the Fairy Godmother drops her wand, Anastasia takes it to her mother. In the ensuing struggle, Anastasia inadvertently turns the Fairy Godmother into a garden gnome. Lady Tremaine, reveling at yet another chance to ruin Cinderella's life, uses the wand to go back in time to the day the Grand Duke fitted the glass slipper on Cinderella. She uses the wand to expand the slipper so that it can fit Anastasia, and the Grand Duke declares she must be the girl the Prince is looking for. Cinderella arrives on the scene too late, and Lady Tremaine destroys Cinderella's other slipper – the only clue to her identity that she was the girl who danced with the Prince on the night of the ball. Cinderella decides to follow Lady Tremaine and her stepsisters to the palace with Jaq and Gus. At first the Prince claims Anastasia is not the girl he danced with at the ball, but Lady Tremaine uses the wand to alter his memory, and he accepts Anastasia as his bride. Jaq and Gus witness this and inform Cinderella that Lady Tremaine has the Fairy Godmother's wand. Cinderella poses as a maid to get into the Tremaines' room, but she is spotted by Lady Tremaine and captured by the palace guards as an intruder. Cinderella briefly touches the Prince's hand and he begins to recognize her, but Lady Tremaine orders Cinderella placed on the next ship out of the kingdom. The mice find the Prince and explain the whole story to him, and he rides off to intercept the ship just as it leaves port. The Prince embraces Cinderella and his true memories return. He asks her to marry him, and she accepts.","output":"In the given context, the name of the girl that the Prince danced with at the Ball is Cinderella. Cinderella is the protagonist of the story, and she had a magical night at the ball where she wore a beautiful dress and glass slippers, both of which were created by the Fairy Godmother. The Prince danced with Cinderella that night and fell in love with her. However, due to the evil actions of Cinderella's stepmother, Lady Tremaine, and the misuse of the Fairy Godmother's wand, Cinderella's true identity was temporarily hidden. Lady Tremaine altered both the size of the glass slipper and the Prince's memory, leading him to believe that Anastasia, one of Cinderella's stepsisters, was the girl he had danced with at the Ball. Despite the obstacles and challenges posed by Lady Tremaine and her daughters, Cinderella's true identity was eventually revealed, and she reunited with the Prince. In the end, the Prince recognized Cinderella as the girl he danced with at the Ball, and they got engaged to be married. This story once again highlights the triumph of good over evil and showcases the power of love, courage, and determination to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The true love between Cinderella and the Prince managed to withstand the deceit and treachery of the evil stepmother and stepsisters, eventually leading to a happy ending for the couple."},{"instruction":"talk to a group of friends or just one person as much as you like.

First, we need to add the numbers on the right side of the equation: 53 + 28 + 109. Here's how we can do it: - 53 + 28 = 81 (You add up 3 and 8, then carry the 1 from 1+5+2.) - Now, 81 + 109 = 190 (You add up 1, 9, and 1, then add 8 and 0.) 2. So, now our equation looks like this: -19*p = 190 3. To solve for p, we need to get p by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we have to divide both sides of the equation by -19. Here's why: Right now, p is being multiplied by -19, and we want to \\"undo\\" that multiplication to get just p by itself. So, we do the opposite of multiplying, which is dividing. 4. When we divide both sides by -19, the equation looks like this: p = 190 / -19 5. Now, we need to divide 190 by -19: - If a positive number divides a negative number, or a negative number divides a positive number, the result is a negative number. So, our answer will be negative. - Now, 190 divided by 19 is 10. Since the answer has to be negative, we get -10. 6. So, p = -10! And that's our answer! Our little math problem is solved, and we found out that p equals -10. Good job!"},{"instruction":"Solve 18 = 4*w + 2 for w. Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the equation 18 = 4*w + 2 for the variable w, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable w on one side of the equation. In this case, we want to isolate 4*w, so we need to move the constant term (+2) to the other side of the equation. To do that, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 18 - 2 = 4*w + 2 - 2 This simplifies to: 16 = 4*w Step 2: Solve for the variable w. Now that we have the equation in the form of 16 = 4*w, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 4: 16/4 = 4*w/4 4 = w So, the solution to the equation 18 = 4*w + 2 is w = 4."},{"instruction":"Is the following statement true? \\"Ecotourism also includes Big Game hunting.\\" Let's think first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"To evaluate the statement \\"Ecotourism also includes Big Game hunting,\\" let's first understand the definitions of ecotourism and Big Game hunting, and then compare their similarities and differences to determine if they can be associated. 1. Definition of Ecotourism: Ecotourism is a form of sustainable tourism that focuses on preserving and protecting the environment, promoting conservation, and supporting local communities. It involves responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of the local people, and involves interpretation and education. The main goals of ecotourism include creating a low-impact tourist experience, enhancing tourists' understanding and appreciation for ecosystems and cultures, and contributing to the local economy in a responsible manner. 2. Definition of Big Game hunting: Big Game hunting is a form of recreational hunting that targets large animals, typically mammals, such as elephants, lions, leopards, buffaloes, rhinoceros, bears, and deer. Big Game hunting has been practiced for centuries for various purposes, including sport, subsistence, and cultural reasons. 3. Comparison of Ecotourism and Big Game hunting: On the surface, ecotourism and Big Game hunting appear to be different forms of tourism. Ecotourism emphasizes environmental conservation and low-impact visits, while Big Game hunting involves targeting and killing large animals, which may seem contradictory to the principles of conservation. However, there are some cases in which Big Game hunting could be considered as a part of ecotourism. In some countries, Big Game hunting is regulated and controlled by government agencies or conservation organizations to manage wildlife populations and protect the environment. In these cases, hunting can contribute to conservation efforts by generating revenue from hunting licenses, permits, and fees that go towards funding conservation projects, wildlife research, and habitat management. Additionally, they might also support local communities by creating jobs, promoting community-based conservation, and providing income for local people. When Big Game hunting is practiced ethically and sustainably, it can contribute to environmental conservation, social well-being, and education, aligning with some of the principles of ecotourism. Conclusion: Given the above reasoning, the statement \\"Ecotourism also includes Big Game hunting\\" can be considered true in certain cases, but only when Big Game hunting is managed sustainably, contributes to conservation efforts, and positively impacts local communities. Nevertheless, the inclusion of Big Game hunting in ecotourism remains contentious, as it does not always align with the core principles of ecotourism."},{"instruction":"Definition: This task is to translate a news commentary given in English language into French language.

On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. and the situation: Rob is testing the properties of gas. To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down. Answer the following question: Would stage B see increased of decreased pressure than stage C? Answer:","output":"Stage B would see an increased pressure compared to stage C due to the changes in temperature that directly affect the kinetic energy of the gas molecules and their subsequent interactions with the container walls. In Stage A, the gas in the cylinder is at room temperature, which is 300 Kelvin. At this temperature, the gas molecules have a specific amount of kinetic energy, which is directly related to the pressure exerted by these molecules on the container walls as they collide against them. During Stage B, the gas is heated until the Kelvin temperature doubles to 600 Kelvin. As a result, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases. This increased kinetic energy leads to more forceful collisions with the walls of the container, causing the pressure of the gas to double as well. Consequently, Stage B experiences a higher pressure compared to Stage A due to the increased temperature. Finally, in Stage C, the gas is cooled down, which leads to a decrease in the Kelvin temperature. As the temperature decreases, so does the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. This results in less forceful collisions against the container walls, and in turn, a decrease in the pressure exerted by the gas. Therefore, the pressure in Stage C is lower than the pressure in Stage A and significantly lower than in Stage B. In summary, Stage B would see an increased pressure compared to Stage C, as the higher temperature in Stage B results in more forceful collisions by the gas molecules against the container walls, leading to a higher pressure. Conversely, cooling the gas in Stage C leads to less forceful collisions and a lower pressure than Stage B."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end?

In this text, the scene set is a group of people gathered in a hall, discussing the fate of Macpherson's son. An awkward silence has filled the room, and Alice approaches Adam to discuss a note. Step 2: Identify the relationships between characters and relevant interactions. Macpherson is the father of the missing son. Alice and Adam appear to share a secret, specifically about a note they have discovered. Macpherson and Mathis are standing near a crate. Their relationship and role in the gathering are not clear from the text. Step 3: Determine the important elements to focus on while completing the task. There is tension in the room because of an uncomfortable silence. The note that Alice and Adam have discovered seems to be a crucial plot point. Step 4: Continue the narrative by expanding on the existing elements and focusing on the critical components. Adam weighed the potential consequences of revealing the note. He knew that emotions were high and that introducing new information might intensify those feelings. \\"Let's wait until we have a better understanding of the context and the note's content,\\" he suggested. Alice nodded, understanding the reasoning behind Adam's decision. They both knew it was essential to proceed cautiously to avoid worsening the already delicate situation. Meanwhile, Macpherson continued his discussion with Mathis near the crate. Their exchange appeared to become more intense, drawing the attention of those present in the hall. The tension in the room grew, as the others started to wonder if there was something significant to be unveiled soon. Step 5: Unveil the further development of the narrative while maintaining the existing atmosphere and relationships between the characters. As the suspense in the room continued to rise, Alice and Adam shared a concerned glance, knowing that they might need to reveal the note sooner rather than later. Their priority was now to ease the tension and possibly provide some clarity on the son's fate, even if it meant disclosing their secret. They decided to monitor the situation closely, prepared to intervene as needed."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What key details about edwin e. roberts can be extracted from the following bio?

You will need to measure the dimensions that you want and determine the amount of pipe that you need from that. Try to break up the larger structure into 2’ sections. This will give your greenhouse greater stability and strength. Use relatively thin PVC pipe, no more than 1.5” wide. A good size to use would be closer to ¾”. Also, be sure that your joints and PVC pipe are sized so that they will fit together. This should be labeled, but you can test in the hardware store to be sure or you can ask a hardware store employee for help and advice. You will form the base and the walls together, out of connected sections of pipe. Begin by connecting vertical pipe sections at two foot intervals to horizontal pipe sections with T pipe joints. Form corners in the horizontal bottom section by attaching a T joint to an elbow joint with a very small section of pipe. When you are done, you should have a horizontal rectangle or square base with posts coming up from the T joints at regular intervals. The corner posts should come from the the last T joint on the long sides, with the elbow joints and short side of the base protruding out from the “wall”. Next, you will need to connect the wall pipes to the roof pipes and form a roof. It is important that the roof not be flat across, as this will diminish the amount of light which can get through, as well as cause rain and snow to build up on top of your structure. Form the central roof structure by creating a line of PVC pipe identical to one long side of the base. The pieces should be connected with four-way joints at the same intervals as your wall posts, except for the ends which will be capped in T joints. From the T joints and four-way joints, place short sections of pipe and cap them in 45° joints. Next, place 45° joints at the top of each of your wall posts. After that you will need to measure how much pipe you need to join the 45° joints of the wall to the 45° joints of the central roof structure. Cut this pipe once measured and fit it between each of the 45° joints. Place the greenhouse on the raised or ground bed that you want to cover. You can attach it to the ground with stakes and ties or to a raised bed with a conduit anchor but be sure to only attach one long side. This will allow you to lift the structure to water and care for your plants. The final step will be to cover the structure with plastic or cloth, depending on why you need the cover to begin with. If using sheet plastic, use thin clear plastic and cover the whole structure with one large sheet if possible. Whatever material you use, wrap the structure and then secure with tape (duct or packaging). You’re done! What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides instructions on building a modular greenhouse using PVC pipes and plastic or cloth covering.

Yes or no? Answer: NEPTUNE logo Question: how many days it take for neptune to orbit once Answer:","output":"Neptune takes approximately 164.8 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. However, when discussing the rotation of a planet, it is essential to differentiate between the two types of rotation: a sidereal day and a solar day. A sidereal day refers to the time it takes for a planet to complete a full rotation on its axis relative to the background stars. Neptune's sidereal day is about 16 hours and 6 minutes. A solar day, on the other hand, refers to the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky as observed from the planet's surface. Due to Neptune's highly-tilted axis (28.3 degrees) and its lengthy orbital period, its solar day is quite challenging to determine accurately. However, estimates suggest that Neptune's solar day is roughly 16 hours."},{"instruction":"Mietinnön puolesta äänestäminen tarkoittaa siis myös sitä, että nuorten turkkilaisten avarakatseisuutta pyritään lisäämään yhteyksillä heidän eurooppalaisiin ikätovereihinsa; se tarkoittaa myös suvaitsevaisuuden kehittämistä, ja näin voidaan toivoa, että Turkin kansa yleensä tiedostaa välttämättömän ja hyödyllisen demokratisoinnin tarpeen.

Outside, the freighter heads right for them, blasting its horn, and despite Ashland's best efforts, collides with the cruise ship, sinking it.The next morning, a handful of survivors, including Marshall, his wife Margaret (Sally Ann Howes), their children Robin and Ben, a young officer named Nick (Nick Mancuso), his love interest Lori (Victoria Burgoyne), the ship's stand up comic Jackie (Saul Rubinek), and a passenger, Mrs. Morgan (Kate Reid), are adrift on a large piece of wreckage. Ashland surfaces nearby, and is brought aboard barely conscious. Later, the survivors come upon the black freighter, unaware it is the ship which attacked them. Finding a boarding ladder slung from the stern, they climb aboard, but not before the ladder plunges into the sea as the officers try to climb it with the injured Ashland. When all are finally aboard, Jackie tries to rally the survivors with humor, but a cable seizes him by the ankle, and he is lifted and swung outboard by one of the ship's cranes, which lowers the thrashing comic into the water before cutting him loose, to be swept astern and lost.Shocked, the survivors explore the corridors of the empty, echoing vessel, finding only cobwebs and 1930s memorabilia.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

Thirteen of the submarines were destroyed, of which authorities have found 11. But, according to the local government, this recent find is the \\"best preserved\\" of them all. Researchers believe that the damage to the front of the vessel indicates that it struck a mine with its upper deck.

The names of 34,957 of their comrades, whose remains were never recovered because of constant artillery fire, are engraved on the interior walls.

Author: Jefferson Chase es/kl (AFP, Reuters) ||||| BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The well-preserved wreck of a World War One German submarine, possibly still containing the bodies of its 23 crew members, has been found off the Belgian coast. The well-preserved wreck of a World War One German submarine, possibly still containing the bodies of 23 crew members, found off the Belgian coast, is seen in this handout picture provided by KB Vlaanderen on September 19, 2017. KB Vlaanderen- Tomas Termote/Handout via REUTERS The use of submarines, often referred to as U-boats, in World War One to disrupt British trade routes in the English Channel and the North Sea was a key part of German tactics. The 93 German U-boats stationed in Belgian ports downed more than 2,500 ships but were also a target themselves, with 70 of them lost at sea, killing 1,200 sailors. It was not yet clear which of the 11 known wrecks of the German submarines had been found, and authorities said they would not give the exact location of the wreck to deter looters. “Of the 11 downed U-Boats in Belgian waters, this one is the best preserved example,” the province of West Flanders said. Belgium’s North Sea minister said he would investigate whether the wreck could be recognized as a heritage site. ||||| An intact German submarine from the First World War containing the bodies of 23 people has been found on the bottom of the ocean off the coast of Belgium. The U-boat, a UB II-type submarine, was found between 82 and 98 feet below the surface, with damage to its upper deck. Carl Decaluwe, the governor of Western Flanders, said the find on the floor of the North Sea is “unique”. “It’s quite amazing that we found something like this,” he said. “The impact damage was at the front, but the submarine remains closed and there are 23 people still onboard.” The boat, which is 88 feet long and 20 feet wide and was found encrusted with barnacles and seaweed, appears to have struck a mine. Two torpedo tubes have been destroyed but the lower tube is intact and closed. Decaluwe, who said the U-boat was found by researchers, declined to provide details about its location until the site has been protected. He has contacted the German ambassador because “we need to see what can do” with the remains. Around 18 U-boats were stationed with the Flanders Flotilla in Bruges between 1915 and 1918. Thirteen of them were destroyed and this is the 11th wreckage to be found in Belgian waters. Allied warships and cargo ships were easy pickings for the German subs that were launched from Bruges, just across the English Channel. A website, Uboat.net, tracks the submarines lost in both World War One and World War One, as well as casualties suffered by their staff. According to the BBC, of the 375 German submarines that set sail from German ports in World War One, 202 were lost in action, and of 17,000 men who served, more than 5,100 lost their lives. The German submarines, however, managed to sink 2,600 allied shipping vessels. Earlier this year, unseen photographs of German World War One submarines washed up on the English coast were published for the very first time. Historic England revealed the images to mark the centenary of Germany’s declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare on Britain. Last year, the a German U-boat was been discovered at the bottom of the sea off the Scottish coast. Experts believe it to be the UB-85, a submarine which was sunk by HMS Coreopsis in 1918. |||||Summary:","output":"An intact German World War I U-boat submarine has been discovered off the coast of West Flanders in Belgium, 98 ft below the surface of the North Sea.

Bankhead was known for her husky voice, outrageous personality, and devastating wit. Originating some of the 20th century theater's preeminent roles in comedy and melodrama, she gained acclaim as an actress on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1933, Bankhead nearly died following a five-hour emergency hysterectomy due to venereal disease, which she claimed she had contracted from George Raft. Only 70 lb (32 kg) when she left the hospital, she stoically said to her doctor, \\"Don't think this has taught me a lesson!\\" In 1934, after recuperating in Alabama, she returned to England. After only a short stay, she was called back to New York to play in The Little Foxes. Although Bette Davis played the leading character in the 1941 film version, she openly admitted in later years that she had emulated Bankhead in the role. Bankhead continued to play in various performances over the next few years, gaining excellent notices for her portrayal of Elizabeth in a revival of Somerset Maugham's The Circle. Returning to Broadway, Bankhead's career stalled at first in unmemorable plays. When she appeared in Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra with her then-husband, John Emery, the New York Evening Post critic John Mason Brown wrote, \\"Tallulah Bankhead barged down the Nile last night as Cleopatra - and sank.\\" David O. Selznick, producer of Gone with the Wind (1939) called her the \\"first choice among established stars\\" to play Scarlett O'Hara. Although her screen test for the role in black-and-white was superb, she photographed poorly in Technicolor. Selznick also reportedly believed that at age 36, she was too old to play Scarlett, who is 16 at the beginning of the film (the role eventually went to Vivien Leigh). Selznick sent Kay Brown to Bankhead to discuss the possibility of Bankhead playing prostitute Belle Watling in the film, which she turned down. The search for Scarlett O'Hara was documented in \\"The Scarlet O'Hara Wars\\" episode of the miniseries Moviola, where the very similar Carrie Nye played Bankhead, being nominated for an Emmy Award. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what else notable occurred during this time?","output":"During this period of Tallulah Bankhead's life, many notable events took place; however, one stands out significantly due to its impact on her life and her career. In 1933, Bankhead nearly lost her life following a five-hour emergency hysterectomy due to venereal disease. As stated in the article, \\"In 1933, Bankhead nearly died following a five-hour emergency hysterectomy due to venereal disease, which she claimed she had contracted from George Raft.\\" This was a distressing event, as it left her weighing barely 70 lbs when she left the hospital. Despite the severity of the situation, she remained undaunted and dismissive of its potential lessons, as she told her doctor, \\"Don't think this has taught me a lesson!\\" Another significant event during this time was her return to America from England in 1934. Despite her health issues, she was called back to New York to perform in \\"The Little Foxes\\", marking a remarkable recovery and return to her acting career. She earned high acclaim for her performance, indicating a strong comeback in the American theatre. Furthermore, Bankhead was considered the \\"first choice among established stars\\" by producer David O. Selznick to play the role of Scarlett O'Hara in the iconic film, \\"Gone with the Wind\\" in 1939. This was a rarified opportunity validating her prominence in the film industry. Even though she was ultimately passed over for the role due to concerns about her age and her appearance in Technicolor, the fact that she was initially considered demonstrates her stature during this period. Selznick even discussed the possibility of her playing the role of Belle Watling, a prostitute in the same movie, though she turned it down. These events illustrate a challenging, yet ultimately triumphant period in Bankhead’s life, marked both by personal hardships and professional recognition. Her resilience, talent, and indomitable spirit combined to keep her at the forefront of American theater and cinema, defining her as one of the most notable actresses of the 20th century."},{"instruction":"Instructions: Given a sentence in Chinese, generate a new Chinese sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

On the other hand, Sentence B states, \\"He took his dog to the veterinarian for a health check-up.\\" This sentence is logical, as a veterinarian is a qualified medical professional specializing in the healthcare of animals, including dogs. A veterinarian is specifically trained to diagnose, treat, and manage a variety of animal health issues, making them the appropriate professional to take a dog to for a health check-up.

Answer the above question based on the context below: From the days of 78 rpm discs, when relatively little modern music was being put on record, Walton was favoured by the record companies. In 1929 the small, new Decca company recorded eleven movements from Façade, with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble, with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton's friend and colleague Constant Lambert. In the 1930s, Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc, both on Decca, the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Viola Concerto with Frederick Riddle and the LSO conducted by the composer. In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older, larger rival, EMI. The EMI producer Walter Legge arranged a series of recordings of Walton's major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence (he used an earthier expression), Walter Legge would record it.Walton himself, although a reluctant conductor, conducted many of the EMI recordings, and some for other labels. He made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, the Façade Suites, the Partita, Belshazzar's Feast, and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and The First of the Few. Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc, including the Cello Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum.Almost all Walton's works have been recorded for commercial release.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Which phone does Kristen use to call James? Title: The Strangers Movie plot: James (Scott Speedman) and his girlfriend Kristen (Liv Tyler) arrive at James' childhood summer home, tired and irritable after a long evening at a friend's wedding reception. It is revealed that while they were there, James proposed to Kristen and she refused, claiming she is not ready for marriage yet. James calls his friend Mike to come pick him up in the morning. Shortly after 4 a.m., there is a knock at the door, surprising to them both since the house is so remote and far from any civilisation for miles. They open the door and a young blonde woman, whose face is obscured by low lighting, is standing on the porch asking for Tamara. When told that she is at the wrong house, she asks if they're sure, then leaves with the casual caveat that she will \\"see them later\\". Due to the tension between him and Kristen, James leaves to go for a drive and to buy cigarettes. While alone in the house, Kristen hears another knock at the door; she refuses to open it after realising that it is the same woman from earlier, who has returned to ask for Tamara again. She leaves. Kristen then starts hearing strange noises around the outside of the house and her cell phone goes missing. She calls James using the house phone but the line goes dead. The smoke alarm goes off and Kristen disarms it as there is another loud bang on the front door. She goes to the kitchen and grabs a large knife. When she returns, the smoke alarm cover has been placed on one of the chairs, so Kristen knows somebody has been inside. When she hears a noise from the back yard, she goes to the back door and opens the curtains to find a man wearing a sack mask staring back at her. Panicked, she hides in the bedroom until James returns. When James arrives back, she explains what has happened and he goes to investigate. He finds his car ransacked and the blonde woman, now wearing a doll mask, watching him from afar in the street. His phone has had its battery stolen and he realizes the house has been breached.

In this case, 'i' = 2. So we need to extract every 2nd element starting from the 1st (or potentially 0th if zero-indexed) element. Here are the steps we can follow for this task: Step 1: First, identify what 'i' and 'A' are. Here 'i' = 2 and 'A' is the provided list of elements. Step 2: Next check if 'i' is a valid index (greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of the array). 'i' = 2 is a valid index for the given 'A' as 'A' has more than 2 elements. Step 3: Next, let's start the process of extracting every ith element. Here, we should note that array indices may be zero-based or one-based. As there isn't a specific indication, we can assume this is one-based, implying we count from the first element of the array. Step 4: Since 'i' = 2 and we start from 1st element, we will get every 2nd element starting from the 1st element. So, we will get elements at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and so on until we reach the end of 'A'. Step 5: Read and store these elements into a new array. Step 6: The final output will be this new array containing all the extracted elements. Let's perform these steps. - Input: i = 2, A = ['Y', 'J', '5207', 'J', '4773', '1289', '2767', '4355', '9913', 't', '1397', 'h', '3789', '9755', '9363', 't', 'N', 'R', 'm', 'W', 'A', 'u', '7529', '7405', 'f', '7399', 'P', '9059', 'X', '1871', '833', '1007', '1559', '4569', '1789', '8775', 'o', '9855', 'x', 'X'] - Output: Since the extraction goes according to the steps outlined above, the expected output will be the elements at positions 1, 3, 5, ... which are ['Y', '5207', '4773', '2767', '9913', '1397', '3789', '9363', 'N', 'm', 'A', '7529', 'f', 'P', 'X', '833', '1559', '1789', 'o', 'x']. The steps provided above can be translated into several programming languages to automate this task. The general logic involves looping through the array at every ith step and extracting the element at that position. This solution assumes the array is one-indexed per standard mathematical notation, however, variations could easily be made for a zero-indexed array."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: – The FBI is investigating whether alleged perpetrators of a mass lynching nearly 70 years ago in the South remain alive and well, the Guardian reports. Using a suspect-list provided by civil rights activists, investigators knocked on the door of 86-year-old Charlie Peppers in Monroe, Georgia. The subject of their chat: the Moore's Ford Bridge lynching of 1946, in which two young, black couples were killed just ten miles away. \\"Heck no,\\" says Peppers of his possible involvement. \\"The blacks are blaming people that didn’t even know what happened back then.\\" He's likely referring to a 2013 NAACP video (excerpted here) in which Peppers' nephew, Wayne Watson, 57, accuses Charlie and several others of being involved. \\"All through my life, I heard them talk about the Moore’s Ford and the lynching,\\" says Wayne. \\"I’m tired of it, when you go through life, and you’re living with lies,\\" adds Wayne, who says his family shunned him after he started dating a black woman. History tells us that on July 25, 1946, a white mob assaulted two black couples—Dorothy and Roger Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey—shooting them 60 times and ripping an unborn baby from Malcom's body. A federal investigation led to no indictments; the state's probe was reopened in 2000 and the FBI's in 2007, without success. \\"There is a lot of pain, a lot of frustration and a lot of disappointment\\" over the unsolved murders, says a Georgia state representative. Meanwhile, a new report says 700 more US lynchings occurred than previously believed—including a wave of violence against black sharecroppers in Arkansas that took 237 lives, the Daily Beast reports. Article:","output":"Once upon a time, nearly 70 years ago, in a place called the South, there was a very sad and scary event called the Moore's Ford Bridge lynching. In this event, two young black couples were hurt by a group of white people. This happened just ten miles away from a town called Monroe, Georgia. Now, some very brave and smart people at a big organization called the FBI are trying to find out if the people who did this bad thing are still alive. They have a list of people they think might know about what happened back then, and they went to talk to an old man named Charlie Peppers. Charlie is 86 years old and lives in Monroe, Georgia. The FBI asked him if he had anything to do with the terrible event, but he said, \\"Heck no.\\" Charlie thinks that people are blaming him and others who didn't even know what happened back then. A few years ago, there was a video where Charlie's nephew, Wayne Watson, accused Charlie and some other people of being involved in the lynching. Wayne seems sad and says he's tired of lies his family has told him. The story of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynching is a very important part of history that we must learn from. On the day it happened, July 25, 1946, two black couples, Dorothy and Roger Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey were hurt by the white mob. Many years have passed, and people have tried to solve the case, but they haven't been able to – which makes a lot of people feel sad and frustrated. Recently, a new report said that there were 700 more such scary events than people knew about in the past. This included terrible things that happened to black sharecroppers in a place called Arkansas. It is important that we remember these sad stories and learn from them, so that we can work together to create a kinder and more understanding world for everyone."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"a fuzzy little dog\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"A wooly, little white pup.\\"?","output":"If the premise, \\"a fuzzy little dog,\\" is true, it provides us with certain information about the subject (a dog) being described. It tells us that the dog in question has a small size and a fuzzy or fluffy coat. However, this description does not offer enough specific information to definitively entail the hypothesis, \\"A wooly, little white pup.\\" To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, it is important to analyze both descriptions and evaluate their compatibility. The term \\"wooly\\" and \\"fuzzy\\" are similar in meaning. When describing a dog's coat, both terms imply that the texture of the dog's hair is soft and lofty or curly. While it is reasonable to assume that a fuzzy dog might have a wooly coat, it is not explicitly mentioned, so it does not guarantee that the premise \\"a fuzzy little dog\\" entails \\"A wooly, little white pup.\\" The word \\"little\\" appears in both the premise and hypothesis, specifying the small size of the dog. In this case, there is a compatibility in the descriptions, and this aspect of the hypothesis can be considered as entailed by the premise since both descriptions refer to a small-sized dog. However, the color of the dog is not mentioned in the premise \\"a fuzzy little dog.\\" The hypothesis specifies a \\"white pup\\" while the premise remains ambiguous in terms of the color of the dog's coat. Since there is no mention of the dog's color in the premise, it does not provide enough information to determine if the premise entails a dog with a white coat. Lastly, the premise refers to a \\"dog,\\" while the hypothesis mentions a \\"pup.\\" These terms can be almost synonymous in general conversation, as 'pup' is often used to refer to young dogs or used affectionately for dogs of any age. However, a pup is officially a young dog, usually below one-year-old. The premise does not specify the age of the dog, so it does not entail the dog's age, which is pre-determined by the term \\"pup.\\" As a result, there remains ambiguity regarding whether the premise entails the hypothesis. In conclusion, although there is some compatibility between the premise \\"a fuzzy little dog\\" and the hypothesis \\"A wooly, little white pup,\\" the premise does not provide sufficient specific information to definitively entail the hypothesis. The fuzziness of the coat does not guarantee wooliness, the color of the dog remains unspecified, and the age of the dog is ambiguous. Consequently, based on the available information, it cannot be definitively concluded that the premise entails the hypothesis \\"A wooly, little white pup.\\""},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that contains a fact.","output":"Penguins are birds that cannot fly, but they are great swimmers!"},{"instruction":"Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city.

The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Jessica's plan? A:","output":"Under Jessica's plan, the number of animals is likely to decrease. Emitting more anthropogenic gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, contributes to the greenhouse effect, which leads to global warming and climate change. This will negatively impact the planet and its ecosystems by causing more frequent and severe extreme weather events, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and changes in precipitation patterns, as well as upsetting the delicate balance of habitats and food sources for wildlife. As a result, many species may experience a decline in population, face habitat loss, and could even become extinct. This is particularly true for species that have limited ranges and those living in habitats already threatened by climate change, such as those in polar and alpine regions, or coastal ecosystems. In contrast, Milly's proposal to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere will help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change, protect ecosystems, and promote the well-being of the planet's diverse species.

But, let's face it, their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents. The Eurovision contest gradually turned into one big political circus over the years and Lordi probably just won because their song finally brought a little change and  even more importantly - because their whole act sort of ingeniously spoofed the whole annual event. The absolute last thing Lordi's first (and hopefully last) horror film brings is change and ingenuity. \\"Dark Floors\\", based on an idea of the lead singer and starring the rest of the band in supportive roles, is a truly unimaginative and hopeless accumulation of clichés. The immense budget (\\"Dark Floors\\" supposedly is the most expensive Finnish film ever) definitely assures greatly macabre set pieces and impressive make-up art, but what's the point where there's no story that is worth telling? The film takes is set in a busy hospital where a bunch of people, among them a father and his young daughter with an unidentifiable illness, become trapped in the elevator during a power breakdown. When the doors open again, the floors are empty and it looks as if the hospital lies abandoned since many years already. Trying to reach the exit, the group stumbles upon several morbid and inexplicable obstacles, like eyeless corpses, screaming ghosts and Heavy Metal monsters emerging from the floors. The only three points I'm handing out to \\"Dark Floors\\" are exclusively intended for the scenery and the adequate tension building during the first half of the film. For as long as the sinister events don't require an explanation, the atmosphere is quite creepy, but as soon as you realize the explanation will a) be very stupid or b) never come, the wholesome just collapses like an unstable house of cards. Lordi's costumes never really were scary to begin with (except maybe to traditional Eurovision fans) and, in combination with a story more reminiscent to Asian ghost-horror, they just look downright pathetic and misfit. With all the national myths and truly unique exterior filming locations, I personally always presumed Finland  The Land of a Thousand Lakes  would be the ideal breeding ground for potentially horrific horror tales, but I guess that's another disillusion on my account.

You have to classify the questions into \\"Extractive\\", \\"Abstractive\\", or \\"Yes-no\\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by concatenating extracts taken from a context into a summary while answering abstractive questions involves paraphrasing the context using novel sentences. Yes-no question is a question whose expected answer is one of two choices, one that affirms the question and one that denies the question. Typically, the choices are either yes or no. Problem:We collected tweets associated to a dozen US mainstream news websites, i.e. most trusted sources described in BIBREF18, with the Streaming API, and we referred to Hoaxy API BIBREF16 for what concerns tweets containing links to 100+ US disinformation outlets. We filtered out articles associated to less than 50 tweets. The resulting dataset contains overall sim 1.7 million tweets for mainstream news, collected in a period of three weeks (February 25th, 2019-March 18th, 2019), which are associated to 6,978 news articles, and sim 1.6 million tweets for disinformation, collected in a period of three months (January 1st, 2019-March 18th, 2019) for sake of balance of the two classes, which hold 5,775 distinct articles. Diffusion censoring effects BIBREF14 were correctly taken into account in both collection procedures. We provide in Figure FIGREF4 the distribution of articles by source and political bias for both news domains. For what concerns the Italian scenario we first collected tweets with the Streaming API in a 3-week period (April 19th, 2019-May 5th, 2019), filtering those containing URLs pointing to Italian official newspapers websites as described in BIBREF22; these correspond to the list provided by the association for the verification of newspaper circulation in Italy (Accertamenti Diffusione Stampa). We instead referred to the dataset provided by BIBREF23 to obtain a set of tweets, collected continuously since January 2019 using the same Twitter endpoint, which contain URLs to 60+ Italian disinformation websites. In order to get balanced classes (April 5th, 2019-May 5th, 2019), we retained data collected in a longer period w.r.t to mainstream news. In both cases we filtered out articles with less than 50 tweets; overall this dataset contains sim 160k mainstream tweets, corresponding to 227 news articles, and sim 100k disinformation tweets, corresponding to 237 news articles. We provide in Figure FIGREF5 the distribution of articles according to distinct sources for both news domains. Question: Which two news domains are country-independent? Solution:","output":"In this task, you are given a context from an academic paper and a question based on that context. Your goal is to classify the question into one of three categories: Extractive, Abstractive, or Yes-no.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The given sentences are as follows: Sentence 1: Selling to the government Sentence 2: Stolen from the government To determine if the truth of the first sentence implies the truth of the second sentence, we need to analyze them more closely and understand their possible relationships. The first sentence, \\"Selling to the government,\\" suggests a scenario where an individual or entity is engaging in a transaction with the government wherein goods or services are exchanged for monetary compensation. This type of activity is common for businesses and organizations that have contracts or agreements with government agencies or departments. The second sentence, \\"Stolen from the government,\\" implies a situation where an individual or entity has unlawfully taken possession of goods or resources that belong to the government. This statement suggests theft or criminal activity, which is morally and legally wrong. Considering the meanings of the two sentences, they describe two entirely different situations - engaging in a legal transaction with the government and committing theft from the government. It is essential to note that these situations are not mutually inclusive or exclusive; they are independent of one another. That is, one can engage in selling to the government and not steal from the government. Likewise, it is possible for someone to steal from the government without selling to the government. Moreover, it is feasible that an individual or entity can both sell to the government and engage in theft from the government, although these actions would typically be unrelated since one is legal while the other is illegal. Therefore, the truth of the first sentence, \\"Selling to the government,\\" does not imply the truth of the second sentence, \\"Stolen from the government.\\" The truth of these sentences is determined independently, and the relationship between them is not defined by the truth of the other. In summary, while both sentences describe interactions between an individual or entity and the government, they refer to different types of interactions - legal transactions versus theft. The truth of one sentence does not dictate the truth of the other, as they are not logically connected in a provable way."},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem?

Article: There are a number of special days of the year that are celebrated in different countries. The origins of most of the days are unknown. They were certainly not created by individual people. Other days, however, especially those celebrated in western countries, often owe their origins to a particular person. One of the most popular of these, even though it is fairly recent, is Mother's Day. Mothers have always been highly regarded in all cultures. The ancient Romans had a festival known as Hilaria, during which children took presents to the temple of the \\"Mother of the Gods\\". The Christian Church adopted this idea and called it Mothering Sunday. However, over the years this custom was gradually forgotten and almost disappeared by the end of the 19th century. Born in 1864 in Virginia, USA, Anna Jarvis was a school teacher and believed children should show gratitude to their mothers for all their love and care. Encouraged by a friend, she wrote to thousands of important people--politicians, churchmen, doctors, city officials--and asked them to support her idea: a special day of the year for thanking mothers. In 1910 the Governor of West Virginia introduced Mother's Day into the state. The date chosen was May 10--the second Sunday in May, which is still observed in America today. This date was chosen because May 10 was the date on which in 1908 Anna Jarvis's mother had died. In 1914 President Woodrow Wilson made May 10 the official date for Mother's Day throughout the United States. Soon there was a Mother's Day International Association and the custom began to be adopted in many countries of the world. Anna Jarvis, a sad and disillusioned woman, died in 1948. The custom she had worked so hard to establish and which had become almost universal had lost its original purpose. It had been taken over by business. Like Christmas, the giving of presents and the sending of cards had become a multi-million-dollar industry. Question: The story is about _ .

The next morning, Francis and Alan visit Dr. Caligari's spectacle, where he opens a coffin-like box to reveal the sleeping Cesare. Upon Dr. Caligari's orders, Cesare awakens and answers questions from the audience. Despite Francis' protests, Alan asks \\"How long will I live?\\".

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If less sediment erodes the land, it will result in LESS erosion by the ocean. The supposed perturbation influences the second effect mentioned because the reduced amount of eroded sediment means there will be less material available for the waves to move and act like sandpaper.

He said at a press conference the world's cities consume 75 percent of the world's energy and produce 80 percent of the emissions which cause climate change. \\"The problem of our planet is an urban problem,\\" Johnson said. He said the British capital wants to use the Olympics \\"to drive the greening and the improvement of our city\\" and noted that London is committed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 percent by 2025. Johnson said the key measure was being taken to solve problems relating to housing and commercial buildings, which accounted for 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in London. This involved retrofitting -- installing lagging -- in large numbers of public buildings. Johnson proclaimed himself a \\"passionate cyclist\\" and said he would push ahead with cycle superhighways around London. London's air quality problem, he said, was caused by vehicle emissions from 8,300 worn and used diesel buses, which could be replaced by low-carbon vehicles.

To provide a detailed and long response, it is important to understand the context of this era, the events leading up to the withdrawal of troops, and the reasons behind the decision. The Reconstruction Era began after the American Civil War (1861-1865), with the main aim of reintegrating the southern states that had seceded from the Union and forming policies to protect and ensure the rights of newly freed African American slaves. During this period, both the North and the South faced political, economic, and social challenges in reestablishing unity and reforming the devastated southern states. The presence of federal troops was crucial in maintaining law and order in the southern states, as well as enforcing civil rights legislation and protecting the rights of the newly freed slaves. However, the withdrawal of troops from the South was a gradual process that occurred in multiple stages over several years. There are two key events that marked the conclusive end of this process. First, the Compromise of 1877 was a decisive political agreement that emerged out of the contentious and disputed U.S. presidential election of 1876 between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel J. Tilden. The Compromise effectively resolved the impasse by granting Hayes the presidency in exchange for the Republicans' promise to withdraw federal troops from the southern states (Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida), effectively marking the end of the Reconstruction Era. The second event took place on April 10, 1877, when President Hayes issued an executive order for the withdrawal of federal troops from the Louisiana statehouse, the final remaining garrison of federal troops in the South. This symbolically marked the end of military support for the Reconstruction government in the region and revitalized the efforts of southern Democrats to restore white conservative rule. The withdrawal of troops from the South significantly impacted the enforcement of civil rights legislation and the protection of African American rights. This decision led to the rise of white supremacist groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan, and the implementation of repressive policies, such as the \\"Jim Crow\\" laws that endorsed racial segregation and the disenfranchisement of African Americans. Consequently, the gains made during the Reconstruction Era were eroded, and the civil rights movement would not gain significant traction until the mid-20th century. In conclusion, the government withdrew troops from the South mainly as a result of political negotiations arising from the Compromise of 1877 after the disputed presidential election of 1876. The withdrawal was finalized on April 10, 1877, with the removal of federal troops from the Louisiana statehouse. The decision to withdraw troops had major consequences on the civil rights progress made during the Reconstruction Era and influenced the sociopolitical landscape of the United States in the years that followed."},{"instruction":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: BEIJING, June. 30(Xinhua)----There are ten times as many Chinese newspapers and magazines than there were 30 years ago.

Later they became precious family heirlooms passed from generation to generation, but as medieval art fell out of fashion in the early modern period, their provenance was often lost. The earliest record of a collection is the 1598 inventory of the dukes of Bavaria, which contain several boxwood miniatures.Of the surviving works, over one hundred re-emerged in the 19th century Parisian antiquarian market, then the leading market for medieval art. During this period, they were acquired by collectors such as the British collector Richard Wallace (1818–1890), who purchased Count van Nieuwerkerke's (1811–1892) entire collection, including two boxwood prayer nuts, the Vienna-born collector of objets d'art Frédéric Spitzer (1815−1890), and Ferdinand de Rothschild (1839–1898). Spitzer was not a purist and commissioned metalsmiths to produce modern versions, or copies, of a variety of medieval artworks. Today, there are four surviving boxwood carvings he had augmented for the market.When the American financier J. P. Morgan purchased Baron Albert Oppenheim's collection in 1906, he acquired four boxwood miniatures, including a triptych with the Crucifixion and Resurrection, and a prayer nut showing the Carrying of the Cross, all of which are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The Canadian publishing magnate Kenneth Thomson was an important collector for over 50 years, and his collection included the world's largest gathering of boxwood miniatures, including two skulls, two triptychs, and six prayer beads.

It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - The Sava is a river in Central Europe, a right side tributary of the Danube. It flows through Slovenia, Croatia, along the northern border of Bosnia and Herzegovina, through Serbia, discharging into the Danube in Belgrade.

Historians in the 19th century came to apply the name \\"Capetian\\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice (see House of France). They were sometimes called \\"the third race of kings\\", the Merovingians being the first, and the Carolingians being the second. The name is derived from the nickname of Hugh, the first Capetian King, who was known as \\"Hugh Capet\\". The direct succession of French kings, father to son, from 987 to 1316, of thirteen generations in almost 330 years, was unparallelled in recorded history. - A natural border is a border between states or their subdivisions which is concomitant with natural formations such as rivers, mountain ranges, or deserts.

'The Last Fiasco' attempts to tell a thrilling tale but ultimately falls prey to all the shallow traps that a viewer would hope to avoid when looking for an invigorating film experience. From the butchering of a compelling premise to blatant disregard for character development, this movie can be safely deemed as the poster child for disappointment on the silver screen. First and foremost, the lackluster script is unable to seize the potential of the movie's underlying concept. The story starts strong as it explores themes of betrayal, revenge, and redemption, but it quickly meanders into redundancy and predictability. The dialogue bounces between clichés and cringe-worthy one-liners, leaving one in a perpetual loop of sighs and eye rolls. The story's overall structure struggles to maintain cohesion, failing to follow a clear narrative path. By the end, the audience is left with a muddled mess of a story that hardly resonates beyond the screen. The characters, brought to life by an ensemble cast, tragically suffer at the hands of the poor script and direction. Their backstories are clumsily recounted, stripping away any opportunity for the audience to form an emotional connection. The protagonist, meant to be the epitome of heroism, comes across as a flat and uninspiring figure lacking any kind of personality or relatability. The antagonist, on the other hand, borders on being cartoonish and cliched rather than imposing a palpable sense of dread. The supporting characters fall into tired and overused archetypes, leaving no room for surprise or invigoration. Another facet that leaves much to be desired is the visual storytelling. The cinematography is uninspired and plagued with a washed-out color palette that feels dull and listless. Lackluster camera work equates to generic, mundane shots that lack creativity. The lack of visual variation becomes strikingly apparent as the film trudges along. Equally disappointing is the editing, where abrupt leaps in time and scenes disrupt the narrative flow, further confusing the viewers. A major point of contention lies in the action sequences; despite being positioned as the film's most exciting moments, they fall woefully short due to choppy choreography and uninspiring visual effects. The film's score, which could have salvaged some aspects of the movie, seems completely divorced from the emotional pulse of the story. It is generic and formulaic, failing to evoke even a modicum of excitement or anticipation essential for a thrilling film experience. By ignoring the opportunity to engage the audience through evocative scores and clever sound design, 'The Last Fiasco' finds itself more in line with second-rate TV movies than a cinematic masterpiece. In conclusion, 'The Last Fiasco' is an unfortunate disappointment that serves as a cautionary tale on how a promising idea can go awry due to egregious errors in various aspects of filmmaking. With a floundering script, lifeless characters, and lackluster visual storytelling, it becomes an arduous feat to find any aspect of this film worth recommending. The viewer is better off saving both their time and money, avoiding this trainwreck entirely. As it stands, 'The Last Fiasco' is a testament to the disastrous end of creativity in the realm of modern cinema."},{"instruction":"Please add punctuation to this: Sometime replicas of briefcases would be used to hold the money Punctuation version:","output":"Sometime, replicas of briefcases would be used to hold the money.

The sentence would end with an explanation of the situation, possible resolution efforts, or thought processes of the characters involved. The following example expands on the scenario: \\"Lawrence wanted to take their girlfriend to dinner, but Kyle wouldn't let them due to the unresolved conflict from an earlier dispute – a rivalry that had taken root when both of them had unintentionally vied for the attention of the same person months ago. Back then, Lawrence and Kyle had been inseparable, the kind of friends who would do anything for each other. The arrival of Jamie, an attractive and charming newcomer to their social circle, changed everything. Unbeknownst to the other, both Lawrence and Kyle had been smitten by Jamie’s captivating presence. As time went on, the once-close friends found themselves jockeying for Jamie's attention, each one attempting to subtly outdo the other. The more they competed, the more they grew distant, their once-strong bond slowly eroding to a point of near collapse. Lawrence eventually won Jamie's heart, plunging Kyle into a bitter mix of jealousy and resentment. With this context, it becomes clear why Kyle wasn't keen on allowing Lawrence to take Jamie to dinner. In a way, it was both an act of defiance and a coping mechanism for his bruised ego. Refusing Lawrence’s request was a final stand to preserve his dignity and claim at least some measure of pride. In the days that followed, both Lawrence and Kyle struggled with the emotional weight of their disintegrating friendship. Lawrence missed the camaraderie they once shared and secretly wished Kyle could find a way to accept their new relationship. Meanwhile, Kyle began a painful process of introspection, questioning his growing animosity towards his old friend and trying to understand his inability to let go of the past. Late one night, with all these thoughts churning in his mind, Kyle made a decision. He picked up his phone and called Lawrence, swallowing his pride and bitterness to break the silence that had formed between them. The conversation was difficult but cathartic, allowing both friends to express their feelings and work towards rebuilding their bond. Slowly, they found their footing again, each making an effort to mend the rift that had developed. In time, Kyle found a way to accept Lawrence and Jamie's relationship, acknowledging that his happiness had always been tied to the success of his closest friend. And as they embraced the next phase of their lives, the memory of that unresolved dinner melted into the background, replaced by a newfound appreciation and understanding of the bonds that truly make a friendship strong.\\" The resolution in this scenario demonstrates how the two friends managed to overcome the issue, suggesting that open communication, self-reflection, and empathy can be healing tools in the face of relational struggles."},{"instruction":"This is an email Hope everything is going okay for you.

The school administration believes that this decline may be due to a lack of interest, inadequate resources, or a lack of qualified teachers. The decline in STEM enrolment has raised concerns among teachers, parents, and community leaders as they understand the importance of science and technology in today's rapidly changing world. They want to adopt some measures to tackle the situation and boost student enrolment in STEM subjects at Greenvale High School. Hypothesis: The hypothesis in this context can be: \\"The introduction of innovative hands-on learning experiences, recruitment of qualified teachers, and access to additional resources would increase student enrolment in STEM courses at Greenvale High School.\\" To test this hypothesis, the following steps will be undertaken: 1. Conduct a survey among current students and recent graduates to determine the specific reasons for the decline in STEM enrolment and identify any gaps in the current curriculum. 2. Based on the survey results, develop innovative hands-on learning experiences in STEM courses. Such programs may include robotics workshops, coding boot camps, and real-world science projects. 3. Perform a thorough needs assessment of Greenvale High School's resources and facilities, identifying any inadequacies that may be hindering students' interest or performance in STEM courses. Afterward, propose a budget and action plan to remedy the shortcomings identified in the assessment. 4. Implement a recruitment program to hire more qualified teachers, focusing on finding professionals who are passionate about teaching STEM and experienced in hands-on pedagogical methodologies. 5. Launch a communication campaign among the students and the parents to promote the new STEM initiatives, sharing the benefits and real-world applications of studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. 6. Monitor the enrolment rates and academic progress of STEM students for at least three years after implementing the proposed changes. This will help in comparing the data to previous years and effectively evaluate the hypothesis. 7. Conduct follow-up surveys and interviews with students, parents, and teachers to assess the effectiveness of the implemented changes and gather feedback for potential improvements or alterations. By following these steps, the school administration can test their hypothesis and make informed decisions about promoting STEM education at Greenvale High School."},{"instruction":"spring day for europe 2009: launch event in strasbourg Write the above sentence using proper case.","output":"Spring Day for Europe 2009: Launch Event in Strasbourg"},{"instruction":"Who created the comic strip called Dykes to Watch Out For which featured in 1985 a character who watches a movie only if it has two women who talk to each other about something besides a man????","output":"The comic strip \\"Dykes to Watch Out For\\" was created by Alison Bechdel, an American cartoonist, and writer. Born on September 10, 1960, in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, Bechdel is best known for her long-running and widely influential comic strip, which first appeared in 1983 and became a regular publication in 1987. The strip mainly revolved around the lives of a group of lesbian friends and provided a deep insight into lesbian culture, politics, feminism, and other socio-political issues. The Bechdel Test, also known as the Bechdel-Wallace Test, originated from a 1985 strip of \\"Dykes to Watch Out For\\" titled \\"The Rule.\\" In this comic, a character named Mo explained that she would only watch a movie if it met the following three criteria: (1) it had two women in it, (2) who talk to each other, and (3) about something besides a man. Initially intended as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on the lack of representation and depth of female characters in movies, the Bechdel Test has since become a widely used measure of gender representation in media. It highlights the prevalent gender bias and underrepresentation of women in films and television shows. Alison Bechdel's work in \\"Dykes to Watch Out For\\" and the creation of the Bechdel Test have had a significant impact on discussions surrounding gender representation in popular media. Apart from her contributions to the comic strip world, Bechdel has also written graphic memoirs. Her critically acclaimed memoir, \\"Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic,\\" was published in 2006 and was later adapted into a Tony Award-winning musical in 2015. Another memoir, \\"Are You My Mother? A Comic Drama,\\" was published in 2012, further solidifying Bechdel's status as a groundbreaking and influential artist in the comic and literary world."},{"instruction":"WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\\" Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \\"schizoid policy making.\\" Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \\"a horrifically chilling signal\\" that \\"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\\" On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies. \\"This is a fight born out of knowing who we are and fighting for the ideals of our country,\\" she said.

Hypothesis: The man in the car is an FBI agent. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the premise provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the man in the car is an FBI agent. The premise states that \\"A man sits in a government vehicle on the street.\\" While it's true that FBI agents may use government vehicles as part of their job, this information alone is not sufficient to accurately and unambiguously determine the man's occupation or organizational affiliation. The term \\"government vehicle\\" is quite broad and can include many types of vehicles associated with various governmental branches, agencies, and job roles. This vehicle could be associated with law enforcement (local, state, or federal), emergency services (fire department, EMTs), the Department of Transportation, military, or even a civilian working directly or indirectly for the government. Moreover, there are numerous job titles and positions under the umbrella of the federal government, not limited to the FBI. The occupant of the vehicle could be a member of another federal law enforcement agency such as the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Secret Service, or U.S. Customs and Border Protection, among others. Alternatively, he could be a local or state law enforcement officer on assignment, an employee of a regulatory agency like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a government utility worker, or associated with a government-funded organization or contractor. Furthermore, the man could simply be a driver or a passenger in the vehicle, who may or may not be a government employee or affiliated with the FBI. The premise does not provide any specific identifying information, such as attire, behavior, or equipment that would point to the man being an FBI agent. For example, if the premise mentioned that the man wore a suit, had a badge or ID, and appeared to be conducting surveillance or an investigation, it would be much easier to support the hypothesis. In conclusion, even though it's possible that the man in the car could be an FBI agent, we cannot establish this with certainty based on the limited information provided in the premise. To draw a more informed conclusion, we would need additional evidence or context that directly correlates the man with the Federal Bureau of Investigation or another government agency."},{"instruction":"Facts: - residence: france - years active: 1954 -- present - caption: polanski at the 2013 cannes film festival - birth name: rajmund roman thierry polański - children: 2 -lrb- daughter and son -rrb- - birth date: 18 august 1933 - citizenship: polish naturalization -rrb- -lrb- by birth -rrb- and french -lrb- by - image: roman polanski cannes 2013.jpg - birth place: paris , france - alma mater: national film school in Łódź - occupation: actor , director , producer , screenwriter Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of roman polanski .","output":"Roman Polanski, born Rajmund Roman Thierry Polański on August 18, 1933, in Paris, France, is a well-known actor, director, producer, and screenwriter.

(Associated Press) The pilot of the single-seat jet was headed to New Orleans for radar installation as part of routine maintenance and reported an inflight emergency, then lost radio contact, authorities said. The pilot and jet are with the 104th Fighter Wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, officials there said. It was unclear whether the pilot had ejected and the plane had no munitions onboard, Col. James Keefe said at a news conference in Westfield, Massachusetts, home of the fighter wing. Just before 9 a.m., residents near Deerfield — with a population of just 130 people, about 135 miles northwest of Richmond — say they heard a series of explosion-like booms. \\"It's the loudest noise I've ever heard,\\" 63-year-old Rebecca Shinaberry, who lives on a farm about two miles away, said. \\"(It) just shook the ground, and from my house we could just see a big plume of smoke.\\" Her husband, turkey farmer A.D. Shinaberry, said that from the first two booms, he thought a plane had broken the sound barrier. But 10 seconds later he heard a third boom — the crash, he said. Then, \\"it was like a mushroom, black smoke came up,\\" Shinaberry said. From the smoke, Virginia State Police said, they located the crash site, in a heavily wooded but level area adjacent to a mountain in the George Washington National Forest. A deep crater and a large debris field are on the site, and state police are searching, spokeswoman Corrine Geller said. \\"It is probably five, six miles from the crash site to the nearest civilization,\\" Keefe said. \\"It's deeply wooded, and a lot of hills and mountains.\\" \\"We are not going to speculate on what occurred or the status of the pilot,\\" Keefe said. \\"We are hopeful that the pilot is OK.\\" A massive rescue operation was underway in the rural area with rocky, steep terrain. More than 100 dozen local, state, and federal officials as well as volunteers gathered at the Deerfield Volunteer Fire Department. About a dozen helicopters from various agencies were used through the day to search. The aircraft were constantly taking off and landing throughout the day. Geller said later Wednesday rescuers on foot and horseback would search through the night, assisted by search dogs and helicopters equipped for night flying. Keefe said the plane was flying about 30,000 to 40,000 feet — \\"pretty high\\" — when the pilot reported the emergency. Pilots are trained to release equipment when ejecting, Keefe said, so it was likely the pilot did not have a radio. F-15s are maneuverable tactical fighters that can reach speeds up to 1,875 mph, according to the Air Force website. The F-15C Eagle entered the Air Force inventory in 1979 and costs nearly 30 million, the website says. The Air Force has nearly 250 F-15s. Several F-15s have crashed over the past few years in various states. In at least one, the pilot ejected safely. Causes included failure of a support structure for the jet and pilot error. __ Associated Press writers Michael Felberbaum in Richmond, Brock Vergakis in Norfolk, and Stephen Singer in Westfield, Massachusetts, contributed to this report. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A search continues for a missing Massachusetts National Guard pilot after his F-15C military jet crashed in a heavily wooded area of Virginia.

This position is held by a four-star general, who is responsible for overseeing the organization, training, and equipping of the active-duty, Reserve, and National Guard components within the United States Air Force (USAF). The current Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force is General Charles Q. Brown Jr., who assumed the role on August 6, 2020. It is important to note that while General Brown is the highest-ranking officer within the USAF, he is not the highest-ranking officer within the United States Department of Defense (DoD). The highest-ranking military officer in the DoD is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a position currently held by General Mark A. Milley, who represents the highest-ranking military official across all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. As the Chief of Staff, General Brown serves several key roles in the operation and management of the USAF. Some of his primary responsibilities include organizing, training, and equipping Air Force personnel for combat operations and other missions; managing the USAF's annual budget, which exceeds 160 billion; serving as the principal military advisor to the Secretary of the Air Force, President of the United States, and other top-level government officials; and representing the USAF at key events, meetings, and conferences around the world. The role of Chief of Staff is typically held for a term of four years, although extensions can be granted, depending on the circumstances. During their tenure, the CSAF works closely with other high-ranking officers and civilian leaders across the DoD and other U.S. government departments, implementing strategies and policies to ensure the effectiveness and readiness of the Air Force. To attain the position of Chief of Staff, one must have a long and distinguished career within the USAF, demonstrating exceptional leadership, tactical acumen, and strategic vision. General Brown has over three decades of experience in various leadership and command positions within the USAF, including serving as the Deputy Commander of U.S. Central Command and the Commander of Pacific Air Forces. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering from Texas Tech University and has completed various professional military education programs and courses throughout his career. In summary, the highest-ranking Air Force officer is the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, currently held by General Charles Q. Brown Jr. This four-star general serves as the top military authority within the USAF and plays a critical role in organizing, training, equipping, and advising on Air Force policies and strategies."},{"instruction":"How is \\"Aerosvit destinations\\" said in Russian?","output":"In Russian, \\"Aerosvit destinations\\" can be translated as \\"Направления Аэросвит\\" (Napravleniya Aerosvit).

Article: No opera smells of the sea quite like Britten's Peter Grimes. The music makes us constantly aware of the sea's immensity, it's potential for threat, and the play of light on its waves. But the sea isn't just a special background, it weighs on the lives of the characters, offering them a living, but at a price. In the first act the laboured sound of the strings evokes the complete heaviness of the sailor's work, as they haul the boats up the shingle . Then a storm gathers which rages through the scene at the Inn, and stirs up an orchestral hurricane. Even when it's calm and favorable, the sea is inescapable. In the comfortable enclosed world of the opera house, this can only be suggested. In the production of Peter Grimes about to open at the Aldeburgh Festival, it will be really present, because the opera is taking place on the beach, the setting for much of the narrative of Britten's opera, and also the poem by the Suffolk poet George Crabbe that inspired it. This won't be the first opera production to be set in the actual landscape in which the action takes place. There's a well-known filmed production of Tosca shot in Castel Gandolfo in Rome, and a production of Donizetti's Anna Bolena was once mounted in the moat surrounding the Tower of London. But those were manageable urban landscapes, with comfortingly solid buildings to act as wind shields and acoustic blocks. On the Aldeburgh beach there's actually nothing, apart from a few boats, some whole, some wrecked. Here anything more complicated than walking the dog is hard to solve. The wind blows away one's words, so conversation is hard, and anything not tied down tends to blow away. The sliding shingle turns one's steps into a drunken stagger.

A battle-hardened Huntley-Brinkley reporter later said that no military action he had witnessed had ever frightened or disturbed him as much as what he saw in Birmingham. Two out-of-town photographers in Birmingham that day were Charles Moore, who had previously worked with the Montgomery Advertiser and was now working for Life magazine, and Bill Hudson, with the Associated Press. Moore was a Marine combat photographer who was \\"jarred\\" and \\"sickened\\" by the use of children and what the Birmingham police and fire departments did to them. Moore was hit in the ankle by a brick meant for the police. He took several photos that were printed in Life. The first photo Moore shot that day showed three teenagers being hit by a water jet from a high-pressure firehose. It was titled \\"They Fight a Fire That Won't Go Out\\". A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography. The Life photo became an \\"era-defining picture\\" and was compared to the photo of Marines raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima. Moore suspected that the film he shot \\"was likely to obliterate in the national psyche any notion of a 'good southerner'.\\" Hudson remarked later that his only priorities that day were \\"making pictures and staying alive\\" and \\"not getting bit by a dog.\\"Right in front of Hudson stepped Parker High School senior Walter Gadsden when a police officer grabbed the young man's sweater and a police dog charged him. Gadsden had been attending the demonstration as an observer. He was related to the editor of Birmingham's black newspaper, The Birmingham World, who strongly disapproved of King's leadership in the campaign. Gadsden was arrested for \\"parading without a permit\\", and after witnessing his arrest, Commissioner Connor remarked to the officer, \\"Why didn't you bring a meaner dog; this one is not the vicious one.\\" Hudson's photo of Gadsden and the dog ran across three columns in the prominent position above the fold on the front page of The New York Times on May 4, 1963.

Otherwise, you're warned, it might not be to your liking. Answer:","output":"The effect of the given review on the decision to buy the product would depend on the individual's preferences and familiarity with the mentioned references. For someone who enjoys experimental music and is already a fan of Nurse With Wound, this review would likely increase the chances of purchasing the product. The comparison to Metal Machine Music and the suggestion that this album would appeal to those who appreciate that type of sound imply that the album delivers on its experimental and potentially avant-garde qualities. This could be a selling point for people who are looking for unique and challenging music. Additionally, the mention of Nurse With Wound attracts fans of that music project to explore this particular album. On the other hand, for individuals unfamiliar with Metal Machine Music or Nurse With Wound, the review might not offer enough useful information to sway their decision. Furthermore, the warning at the end of the review might discourage potential buyers who are not sure if they would enjoy such an experimental sound, thus decreasing the chances of purchasing the product. Finally, for people who are specifically not fans of experimental music, this review would likely decrease the chances of buying the product. The direct comparison to Metal Machine Music, a highly polarizing album, could serve as a deterrent, especially if the person reading the review is aware of its controversial reputation.

(iv) The narrator was trying to cure her cold . Answer the following question: Why did the narrator offer the colleague a glass of tea ?","output":"The narrator's primary intention in this situation was to create a meaningful and heartfelt farewell for their colleague, who was moving on from working at Black & Spiro. Offering their colleague a glass of tea was a thoughtful gesture that is typically associated with nurturing and comfort. Morning tea serves as a social experience where individuals can come together, celebrate, connect, and communicate in a relaxed environment. In this case, the setting provided an opportunity to express gratitude and reminiscence over the memories and experiences they have shared together as colleagues. By organizing a special morning tea for their departing colleague, the narrator was demonstrating their care, appreciation and support for her. This thoughtful act allowed the entire team to gather together, reinforcing their bond and unity. It was an opportunity for everyone to share their thoughts, best wishes and words of encouragement with the individual who was moving on to a new chapter in her life. This farewell moment provided the narrator, as well as the entire team, with a chance to show their genuine interest in their colleague's future endeavors. Offering a glass of tea was both a symbolic and practical gesture, as it helped set the tone for an intimate, warm, and special gathering. Drinking tea together, in this context, was more than a simple beverage; it became an element for connection, community and human interactions, which are essential in moments of transitions like these. Therefore, the reason the narrator offered a glass of tea to their colleague was multifaceted: it was a caring gesture symbolizing support and warmth, a means of providing a comfortable atmosphere for the farewell event, and an opportunity to show their appreciation for the time and effort she invested while working together as a team. The simple act of sharing a glass of tea opened the door to many heartfelt emotions and memories, and served as the foundation for a beautiful farewell that the team, and especially the departing colleague, will treasure for a long time."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: - Eventually it burns all its hydrogen - Becomes a red giant - Once the red giant burns itself out - The core of the star collapses - The gasses will start to disperse - Only the core is left - A white dwarf has been formed.

After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea.

Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation.

As someone who had lived in the town for many years, Donald had a wealth of knowledge about the best routes, shortcuts, and even secret passages that were not commonly used by others. He wanted Kyle to feel welcomed and at ease in his new community, and providing these directions was a simple yet effective way to make his transition smoother. Donald's concern for Kyle and his willingness to share his local knowledge demonstrate his thoughtful and kind nature. By offering this guidance, he was helping Kyle to become more self-reliant and to develop his own understanding of the town's layout. Not only would this allow Kyle to get from one place to another with greater ease, but it would also help him to become more deeply connected to his new community and the people who lived there. Moreover, giving Kyle these basic directions was important because it would help him to avoid getting lost or ending up in potentially unsafe areas of the town. Even though most navigation can now be done through smartphones and GPS devices, there may still be times when such technology fails or is unavailable. In these cases, having a general idea of how to get from one point to another becomes extremely valuable. Furthermore, Donald's local knowledge may well go beyond what is available via digital maps, making his advice even more useful. Additionally, Donald's directions could save Kyle valuable time by helping him take more efficient routes. This could be particularly important if Kyle was exploring the town not just for leisure, but also for work-related reasons, as getting to important meetings and other professional engagements on time is essential. By providing these directions, Donald was giving Kyle an advantage that would make his life easier and potentially enhance his career in the town. Furthermore, by sharing his local expertise, Donald was fostering a sense of camaraderie and trust between himself and Kyle. This seemingly small act of kindness could set the stage for a deepening friendship between the two of them, as Kyle might be more likely to turn to Donald for help or advice in the future, knowing that he can rely on him to provide useful information. In turn, this could lead to a stronger bond, not just between them, but also among other members of the community. In conclusion, Donald gave Kyle some basic directions for how to get around town, because he recognized that doing so would help Kyle acclimate more easily to his new environment, avoid getting lost, save time, feel more connected to the community, and build a foundation of trust and friendship between them. As such, this act of generosity was not only practical but also served to create a sense of unity and support that is essential for any thriving community."},{"instruction":"Allan crouched over his desk once more, pen in hand and mind blank. He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago. He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers. His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture. He continued long into the night, until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow, raised perpetually skyward. Arthur looked up from the results of a night's frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye. \\"What is this?\\" he queried, indicating the pages he held in his left hand. \\"I decided that… since I wasn't having much success with more – traditional – stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely,\\" Allan replied, somewhat less self-assured than he had been the previous night. \\"What in G-d's name could have possessed you to do such a thing,\\" cried Arthur, nearly raising his voice. \\"After all I said the day before, why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self-indulgent fantasy?\\" He shook the papers at Allan, raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son. \\"This is nothing but a glorified Grimm's tale, a miscarried child of Stoker, a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant!\\" He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthur's throat. \\"Do you hate the modern system of literature? Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare?\\" For a moment, Allan could hardly do more than shake his head. \\"No, of course not… I– \\" \\"Then why,\\" Arthur barreled on, \\"do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble, this morbid, paganistic drivel?

Which one is more important to you: to love or to be loved? Is it more important to love or be loved?","output":"Yes, these questions essentially ask the same thing, but they are phrased slightly differently. Both questions aim to explore the individual's personal priorities between giving love to others and receiving love from others. However, there are some subtle differences in phrasing that may evoke slightly different emotional responses. Question 1: \\"Which one is more important to you: to love or to be loved?\\" This phrasing presents the two options—\\"to love\\" and \\"to be loved\\"—as separate entities and encourages the respondent to choose their preferred option. It implies that the two types of love mentioned may not be mutually exclusive and that one may have a stronger preference or priority over the other. Question 2: \\"Is it more important to love or be loved?\\" This question prompts the respondent to consider the importance of each concept and evaluate which has greater significance overall. The phrasing may lead to a more comparative analysis of the two subjects, rather than the selection of a preferred choice as in Question 1. While the meaning behind the questions is essentially the same, the subtle differences in phrasing may evoke slightly different thought processes or emotional responses in the respondent. As an AI assistant, I do not possess emotions or personal beliefs, so I cannot choose between these options. However, I can provide insights on the perspectives often associated with loving and being loved. “To love” focuses on the act of giving affection, care, and emotional support to others, which is usually perceived as a selfless and compassionate act. This perspective emphasizes personal growth, empathy, and the ability to foster meaningful connections. Advocates of this view may argue that when one actively loves others, they can cultivate a greater sense of fulfillment and life satisfaction. “Being loved,” on the other hand, concentrates on the importance of feeling valued, cherished, and emotionally supported by others. This perspective recognizes the fundamental human need to belong, feel validated, and form deep connections with others. Proponents of this viewpoint may argue that being loved is essential for psychological well-being and positive emotional outcomes. Ultimately, the question of whether it’s more important to love or be loved is subjective and may vary from person to person, as individual values, experiences, and priorities shape their perspective. Some people may find fulfillment in giving love, while others may prioritize receiving love. Most often, a balance between the two is ideal for maintaining a healthy and fulfilling life."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: The Music Man Movie plot: The movie opens with a number of traveling salesmen in a railroad car in 1912, lamenting the things that are making their livelihood difficult--changes in society and the economy, and dishonest salesmen who give them a bad name. They are particularly scornful of a certain \\"Professor\\" Harold Hill (Robert Preston), who goes into a town, sells the kids musical instruments, instruction books, and band uniforms, under the promise that he will form a band for them, and then disappears. Someone mentions that \\"He don't know one note from another!\\". (This opening song has interesting musical accompaniment: the sound of the train's steam locomotive.) At the end of the song, just when the train is about to start up from a station stop in River City, Iowa, one of the people reveals that he is Harold Hill, and quickly escapes from the train before the others can catch him.Hill finds himself in a small turn-of-the-century Iowa town, full of taciturn people with small-town values. They sing him a song of welcome, explaining that Iowans are stubborn but good natured and generous. He is delighted to find an old friend and colleague from his earlier days as a crooked salesman, Marcellus Washburn (Buddy Hackett). Marcellus says that he is now making an honest living, has settled in River City, and that he likes the town and the people. The two friends reminisce about their shady dealings in the past, and that \\"Professor Hill\\"'s current racket is boys' bands. Marcellus says that it will be difficult to make headway on that front, because the town librarian and piano teacher, Marian Paroo (Shirley Jones), is quite smart and will expose him instantly. Harold takes that as a challenge, both professionally and romantically.

The Organic Act of 1804, passed on March 26 for October 1 implementation, also created the United States District Court for the District of Orleans—the only time Congress has ever provided a territory with a United States district court equal in its authority and jurisdiction to those of the states. Congress also established the Superior Court for the Territory of Orleans whose three judges were the top territorial court. On April 10, 1805, the Territorial Legislature organized 12 counties : Orleans County, LaFourche County, German Coast, Acadia County, Iberville County, Attakapas County, Pointe Coupée County, Opelousas County, Rapides County, Concordia County, Natchitoches County, and Ouachita County. The Florida Parishes on the east side of the Mississippi River were not included in Orleans Territory at this time, as they were in the Spanish territory of West Florida until they were formally annexed on April 14, 1812. The western boundary with Spanish Texas was not fully defined until the Adams-Onís Treaty in 1819. A strip of land known as the Sabine Free State just east of the Sabine River served as a neutral ground buffer area from about 1807 until 1819.

Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"While these two sentences convey similar information, there are subtle differences in how the information is presented and the emphasis placed on certain aspects. The main idea common between both sentences is that Wagener designed a porcelain with white and blue flowers; however, the inspiration and description of the design are presented differently in each sentence. In sentence 1, the emphasis is on the fact that the European porcelain was designed by Wagener, and the design was influenced by the Japanese taste. The phrase \\"according to the Japanese taste\\" implies that the design elements borrowed from the Japanese aesthetics were made to appeal specifically to those with a preference for such styles. The sentence focuses on the origin of the porcelain, which is European, while highlighting the influence and inspiration from the Japanese taste. Sentence 2, on the other hand, emphasizes that the Japanese porcelain was designed by Wagener, incorporating white and blue colors and an abundance of flowers. However, this sentence indicates that the design was made \\"according to the European taste.\\" This phrasing suggests that the design elements were modified to cater specifically to European preferences. Interestingly, the origin of the porcelain in this sentence is Japanese, as opposed to the European origin in the first sentence. In summary, both sentences reflect that Wagener designed porcelain with white and blue flowers, and they convey the idea of a fusion of Japanese and European tastes. While they contain similar elements, the differences in sentence structure, emphasis, and descriptions provide a distinct perspective on the information that is being conveyed.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose you are more successful during the great american smoke out happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The Great American Smokeout is an annual event that encourages smokers to quit smoking for at least one day, with the hope that they will eventually quit for good. By not smoking during this event, you would increase the chances of more oxygen being brought into your body. Here's how the perturbation hypothesis would affect the process, step-by-step: 1. When you breathe in air during the Great American Smokeout, there is a higher chance of the air being cleaner and containing more oxygen as there are fewer pollutants from cigarette smoke. 2. The air entering the bronchial tubes would thus have a higher oxygen concentration as it is less contaminated by cigarette smoke. 3. The air that gets split into the bronchioles of each lung would also contain more oxygen as a result. 4. The alveoli, which are the tiny air sacs where gas exchange occurs, would have higher oxygen levels to work with. This means that more oxygen would be available to pass through the walls of the alveoli into the surrounding blood vessels. 5. With a higher amount of oxygen entering the bloodstream, more oxygen-rich blood would leave the lungs and travel through the body, providing more oxygen to the cells that need it. 6. As blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs, the person might exhale slightly less carbon dioxide because the cells are using more oxygen and producing slightly less carbon dioxide. 7. When exhaling, carbon dioxide is released, but with slightly more oxygen in the system, the body should be more efficient at handling this gas exchange, leading to better overall health. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis, in this case, suggests that being more successful during the Great American Smokeout would have a direct effect on the process of oxygen exchange in the lungs and consequently lead to more oxygen being brought into the body. This would potentially improve the overall health and well-being of the individual."},{"instruction":"TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing.

Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere.

Kasich praised Latinos for their family values and strong work ethic, then proceeded to discuss a Latina hotel maid, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. He highlighted the importance of leaving a small tip for hotel maids, whom he believes are often taken for granted. Kasich recalled a personal experience with a Latina maid, who left him a note inquiring about his stay and went out of her way to provide additional soap for his room.

In response, a Republican spokesman defended Kasich, stating that he \\"was talking about how great the service was and how we should respect everyone in our society no matter what their job or position might be.\\" Despite the spokesman's defense, some people remain unconvinced.

Ross believes that if people were cognizant of the varied skills and interests within the Hispanic American demographic, they would recognize just how problematic Kasich's comments are and how challenging it will be to justify them. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of recognizing and addressing inherent biases and stereotypes in our society.

To arouse compassion: In contrast, when the word \\"arouse\\" is used in this context, it signifies the evocation of feelings of empathy, sympathy, and concern for the difficulties faced by others. The intention here is to awaken a sense of understanding, kindness, and a desire to help or alleviate another person's suffering. This could be in response to heartbreaking stories, unfortunate events, or observing another's hardship. The act of arousing compassion frequently aims to unite people in their shared human experiences and encourages them to support and care for one another. To conclude, while the word \\"arouse\\" remains consistent in its core meaning - invoking or triggering an emotional response - the intention and impact of the term differ considerably in the provided sentences. Therefore, the appropriate answer would be that \\"arouse\\" has different meanings in these specific contexts."},{"instruction":"Given the rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer.

The differences between the two sentences lie in the way the information is presented, as well as the emphasis on certain aspects of the narrative. Here is a detailed comparison of both sentences: 1. \\"The father of Mervyn Paice wrote a letter to Menachem Begin asking him to spare his son's life.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the action of writing a letter. It tells us that Mervyn Paice's father wrote a letter to Menachem Begin, and the purpose of this letter was to ask for Mervyn's life to be spared. The structure used here, which connects the purpose of the letter (asking Menachem Begin to spare Mervyn's life) directly to the act of writing the letter, emphasizes the primary intention of the letter itself. 2. \\"The father of Mervyn Paice wrote a letter to Menachem Begin and asked him to spare his son's life.\\" This sentence separates two actions: writing a letter to Menachem Begin and asking him to spare Mervyn's life. By using the conjunction \\"and\\" between these two actions, the sentence creates a connection between them but does not exclusively emphasize the purpose of the letter. Instead, it presents both actions as equally important and suggests that the request to spare Mervyn's life may have happened as an additional act – either within or separate from the letter. In conclusion, while both sentences convey that Mervyn Paice's father wrote a letter to Menachem Begin and asked him to spare his son's life, they differ in terms of focus, structure, and the way the information is presented. The first sentence emphasizes the primary intention of the letter, whereas the second sentence highlights both the actions of writing the letter and making the request, without specifying if the request was made exclusively within the letter."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The war started badly for the US and UN. North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.\\"?

All of them will take some time to dry fully but should stay on your glass for a long time once they have set. Here are a few different types of enamel paint you could choose from: Gloss enamel paints will give you the thickest coat and result in a more opaque finish. Frosted glass enamel paints will give a much lighter coat for a slight hint of color. Crystal gloss enamels will provide you with something in between the two. Gesso is a combination of a binder and white powder that will make nearly any surface easily paintable. Use a base coat of gesso with top coats of acrylic paint for a totally opaque finished glass painting. Gesso and acrylic paints will work best on bottles, glasses, or other containers with interesting shapes. Painting with gesso and acrylic on a flat pane of glass will look very similar to a painted canvas. Glass liner or lead will give a dark, solid outline that you can fill with translucent and colorful paints. Building an outline and coloring it in sections will create some cool, see-through colors that look like a stained glass window. Trace the outline of your design onto the glass before you go over it with glass liner. It’s much easier to paint over or wash off marker than it is getting rid of liner! While you can use any type of paintbrush or paint applicator when painting onto glass, they might change the overall look of your finished design. Here are a few different types of paintbrush to choose between: Brushes with synthetic bristles will leave visible brush marks, which can give your glass more homemade, rustic vibes. Use these for smaller, intricate designs. Natural bristle brushes will give you more smooth and even coverage. These will work great when painting base coats over the whole surface of your glass. Applicator sponges will provide an even, textured coat across the surface of the glass. Use sponges to cover the whole glass or to give a slightly frosted look. Make sure you use a paintbrush of the right size for your painting. Smaller, narrower paintbrushes will be better for delicate designs, whereas broader, flat brushes will work for overall coats. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about different types of enamel paint you can use to paint on glass.

Dundee raised a force that held Edinburgh Castle for the deposed king and then organised an army that was mainly made up of Highlanders. They were confronted in Perthshire by a force from the new government that was led by General Hugh Mackay, but in the ensuing Battle of Killiecrankie which took place on 27 July 1689 the government force was overwhelmed by the Jacobite Highlanders and defeated. However, the Jacobites sustained heavy losses as well, including their leader the Viscount Dundee. This victory raised the hopes of the Jacobite rebels, but their army of 5,000 men was defeated by government forces at the Battle of Dunkeld on 21 August 1689 by 1,200 men of the Cameronian Regiment . During the battle the leader of the government force, William Cleland, was killed and so command fell to Captain George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie who led them to victory. With the Jacobite defeat at Dunkeld, the rising was over. How many more men did the Jacobite rebels have compared to the Cameronian Regiment?","output":"To find the answer to this question, we need to identify the numbers of men in the Jacobite rebels and in the Cameronian Regiment respectively. From the text, we can see that the Jacobite rebels had an army of 5,000 men. The Cameronian Regiment, on the other hand, had 1,200 men. Now, to find out how many more men the Jacobite rebels had compared to the Cameronian Regiment, we subtract the number of men in the Cameronian Regiment from the number of men in the Jacobite rebels. 5,000 (Jacobite rebels) - 1,200 (Cameronian Regiment) = 3,800 Therefore, the Jacobite rebels had 3,800 more men than the Cameronian Regiment."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: In planning the engagement, auditors should obtain an understanding of internal control7 as it relates to the subject matter or assertion to which the auditors are attesting.

Translate this to English?","output":"The given text is in Russian and it translates to the following in English: 18 And everyone, as if by agreement, began to apologize. This sentence likely refers to a specific moment in a narrative or story where multiple people, or possibly characters, all started to apologize at the same time. It seems as though their actions were coordinated or mutually understood without having to communicate their intentions directly. This type of situation often occurs in literature and real life when multiple people realize together they have made a mistake or feel responsible for an event that resulted in some form of misunderstanding or conflict. The act of apologizing in unison can sometimes denote an agreement between them or a desire to resolve the issue quickly and amicably. In this context, the number 18 might point to this sentence being a quotation from a book, where it is possibly the 18th verse or sentence from a particular chapter. Alternatively, it could be a reference to a sequence of events or a list of items, where this particular event is the 18th entry in that list. In either case, it points to a key moment in the narrative when all involved parties express their regrets in an almost preplanned, synchronized manner, suggesting a shared responsibility and desire for reconciliation."},{"instruction":"I guess my addition is to technology in general so I can not blame the 360 for all my woes .

Since the user refers to it as an \\"addiction\\", it's likely they spend a significant amount of time on it. Step 1: Context Identification Based on the context given, the '360' seems to refer to a gaming console, probably Xbox 360. The user mentions it as somewhat of an addiction and as part of a list of technology devices, which would usually include gaming systems. Step 2: Analyzing the result of '360' removal The following outcomes can be extrapolated: 1. More Free Time: Firstly, if the user got rid of the Xbox 360, they might find that they have more free time, as they are no longer spending hours playing on the console. 2. Focused Attention: The user stated that they're trying to tackle one addiction at a time. If they manage to overcome their Xbox 360 addiction, this could mean that they can focus their attention towards managing other addictions (like their computer as mentioned). 3. Behavioral Adjustment: Removing such a central part of a daily routine could result in withdrawal symptoms initially, leading to a period of adjustment. Over time, however, this could lead to an overall healthier lifestyle, especially if the time previously spent on the gaming console is used for more productive activities. 4. Possible Replacement: There's a risk that the user might replace this addiction with another unless they actively work on developing healthier habits. Step 3: Concluding the answer So, by getting rid of the 360, the user might face a mix of these situations. Ultimately, the user's discipline and attempts at managing time and controlling their tendencies will decide the final outcome."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: One night in Portsmouth, England in 1787, a press gang breaks into a local tavern and presses all of the men drinking there into naval service. One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is the HMSÂ Bounty. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is William Bligh (Charles Laughton), and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The Bounty leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable), the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam (Franchot Tone) is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian. During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of Tahiti, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take home, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti (William Bambridge), and his daughter, Tehani (Movita Castaneda), and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language.

To determine whether this statement is factual or not, we need to consider the characteristics of Loire wines and how they change over time. Loire wines include a variety of types, such as red, white, rosé, and even sparkling. Some of the wines, like Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé, are crisp and acidic white wines, while others, like Chinon and Bourgueil, are fruity and tannic red wines. The aging potential and taste improvement for each type of wine can be quite different. Some Loire wines, particularly those with higher acidity and tannin content, can indeed improve with age. As the wine ages, the tannins soften, and the wine develops a more complex flavor profile, potentially becoming more delicious. However, this is not true for all Loire wines, as some are best consumed young, when their freshness and fruitiness are most pronounced. Based on this analysis, we cannot generalize the statement for all Loire wines.

The Old English name was \\"Earninga Straete\\" (1012), named after a tribe called the \\"Earningas\\", who inhabited a district later known as \\"Armingford Hundred\\", around Arrington, Cambridgeshire and Royston, Hertfordshire. \\"Armingford\\", and \\"Arrington\\" share the same Old English origin. The original Roman name for the route is unknown. It is also known as the Old North Road from London to where it joins the A1 Great North Road near Godmanchester. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - The City of London Corporation, officially and legally the Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City of London, is the municipal governing body of the City of London, the historic centre of London and the location of much of the UK's financial sector. In 2006 the name was changed from Corporation of London to avoid confusion with the wider London local government, the Greater London Authority. - The inner city is the central area of a major city or metropolis. Inner city areas tend to have higher population densities than outer suburbs, with more of the population living inside multi-floored townhouses and apartment buildings. - Shoreditch is an inner city district in the historic East End of London and modern Central London within the London Borough of Hackney, lying immediately to the north of the City of London. - Founded in 1914 , the Geffrye Museum explores the home from 1600 to the present day . Named after Sir Robert Geffrye , a former Lord Mayor of London and Master of the Ironmongers ' Company , it is located on Kingsland Road in Shoreditch , London . The museum is set in beautiful 18th - century Grade I - listed almshouses of the Ironmongers ' Company , built in 1714 thanks to a bequest by Sir Robert Geffrye . The museum was extended in 1998 with an innovative yet architecturally sympathetic new wing designed by Branson Coates Architects . Surrounding the museum is a walled herb garden , created in 1993 , and a series of period gardens which show how domestic gardens have changed over the last 400 years . The herb and period gardens are open from 1 April to 31 October . Evocative displays of London , middle - class living rooms and gardens illustrate homes and home life through the centuries , reflecting changes in society , behaviour , style and taste . The many aspects of home are brought to life through an imaginative and inspirational programme of special exhibitions and events throughout the year . The museum 's popular Christmas Past exhibition is held annually each winter , with the eleven period rooms authentically decorated for the season . In addition , the museum 's restored 18th - century almshouse , taken back to its original condition and offering a rare glimpse into the lives of London 's poor and elderly in the 1780s and 1880s , is open to the public on specific days . In May 2015 , the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded the Geffrye Museum a grant of £ 11m to support its exciting plans to develop the museum for the future . The museum is now actively fundraising the balance of £ 4m .

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Old Street is a street in central and east London that runs west to east from Goswell Road in Clerkenwell, in the London Borough of Islington, to the crossroads where it meets Shoreditch High Street (south), Kingsland Road (north) and Hackney Road (east) in Shoreditch in the London Borough of Hackney. - Shoreditch High Street is the old main street of Shoreditch, London. It is part of the A10 road and connects Norton Folgate to the south with Kingsland Road to the north. It constitutes a segment of the Roman Ermine Street, which ran directly north from London to Lincoln and York. The parish church of St Leonard's, Shoreditch is situated at the north-east end of the road at the crossroads where it meets with Hackney Road. This part of the road is wholly within the London Borough of Hackney; below Boundary Street, the eastern side lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The high street enters the City of London at Norton Folgate. - An almshouse is charitable housing provided to enable people (typically elderly people who can no longer work to earn enough to pay rent) to live in a particular community. They are often targeted at the poor of a locality, at those from certain forms of previous employment, or their widows, and are generally maintained by a charity or the trustees of a bequest. - A community is commonly considered a social unit (a group of people) who have something in common, such as norms, values, or identity. Often - but not always - communities share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood). Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions like family, home, work, government, society, or humanity, at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties (micro-level), \\"community\\" may also refer to large group affiliations (or macro-level), such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities. - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region. - Dalston is a district of the London Borough of Hackney in North East London, England. Dalston began as a hamlet within the parish of Hackney, which developed on either side of Dalston Lane. As the area urbanised, the term came to apply to surrounding areas including the old centres of Kingsland and Shacklewell, which are now considered part of Dalston. - Hackney Road is a London arterial route running from Shoreditch Church to Cambridge Heath in the London Borough of Hackney. The route runs between the areas of Bethnal Green and Haggerston. It lies close to the border between the boroughs of London Boroughs of Hackney and Tower Hamlets. - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around 43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century. - Central London is the innermost part of London, England. There is no official definition of its area but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government. - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire.

The Library[edit] In the wrap-around story of the film, H. P. Lovecraft (Jeffrey Combs) learns of a monastery where a copy of the Necronomicon is held. Having been a regular there for his research, he sets up an appointment, his cab driver told to wait outside. Taking insult when the head monk calls his work \\"fiction\\", Lovecraft insists that all his writings are true. Requesting to read the Alchemical Encyclopedia Vol. III, Lovecraft steals a key from another monk and flees to the cellar where the Necronomicon is being held. Unknown to him, a monk has seen him.

As that happens, one of the seals is opened. Lovecraft sits to read and record what he is reading.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Babies have a father and a mother.\\" - Sentence B: \\"Babies have no mother.\\"","output":"Sentence B: \\"Babies have no mother.\\" does not make sense. Explanation: In general, a baby is the result of reproduction, which involves two biological parents: a mother and a father. The mother contributes the egg and the father provides the sperm. The fertilization of the egg by the sperm creates a zygote, which develops into an embryo and eventually a baby. Therefore, it is natural for a baby to have both a father and a mother. Sentence A acknowledges this fact by stating that \\"Babies have a father and a mother.\\" It shows a clear understanding of the way reproduction works. However, Sentence B contradicts this understanding by suggesting that \\"Babies have no mother.\\" This statement is inconsistent with the biological processes of reproduction because it suggests that a baby can exist without a mother, which is incorrect."},{"instruction":"Question: Process: - The bat sends out sound waves from their mouth or nose - The sound waves hit an object - Echoes are produced - The echo returns to the bat&#x27;s ears - The bat hears the echo - The bat can figure out where the object is located. Question: suppose If bats are in a cave happens, how will it affect WEAKER echolocation. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"In a cave environment, weaker echolocation can be affected in the following ways: 1. More effect: In the confined space of a cave, sound waves may bounce off multiple surfaces, creating more echoes. These additional echoes make it more challenging for bats with weaker echolocation to accurately pinpoint the location of objects or prey. This could lead to increased interference and confusion for the bat. 2. Less effect: On the other hand, caves may also provide some advantages to weaker echolocation. Due to their enclosed spaces, sound waves might not have to travel as far before they encounter an object and produce an echo, potentially making detections more accessible for bats with weaker echolocation. 3. No effect: In some cases, bats with weaker echolocation may adapt their strategies within a cave environment to compensate for the limitations of their echolocation ability. They might rely more on other senses, such as touch or smell, or utilize social cues from other bats to navigate their surroundings. In these instances, the perturbation in the cave environment might not have a significant effect on bats with weaker echolocation. In summary, the effect of a cave environment on weaker echolocation largely depends on the specific conditions and adaptations of each individual bat. It could lead to more interference and difficulty in pinpointing objects (more effect), make detections more accessible due to confined spaces (less effect), or have no significant impact if the bat can adapt and find alternative strategies (no effect)."},{"instruction":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Shopping in Singapore is really a pleasure for tourists.

What is the answer??","output":"Sure, little buddy! Let's play with some numbers. Our equation is: -41843 * l - 1728 = -41789 * l We need to find l. First, let's move this -41789 * l to the other side of the equation. That means we need to add 41789 * l to both sides. When we do that, we get: -41843 * l + 41789 * l - 1728 = 0 Now, let's see what happens when we add -41843 * l and 41789 * l together. It will become: (-41843 + 41789) * l - 1728 = 0 When we do the math in the parentheses, we get: -54 * l - 1728 = 0 Now, let's make this equation look a bit friendlier. We will move the 1728 to the other side by adding 1728 to both sides of the equation: -54 * l = 1728 Finally, to find the value of l, we need to divide both sides by -54: l = 1728 / -54 When we do the division, we find out that l is equal to: l = -32 So, the answer is l = -32.

As distinguished by its unique language, this civilization endured from before the time of the earliest Etruscan inscriptions (c. 700 BC) until its assimilation into the Roman Republic, beginning in the late 4th century BC with the Roman-Etruscan Wars. Culture that is identifiably Etruscan developed in Italy after about 800 BC, approximately over the range of the preceding Iron Age Villanovan culture. The latter gave way in the 7th century BC to a culture that was influenced by Ancient Greek culture. The ancient Romans referred to the Etruscans as the Tusci or Etrusci. Their Roman name is the origin of the terms \\"Tuscany\\", which refers to their heartland, and \\"Etruria\\", which can refer to their wider region. In Attic Greek, the Etruscans were known as Tyrrhenians (Turrenoi, Turrhenoi, earlier Tursenoi Tursenoi), from which the Romans derived the names Tyrrheni, Tyrrhenia (Etruria), and Mare Tyrrhenum (Tyrrhenian Sea), prompting some to associate them with the Teresh (Sea Peoples). The word may also be related to the Hittite Taruisa. The Etruscans called themselves Rasenna, which was syncopated to Rasna or Rasna. The origins of the Etruscans are mostly lost in prehistory, although Greek historians as early as the 5th century BC repeatedly associated the Tyrrhenians (Turrhenoi/Turrenoi, Tursenoi/Tursenoi) with Pelasgians. Thucydides, Herodotus and Strabo all denote Lemnos as settled by Pelasgians whom Thucydides identifies as \\"belonging to the Tyrrhenians\\" (to de pleiston Pelasgikon, ton kai Lemnon pote kai Athenas Tursenon), and although both Strabo and Herodotus agree that Tyrrhenus/Tyrsenos, son of Atys, king of Lydia, led the migration, Strabo specifies that it was the Pelasgians of Lemnos and Imbros who followed Tyrrhenus/Tyrsenos to the Italian Peninsula. The Lemnian-Pelasgian link was further manifested by the discovery of the Lemnos Stele, whose inscriptions were written in a language which shows strong structural resemblances to the language of the Tyrrhenians (Etruscans). Dionysius of Halicarnassus records a Pelasgian migration from Thessaly to the Italian peninsula, noting that \\"the Pelasgi made themselves masters of some of the lands belonging to the Umbri\\"; Herodotus describes how the Tyrrheni migrated from Lydia to the lands of the Umbri (Ombrikoi). Strabo as well as the Homeric Hymn to Dionysus make mention of the Tyrrhenians as pirates. Pliny the Elder put the Etruscans in the context of the Rhaetian people to the north and wrote in his Natural History (AD 79): Adjoining these the (Alpine) Noricans are the Raeti and Vindelici. All are divided into a number of states. The Raeti are believed to be people of Tuscan race driven out by the Gauls, their leader was named Raetus. Etruscan expansion was focused both to the north beyond the Apennine Mountains and into Campania. Some small towns in the sixth century BC disappeared during this time, ostensibly consumed by greater, more powerful neighbours. However, it is certain that the political structure of the Etruscan culture was similar to, albeit more aristocratic than, Magna Graecia in the south. The mining and commerce of metal, especially copper and iron, led to an enrichment of the Etruscans and to the expansion of their influence in the Italian peninsula and the western Mediterranean Sea. Here, their interests collided with those of the Greeks, especially in the sixth century BC, when Phocaeans of Italy founded colonies along the coast of Sardinia, Spain and Corsica. This led the Etruscans to ally themselves with Carthage, whose interests also collided with the Greeks. Around 540 BC, the Battle of Alalia led to a new distribution of power in the western Mediterranean. Though the battle had no clear winner, Carthage managed to expand its sphere of influence at the expense of the Greeks, and Etruria saw itself relegated to the northern Tyrrhenian Sea with full ownership of Corsica. From the first half of the 5th century BC, the new political situation meant the beginning of the Etruscan decline after losing their southern provinces. In 480 BC, Etruria's ally Carthage was defeated by a coalition of Magna Graecia cities led by Syracuse, Sicily. A few years later, in 474, Syracuse's tyrant Hiero defeated the Etruscans at the Battle of Cumae. Etruria's influence over the cities of Latium and Campania weakened, and the area was taken over by Romans and Samnites. In the 4th century BC, Etruria saw a Gallic invasion end its influence over the Po Valley and the Adriatic coast. Meanwhile, Rome had started annexing Etruscan cities. This led to the loss of the northern Etruscan provinces. Etruria was conquered by Rome in the 3rd century BC. Etruscan art was produced by the Etruscan civilization between the 9th and 2nd centuries BC. Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta (particularly lifesize on sarcophagi or temples), wall-painting and metalworking (especially engraved bronze mirrors). Etruscan sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, but few large examples have survived (the material was too valuable, and recycled later). In contrast to terracotta and bronze, there was apparently little Etruscan sculpture in stone, despite the Etruscans controlling fine sources of marble, including Carrara marble, which seems not to have been exploited until the Romans. Most surviving Etruscan art comes from tombs, including all the fresco wall-paintings, which show scenes of feasting and some narrative mythological subjects. Bucchero wares in black were the early and native styles of fine Etruscan pottery. There was also a tradition of elaborate Etruscan vase painting, which sprung from its Greek equivalent; the Etruscans were the main export market for Greek vases. Etruscan temples were heavily decorated with colourfully painted terracotta antefixes and other fittings, which survive in large numbers where the wooden superstructure has vanished. Etruscan art was strongly connected to religion; the afterlife was of major importance in Etruscan art. The Etruscan musical instruments seen in frescoes and bas-reliefs are different types of pipes, such as the plagiaulos (the pipes of Pan or Syrinx), the alabaster pipe and the famous double pipes, accompanied on percussion instruments such as the tintinnabulum, tympanum and crotales, and later by stringed instruments like the lyre and kithara.

Let's subtract the current capacity to find out how many more fish she needs to accommodate: 75 fish - 45 fish = 30 fish Since the new tanks will hold 10 fish each, we need to divide the remaining number of fish by the capacity of each new tank: 30 fish ÷ 10 fish/tank = 3 tanks So, Jennifer will need to build 3 more tanks to house a total of 75 fish."},{"instruction":"Here is some data about a restaurant: name = Wildwood, eatType = coffee shop, food = Japanese, customer rating = 3 out of 5, near = Ranch.

I think you'll say \\"no\\". But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain through organs According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colour they like, and _ the colour they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colours you like. Or you'll be nervous or even get ill. If you stay in a room with red windows, wallpapers and furniture for two hours, you'll feel you have been there for four hours. But if the room is blue, you'll feel you have been there for only one hour. Another example, if a person walks out of a red room and into a blue room, his temperature will fall. That means our body temperature will change when we see different colours.

B-Rad dresses and speaks like a gangster and essentially talks and acts like he is black. His father, Bill Gluckman, is running for governor of California. After Bill's campaign manager Tom Gibbons gets irritated with B-Rad's constant interruptions with the election, Bill decides that B-Rad must see a psychiatrist, Dr. Feldman. B-Rad explains to Feldman that when he was a kid, his parents were hardly ever around so he got hooked on the music his black caretaker listened to, and dreamt of being a rapper ever since. Dr. Feldman tells B-Rad's parents Bill and Bess that B-Rad has the most serious case of \\"gangstaphrienia\\" that he has ever seen. Tom then has an idea to hire two actors, PJ and Sean James to try to scare B-Rad back to normal. Although Bill thinks it could get dangerous, he reluctantly agrees. With the help of PJ's cousin Shondra, they kidnap B-Rad and take him to the ghetto. Shondra tries to convince B-Rad that if he stops acting like a gangster, they will let him go. B-Rad tries to tell Shondra he cannot, it is who he is. The actors then try plan B, forcing B-Rad to rob a convenience store owned by a Korean American family.

Bill studied about mycorrhiza, while Red studied about hugel kultur. Which friend learned less about surface areas of root systems? Hint: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Bill, who studied about mycorrhiza, learned more about the surface areas of root systems. This is because mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant, and the mycelia of the fungi directly increase the surface area of the plant's root system, which in turn improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. On the other hand, Red studied hugelkultur, which is a method of creating raised garden beds by burying wood and other organic materials. While hugelkultur can also improve soil fertility and water retention, it does not focus on the surface areas of root systems like mycorrhiza does. Therefore, Red learned less about the surface areas of root systems than Bill."},{"instruction":"In 1344, the regency concluded a further alliance with Bulgaria, which required the surrender of Philippopolis and nine other towns in northern Thrace along the river Evros. Nevertheless, after their occupation, Ivan Alexander refrained from direct action against Kantakouzenos' forces operating in southern and eastern Thrace. At the same time, Momchil, a former brigand whom Kantakouzenos had entrusted with control over the region of Merope in the Rhodope mountains, switched over to the regency. In early 1344, Kantakouzenos was deprived of Umur and the bulk of his army, who had sailed home to repel a Latin attack on his main harbour, Smyrna. On their way, the Turkish force was attacked by the Serbs under Gregory Preljub, but prevailed at the Battle of Stephaniana. Nevertheless, Kantakouzenos was able to ward off joint attacks by Dušan and Apokaukos until Umur returned to his aid the next spring at the head of an army of 20,000 men. Kantakouzenos and Umur raided Bulgaria, and then turned against Momchil. The latter had exploited the power vacuum in the Rhodope, an effective no man's land between the Serbs, Bulgarians and Byzantines, to set himself up as a quasi-independent prince, supported by a substantial force of around 5,000 men. On 7 July 1345, the two armies clashed at Peritheorion. Momchil's army was crushed, and he himself fell in the field. Soon afterwards, Dušan arrived before Serres and laid siege to the city. Rejecting demands by Kantakouzenos to withdraw, a clash appeared inevitable until the murder of Alexios Apokaukos in Constantinople forced Kantakouzenos to direct his attention there.

This idea was initially welcomed by many ethnic Germans in Sudetenland, Austria, Poland, Danzig and western Lithuania, particularly the Germans from Klaipeda (Memel). The Swiss resisted the idea. They had viewed themselves as a distinctly separate nation since the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. Question: Since when had the Swiss viewed themselves as a different nation?","output":"The Swiss have viewed themselves as a distinct and separate nation since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The Peace of Westphalia marked the end of the Thirty Years' War, a devastating conflict involving numerous European powers. This series of peace treaties not only established the modern system of nation-states but also recognized the independence and sovereignty of the Swiss Confederacy, which laid the foundations for modern Switzerland. Switzerland's history as an independent nation goes back even further than the Peace of Westphalia. Its origins can be traced to the Old Swiss Confederacy, a loose alliance of different cantons that formed in the late 13th century in response to external threats and the desire to preserve their independence. Throughout the years, the Swiss Confederacy successfully resisted various attempts to enforce foreign rule, notably by the Habsburgs. The Swiss Confederacy continued to expand and evolve, eventually becoming the Helvetic Republic when French revolutionary forces invaded in 1798. The invasion led to centralization and a new constitutional structure, along with significant territorial changes. After the period of French rule, Switzerland emerged as the Swiss Confederation in 1815 during the Congress of Vienna, reaffirming its independence and neutrality. This long and complex history has created a strong sense of national identity among the Swiss people, who have successfully maintained their independence and sovereignty despite being surrounded by powerful European nations. The Swiss resistance to the Nazi unification efforts, as mentioned in the article, can be seen as an extension of this historical commitment to national sovereignty and self-determination."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that describes the following data: Anderson, Indiana, isPartOf, Adams Township, Madison County, Indiana; Anderson Township, Madison County, Indiana, country, United States; Anderson, Indiana, isPartOf, Anderson Township, Madison County, Indiana; Anderson, Indiana, populationDensity, 523.9 (inhabitants per square kilometre); Anderson, Indiana, areaTotal, 107.43 (square kilometres).

Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important.

Typing for long periods without taking breaks can lead to various health issues, such as discomfort or even repetitive strain injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome. Pain serves as an early warning sign that your body is undergoing some stress, and taking a break can help alleviate it. Carpal tunnel syndrome, although associated with prolonged typing, is not a sign that you should take a break, but rather a more serious medical condition that may develop from continuously ignoring the pain or discomfort. If you suspect you have developed carpal tunnel syndrome, you should consult a medical professional. The other options are not directly related to the question asked. A letter, thirst, and printed word are not indicators that you’ve been typing too long and need a break. Thirst might suggest you need to stay hydrated while working, but it does not specifically relate to typing. To maintain good health, take regular breaks during long typing sessions.

Deputy Police Chief Chris Lyddy confirmed that the 4-month old Shelton boy, who was found dead on March 22, died due to toxic levels of over-the-counter drugs in his system. The infant was first thought to have succumbed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), but extensive postmortem testing conducted over the months that followed revealed otherwise. Medical inspectors working the case told Fairfield detectives in July that the baby had extremely high levels of diphenhydramine, or Benadryl, in his blood. Now, police are investigating how the infant could have ingested such a heavy dose. To do so, they will need to determine whether the homicide was committed intentionally or accidentally due to negligence. Police have not made any arrests or pressed any charges on employees who manage the daycare. In addition to the death investigation, Fairfield Police said they will be pursuing criminal infractions against the makeshift daycare for operating out of a private home without a license. Diphenhydramine, most commonly known as Benadryl, is an antihistamine meant to treat moderate to severe cold symptoms in adults. The FDA warns against administering the medication to infants under two-years-old without a doctor’s supervision, due to increased risk of overdosing. For more information on the hazards of giving cough and cold medicine to infants, read this FDA disclaimer. ||||| Death of 4-Month-Old Baby at Connecticut Daycare Caused by High Levels of Benadryl: Police Toxicology tests on a 4-month-old boy whose March 22 death at an unlicensed home daycare in Connecticut was ruled a homicide show he died from high levels of Benadryl in his system, police say.\\"It's a parent's worst nightmare and our hearts are broken for the parents of this young child,\\" Fairfield Police Chief Gary MacNamara tells PEOPLE. \\"We have an obligation to the parents to do a thorough investigation and determine who is responsible for this.\\"Since the death of Adam Seagull, the home-based daycare has been shuttered by state officials, according to MacNamara, who says the child wasn't sick at the time of his death and his body showed no signs of trauma.MacNamara tells PEOPLE that while no charges have been filed yet, someone at some point will be held accountable for Adam's death.\\"The consumption of the medication wasn't accidental,\\" says MacNamara. \\"This baby was 4-months-old. Someone administered Benadryl to this child. I am not saying there was intent to kill the baby, but as a result of that Benadryl, this child died. We are working to determine who, when and why this baby was given these meds.\\"MacNamara says Adam's death should serve as a cautionary tale for parents.\\"This daycare center had been operating without the proper licensing,\\" the chief says. \\"Without that licensing, there are no checks and balances. Without the proper training, you can't ensure a child's safety.\\" ||||| Shelton infant’s death being investigated as a homicide by Fairfield Police FAIRFIELD - What was originally believed to be a case of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is now being investigated as a homicide. The infant, Adam Gregory Vasaturo Seagull, was called \\"little prince,\\" \\"tootie muffin,\\" and \\"little man\\" by his family. “His infectious smile brought immediate joy to everyone who had the privilege of experiencing it,” his obituary read. “As he would look at you with his beautiful brown eyes, your heart became bigger and fuller with love.” Deputy Police Chief Chris Lyddy confirmed Saturday the death of the 4-month old Shelton boy in March at an unlicensed home day care has been ruled a homicide. According to the state medical examiner, toxicology reports showed high levels of Benadryl in the infant’s system. “The investigator is being extremely diligent and to date, we have not been able to rule out anybody,” Lyddy said. The unlicensed day care was run by Carol Cardillo at her home at 63 Edgewood Road and had been in operation for 11 years, Lyddy said. A lawyer representing Adam’s parents, Matthew and Michelle, confirmed that the family is aware that the case is being investigated as a homicide. The lawyer, along with Adam’s grandfather, Lewis Seagull, said that they were not ready to comment on the development in the case. The police announcement comes just days after the death of Stamford 2-month-old girl was also ruled a homicide. That child was rushed to the hospital from an East Side day care facility with severe head trauma. Neighbors of Cardillo, the woman who ran the day care where Adam was found dead on March 22, were surprised to learn that the case was being investigated as a homicide. Dimitri Gregorio, 19, was away at college in March when Adam died but heard the news through text messages from his mother, including images of first responders lining the normally quiet and uncluttered Edgewood Road. He has watched children coming to and from for years. “The family is very nice, the mother, the grandmother—they’re very nice,” he said. Cardillo did not return requests for comment by phone and at her home. A relative confirmed that she still resides there. “She was so sad,” said Cliff, a neighbor of Cardill’s who asked that his last name not be used, of Cardillo’s reaction after the accident. “(Intentional wrongdoing) is last thing that I would expect; it’s a wonderful family.” Police were called to the home March 22 just after 3 p.m., when Cardillo dialed 911 to report an unresponsive infant. According to Lyddy, Deputy Police Chief, Cardillo told police the baby had been given a bottle around noon and then put down in a play crib for a nap. When she went to check on the baby around 2:55 p.m., she could not wake him up. There were seven other children being cared for at the time, five toddlers and two other infants. There were four adults in the home at the time, according to the report. “The baby had not been sick, and there were no signs of trauma,” Lyddy said, which led to the belief that SIDS was the cause of death. However, due to the fact that the death was untimely, the infant’s body was sent to the state medical examiner’s office for an autopsy. The autopsy concluded the baby died from acute diphenhydramine intoxication. Lyddy said Cardillo has denied administering Benadryl to the baby. The day care center has been closed since the incident, and any charges regarding the operation of an unlicensed day care center would likely come from state authorities, Lyddy said. As for criminal charges in the baby’s death, Lyddy said, “It is very much an active investigation.” He said it is possible that it could be determined the Benadryl overdose was accidental, “but certainly, negligence would be a factor in administering a lethal dose of anything to an infant” and could still result in criminal charges. “It’s very important that parents check into day care facilities,” Lyddy said. “There are several ways to check if a center is licensed. The easiest is call 211, and you would be provided with a list of licensed day care facilities in your area.” He said parents should also check to make sure a facility has the proper child to staff ratio and that caregivers are properly trained in first aid, including CPR. |||||","output":"An infant's death at an unlicensed daycare center in Fairfield in March has been ruled a homicide due to high levels of over-the-counter drugs found in his system.

The band was formed in 1981 by vocalist and bassist Tom Araya and guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the founding \\"big four\\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Slayer's current lineup comprises King, Araya, drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt. Hanneman and drummers Dave Lombardo and Jon Dette are former members of the band.

However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Slayer has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" and one in 2008 for the song \\"Final Six\\", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006). Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold five million albums in the United States.

Kingdom of Hungary A:","output":"Title: Blood of the Innocent Setting: Kingdom of Hungary in the late 1560s Synopsis: In the kingdom of Hungary, an ancient prophecy speaks of a powerful woman who will acquire eternal existence and reign over the land with an iron fist. Little do the people of this kingdom know that Countess Bathory (Elizabeth Bathory) is about to fulfill this prophecy. Plot: An archaeologist named William uncovers an ancient scroll detailing the prophecy. Feeling compelled to prevent its fulfillment, he teams up with his historian friend, Isabella. Their investigation leads them to the Kingdom of Hungary, where they hear whispers of a wealthy and influential Countess with a dark secret. The curious duo sets off towards Castle Bathory. Meanwhile, Countess Bathory has just inherited her family's wealth and immense power following the death of her parents. Her fascination with the occult and alchemy fuels her desire to claim her place in the prophecy. She learns of a dark ritual that requires the blood of innocent young girls to gain immortality – a small price to pay for eternal life and power. William and Isabella arrive at the castle just as the Countess is about to begin her series of blood sacrifices. They meet a young servant girl named Lucia, who has been suspicious of the Countess's activities. She reveals the secret entrances and hidden corridors of the castle, enabling them to stop Countess Bathory just in time. However, much to their dismay, they discover that she already possesses unnatural strength and resilience. As the castle begins to crumble around them, the trio sets out to find a way to break the curse. They discover that the only means of defeating the immortal Countess is to reveal her dark deeds to the world and destroy her reputation, as the weight of her legacy is a major source of her strength. Isabella, a skilled writer, documents their horrifying findings and shares them with a trusted network of contacts. Back at the castle, Countess Bathory corners our heroes in her throne room. In a desperate attempt to escape, William reaches for a medieval weapon on display and strikes her, inflicting a seemingly fatal injury. However, due to her newfound powers, she begins to heal instantly. Just as it seems all hope is lost, Isabella takes out the manuscript she created detailing the Countess's darkest secrets and crimes. With the document in hand, she recites its contents, causing the Countess to become engulfed in flames as her dark secret is revealed. As the surviving heroes escape the burning castle, they watch it crumble to the ground and burn to ashes, signifying the end of the tyrannical and dark reign of Countess Bathory. The kingdom of Hungary is safe, and although the sacrifices of many innocent lives will never be forgotten, the prophecy of the powerful woman is put to rest. William, Isabella, and Lucia embark on a new journey, determined to prevent any similar dark prophecies from coming true. The film ends with the hint of a sequel, as our heroes come across another mysterious scroll hinting at a new threat."},{"instruction":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 14*z + 726 = -11*z - 41*z for z.","output":"Alright, let's break down this math problem step-by-step like we're talking to a 5-year-old: We have the equation: 14 * z + 726 = -11 * z - 41 * z First, let's add the z's together on the right side of the equation: (-11 * z) + (-41 * z) = -52 * z Now our equation looks like this: 14 * z + 726 = -52 * z Next, we want to get all the z's onto one side of the equation. To do that, we'll add 52 * z to both sides: 14 * z + 52 * z + 726 = -52 * z + 52 * z This simplifies to: 66 * z + 726 = 0 Now, we want to get z all by itself. To do that, we will subtract 726 from both sides: 66 * z + 726 - 726 = 0 - 726 Which simplifies to: 66 * z = -726 Finally, to find the value of z, we'll divide both sides by 66: (66 * z) / 66 = -726 / 66 So, z = -11.

Sarah Lane Toney was denied bond on the charge for which she was arrested Wednesday: unlawful conduct toward a child. She will remain incarcerated at the J. Reuben Long Detention Center. During the hearing, Toney said she went into the water with the baby, and couldn't hold on to her when the current sucked her in. She said that she did not intentionally put Baby Grace in danger. She did not explain why she was in the creek in the first place. \\"I went in the water with her and I was unable to hold her,\\" Toney said during the hearing. \\"I didn't intentionally put her in anything - any danger. I was going with her and I wasn't able to hold on to her when the water sucked me in.\\" On the day of the incident, Toney reportedly told a neighbor that she threw the infant into the creek in Socastee, according to police. The solicitor and prosecutor asked the judge to deny bond based on Toney's criminal history, specifically a domestic violence charge, and her record from Washington state. Toney said she does not have any money, so she is not a flight risk. Bond was denied based on her criminal history, and the on-going investigation into the disappearance of Toney's child. \\"I have no where to go, I'm not going to go anywhere, I have no money, I have no way to go anywhere. I'd like to be with my other child until we find Grace,\\" Toney said during the hearing. The search continues Thursday Divers with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and several other agencies stopped searching at dark Wednesday for the missing five-month-old girl whose mother claimed she threw her daughter in a creek in Socastee Tuesday morning. The Horry County Police Department tweeted Thursday morning that they resumed the search for Baby Grace, and informed residents nearby that search parties are moving about. Lt. Denis said that they have expanded their search area, and are now looking in ditches and other areas in the neighborhood. They are also able to search deeper into the woods, as the creek waters have receded about four feet since Tuesday. He said they are hoping to bring out SLED helicopters to assist with the search. Horry County Police asked that onlookers and prospective volunteers to \\"stay put for now\\" and monitor the situation on social media. \\"If we determine that we volunteers are needed we will post it on our social media sites along with instructions as how to help,\\" a post on the Horry County Police Facebook page states.

Officers said 33-year-old Sarah Lane Toney, of Myrtle Beach, was being held at J Reuben Long Detention Center. On Wednesday, Lt. Denis said Toney is being charged with unlawful conduct toward a child. Detectives with HCPD have secured an arrest warrant for Toney and say the warrant will be served by the end of the day on Wednesday.

Lt. Denis said K-9s did pick up a scent in one area of the creek Wednesday afternoon and divers are focusing on that area but crews have not found Baby Grace. Coastal Carolina University also sent in people with high-tech sonar equipment, which can usually find items, but may have difficult locating a small baby. Lt. Denis said they're patrolling a small concentrated area, and hope to be able to resolve this by Wednesday. The water level in the creek has dropped about one foot since Tuesday from its previous level of 6 to 7 feet, Lt. Denis said. However, the creek is usually only a foot or two deep.

The Community United Effort (CUE) Center for Missing Persons, traveled from Wilmington, NC to Socastee to aid police in the search for baby Grace. Police say Toney claimed to have lost her baby in a Socastee creek Tuesday morning. Crews called off the search Tuesday night for the missing Socastee baby after water began to rise. According to Lt. Raul Denis, a homeowner reported finding a woman, later identified as Toney, on her back porch. The initial call to officers was in reference to a suspicious person around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday. Toney then reportedly told the homeowner she went into the creek with her child, Lt. Denis adds. Investigators revealed that Toney lost her baby in a rushing creek behind a home on Simms Drive. Toney was transported to Conway Hospital for “medical clearance” while officials searched for the child Tuesday afternoon. “Anything she tells us has to be investigated and corroborated,” explained Denis. Detectives canvassed Simms Drive while talking to neighbors. Kaylee White lives in the neighborhood and says she’s seen Toney out walking. “I have two babies of my own; I couldn’t imagine doing anything to them,” stated White. Rescue crews discontinued their search for the infant Tuesday at sunset, says Lt. Denis. The water became too high and too fast for crews to continue the search. Officers returned to search for the baby at 8 a.m. Wednesday morning. “The water is really fast and turbulent so it’s not ideal for any diver to be in it,” said Denis. The baby named Grace is 5-months-old, according to Lt. Denis. Police k-9 agents were called to the scene to aid in the search for the child. Lt. Denis said officers were on scene, along the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Horry County Fire Rescue, conducting an investigation. Horry County Police released a photo of the baby shortly after the search began. According to Lt. Denis, Toney was later arrested on an outstanding, unrelated warrant and is being held at the Horry County Detention Center.

Toney was booked into the jail March 6 at 9:03 a.m. for criminal domestic violence, third or subsequent offense. She was released on 5,000 bond the following day. Toney was also jailed in November 2014 for numerous drug charges.

Reports are swirling that Biebs, 16, and his bodyguards were playing laser tag at a facility in Richmond, British Columbia on Friday night when a 12-year-old boy began hounding him. According to TMZ, when Biebs told the boy to back off, he lashed out and called the superstar a \\"faggot.\\" While TMZ reports Biebs is the victim, the owner of the laser tag center told Canada's CBC News that Biebs was kicked out of the game and the boy's father later called police to report his son was the one who had been assaulted. A member of Royal Canadian Mounted Police told Us Weekly: \\"On Friday around 5:30 p.m. we got a report that a 12-year-old boy was allegedly assaulted at an entertainment facility in Richmond. The boy sustained minimal injuries and did not require medical attention. We are continuing our investigation.\\" According to TMZ, authorities have already concluded that Bieber is not at fault. Baby Biebs has yet to comment on the incident, but he will reportedly go public with his support of the celebrity anti-bullying campaign any day now.

The paragraph states that \\"You rifle through your visual memory and there it is: Vermeer, the 17th-Century Dutch artist who painted extraordinary portraits of women engaged in the ordinary.\\" This statement implies that not only do you remember who Vermeer was, but you also recall specific details about him and the subject matter of his paintings. Johannes Vermeer was a Dutch painter active during the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th century. Born in 1632 in Delft, Netherlands, he is known for his astonishing attention to detail, depictions of light, and the realistic portrayal of his subjects. He focused primarily on domestic scenes, giving prominence to ordinary women engaged in everyday activities. Vermeer's most recognizable work, \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\\" is an excellent example of his ability to capture subtle expressions and the play of light on the subject. Other well-known works of his include \\"The Milkmaid,\\" where a woman is depicted pouring milk from a jug, and \\"Woman Holding a Balance,\\" which showcases a woman weighing jewelry. In the provided paragraph, the person recalls who Vermeer was (a 17th-century Dutch artist), as well as specific details about the type of subjects he painted (women engaged in the ordinary). This demonstrates that the person has a clear memory of Vermeer and his work. In conclusion, based on the information in the paragraph, the hypothesis \\"I couldn't remember who Vermeer was or anything about him\\" is not true. The individual not only remembers who Vermeer was, but also recalls specific details about the artist and his artwork."},{"instruction":"Read the bio below and try to give details on ricky vela 's: - instrument - website - years active - birth name - origin - genre - alias - name - background - label - associated acts - occupation Bio: ricardo \`\` ricky '' vela is an american award-winning songwriter and keyboardist for the band selena y los dinos . vela joined the band as the bands keyboard player in 1984 . his great works include creating songs for selena .

Context: I'm going to take something that happened to my daughter for this answer. Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse.

But there are tons of better recordings out there, why should we keep this one? Answer:","output":"This review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. Here are my step-by-step thoughts and justifications: 1. The review title mentions that the product is \\"interesting but not worth keeping.\\" This gives me an initial impression that the product might have some intriguing aspects, but overall, it may not be worth purchasing or keeping in the long term. 2. The reviewer has purchased the cassette and listened to it, which means they have firsthand experience with the product. This makes their opinion more valuable than someone who hasn't actually used the product. 3. The reviewer is amazed by the fact that one of the artists involved was only 12 years old. This piece of information is impressive and might initially make me more interested in the product. 4. However, the reviewer then states that \\"there are tons of better recordings out there.\\" This statement suggests that the product might not be the best available option, and there are potentially better alternatives. 5. Lastly, the reviewer questions why they should keep this particular recording, implying that it's not a worthwhile purchase. This further strengthens my impression that the product may not be high-quality or worth buying.

Nutrients provide energy, support growth and development, and help regulate various bodily functions, while oxygen is essential for cells to produce the energy they need to perform their tasks. 2. Blood also transports metabolic waste products away from the cells.

Option A (seatbelt) involves the driver using a safety device and does not describe the action the driver took after hitting a post. It's not a proper response to the situation. Option B (suffer damage) is a result of hitting the post and isn't an action the driver consciously decided to take, so it doesn't directly answer the question. Option C (gain speed) and Option D (slow down) describe changes in speed, which can happen in any situation and do not clearly express what an inattentive or fleeing driver would typically do in this scenario.

Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it.

Article: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog. Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation. \\"The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,\\" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery. The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are \\"extremely difficult, if not impossible\\" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said. The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face. The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants, Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue. Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers. Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant.

'' stanton rogers had replied tightly , \`\` back off ,","output":"Paul. It's my life, and I have to make my own decisions.'' As Stanton and Barbara were an unlikely pair, their differences in political ideology caused significant tension and discord in their relationship. The couple became increasingly distant as their political allegiances took center stage, with Stanton embracing liberal ideologies and Barbara staunchly supporting conservative principles. This widening gap proved to be insurmountable in their relationship, ultimately leading Stanton to consider divorce despite the potential impact on his reputation and professional career. At the core of their disagreements were several issues that highlighted their contrasting political beliefs. Stanton, being a liberal, was a strong advocate for social justice and believed in addressing systemic inequalities through progressive policies and legislation. He valued individual freedoms, environmental sustainability, and championed the need for accessible healthcare and education for all. On the other hand, Barbara's archconservative approach to politics placed a strong emphasis on limited government intervention, traditional values, and rigid fiscal policies. She argued for a more laissez-faire approach to the economy and strongly opposed any regulation or policies she perceived as infringing on individual liberties, viewing them as overreach. In their personal and social lives, Stanton and Barbara's political differences manifested as contentious discussions and arguments that tested the limits of their relationship. Friends and family members took notice, adding fuel to the already volatile mix. Stanton's closest friend, Paul Ellison, was well aware of the strain between Stanton and Barbara, and expressed his concerns when Stanton brought up the idea of divorce. Paul knew the ramifications of a divorce could be immense for Stanton's career, as he was a successful and well-known figure in the political arena. However, despite the potential negative consequences on his professional life, Stanton reached a point where his happiness and personal fulfillment could no longer be sacrificed at the altar of ideological conflict. He no longer wished to live a life filled with tension and incompatibility, and came to the realization that the differences between him and Barbara were too vast to ignore. In the end, Stanton decided that staying true to his beliefs and pursuing a life of personal happiness and growth was the right decision, even if it meant facing the challenges of a divorce. He reasoned that if his career suffered as a result, it was worth finding solace in being free from a strained and conflict-ridden marriage. The difficult journey toward divorce may have been an arduous one, but ultimately, Stanton would remain true to his values and seek out a more fulfilling future, both personally and politically. In conclusion, the story of Stanton and Barbara serves as a commentary on the role of ideological differences in personal relationships and the difficulties of reconciling conflicting viewpoints. Their story shows that despite the love and commitment that may exist in a marriage, sometimes the divide between two people’s beliefs can grow too wide to bridge, leading to the difficult decision of seeking a happier life apart from one another."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Sentence A: \\"If you want to awake then you should go to sleep.\\" In this sentence, the idea is presented that in order to wake up (become fully awake), you should first go to sleep. This statement makes sense, as it is a natural part of the sleep-wake cycle. When someone sleeps, the body enters a state of rest and recuperation, which eventually leads to waking up more refreshed and alert. Sentence B: \\"If you want to awake then you should stay awake.\\" This sentence suggests that in order to become fully awake, a person should remain in a state of wakefulness without sleeping. This statement is illogical and contradictory, as it does not acknowledge the need for sleep to reconnect with a fresh and alert state. Staying awake indefinitely can lead to various negative effects, including physical and cognitive impairments, which contrasts with a person's desire to feel awake. After the analysis, it is clear that Sentence B: \\"If you want to awake then you should stay awake\\" is nonsensical, as it contradicts the natural and essential process of sleep-wake cycles, and presents an impractical and illogical solution to the desire to become awake."},{"instruction":"Twenty years ago almost all nurses were women, and almost all pilots were men.

He is especially despised by PFC Peter \\"Pete\\" Conway, the arrogant, college-educated son of an officer, Colonel Sam Conway under whom Stryker served and admired, and PFC Al Thomas, who blames him for his demotion.

Here's why: Firstly, it is important to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than one that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. It has exactly two distinct natural divisors: 1 and itself. Starting with the first number, 29 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 29. Next, 77 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and 77 (it can be divided by 7 and 11 without a remainder). Then, 846 is not a prime number either because, among other divisors, it can be divided by 2 without a remainder (meanwhile, prime numbers can't be even, except for the number 2). For the same reason, 16 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 2, 4 and 8. Finally, 137 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 137.

I was assisting in the delivery of an infant. My specific task was to work with the rather over-excited father-to-be. He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves. That was 30 years ago, and I still get tears just thinking about what I consider the most beautiful moment of my life, one that I was lucky to share with these two wonderful people.

As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Stargazers across the world wait for 2020 when newly discovered very bright Neil's comet would start to pass through the inner solar system On December 21, 2020. After December 27, 2020 the comet would leave the inner solar system. Like many other enthusiasts Ken bought a telescope for the event. His friend Mike is interested in that event too, but is too busy to buy a telescope. Would Neil's Comet be visible or not visible on December 21, 2020? Answer:","output":"Neil's Comet is anticipated to be visible on December 21, 2020, as it begins its journey through the inner Solar System. This newly discovered comet has generated excitement among stargazers and astronomy enthusiasts worldwide due to its exceptional brightness, which is expected to make it visible even to the naked eye on this date. Ken's decision to purchase a telescope for the event will enhance his observation experience, providing him with a magnified and clearer view of the comet. On the other hand, Mike, who is too busy to buy a telescope, can still witness this celestial event without any optical aid. However, his experience might be less detailed compared to Ken's, and he may miss out on some of the comet's intricate features. The visibility of comets depends on various factors such as their brightness, their proximity to Earth, and the local viewing conditions like cloud cover, light pollution, and atmospheric transparency. As Neil's Comet passes through the inner Solar System on December 21, 2020, solar radiation will cause its volatile materials to vaporize, creating a spectacular tail and coma. These features will become visible through the reflection of sunlight by its dust particles or the glowing of gases caused by ionization. Although most comets are too faint to be seen without the use of a telescope, Neil's Comet is an exception due to its extraordinary brightness. Thus, it is expected to be visible from Earth between December 21 and December 27, 2020, before it leaves the inner Solar System. In conclusion, Neil's Comet will be visible on December 21, 2020. Both Ken and Mike should be able to appreciate this rare spectacle, although Ken's telescope will undoubtedly offer a more detailed and enhanced viewing experience. It is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for stargazers across the globe, as they eagerly await the arrival of this remarkable celestial phenomenon."},{"instruction":"Solve -204722595*q + 204722606*q + 495 = 0 for q..

To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid. Which compound would have higher boiling point, compound A or compound B? Hint: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. Answer:","output":"Compound A, the polar compound, would have a higher boiling point than compound B, the nonpolar compound. This is because polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points due to the additional energy needed for their molecules to move apart from one another, which is caused by the presence of hydrogen bonds and other types of intermolecular forces."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: what is bevo in text terms?

The face was of crystal, and engraved Upon it the figures flashed and waved With zircons, and beryls, and amethysts. It took a week to make, and his trysts At night with the Shadow were his alone.

Samoa Air, which opened in 2012, asks passengers to give their personal weight during booking, which is then charged according to the length of a flight. The customers will also be weighed just before they board the plane. \\"It is believed that all people throughout the world are the same size,\\" Samoa Air CEO Chris Langton said. \\"Airplanes always run on weight, not seats.\\" \\"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the concept of the future. This is the fairest way of your travelling with your family or yourself.\\" Though the airline introduced the plan last November, it caught people's attention last week when the carrier began international flights to neighboring American Samoa. Almost at the same time, a Norwegian economist, Bharat Bhatta, published a report suggesting that airlines should charge obese passengers more. The Pacific Islands contain some of the world's most common countries for obesity, many ranking in the top 10, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Samoa is ranked number four, with 59.6 percent of the population considered obese, said the most recent WHO report. According to Samoa Air's latest schedule, the airline charges up to 0.57 per kg for flights in Samoa and 1.03 per kg for its only international flight to American Samoa, around 250 miles. Children under 12 are charged 75 percent of the adult rate, with fares also based on weight. Any overweight baggage is calculated at the same rate as the passenger's personal weight. The plan could actually prove cheaper in some cases, such as for families travelling with small children, and Langton said customer reaction has mainly been \\"amazingly positive\\".

What is the answer?","output":"The company that described its products as \\"Finger Lickin' Good\\" is KFC, which stands for Kentucky Fried Chicken. KFC is an American-based, fast-food restaurant chain that was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders in 1930 in North Corbin, Kentucky. The company is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, which also owns other popular fast-food chains, such as Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. KFC's famous tagline, \\"Finger Lickin' Good,\\" was introduced in the late 1950s and was predominantly used to market their signature product, fried chicken. The phrase intends to convey the deliciousness and irresistibility of KFC's chicken, implying that customers will be compelled to lick their fingers to savor every last bit of flavor. KFC is best known for its pressure-cooked, seasoned chicken, which is typically served in buckets or individual portions. While fried chicken is the centerpiece of the KFC menu, the company has expanded its offerings over the years to include other popular items such as chicken sandwiches, wraps, salads, and side dishes such as mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and biscuits. In addition, KFC has introduced different variations of their fried chicken recipe, like grilled and extra crispy, to cater to different customer preferences. As of now, KFC has a presence in over 140 countries worldwide, making it one of the largest fast-food chains across the globe. It continues to innovate and expand its menu offerings, while also focusing on maintaining customer loyalty through a combination of food quality, taste, and value. In August 2020, however, KFC decided to temporarily suspend the use of the \\"Finger Lickin' Good\\" slogan in their advertising due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as the company deemed it inappropriate given the heightened emphasis on hand hygiene and avoiding potential health risks.

Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20] Now, I have a new situation: 2018 was a very wet year for the Four Corners area, because of the subtropical ridge, 2019, on the other hand was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength in this year. Answer this question please: Which month of the year was drier, August 2018 or August 2019? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it suggests that 2018 was a wet year for the Four Corners area due to a stronger subtropical ridge, while 2019 was a dry year as the subtropical ridge lacked strength. Although specific monthly data is not mentioned, we can infer that the monsoon conditions were influenced by the strength of the subtropical ridge in each respective year. In 2018, the subtropical ridge was stronger than normal, causing wetter monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest. Since the monsoon season typically spans from July to September, we can assume that August 2018 was a wet month in the Four Corners area due to the stronger subtropical ridge promoting more monsoon moisture and thunderstorms. In contrast, in 2019, the subtropical ridge lacked strength, leading to a drier year in the Four Corners area. Given this information, it is reasonable to assume that August 2019 was a drier month compared to its counterpart in 2018, due to the weaker subtropical ridge suppressing monsoon moisture and thunderstorms. Therefore, based on the given background, August 2019 was likely the drier month compared to August 2018 due to the weaker subtropical ridge that caused a break in the monsoon regime and drier conditions in the Four Corners area."},{"instruction":"Translate to Russian: Erica Batchelor Russian:","output":"Erica Batchelor Russian: Эрика Бэтчелор Please note that this is a phonetic translation, which means that we adapted the name to the Russian alphabet, so it sounds similar when spoken."},{"instruction":"Q:I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Premise: \\"Three men in green suits\\": The premise provides the number of men (three) and describes their attire (green suits). However, it does not specify if these men are businessmen or if their attire identifies them as such. Therefore, we cannot make any assumptions about their profession based on outfit alone. 2. Premise: \\"Walking on a sidewalk\\": The premise describes the action of the subjects (walking) and their location (a sidewalk). This detail gives us a general context and suggests an outdoor setting, but it does not provide any information about the purpose of their walk, nor if they are engaged in any specific activity such as a meeting. 3. Hypothesis: \\"Businessmen\\": The hypothesis assumes that the men are businessmen, a detail that is not explicitly stated or implied in the premise. Thus, we cannot confirm this assumption based on the information provided in the premise alone. 4. Hypothesis: \\"Having a meeting outdoors\\": The hypothesis claims that the men are having a meeting outdoors. While the premise describes an outdoor setting, it does not state or imply any interaction among the men, such as a discussion or negotiation associated with a meeting. Therefore, we cannot support this assumption based solely on the premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis, \\"Businessmen are having a meeting outdoors,\\" is not directly entailed by the premise, \\"Three men in green suits are walking on a sidewalk.\\" The hypothesis makes assumptions about the subjects' occupation and their activities, which are not explicitly supported by the information in the premise."},{"instruction":"Question: - The consumer throws aluminum cans and foil into a recycle bin - The aluminum is collected - Taken to a treatment plant - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned ready for reprocessing - The aluminum is re-melted - Turned into molten aluminum - The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the aluminum recycling process involves the creation of new aluminum products from the flattened, rolled-out aluminum sheets or plates that have been manufactured from the aluminum ingots. This final stage revolves around fabricating and shaping the recycled aluminum material into desired final products, followed by their distribution to various industries and consumers. Once the aluminum ingots have undergone the milling process and have been rolled into thin sheets or plates, they are now ready for further processing. The thickness and shape of these sheets can be adjusted according to the specific needs of the market. There are several processes employed during this stage, depending on the type of aluminum products that need to be created. Some common methods of fabrication include: 1. Extrusion: This process involves pushing the aluminum alloy through a die shaped in the form of a specific profile, creating long, continuous lengths with a consistent cross-sectional shape. These extruded profiles are used for various applications such as window and door frames, signposts, curtain walls, and structures for vehicles. 2. Casting: Aluminum is cast into different shapes and forms using various casting techniques like die-casting, sand casting, or permanent mold casting. The cast aluminum components are then used in automotive parts, aircraft structures, housings, appliances, and other products. 3. Forging: In this process, aluminum is heated and then shaped by applying a compressive force using hammers, presses, or other forging tools. Forged aluminum products are known for their superior strength and durability, and are often used in safety-critical applications such as aircraft components and automotive suspension systems. 4. Stamping: Aluminum sheets are stretched and formed into complex shapes by using a stamping press, which exerts a high amount of pressure on the metal. Common applications of stamped aluminum include automotive body panels, household appliances, and packaging. 5. Machining: Using specialized cutting tools and computer numerical control (CNC) systems, aluminum sheets or plates can be precisely cut, drilled, turned, or milled into desired shapes. Machining is vital for creating intricate parts required in various industries, such as aerospace, automotive, and electronics. Once these new aluminum products have been fabricated and shaped as required, they undergo several quality control checks to ensure that they meet the necessary standards and specifications. Then, these products are packed and transported to various industries and markets, such as construction, automotive, aerospace, consumer goods, packaging, and more. In conclusion, the last step in the aluminum recycling process is the fabrication and shaping of recycled aluminum into new products, followed by their distribution to various industries. This culminates in a closed-loop recycling system, as the aluminum continues to be recycled and reused, dramatically reducing its environmental impact compared to extracting raw materials."},{"instruction":"Given the following reasoning and answer, what was the question?

But I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. What is an answer for this question: Which planet used fewer chlorine gasses? The answer to this question is:","output":"Planet B used fewer chlorine gases. This is because Planet B respected the environment and used ecological products, which means they likely implemented measures and policies to reduce the emission of harmful substances such as chlorine and bromine gases. In contrast, Planet A emitted a lot of air pollution, destroying its ozone layer. The destruction of the ozone layer can be attributed to the release of chlorine and bromine gases, implying that Planet A used more of these harmful substances. Therefore, Planet B used fewer chlorine gases to maintain a healthier environment and protect its ozone layer."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What's the answer to that question: where did jennifer hudson go to school?
