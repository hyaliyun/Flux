When you query OpenAI's language models, each request is billed based on the number of \\"tokens\\" it consumes. A token roughly corresponds to a piece of a word, which can be ~4 characters of English text on average. However, this is not a strict rule, and the relationship between text length and token count can depend on several factors, such as word length, use of special characters, and white space. To calculate the number of tokens, you would generally follow these steps: 1. Find out how the language model you're using defines a token. For OpenAI's GPT model, a token is roughly equivalent to a byte-pair-encoded (BPE) token. This can be a word or part of a word (subword). 2. Use the tokenizer provided by OpenAI or implement your own if you are not interacting with the API directly (in which case you would have to ensure it's compatible with OpenAI's tokenizer). 3. Tokenize your input string with the tokenizer to count the number of tokens. 4. If you are interacting with the API, it will automatically count the tokens for you and this information will often be returned in the API response. Here's an example of how you might use Python to count the number of tokens used by an OpenAI API response by simply inspecting the response object: \`\`\`python import openai # Set up your API key from OpenAI openai.api_key = 'your-api-key' # Replace 'your-prompt-here' with your actual prompt response = openai.Completion.create( engine=\\"davinci\\", prompt=\\"your-prompt-here\\", max_tokens=50 # or however many tokens you expect to use ) print(\\"Response:\\", response['choices'][0]['text']) print(\\"Tokens used in input:\\", response['usage']['prompt_tokens']) print(\\"Tokens used in output:\\", response['usage']['completion_tokens']) print(\\"Total tokens used:\\", response['usage']['total_tokens']) \`\`\` This example assumes that the \`openai\` Python package is installed and that you have set up your API key correctly. The OpenAI API typically returns a \\"usage\\" object in their JSON response that includes how many tokens were used for the prompt and the completion. Please note that the details of how tokens are counted and billed can vary by API service, so if you are not using OpenAI's API, you should refer to the documentation of the service you are using for the exact details on token counting."},{"instruction":"import openai # Set up your API key from OpenAI openai.api_key = ‘your-api-key’ # Replace ‘your-prompt-here’ with your actual prompt response = openai.Completion.create( engine=“davinci”, prompt=“your-prompt-here”, max_tokens=50 # or however many tokens you expect to use ) print(“Response:”, response[‘choices’][0][‘text’]) print(“Tokens used in input:”, response[‘usage’][‘prompt_tokens’]) print(“Tokens used in output:”, response[‘usage’][‘completion_tokens’]) print(“Total tokens used:”, response[‘usage’][‘total_tokens’]) Edit the above code to suit the below: import os from openai import OpenAI client = OpenAI( # This is the default and can be omitted api_key=os.environ.get(\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\"), ) chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create( messages=[ { \\"role\\": \\"user\\", \\"content\\": \\"Say this is a test\\", } ], model=\\"gpt-3.5-turbo\\", )","output":"It seems you want to adapt the previous example to use a different OpenAI client setup and the new ChatGPT model.

Typically, the response will give a session-level count of tokens used. For the Chat API (like gpt-3.5-turbo), you often track the conversation state and the total tokens yourself across multiple messages if you need detailed per-message token usage. Remember to set your OpenAI API key in your environment variables or directly in the code (not recommended for security reasons). If you have not done so, you can set it in your environment using the command line: \`\`\`bash export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key' \`\`\` Or in your script directly: \`\`\`python openai.api_key = \\"your-api-key\\" \`\`\` But it's crucial to understand the security implications of hardcoding secrets in your code, especially for production use.

Here's corrected code, which attempts to calculate the tokens for each response. Please note that OpenAI's API currently does not provide a direct way to calculate the number of tokens used per response in a chat, but only the total token usage. Therefore, you will have to manage the token accounting yourself if you need detailed tracking: \`\`\`python import os import openai # Set up your API key from OpenAI openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY') # Assuming this is the start of a conversation messages = [ { \\"role\\": \\"user\\", \\"content\\": \\"Say this is a test\\", } ] chat_completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create( messages=messages, model='gpt-3.5-turbo', ) # Retrieve the completion response completion_response = chat_completion if isinstance(chat_completion, dict) else chat_completion.to_dict() # Assuming OP wants to track tokens used in this particular interaction # However, note that OpenAI's ChatGPT API does not provide exact token counts per interaction. # Instead, it provides the aggregate token usage for the session. if 'usage' in completion_response: print('Total tokens used (including prior interactions in the session):', completion_response['usage']['total_tokens']) else: print('No token usage information available in response.') \`\`\` This script assumes a session is started and can track the total number of tokens used for each interaction. However, keep in mind that without individual message token counts, you can only track the cumulative tokens used at the end of each chat session. The OpenAI API does provide a \`usage\` object in the JSON response that shows the total number of tokens used in all of the previous interactions within the current session, but, as stated before, it does not provide a token count per individual message. For this reason, if you need to track tokens per message, a workaround would be to track the token counts before and after each interaction to determine the number of tokens used in that specific interaction, like this: \`\`\`python # Before the request total_tokens_before = ... # Retrieve from your records # Make the API call and get the response ... # After the response total_tokens_after = ... # Extract from the response['usage']['total_tokens'] # Calculate tokens used in this interaction tokens_used_this_interaction = total_tokens_after - total_tokens_before \`\`\` To implement this, you would need to store the \`total_tokens_before\` somewhere like a database or file or manage the session state in your application, and update it with the \`total_tokens_after\` each time you make a new chat completion request."},{"instruction":"Write two pythonfunction but set the second function to run after a delay of 5 secs after the first function has completed running.","output":"You can achieve this by using the \`time.sleep()\` function from Python's standard library for the delay.

Here, I assumed that \`response\` might be a \`ChatCompletion\` object, but the same approach applies if it's a dictionary: you can go straight to extracting the \`usage\` key. The \`get()\` method is used to avoid a \`KeyError\` in case the key does not exist in the dictionary, which gives you more graceful error handling. The above code assumes that you already have the \`response\` that is an object you've retrieved from the OpenAI API. If \`response\` is a string representation of the object (as it seems in your example), you'll first need to parse it to convert it into a Python object. If \`response\` is just a string snippet or a manually created representation and not an actual response from an API call, you may need to convert this representation into a structured format such as a dictionary before you can access its contents.

Decided December 26, 2015.","output":"Firstly, it's important to clarify that hypothetical SCOTUS cases are not actual historical occurrences but hypothetical scenarios crafted for the purpose of discussion or exploration of legal principles. As of my last knowledge update in early 2023, there was no case titled \\"Trump v. Mexico\\" heard by the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) in 2015. To discuss a hypothetical case, we need to concoct a premise for the dispute. Imagine a situation where Donald Trump, prior to becoming President of the United States, files a lawsuit against the country of Mexico for some reason—maybe a contractual dispute relating to one of his business ventures or an alleged harm. In the context of international law, it's unlikely that such a case would be taken up by SCOTUS directly because matters involving disputes between a private citizen and a foreign nation typically involve questions of international law and treaty obligations, not the kind of matters that would come before the U.S. Supreme Court directly in the first instance. Disputes between nations or a citizen and another nation generally involve diplomatic channels and international courts or arbitration forums, such as the International Court of Justice or the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). If, somehow, the case were to end up before the Supreme Court, it would have had to come through lower federal courts and present an issue of federal law or constitutional import. Assuming we have such a situation, the Supreme Court in 2015 was composed of the following justices: 1. Chief Justice John Roberts 2. Justice Antonin Scalia (until his death in February 2016) 3. Justice Anthony Kennedy 4. Justice Clarence Thomas 5. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 6. Justice Stephen Breyer 7. Justice Samuel Alito 8. Justice Sonia Sotomayor 9. Justice Elena Kagan An exact ruling on a hypothetical case without facts is impossible to predict. However, the Justices would likely address the jurisdictional issues of such a case, as well as any matters of federal law, such as the application of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), which outlines the circumstances under which a foreign sovereign nation can be sued in U.S. courts. Assuming it met the criteria for an exception under FSIA or some other pertinent federal law issue, the case would be heard on its legal merits. With a majority of center-right Justices at the time (Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito), if the legal issues were ones that could be construed in alignment with conservative legal principles, it’s conceivable that Trump could prevail. Conversely, if the case hinged on more liberal interpretations of the law or international principles, the liberal Justices (Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan) might form the opposing view. However, since there's no actual case or legal issue presented, we cannot speculate further on the outcome, only on the general principles that might be at play in such a hypothetical legal dispute."},{"instruction":"hypothetical scotus case, Trump v. Biden, 2015, with SCOTUS judges of 2015. Decided December 26, 2015.","output":"As with any hypothetical case, there's no historical record of \\"Trump v. Biden\\" being adjudicated by the Supreme Court in 2015 or at any other time as of my last knowledge update in early 2023. To engage with the premise of a hypothetical case titled \\"Trump v. Biden\\" decided on December 26, 2015, we would first need to imagine a situation or legal question that could have brought such a dispute to the nation's highest court. Let's conjure a fictional scenario where Donald Trump, a businessman and television personality at the time, was involved in a legal dispute with then-Vice President Joe Biden. Maybe the dispute could be related to a policy decision that affected Trump's business interests. However, typical disputes of this nature would likely involve administrative law and wouldn't be a direct case between two individuals but rather between an individual and a government agency or entity. For this imaginary case to end up before the Supreme Court, there would have had to have been significant legal questions—likely constitutional issues—that needed resolution. Furthermore, the case would typically need to be appealed through lower courts before the Supreme Court would agree to hear it. Given the date of December 26, 2015, this would not only be an unusually rapid progression through the court system but also an unusual date for a decision, since the court does not typically release decisions during the holiday season. Considering the justices who served in 2015, as previously listed in my prior response, they would apply the law to the facts of the case irrespective of the individuals involved. The Supreme Court, in general, seeks to resolve legal questions based on the Constitution, laws, and precedents, so the identities of Donald Trump and Joe Biden as the parties would have limited bearing on the outcome. The makeup of the Court in 2015 was such that decisions could be closely divided, often with Justice Anthony Kennedy serving as the swing vote in 5-4 decisions. The conservative justices would likely prioritize issues like the limitation of federal power and strong executive authority, while the liberal justices may focus more on individual rights and interpret the Constitution with a present-day context. Since no specific legal or constitutional issues are cited in the hypothetical, it would be purely speculative to predict the outcome. Without a concrete legal context, we can only assert that the Court would examine the matter before it under the lens of U.S. constitutional and legal principles. Whether the decision would favor Trump or Biden would entirely depend on the case's merits and how those merits interact with established law and the Constitution."},{"instruction":"Make a hypothetical scotus case, Corona Beer v. 45 Barrels of Corona Beer, 2017, with SCOTUS judges of August 2017. Decided November 6, 2017.","output":"To create a hypothetical Supreme Court case by the title \\"Corona Beer v. 45 Barrels of Corona Beer,\\" we need to formulate a premise that would necessitate the involvement of the U.S. Supreme Court and consider the composition of the court in August 2017. Let's use as a basis for our scenario a situation involving trademark law and the seizure of goods. In this case, imagine that \\"Corona Beer,\\" representing the trademark holder of the well-known beer brand, discovers a shipment of 45 barrels of beer that are labeled \\"Corona\\" but suspected to be counterfeit. The United States government, through its customs and law enforcement agencies, has seized these barrels at the border on suspicion that they are in violation of trademark laws, with the intention of preventing them from entering the commerce of the United States. **Hypothesis:** \\"Corona Beer\\" files a lawsuit for a judicial order demanding the destruction of the counterfeit goods. The case travels through the lower courts, which must address questions of intellectual property rights, customs enforcement, and possibly even international trade law. The case reaches an appellate court that issues a complicated or unexpected ruling—perhaps it questions the adequacy of Corona Beer's trademark protections or the scope of the government's seizure powers under the relevant trademarks and customs laws. **Supreme Court Composition, August 2017:** 1. Chief Justice John Roberts 2. Justice Anthony Kennedy 3. Justice Clarence Thomas 4. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 5. Justice Stephen Breyer 6. Justice Samuel Alito 7. Justice Sonia Sotomayor 8. Justice Elena Kagan 9. Justice Neil Gorsuch (who replaced Justice Scalia in April 2017) **Decision Date, November 6, 2017:** The rapid pace from trial court to Supreme Court decision is extraordinary for such a complex case but for the sake of the hypothetical, let's assume an expedited timeline due to the urgency of matters pertaining to customs enforcement and trademark rights. The Supreme Court decides to hear the case to settle legal questions regarding the trademark enforcement actions under the Lanham Act and customs law, as well as the process and criteria for the seizure and destruction of goods that infringe on intellectual property rights. **Hypothetical Outcome:** Given that trademark law typically favors the protection of established trademarks against infringement, it's reasonable to surmise that the majority of the 2017 Court would side with \\"Corona Beer,\\" especially if the case clearly demonstrated that the barrels contained counterfeit goods infringing upon a well-protected trademark. In our hypothetical decision, the majority opinion might be authored by a justice with a strong record on intellectual property law, like Justice Ginsburg, and might emphasize the importance of protecting trademarks from dilution and the public from deception. The opinion could outline the legal basis for the seizure and uphold the right of the trademark holder to request the destruction of counterfeit goods. A concurring opinion might be written by one of the more conservative justices, like Justice Alito or Justice Thomas, emphasizing the property rights of trademark holders and the government's role in protecting U.S. commerce from fraudulent products. Dissenting opinions could raise concerns about the broader implications for international trade or the procedural due process rights of the parties involved in the importation of the disputed goods. A justice like Breyer or Sotomayor might author such a dissent, calling for a more nuanced analysis of the seizure process and the rights of those whose goods are seized. In this highly hypothetical scenario, the Court's decision would rest on the specific statutory interpretations of trademark and customs law, as well as the balancing of various interests, including those of trademark holders, the government's enforcement obligations, and the rights of individuals or businesses engaged in commerce."},{"instruction":"Make a hypothetical scotus case, Joe Biden v. Boe Jiden, 2019, with SCOTUS judges of January 2019. Decided March 16, 2019. Also add Majority, Concurrence, and Dissenting opinion.","output":"Creating a hypothetical Supreme Court case titled \\"Joe Biden v. Boe Jiden,\\" let's invent a situation involving identity and trademark law which would rise to the level of federal review. **Hypothetical Facts:** Joe Biden, in this context, is the former Vice President of the United States and at the time a probable candidate for the 2020 presidential election. \\"Boe Jiden\\" is a fictional character or perhaps a stage name used by an entertainer or a brand trying to capitalize on Biden's name recognition. Joe Biden's legal team alleges that Boe Jiden's use of a phonetically identical name is causing confusion, diluting his \\"mark\\" (his name with political and public context), and infringing upon his right to control the commercial use of his identity. The hypothetical case pivots on the legal issue of whether an individual's name, particularly one with national recognition due to political service, can receive trademark-like protection against confusing or deceptive uses in public and commerce. **Supreme Court Composition, January 2019:** 1. Chief Justice John Roberts 2. Justice Clarence Thomas 3. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 4. Justice Stephen Breyer 5. Justice Samuel Alito 6. Justice Sonia Sotomayor 7. Justice Elena Kagan 8. Justice Neil Gorsuch 9. Justice Brett Kavanaugh (confirmed in October 2018) **Decision Date, March 16, 2019:** **Hypothetical Majority Opinion:** Authored by Chief Justice Roberts, the majority opinion finds that Joe Biden has a protectable interest in his name. Drawing on previous legal precedents regarding the right of publicity and the Lanham Act's prohibition on false or misleading use of names in commerce, the Court rules in favor of Biden. The majority concludes that Biden's name has sufficient public recognition that its unauthorized commercial exploitation by Boe Jiden could potentially cause confusion and does not constitute a permissible use, especially as Boe Jiden's usage is a phonetic imitation intended for commercial gain. **Hypothetical Concurrence:** Justice Sotomayor writes a concurring opinion, emphasizing that the right of an individual, particularly public figures, to control the use of their identity in commerce is not absolute and is subject to free speech considerations under the First Amendment. However, she agrees that in this case, the use by Boe Jiden is likely to cause confusion and lacks sufficient artistic or expressive justification to outweigh Biden's interests. **Hypothetical Dissenting Opinion:** Justice Gorsuch pens the dissent, joined by Justice Thomas. They argue that while the right of publicity is an important interest, the federal government's role in regulating names as trademarks should be limited. They caution against an overly expansive interpretation of the Lanham Act, warning that this could encroach on First Amendment rights and the realm of individual liberty. Dissenters express concern about setting a precedent where a public figure’s name cannot be invoked in political, social, or commercial commentary, debate, or parody without legal ramifications. In this hypothetical scenario, the high-speed progression of the case through the judicial system is extremely unlikely, particularly when dealing with complex issues of trademark law and freedom of speech, but for our exercise, we have suspended that reality. Remember, this case does not reflect any real Supreme Court precedents or actions of the Justices, and it is purely a fictional exercise to consider the legal and interpretative dynamics that could be at play in a Supreme Court setting."},{"instruction":"Make a hypothetical scotus case, Nancy Pelosi, et. al. v.

Amy Coney Barrett, et al.,\\" dated 2020, we first need to establish a fictional legal framework for such a case. Since Nancy Pelosi is a political figure and, at the time, served as the Speaker of the House, and Amy Coney Barrett is a judge, we need a scenario that would reasonably involve both in litigation before the Supreme Court. Hypothetical Case Background: Let's say Congress passed a law, known in our hypothetical as the Judicial Transparency Act (JTA), mandating that all federal judges, including Supreme Court Justices, disclose certain personal financial information and recuse themselves from cases where parties have contributed to their nominating president's election campaign or affiliated political action committees (PACs). A group of federal judges, led by Amy Coney Barrett for the purpose of this hypothetical, sues to challenge the law, claiming it violates the Separation of Powers by imposing undue burdens on federal judges and infringes upon their personal privacy rights. Nancy Pelosi and other members of Congress intervene to defend the law's constitutionality, leading to the case caption, \\"Nancy Pelosi, et al. v. Amy Coney Barrett, et al.\\" Supreme Court Composition, September 2020: 1. Chief Justice John Roberts 2. Justice Clarence Thomas 3. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (up until her passing on September 18, 2020) 4. Justice Stephen Breyer 5. Justice Samuel Alito 6. Justice Sonia Sotomayor 7. Justice Elena Kagan 8. Justice Neil Gorsuch 9. Justice Brett Kavanaugh Justice Amy Coney Barrett was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Donald Trump after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's passing, but for the purpose of this exercise, let's assume she was nominated earlier and is part of the case but not yet confirmed to the Court at the time of decision. Hypothetical Decision Date, October 13, 2020: Given that court decisions usually take many months from hearing to decision, this rapid timeline is significantly expedited for our scenario. Hypothetical Majority Opinion: Authored by Justice Breyer, the majority opinion acknowledges the importance of maintaining judicial integrity and public trust in the judiciary. However, it also recognizes that the JTA, as written, challenges the doctrine of Separation of Powers by allowing a legislative body to impose standards that could affect the impartiality of the judiciary. The court also raises concerns about the privacy implications in the comprehensive nature of required disclosures under the JTA. As a result, the majority rules that the JTA overreaches in some of its mandates and invalidates those provisions as unconstitutional, while leaving intact the potential for more narrowly tailored disclosure requirements that respect both transparency and privacy concerns. Hypothetical Concurrence: Justice Alito writes a concurring opinion and emphasizes that while the transparency aims of the JTA are laudable, the specific implementation of the act interferes with the judiciary's ability to function independently, as mandated by the Constitution. Hypothetical Dissenting Opinion: Justice Sotomayor dissents, joined by Justice Kagan. The dissenters argue that financial disclosures and recusal requirements do not impair judicial independence but rather reinforce it by ensuring that judges are free from the appearance of bias or financial conflicts of interest. They contend that such transparency is in the public interest and crucial for maintaining the credibility of the judiciary in the eyes of the citizenry. Please note that this entire scenario, including the case details, rulings, and the opinions attributed to the Justices, is entirely fictional and purely for illustrative purposes. In reality, federal judges, including the Justices of the Supreme Court, recuse themselves from cases based on established ethical principles, and legislative efforts to alter this procedure would likely be significantly more nuanced and would involve comprehensive constitutional review by the courts."},{"instruction":"Make a hypothetical scotus case, George W.

O'Connor regretted her decision in 2000.","output":"Creating a hypothetical Supreme Court case titled \\"George W. Bush, POTUS, et al. v. John Kerry, et al.,\\" let's imagine a scenario that draws parallels to the 2000 U.S. presidential election dispute in Florida, which ultimately led to the Bush v. Gore case. In 2004, we'll envision a similarly contentious election scenario between President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry. **Hypothetical Scenario:** In the 2004 presidential election, again, the state of Florida is the tipping point with razor-thin margins and disputes over the validity of certain ballots. Allegations of irregularities and voting procedure violations have arisen. The Bush campaign files a lawsuit to stop a particular method of recount that they argue is unconstitutional due to varying standards across counties, while the Kerry campaign argues for the continuation of the recount, asserting that all legitimately cast votes must be counted for the election to be fair. **Supreme Court Composition, November 2004:** 1. Chief Justice William Rehnquist 2. Justice John Paul Stevens 3. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 4. Justice Antonin Scalia 5. Justice Anthony Kennedy 6. Justice David Souter 7. Justice Clarence Thomas 8. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 9. Justice Stephen Breyer **Decision Date, December 19, 2004:** The Court has decided to rule on this case expeditiously given the pressing nature of a presidential election dispute. **Hypothetical Majority Opinion:** Authored by Chief Justice Rehnquist, the majority opinion holds that Florida's recount process lacks a uniform standard in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, drawing on the precedent from Bush v. Gore (2000). The Court rules to halt the recount process that lacks standardized methods for determining voter intent, setting a firm date by which all recount procedures must be completed, to prevent a constitutional crisis. **Hypothetical Concurrence:** Justice O'Connor writes a concurring opinion stating that while she acknowledges and regrets aspects of the Court's decision in 2000, the current case before the Court presents an opportunity to provide clearer guidance for election procedures. She agrees with the majority that equal protection requirements necessitate uniform standards but emphasizes the importance of states developing their procedures within constitutional bounds. **Hypothetical Dissenting Opinion:** Justice Stevens authors the dissent, in which Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, arguing that stopping the recount undermines the democratic process and voters' rights. The dissenters emphasize that the primary goal should be to respect the will of the voters, and discrepancies in recount procedures are insufficient grounds for the Court to intervene in state electoral processes, which are traditionally governed by state law. Justice Souter, also dissenting, would add that while uniform standards are desirable, the urgency of resolving presidential elections should not override the need to ensure accurate vote counts and may argue for remanding the case to Florida's courts with instructions to establish a uniform standard and then continue the recount. Please remember, this hypothetical case is an entirely fictional scenario. The actual 2004 presidential election did not result in a Supreme Court case. The thoughts attributed to the Justices are made up for illustrative purposes and do not reflect any actual opinions or regrets the Justices may have had.

Bush, POTUS, et al. v. John Kerry, et al.\\" scenario, with a twist on the decision-making roles of the Justices. Hypothetical Scenario Recap: In the 2004 election, as in our original hypothetical, Florida is once again a hotspot of controversy with disputes over the vote counting process. Both the Bush and Kerry campaigns have filed competing lawsuits concerning the recount procedures, with the matter escalating to the Supreme Court. **Supreme Court Composition, November 2004:** The same as previously listed. **Decision Date, December 19, 2004:** The Court delivers a rapid decision due to the time-sensitive nature of a presidential election. **Hypothetical Majority Opinion:** Authored by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the opinion now reflects a departure from the decision in Bush v. Gore. O'Connor, joined by Justices Souter, Breyer, Ginsburg, and Stevens, holds that while a uniform standard for counting votes is indeed desirable, stopping the recount process would disenfranchise voters. The opinion emphasizes that the integrity of the electoral process relies on every vote being counted. The Court directs the state of Florida to implement a uniform recount standard overseen by an independent body and proceeds with the recount within a set timeframe to resolve the election. **Hypothetical Concurrence:** Justice Stevens writes a concurring opinion underscoring the right to vote as fundamental. While concurring with the majority in result, Stevens stresses that the judiciary has a role to ensure that the right to vote is not diminished by procedural inconsistencies. **Hypothetical Dissenting Opinion:** Chief Justice Rehnquist, joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, pens the dissent. They argue that the Florida recount procedures, as they stand, violate the Equal Protection Clause due to lack of uniformity. The dissenters express that it is within the Court's purview to prevent the constitutional crisis that could follow from a flawed recount process. They caution that the majority's decision risks undermining the certainty and finality essential to the election of the President. Please be reminded, this entire scenario, from the facts of the dispute to the Justices' opinions, is entirely hypothetical and creative speculation. None of this reflects real case law or the actual views of any Supreme Court Justices. Real-world legal situations involve infinitely more detail and nuance, so be cautious in drawing parallels between this fictional case and genuine legal precedent."},{"instruction":"How would it affect the 2004 US election in this scenario?","output":"In this hypothetical scenario where the Supreme Court, composed as it was in 2004, decided a case between George W. Bush and John Kerry over the Florida vote recount, and assuming the majority opinion led by Justice O'Connor called for a uniform standard for the recount, several potential outcomes and ramifications could have unfolded: 1. **Recount Outcome**: If the recount were mandated to proceed with a uniform standard as laid out by the Court, the ultimate result would depend on the findings of that recount. If the recount determined that Kerry won Florida, it could potentially flip the state's electoral votes, possibly changing the overall election outcome, assuming Florida's electoral votes were decisive. 2. **Public Perception**: A Supreme Court decision that effectively allowed for a full and uniform recount might have been viewed as a corrective measure to the controversy of the 2000 election. Public trust might have been positively influenced by the Court showing a willingness to prioritize the accurate counting of votes over a swift resolution. 3. **Legal Precedent**: A decision of this nature would become a legal precedent. It would have implications for how future election disputes and recounts would be handled, especially in requiring uniform recount procedures. 4. **Political Climate**: The 2004 election was a time of great division in the United States, exacerbated by the ongoing War on Terror and issues like the economy. A second controversial election could have further exacerbated polarization and led to increased calls for reform in the electoral system, including how votes are counted and how election disputes are resolved. 5. **Constitutional Implications**: This scenario could reignite debates around federalism, the Electoral College, and states' rights. There might be increased discourse about federal oversight in elections versus states' control over their electoral processes. 6. **Impact on Justices' Legacies**: The Justices involved in the decision would feel a significant impact on their legacies, particularly Justice O'Connor if she factored her regret into an altered stance from the Bush v. Gore decision. It might be seen as an act of judicial integrity or as succumbing to political pressures, depending on one's viewpoint. 7. **Election Reforms**: This case might have sparked immediate or eventual changes in the law regarding election processes. We could have seen a push toward uniform standards for voting and recount procedures nationwide. Bipartisan efforts might have been galvanized to ensure that such a confusion would be less likely in the future. In reality, the U.S. presidential election of 2004 did not require any intervention by the Supreme Court. President George W. Bush won a clear majority of the popular vote and the Electoral College, including the state of Florida, and was duly re-elected for a second term. The hypothetical scenario discussed is a creative exercise to consider possible ramifications of judicial decisions on the electoral processes and should not be confused with actual historical events."},{"instruction":"Kerry won Florida, flipping from 286-251 to 278-260.","output":"In the hypothetical scenario where a Supreme Court-led recount changes the result of Florida in favor of John Kerry, moving the Electoral College count from 286-251 in favor of George W. Bush to 278-260 for Kerry, several consequences would follow: 1. **Presidency**: The most immediate and profound impact would be on the presidency itself. If Florida's electoral votes could flip the overall outcome to favor Kerry, this means that Kerry would surpass the 270 electoral vote threshold needed to win the presidency. Despite losing the popular vote nationally (which Bush won by a margin of around 3 million), Kerry would become the 44th President of the United States as a result of the Electoral College. 2. **Historical Precedence**: This would mark the second consecutive presidential election where the initial declared outcome was contested and resolved in the Supreme Court, which could have serious implications for public confidence in the U.S. electoral system. 3. **Public Reaction**: The decision would likely provoke a polarized response, with some segments of the population viewing the Supreme Court's intervention as a necessary step for electoral integrity, and others perceiving it as judicial overreach. This could lead to protests and a heightened sense of political division. 4. **Legislative Agenda**: John Kerry's policy priorities as president would be different from those of George W. Bush, leading to a shift in legislative priorities and possibly foreign policy, especially in areas like the management of the Iraq War, environmental policies, and domestic social issues. 5. **Impact on the Supreme Court**: The decision might affect how future nominees to the Court are vetted, as the experience would underscore the high stakes involved when Justices rule on matters that can sway national elections. 6. **Election Reform**: The events of the 2000 and hypothetical 2004 recounts would likely lead to major election reforms. Congress and states would face enormous pressure to standardize election procedures to avoid future disputes. 7. **Partisan Dynamics**: Such a decision could alter the partisan dynamics in the United States, impacting subsequent midterm and presidential elections. The Republican Party would likely endure internal analysis and could experience changes in leadership or policy stances. 8. **Bush Legacy**: For George W. Bush, this scenario would mean a single term presidency, and the Bush legacy would include the controversial ending to his re-election campaign. This might alter his post-presidency activities and how his first term is evaluated by historians. Remember, this entire scenario is purely speculative and does not reflect the actual events. In the real 2004 U.S. presidential election, Kerry conceded to Bush the day after the election, and Bush was inaugurated for a second term the following January. The Supreme Court never heard a case named \\"George W. Bush, POTUS, et al. v. John Kerry, et al.\\" in relation to the 2004 election."},{"instruction":"Kerry's SCOTUS appointments, 2005-2009. Rehnquist died in 2005, and O'Connor retired in 2008.","output":"In this hypothetical scenario where John Kerry wins the presidency in 2004, he would have had the opportunity to make appointments to the Supreme Court during his term, influenced by the retirements and passing of sitting Justices at the time. Given the composition of the Court and the political climate, let's speculate on who President Kerry might have nominated: 1. **Chief Justice William Rehnquist's Replacement (2005)**: With the passing of Chief Justice William Rehnquist in 2005, President Kerry would likely seek a nominee who aligns with his political and judicial philosophy. In contrast to President George W. Bush's real-life appointment of John G. Roberts, Jr., Kerry might nominate a moderate to liberal Justice with a record of centrist or progressive legal opinions. Possible candidates might have included Merrick Garland, who was later nominated to the Supreme Court in 2016 by President Barack Obama, or another well-respected appellate judge with a history of bipartisan support. 2. **Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's Replacement (2006)**: O'Connor announced her retirement in 2005 (effective upon the confirmation of her successor), intending to spend time with her ailing husband. O'Connor was considered a key swing vote on the Court, often bridging the divide between its conservative and liberal factions. Given her role, Kerry might look for a nominee who embodied her moderate swing vote reputation, though likely with a reliably liberal bent. Potential names could have included judges like Diane Wood of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals or Kathleen Sullivan, a distinguished legal scholar and the former dean of Stanford Law School. If O'Connor held off on her retirement until 2008, Kerry would have the opportunity to fill her seat at that later date, potentially with the same pool of candidates. Both choices would be aimed at shoring up a more progressive bloc on the court while attempting to maintain the kind of balance O'Connor provided. These nominations would have likely shifted the ideological balance of the Supreme Court to the left, affecting landmark decisions for years to come. Appointing two Supreme Court Justices would also have been a significant part of Kerry's presidential legacy, impacting various areas of law such as civil rights, environmental regulations, and reproductive rights. Remember, this speculation assumes that Senate dynamics and the political environment would have allowed these nominees to be confirmed. Real-life confirmations often involve a complex interplay of political maneuvering and negotiation, especially when the President's party does not control the Senate. Hypothetically, a President Kerry might face a more contentious nomination process if the Republicans retained control of the Senate during his presidency as they did under George W. Bush."},{"instruction":"Garland is now the Chief Justice, the first Democratic-appointed in over 60 years. Kathleen Sullivan was appointed in January 31, 2008.","output":"In this alternate timeline where John Kerry becomes the President of the United States following the hypothetical 2004 election, his Supreme Court nominations would shape the Court for years, if not decades. Based on the information provided, let's explore this scenario further: 1. **Chief Justice Merrick Garland**: In this alternate history, Merrick Garland is appointed and confirmed as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist in 2005. If Garland assumes the role of Chief Justice, it would represent a significant shift, as he would be the first Democrat-appointed Chief Justice since Fred M. Vinson, who served from 1946 to 1953. Chief Justice Garland would likely steer the Court in a more moderate to liberal direction given his judicial record, which was seen as centrist and pragmatic when he was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Garland’s role as Chief Justice would also have symbolic and practical significance, as the Chief Justice not only presides over the Court’s public sessions but also has substantial administrative duties and plays a strategic role in the Court's jurisprudence by assigning who writes the majority opinion when he is in the majority. In this hypothetical timeline, some of the historic decisions over the past several decades could have turned out differently under Garland’s leadership. 2. **Justice Kathleen Sullivan**: With the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in 2006—and assuming President Kerry convokes a special session for the Senate to confirm his nominee, or O'Connor agreed to prolong her service until her successor is appointed—Kerry appoints Kathleen Sullivan to the Court on January 31, 2008. Sullivan, a highly-regarded legal scholar and former Stanford Law School Dean, if appointed, would have been one of the few Justices on the Supreme Court without prior judicial experience, which is not without precedent. Her academic background and legal expertise, especially in the field of constitutional law, would bring a scholarly perspective to the Court. Sullivan would likely lean liberal in her judicial philosophy, aligning with the other liberal Justices on the Court at the time, such as Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer. Her presence could influence Court decisions pertaining to civil liberties, affirmative action, same-sex marriage, and gender equality, depending on the cases that came before the Court during her tenure. The real-world consequence of these appointments would have been a leftward shift in the Supreme Court's ideological balance. Key decisions that were narrowly decided in our actual timeline could have been swung in a different direction. With the hypothetical assumption of a Democratic-appointed Chief Justice and the addition of another liberal Justice, the Court would take on a new dynamic, possibly influencing outcomes and legal precedents in areas ranging from reproductive rights to campaign finance, environmental regulations, and beyond. It is important to reaffirm that this scenario is purely fictional and speculative. The historical record shows that President George W. Bush won re-election in 2004, appointed Chief Justice John Roberts after the death of Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justice Samuel Alito succeeded Justice O'Connor following her retirement. Merrick Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama in 2016 but was not confirmed by the Senate.

Justices Garland, Sullivan, and Sotomayor, along with the liberal bloc of Ginsburg and Breyer, could form a majority in many key cases, influencing the direction of U.S. law and policy for years. This Court might also be more prone to upholding legislation aimed at expanding healthcare, protecting labor rights, and ensuring environmental protection. Sonia Sotomayor's earlier arrival to the bench than in reality, where she was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009, would allow her to influence an additional term of cases and possibly set a different precedence in legal judgments due to her background and approach to judicial decision-making. This hypothetical scenario illustrates the significant impact that presidential elections and Supreme Court appointments can have on the trajectory of American legal and political systems."},{"instruction":"The liberal bloc has a 6-3 majority, for the forseeable future, until Stevens retired in 2011, replaced by McCain's SCOTUS appointee.","output":"Continuing with the speculative scenario where John Kerry became President in 2005, appointed three Justices (Chief Justice Merrick Garland, Associate Justice Kathleen Sullivan, and Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor) to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the liberal bloc held a 6-3 majority: If Justice John Paul Stevens—widely acknowledged as leading the liberal wing of the Court at the time—retired in 2011, the political landscape for his replacement would be determined by the outcome of the 2008 presidential election. In your scenario, if we assume that Senator John McCain won the 2008 presidential election, he would have the opportunity to nominate a replacement for Justice Stevens. Because the liberal bloc would now be a majority, any conservative Justice appointed by President McCain would not be able to shift the overall balance of the Court. The composition following Stevens' retirement in 2011 would be: 1. Chief Justice Merrick Garland (liberal, appointed by President John Kerry), 2. Associate Justice Antonin Scalia (conservative, appointed by President Ronald Reagan), 3. Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy (swing vote, appointed by President Ronald Reagan), 4. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas (conservative, appointed by President George H.W. Bush), 5. Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (liberal, appointed by President Bill Clinton), 6. Associate Justice Stephen G. Breyer (liberal, appointed by President Bill Clinton), 7. Associate Justice Kathleen Sullivan (liberal, appointed by President John Kerry), 8. Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor (liberal, appointed by President John Kerry), 9. Associate Justice [McCain's Appointee] (ideology depends on McCain's choice). Assuming that McCain would select a conservative or a moderate-conservative Justice to take Stevens' place, this could create a Court with a 5-4 liberal-conservative split, with Justice Kennedy continuing to play a crucial role as the swing vote. While this temporary shrinkage in the liberal majority might moderate some decisions, the Court would still lean left overall compared to the actual Court composition in 2011 following the appointment of Justice Elena Kagan by President Barack Obama in reality. McCain's appointee would also set the stage for the ideological stance for future years, factoring into decisions on critical cases related to issues such as campaign finance, health care, the environment, and civil rights. The hypothetical appointments and retirements serve to illustrate the significant long-term impact that presidential leadership can have on the Supreme Court and the shape of constitutional law in the United States. Presidents not only bring immediate change through policy but also exert influence that lasts for generations through their judicial appointments. This lasting legacy is particularly evident in the decisions of the Supreme Court, which can determine major legal precedents for decades."},{"instruction":"The Garland Court ended up as the most liberal court since Warren.","output":"In the hypothetical scenario where Merrick Garland became the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court under a Kerry presidency and was seated alongside Justices Kathleen Sullivan and Sonia Sotomayor, and assuming that this Court has a liberal-leaning majority for some years, it would indeed be characterized as the most liberal court since the Warren Court, which was known for its progressive decisions throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The Warren Court, named after Chief Justice Earl Warren, made a series of landmark rulings that expanded civil rights, civil liberties, judicial powers, and the federal government's power to enforce individual rights. It made historic rulings such as Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional, and Miranda v. Arizona (1966), which required police to inform suspects of their rights upon arrest. Following this hypothetical liberal trend set by Chief Justice Garland's Court after 2005, the Court would be associated with a period of progressive jurisprudence. Some of the defining characteristics and potential rulings of the Garland Court might include: 1. **Civil Liberties and Rights**: Expansions in the areas of free speech, privacy rights, and protections against governmental overreach, further solidifying individual liberties. 2. **Criminal Justice Reform**: Decisions enhancing the rights of the accused, affirming and expanding the principles set forth in Miranda v. Arizona, and perhaps imposing greater restrictions on capital punishment. 3. **Affirmative Action**: The Court might uphold or expand affirmative action policies aimed at addressing historical inequalities in education and employment. 4. **LGBTQ+ Rights**: Decisions that favor the protection and expansion of rights for LGBTQ+ individuals, possibly including nationwide recognition of same-sex marriage prior to its actual establishment in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), given a favorable composition of the Court. 5. **Healthcare**: The Court might uphold healthcare reforms, such as a public option or single-payer system, should any such legislation come before it. 6. **Environmental Law and Regulation**: Enforcement and expansion of regulatory powers of entities like the Environmental Protection Agency, with a focus on combating climate change through legal channels. 7. **Campaign Finance**: The Court might rule to limit the influence of money in politics, potentially taking a stance similar to the dissenters in the actual Citizens United v. FEC (2010) decision. 8. **Separation of Church and State**: A reinforced strict interpretation of the Establishment Clause, leading to greater separation between government and religious institutions. In reality, such an ideological shift would have profound implications for U.S. law and could significantly shape societal progress and the scope of federal powers. It should be noted, however, this scenario is purely speculative and reflects a sequence of political events that did not occur. It serves to underscore how pivotal presidential elections and Supreme Court appointments are in the fabric of the American political and legal landscapes."},{"instruction":"FEC v. Citizens United case, in the hypothetical court.","output":"In the hypothetical scenario where the U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice Merrick Garland became the most liberal court since the Warren era with a 6-3 liberal majority, the outcome of a case like FEC v. Citizens United could be significantly different. In the actual case, decided in 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that the government could not restrict independent expenditures for political communications by corporations, including nonprofit corporations, labor unions, and other associations. The 5-4 decision was noted for broadening the interpretation of the First Amendment to extend to corporate entities, effectively allowing them to spend unlimited amounts on political campaigns. **Hypothetical Outcome in the Garland Court:** **Majority Opinion:** Chief Justice Garland writes the majority opinion, upholding portions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) that were being challenged and affirming Congress’s interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption in elections. The majority could argue that the BCRA's restrictions on corporate and union expenditures related to electioneering communications are justified by the government's interest in preserving the integrity of elections and preventing undue influence. The majority may point to the dangers of allowing unlimited corporate spending in election campaigns, including the potential erosion of public trust in the political process and the disproportionate influence of wealthy corporations over individual voters' interests. **Concurrence:** Justice Breyer or one of the other liberal Justices might write a concurring opinion focusing on the importance of a level playing field in the democratic process and discussing the role of government regulation in creating an equitable environment for political discourse. **Dissent:** One of the conservatives, possibly Justice Scalia or Justice Thomas, would likely pen a strong dissent defending the First Amendment rights of corporations and arguing against viewing corporate political speech as inherently corruptive. The dissent might emphasize the chilling effect on speech that campaign finance restrictions can have and suggest that the marketplace of ideas is best served when there is minimal governmental interference in political advocacy. **Aftermath:** The hypothetical ruling would maintain limitations on corporate and union spending in elections, preventing the substantial deregulation of campaign finance that occurred after the real Citizens United decision. The decision would reflect a view that the government can regulate corporate political speech to prevent corruption while protecting the democratic process. Campaign finance reform advocates would likely hail the decision, while opponents would criticize it as a constraint on free speech and a blow to the First Amendment. Political campaigns might continue to rely more on contributions from individuals and regulated political action committees, rather than the unbridled spending by super PACs and dark money groups that became prevalent after the actual Citizens United ruling. This speculative analysis serves as an illustration of how the composition of the Supreme Court can have a pivotal impact on landmark decisions, shaping the contours of constitutional law in significant ways."},{"instruction":"How would it affect the 2010 midterms?","output":"Exploring the hypothetical impact of a different outcome in FEC v. Citizens United on the 2010 U.S. midterm elections involves considering how campaign financing could have influenced these elections. If the hypothetical liberal Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Garland had ruled with a majority opinion upholding the campaign finance restrictions and affirming the government's interest in preventing corruption in elections, here's what might have unfolded: 1. **Super PACs and Dark Money**: The actual Citizens United ruling led to a proliferation of Super PACs and dark money groups that could collect and spend unlimited amounts of money. If this was not the case in the hypothetical scenario, there would likely be fewer such organizations influencing the elections, and their financial impact would be reduced. 2. **Campaign Advertising**: The decision would likely have led to less political advertising funded by corporations and unions, particularly ads that directly support or attack a candidate close to election time. This might have altered some close races where advertising can sway undecided voters. 3. **Incumbent Protection**: Campaign finance restrictions can sometimes work to the advantage of incumbents, who already have name recognition and easier access to media. In a more regulated campaign finance environment, challengers may have found it more difficult to raise the funds needed for effective campaigns, potentially resulting in a lower rate of turnover. 4. **Grassroots Campaigning**: Without the overwhelming financial firepower provided by Super PACs, campaigns in the 2010 midterms would likely have leaned more on grassroots strategies and traditional fundraising efforts, including small donations from individuals. 5. **Voter Perception**: A Court decision upholding campaign finance limits could have improved public sentiment about the electoral process if voters felt that corporate and wealthy interests had less influence over campaigns. While these factors might have influenced specific races or even shifted the overall mood of the electorate, it's important to note that the 2010 midterms were also driven by broader political trends. The midterms served as a referendum on President Obama’s policies thus far, such as the Affordable Care Act, and a response to the 2008 financial crisis. There was a wave of Tea Party activism and a strong Republican groundswell, which was motivated by ideological and policy concerns rather than solely campaign funding. Thus, the hypothetical restriction on campaign financing may not have dramatically changed the outcome of the 2010 midterms, which saw significant gains by the Republican Party and the flipping of the House of Representatives from Democratic to Republican control. However, specific races could have been impacted, margins of victory might have been different, and the composition and approach of some newly elected officials might have varied in a scenario with more regulated campaign finance."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

Today's first schedule was a shoot for the 'Kang Woo-jin Sub-character' channel. It was new content related to cooking, and there was also a guest. It was Hwarin. Anyway. -Flap. Kang Woo-jin, with his cap on, was silently reading something. It was the 'Beneficial Evil' script that Producer Song Man-woo had handed over last week. He had already read through episode 1 and was now onto episode 2. And it seemed he had almost finished reading episode 2 as well. \\"......\\" Exactly 10 minutes later, when the van stopped on the congested road, Kang Woo-jin closed the script he was reading. His expression was cynical, but inside, he gave a thumbs up. 'So fun. Wow, did writer Choi Na-na really write this?' Soon, Kang Woo-jin checked the situation outside the window and the time. He also checked his own condition. It seemed like it would take a while, and he was feeling great. 'Should I take a quick taste?' Muttering to himself, Woo-jin stealthily pressed a black square attached next to the 'Beneficial Evil' script. His view changed rapidly. He entered a completely dark subspace and stretched out, also loosening the firmly attached concept.

It was a deep smile that couldn't be seen in his usual concept. \\"Oh- 'Martial arts'?\\" < The Price of the Body (6) > End"},{"instruction":"< 몸값 (10) > 강우진의 출연료 제안을 확인한 최성건은 차분하게 계산기를 두드렸다. ‘1억 5000, 충분히 높다.’ 억대 출연료. 배우마다 다르겠지만 S급 탑배우들 출연료는 보통 2억에서 많으면 5억까지도 책정된다. 탑배우 사이에서도 높낮이는 존재하니까. 물론, 심한호 급의 대배우는 더 받는다. 하지만 현재 강우진이 S급 탑배우까진 아니었다. 금세 따라잡을 속도지만 현재는 그랬다. 그럼에도 1억 5000이란 몸값. 데뷔 1년짜리 배우에겐 언감생심 불가능한 수치. ‘거기다 러닝까지 붙였다.’ 러닝개런티가 붙는 건 취급이 180도 달라짐을 뜻했다. 탑배우들의 계약서에나 볼 수 있는 옵션이니까. 심지어 우진은 이번이 두 번째. ‘실종의 섬’은 과정이 독특했으나 어쨌든 붙었었다. 신인에게 러닝을 선사한 거물들. 이런 경우는 강우진이 최초였다. 곧, 최성건이 턱을 쓸었다. ‘안가복 감독이 우진이를 탑급 비슷하게 보고 있다는 소리지.’ 분명, ‘거머리’ 쪽 안가복 감독이나 영화사는 강우진을 상당히 높게 평가하고 있었다. 충분히 그럴만했다. 하지만 그저 넙죽 받을 최성건도 아니었다. 황당하지만 지금은 강우진이 갑에 위치에 가깝다. 정글인 연예계는 욕심이 짙은 쪽이 을이다. “예, 확인했습니다. 그런데 몇 가지 짚고 넘어갈까 합니다. 현재 우진이는 외국어는 물론 수어까지 통달했습니다. 그 부분도 상정하셨는지요. 거기에 연기적인 부분이나 배우 자체의 티켓파워 역시 생각을 해주셔야······” 협상이 시작됐다. 최성건이 그 어떤 때보다 목소리에 힘을 넣는다. 하지만 예의는 지킨다. 상식을 벗어나진 않는다. 이윽고. “잘 부탁드립니다, 감독님.” “나야말로 잘 부탁해요.” 강우진의 수정된 몸값이 확정됐다. -강우진/ 출연료: 2억/ 러닝개런티 손익분기점 넘길 시 추가 관객 명당 100원 2억이었다. 탑의 초입에는 도달한 수치. 그렇게 계약은 일사천리로 진행됐고, 마무리쯤 주름진 미소를 머금은 안가복 감독이 입을 열었다. “아 그리고, 아직 심한호 배우에게 확정 연락이 온 건 아니고 기다리고 있어요.” “그렇군요. 합류 가능성은?” “글쎄. 재촉은 하고 있어요.” “음. 알겠습니다, 일단 우진이에게 그렇게 말해두겠습니다.” 여기서 안가복 감독의 옆에 앉은 영화사 대표가 끼었다. “심한호 선배님 얘기 듣고 우진씨는 뭐라고 합니까? 혹시 부담을 느낀다거나.” 최성건은 강우진에게 들은바 그대로 전했다. “아니요. 그 부분은 걱정 없으실 겁니다. 우진이는 전혀 상관없다고 했어요.” “······사, 상관이 없다?” “예. 원체 딴딴한 친구라.” “허- 다른 배우도 아니고 심한호 선배님인데 전혀 상관없다?” 이어 팔짱 낀 안가복 감독의 미소가 길게 늘어진다. “말했잖나, 배포 하나만큼은 국내 1등이라고.” 오해였으나 우진을 상기하던 안가복 감독은 대수롭지 않게 주제를 바꿨고. “그래서, 최대표님은 우진군 캐스팅 확정 건을 언제 공식 발표했으면 좋겠어요? 행여 사정 같은 게 있나?” 강우진의 꽉 찬 스케줄을 단숨에 복기하던 최성건이 답했다. “바로 하셔도 현재로서 저희는 문제 될 게 없습니다. 다만, 가능하면 5일 이후면 좋을 것 같습니다.” “5일 이후?” “예, 12월 5일이나 6일 사이 우진이가 윤병선 PD의 ‘우리네 식탁’ 촬영차 미국으로 출발합니다. 촬영 기간은 약 일주일 정도.” “아하- 한국에 없는 공백에 우리 영화 소식이 채워졌으면 한다 이 말인가?” “요청입니다. 꼭 그렇게 돼야 한다는 건 아닙니다.” 덤덤히 읊조린 최성건이 다른 이유를 붙였다. “그리고 만약 심한호 배우님이 합류한다면 나란히 발표되는 형태가 좋다고 봅니다. 대중들이야 별 상관없겠지만, 이 바닥 사람으로서 보기엔 그러는 편이.” “아무래도 그림이 예쁘다?” “예. 심한호 배우님으로 확정된다면 우진이와 오래 보게 될 것이고, 의도치 않은 껄끄러움은 피하고 싶습니다.” “음- 심한호 그 친구한테 두 번째로 시나리오를 줬다만, 발표에도 순위를 매기면 예의가 아니지.” 즉, 한국 배우판 대배우의 체면을 세워주면서도 예의를 차린다는 말. 파급력은 차치하고 본질만 본다면 강우진은 새내기고, 심한호는 역사 또는 전설과 같으니까. 연예계서 잔뼈 굵은 최성건에겐 아주 간단한 계산이었다. 더불어. ‘우진이 단독보단 안가복 감독, 심한호 두 전설 사이에 껴진 상태로 발표되는 게 백배는 나아.’ 폭발력의 차이까지 상정한 것이었다. “아, 물론 심한호 배우님이 상황상 합류가 힘들다면 상관없는 말이긴 합니다.” “알아요. 나도 그 친구 대답을 듣고 발표할 생각이긴 했어요.” 이어 ‘거머리’ 관련 기사들을 핸드폰으로 확인하던 있던 영화사 대표가 작게 웃었고. “언론, 여론 상황이 재밌습니다. 아직 대답 안 한 심한호 선배님은 확정처럼 도는데, 언론서 언급조차 없는 강우진씨는 캐스팅 확정이라니.” 느릿하게 턱을 괴던 안가복 감독이 여유롭게 답했다. “이런 걸 상정한 건 아니었다만, 사람들이 꽤 놀라겠구만.” 후로. 영물 안가복 감독의 100번째 작품이 칸을 향한다는 소식을 영화사가 발표한 뒤. 『[무비IS]역사에 남을 100번째 작품을 칸으로 겨냥한 ‘안가복 감독’, 기류가 심상치 않다』 ‘거머리’를 향한 국내 영화판의 관심을 상상 초월로 드높아졌다. 언론이나 관계자들이 부산을 떨었지만, 그 누구보다 눈에 띄는 것은 국내 탑배우들이었다. 그들이 넘실거리기 시작했다. 본인이 하고 싶다는 욕망, 과연 누가 하게 될까 싶은 궁금증, 이번 안가복 감독의 작품은 어떤 내용인가 하는 관심, 소속사에 말해 오디션 정보를 확인하는 등의 판단. “대표님! 안가복 감독님이나 그쪽 영화사랑 미팅 잡아주세요.” “허- 너 설마. 야야, 아서라 아서. 그 판 끼는 건 득보다 실이 많다고.” “그래도 배우로서 그만한 자리도 없잖아요.” “괜히 시도했다가 까였다간 잡소리만 늘 거고, 행여 합류한다 쳐도 연기 살짝만 삐끗하면 바로 티 난다고. 무려 안가복 감독님 현장이잖냐? 그게 무슨 망신이냐니까? 까딱 몸값이 훅 떨어질지도 몰라!” “그럼에도 누군가는 끼겠죠!” “이, 일단 좀 상황을 지켜보자고. 어차피 1선은 무조건 심한호 선배고, 2선은 탑배우들로 갈 건데 분위기가 어찌 흘러가는지부터 파악하자니까??” 물론, 어느 정도 예상을 하는 현장도 있긴 했다. 권기택 감독의 ‘실종의 섬’ 촬영터였다. 과거 안가복 감독이 들이닥쳤던 탓에, 수십 스탭들은 2선으로 추가될 배우들이 ‘실종의 섬’ 현장에 있다고 추측했다. “그랬네. 그때 다낭으로 안가복 감독님이 온 게······그냥 놀러 온 게 아니라 배우들 보러 온 거였어.” “아무래도 류정민씨 아니겠어?” “그렇지? 가능성이 제일 크긴 해. 근데 유라씨도 무시 못 하지. 최근에 헐리웃에서 결과를 내기도 했고.” “둘보다 살짝 약해도 김이원, 전우창씨도 탑인데?” “저 근데 다낭에서 안가복 감독님이랑 홍혜연씨 얘기하는 거 봤어요. 우정 출연인 거 알고 온 거 아니려나?” 그러다 강우진의 얘기까지 나왔다. “왜들 우진씨는 빼고 얘기해요?” “음- 강우진씨가 지금 무지막지하게 핫하긴 한데······뭐랄까 짬이 좀 부족하잖아요.” “안가복 감독님 작품 주연으로 들어가긴 살짝 필모가 아쉽달까?” “근데 조연급으로는 이미 얘기하고 있을지도.” “와······우진씨가 안가복 감독님 작품에 조·단역으로만 박혀도 필모가 그냥 죽이겠는데??” 반면, 류정민이나 하유라 등의 ‘실종의 섬’ 배우들은 딱히 반응이 없었다. 하지만 속으로는 전부 신경 쓰고 있겠지. 여기서 유일하게 확고함을 가진 건 역시 권기택 감독이었다. ‘······심한호씨라- 왜 우진씨 얘기보다 먼저 나왔지? 혹시, 우진씨 쪽은 엎어졌나?’ 안가복 감독의 심증을 알고 있었으니까. 하지만 상황이 헷갈리긴 했다. 이렇게 지난 시간이 몇 시간. 이른 오후쯤, 현 이슈의 주인공인 안가복 감독은 영화 쪽 대형 잡지사와 인터뷰 중이었다. 숱하게 번지는 찌라시를 정리하기 위함, 작품에 소개를 위해 안가복 감독이 직접 잡은 자리였다. 카메라가 꽤 많다. 안가복 감독에게 질문하는 여자는 아나운서 출신 방송인. “감독님, 최근 심한호 배우님과 같이 찍힌 기사가 뜨셨었는데. 기사 내용이 진짠가요? 이번 100번째 영화에 심한호 배우님이 합류하시는 거.” 짧은 흰 머리의 안가복 감독은 노장다운 미소를 지었다. “허허, 그 기사 때는 정말 심한호 배우님하고 식사했을 뿐입니다.” “아아- 그럼 역시 가짜 뉴스군요?” “가능성은 열어둔 상태지요.” 고개 끄덕인 여자가 주제를 바꾼다. “그럼 감독님, 이번 작품은 칸을 노리신다고 하셨는데요! 시나리오는 나온 상태인가요?” “그렇습니다.” “오오! 혹시 제목이라도 알려주실 순 없나요?” “‘거머리’라고 지었습니다. 여기서 처음 얘기하네요.” “감사합니다! 아시겠지만 국내 배우분들의 관심이 뜨겁거든요? 혹시 눈여겨보시는 배우가 있으신가요?” “물론, 이미 캐스팅보드는 짜여 있지요. 고심 중이고.” “그러시군요.” “흠, 아직 배우 캐스팅 부분은 대외비라 다 말씀드리긴 힘들어요. 배우님 사정도 있고. 정리되면 발표할 예정입니다. 하지만 배우 두 명에겐 이미 시나리오가 넘어갔어요.” 이 인터뷰가 끝난 한 시간 뒤. 안가복 감독은 승합차에 탄 상태였다. 목적지는 그의 집. 오늘 퍽 빡빡한 스케줄을 소화한 탓에 안가복 감독의 얼굴엔 약간의 노곤함이 피었다. 그런 그의 핸드폰이 벨소리를 뱉는다. -♬♪ 느릿하게 핸드폰 화면을 확인한 안가복 감독. 발신자로는 대배우 심한호가 출력되고 있었다. 이어 주름진 미소를 머금은 안가복 감독이 전화를 받으며 작게 읊조렸고. “그래, 결정했나? 내 재촉이 통했는지 궁금하군.” 핸드폰 너머로 심한호의 침착하면서도 굵은 음성이 들렸다. “예. 주신 배역 제가 하지요, 선배님.” ‘거머리’의 두 번째 주연 배우가 확정됐다. 같은 날 밤. TV에 속 공중파 채널에선 9시 뉴스가 한창이었다. 그리고 지금은 어제 있었던 화린의 사건이 보도되는 중이다. [“어제 가수 겸 배우인 화린씨가 주차장에서 괴한에게 습격을 당하는 사건이 발생했습니다. 괴한의 손에는 송곳이 들려 있었으나, 다행히 화린씨는 큰 부상을 입지 않았다고 합니다. 황대기 기잡니다.”] 당연히 화린의 소속사 JML 엔터에서 제보한 것이었다. 그렇기에 필요한 부분만 발표됐다. 잡혀가는 괴한의 사진, 그가 들었던 송곳, 차량에 있던 증거품들, 카메라에 찍힌 화린의 사진 등등. 공포감을 주기엔 충분했다. 참고로 뉴스 내용엔 강우진의 얘기는 빠진 상태였다. 어쨌든 이 뉴스를 시작으로 화린의 사건은 타 뉴스, 라디오 등의 각종 매스컴으로 빠르게 확산됐다. 화린의 소속사가 의도한 것도 있겠으나, 사건이 매우 충격적이며 무겁기에 번지는 건 눈 깜짝할 새였다. 따라서 뉴스가 끝나자 주요 매스컴 전부에서 화린의 이름을 거론하기 시작했고. 『[속보]엘라니 ‘화린’, 괴한하게 습격받아』 밤임에도 기사가 무지막지하게 쏟아졌다. 『아니 이게 무슨 일? 주차장에서 괴한에게 습격당한 ‘화린’···괴한의 손엔 송곳이 들려 있었다/ 사진』 『[스타톡]스토커에게 습격당한 화린······소속사 측 “다행히 다친 곳은 없어”』 『가드들이 제압 천만다행······송곳 든 괴한에게 공격당한 화린』 단숨에 연예계면을 장악했다. 『또 사생팬? 습격당한 ‘화린’ 앞으로 스케줄은 어떻게 되나?』 『화린 습격한 괴한에 관해 경찰 측 “현재 조사 중, 그러나 증거 확실”』 즉, 수많은 이들이 이 사건을 확인할 수 있다는 소리였고. 『[공식]‘화린’ 습격 사건에 JML 엔터 측 “강경대응, 선처 없을 것” 선포』 『앞으로 그 어떤 상황이라도 사생팬, 스토커 등 엄하게 다루겠다 선 그은 JML 엔터』 『“사생팬? 아니 범죄자” 엘라니 팬클럽 분노』 화린이나 걸그룹 ‘엘라니’의 팬들 또는 여론의 격분이 터졌다. -아니 송곳??? 송곳??????? 이거 완전 개또라이새끼네?????? -역하넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ사생팬은 개뿔 걍 살인자임 -ㅠㅠㅠㅜㅠㅜㅠㅜ화린언니 놀랐겠다....아오 진짜 개새끼....개패고싶네... -뉴스 봤는데 개소름....눈앞에서 송곳들고 달려드는 걸 본 화린님은....밤마다 생각날 듯... -사생팬ㄴㄴㄴ범죄자ㅇㅇㅇㅇㅇ -시팔 처키냐??? -선처 절대 해주면 안됨 계속 봐주니까 ㅂㅅ들이 두려운 거 모르고 나대는 거임 -ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ송곳ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ칼보다 무섭 -근데 괴한 새끼 누가 제압해준 거임?? 뉴스보면 가드들이 잡고 있긴 하던데 -당연히 가드들이 잡았겠죠 -(링크)여기 너튭 드가면 사건 정리 나와있는데 진짜 ㅅㅂ소름임....증거물 카메라에 화린 사진만 수백장ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ -ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ와 진짜살면서 이딴 기사를 보는 날이 오다닠ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -화린 언니ㅠㅠㅠ진짜 연예계에 환멸날 듯...... 한정된 곳이 아닌, 너튜브는 물론 커뮤니티나 각종 SNS에서 동시다발적으로. 사태가 거침없이 커질 쯤 화린이 자신의 SNS에 현 상태를 업로드했다. 『분노하는 팬들에게 SNS로 현 상태 전한 화린 “전 괜찮아요, 걱정해주신 분들 모두 사랑합니다”』 대중들의 격분은 더욱 가중됐다. 같은 시각, 한 건물의 지하주차장. 퍽 눈에 익은 곳. 잘 보니 어제쯤 화린의 스토커 사건이 있었던 지하주차장이었다. 현재는 늦은 밤이라 그런지 차도 많이 없고 고요하다. 이때. -스윽. 주차장에 세워진 B사의 검은색 외제차 쪽으로 한 남자가 걸어간다. 자리는 엘리베이터 유리문 바로 앞. 한 손에 가방을 든 남자는 뭔가 얼추 40대에 스마트한 인상이었다. 곧, 남자가 외제차에 운전석에 오르며 한숨을 팍 내쉬었다. “어으- 더럽게 피곤하네.” 투덜대던 그가 룸미러로 얼굴 상태를 체크한 뒤 시동을 걸려다 멈칫. “아.” 뭔가 떠오른 듯 그가 가방 속에서 핸드폰을 꺼냈다. 남자가 접속한 것은 외제차 순정의 블랙박스 앱이었다. “지우는 거 오늘이지?” 그의 평소 버릇이었다. 일주일마다 블랙박스에 저장된 영상들을 지우는 것. 어디선가 그러는 게 좋다는 걸 봤기 때문. 이어 남자가 핸드폰 화면을 터치하자 화면에 그간 저장된 블랙박스 영상이 주르륵 출력됐다. 특이한 것은. “······엥?” 영상들을 쭉 확인하던 그의 눈이 약간 커진다는 것. 이유야 간단했다. 블랙박스에 저장된 것 중 눈길을 사로잡는 영상 하나가 보였으니까. 자신의 차 바로 앞에서 찍힌 상황들. 아니 영환가? 주차장에서 촬영이 있었나? 영상 속엔 흡사 액션 영화를 연상케 하는 장면들이 찍혀있었고. “뭐, 뭐냐 이게?” 주인공은 강우진이었다. < 몸값 (10) > 끝","output":"< The Price of the Body (10) > Choi Seong-geon calmly tapped on the calculator after checking Kang Woo-jin's proposed appearance fee. \\"150 million, that's quite high.\\" Appearance fees in the hundreds of millions. It varies by actor, but the fees for S-grade top actors usually range from 200 million to as much as 500 million. There are levels even among top actors. Of course, a top star like Shim Han-ho would receive more. However, Kang Woo-jin was not yet an S-grade top actor. He was catching up quickly, but that was the current situation. Nevertheless, an appearance fee of 150 million. For an actor with only a year since debut, it was an unimaginable figure. \\"Plus, there's a running guarantee.\\" A running guarantee meant a 180-degree change in treatment. It's an option you'd normally see in contracts for top actors. Moreover, this was Woo-jin's second time. 'The Island of the Missing' had a unique process, but it had been included nonetheless. The big names who had offered a running guarantee to a newcomer. This was a first for Kang Woo-jin. Soon, Choi Seong-geon stroked his chin. \\"It means Director An Ga-bok sees Woo-jin as similar to top-tier.\\" Certainly, Director An Ga-bok of 'Leech' and the film company held Kang Woo-jin in high regard. It was well-deserved. But Choi Seong-geon wasn't one to just accept it. Ridiculous as it may be, right now, Kang Woo-jin was closer to being in the position of power. In the entertainment industry jungle, the more greedy side is the weaker. \\"Yes, I've confirmed it. But there are a few things I'd like to clarify. Currently, Woo-jin has mastered foreign languages as well as sign language. I wonder if you've considered that. Plus, you should think about his acting skills and his ticket power as an actor...\\" Negotiations began. Choi Seong-geon's voice was stronger than ever, but he maintained politeness. He didn't stray from common sense. Eventually. \\"I look forward to working with you, Director.\\" \\"I'm the one who should be saying that.\\" Kang Woo-jin's revised appearance fee was confirmed. -Kang Woo-jin / Appearance Fee: 200 million / Running Guarantee: Additional 100 won per audience member after breaking even It was 200 million. A figure that reached the threshold of the top. Thus, the contract proceeded swiftly, and towards the end, Director An Ga-bok, with a wrinkled smile, spoke. \\"Oh, and by the way, we haven't received a final response from actor Shim Han-ho yet, we're still waiting.\\" \\"I see. What are the chances of him joining?\\" \\"Well, we're pushing for it.\\" \\"Hmm. Alright, I'll let Woo-jin know for now.\\" The film company's president, sitting next to Director An Ga-bok, chimed in. \\"What does Woo-jin say about Shim Han-ho? Does he feel pressured?\\" Choi Seong-geon relayed exactly what Kang Woo-jin had told him. \\"No, you don't have to worry about that. Woo-jin said it doesn't matter to him at all.\\" \\"Doesn't matter?\\" \\"Yes. He's a very solid guy.\\" \\"He's not bothered at all by Shim Han-ho?\\" Director An Ga-bok's smile stretched out as he crossed his arms. \\"Didn't I tell you? When it comes to guts, he's number one in the country.\\" It was a misunderstanding, but Director An Ga-bok, reminded of Woo-jin, casually changed the subject. \\"So, Mr. Choi, when would you like to officially announce Woo-jin's casting? Is there any particular reason?\\" Choi Seong-geon, who had quickly reviewed Kang Woo-jin's packed schedule, replied. \\"You can announce it right away, as far as we're concerned there's no problem. However, it would be better if it could be after the 5th.\\" \\"After the 5th?\\" \\"Yes, between December 5th and 6th, Woo-jin will be heading to the U.S. for the shooting of PD Yoon Byung-sun's 'Our Dining Table.' The shooting period is about a week.\\" \\"Ah, so you want our movie news to fill the gap when he's not in Korea?\\" \\"It's a request. It doesn't have to be that way.\\" Choi Seong-geon calmly added another reason. \\"Also, if actor Shim Han-ho joins, it would be better to announce it side by side. It might not matter to the public, but from within the industry, it's better that way.\\" \\"It would make a prettier picture?\\" \\"Yes. If Shim Han-ho is confirmed, Woo-jin will be working with him for a long time, and we want to avoid any unintended awkwardness.\\" \\"Hmm, I've given the script to Shim Han-ho for the second time, but it wouldn't be polite to rank the announcement.\\" In essence, it was about maintaining the dignity of a great actor in the Korean acting scene while being polite. Ignoring the impact and looking at the essence, Kang Woo-jin was a rookie, and Shim Han-ho was like history or a legend. For Choi Seong-geon, who was seasoned in the entertainment industry, it was a simple calculation. Moreover. 'It's a hundred times better for Woo-jin to be announced between the two legends, Director An Ga-bok and Shim Han-ho, than alone.' He had even considered the difference in impact. \\"Ah, of course, if actor Shim Han-ho can't join due to circumstances, then it doesn't matter.\\" \\"I know. I was planning to wait for his response before announcing it.\\" Then, the film company's president, who had been checking articles related to 'Leech' on his phone, chuckled softly. \\"The media and public opinion are interesting. Shim Han-ho, who hasn't responded yet, is being treated as confirmed, while Kang Woo-jin, who hasn't even been mentioned in the media, is confirmed for casting.\\" Director An Ga-bok, who had been resting his chin on his hand, replied leisurely. \\"I didn't expect this, but people will be quite surprised.\\" Later. After the film company announced that Director An Ga-bok's 100th work was aiming for Cannes. \\"[MovieIS] Director An Ga-bok's 100th work, aiming for Cannes, the atmosphere is extraordinary\\" Interest in 'Leech' within the domestic film industry soared beyond imagination. The media and insiders were buzzing, but the most noticeable were the top actors in Korea. They began to stir. The desire to be part of it, the curiosity about who would get the role, the interest in the content of Director An Ga-bok's new work, and the decisions to check audition information with their agencies. \\"President! Please set up a meeting with Director An Ga-bok or the film company.\\" \\"Hey, you can't be serious. Hey, hey, don't be rash. Getting involved in that scene has more losses than gains.\\" \\"But as an actor, there's no greater opportunity than that.\\" \\"If you try and get rejected, you'll just increase the chatter, and if you join and slightly mess up your acting, it'll be immediately noticeable. It's Director An Ga-bok's set, you know? What a disgrace that would be? You might even see your value plummet!\\" \\"Still, someone will get involved!\\" \\"Let's just watch the situation for now. Anyway, Shim Han-ho is the first choice, and the second choice will go to top actors, so let's see how the atmosphere develops, okay??\\" Of course, there were some who had an idea of what to expect. It was the set of Director Kwon Ki-taek's 'The Island of the Missing.' Because Director An Ga-bok had stormed in before, dozens of staff members speculated that the actors who would be added as the second choice were on the set of 'The Island of the Missing.' \\"That's right. When Director An Ga-bok came to Da Nang... it wasn't just for fun, he came to see the actors.\\" \\"It must be Ryu Jeong-min, right?\\" \\"Right? He's the most likely. But you can't ignore Ha Yu-ra either. She's had results in Hollywood recently.\\" \\"Even if they're slightly weaker, Kim Yi-won and Jeon Woo-chang are also top actors, right?\\" \\"By the way, I saw Director An Ga-bok talking with Hong Hye-yeon in Da Nang. Maybe she knew it was a cameo appearance?\\" Then the conversation turned to Kang Woo-jin. \\"Why are you leaving out Woo-jin?\\" \\"Hmm, Kang Woo-jin is really hot right now, but... he's a bit lacking in experience.\\" \\"Isn't his filmography a bit thin to lead a work by Director An Ga-bok?\\" \\"But maybe they're already discussing a supporting role.\\" \\"Wow... even if Woo-jin only gets a minor role in Director An Ga-bok's work, his filmography would be killer, right?\\" On the other hand, actors like Ryu Jeong-min and Ha Yu-ra from 'The Island of the Missing' didn't show much reaction. But they were all certainly paying attention internally. The only one with certainty here was, as expected, Director Kwon Ki-taek. \\"...Shim Han-ho... Why did his name come up before Woo-jin's? Could it be that Woo-jin's deal fell through?\\" He knew Director An Ga-bok's intentions, but the situation was confusing. As time passed. In the early afternoon, Director An Ga-bok, the protagonist of the current issue, was in the middle of an interview with a major film magazine. It was a meeting he had arranged himself to clarify the numerous rumors and to introduce his work. There were quite a few cameras. The woman asking questions to Director An Ga-bok was a broadcaster with an announcer background. \\"Director, there was a recent article with actor Shim Han-ho. Is the content of the article true? Is actor Shim Han-ho joining your 100th film?\\" Director An Ga-bok, with his short white hair, smiled like a veteran. \\"Heh, at the time of that article, I was just having a meal with actor Shim Han-ho.\\" \\"Ah, so it's fake news?\\" \\"The possibility is still open.\\" The woman nodded and changed the subject. \\"Then, Director, you said you're aiming for Cannes with this work! Is the screenplay ready?\\" \\"Yes, it is.\\" \\"Oh! Could you at least tell us the title?\\" \\"It's called 'Leech.' This is the first time I'm talking about it here.\\" \\"Thank you! As you know, there's a lot of interest from domestic actors. Do you have any actors in mind?\\" \\"Of course, the casting board is already set. I'm deliberating.\\" \\"I see.\\" \\"Hmm, I can't disclose the casting of actors yet since it's confidential. There are also the actors' circumstances to consider. We plan to announce it once it's settled. But the script has already been sent to two actors.\\" An hour after the interview ended. Director An Ga-bok was in a van. The destination was his home. Having had a very busy schedule today, there was a slight weariness on Director An Ga-bok's face. His phone rang. -♬♪ Director An Ga-bok slowly checked the phone screen. The caller ID showed the great actor Shim Han-ho. Then, with a wrinkled smile, Director An Ga-bok answered the phone and murmured softly. \\"So, have you decided? I'm curious if my urging worked.\\" From the other end of the phone, Shim Han-ho's calm and deep voice was heard. \\"Yes. I'll take the role you offered, senior.\\" The second lead actor for 'Leech' was confirmed. That same night. On one of the public TV channels, the 9 o'clock news was in full swing. And now, the incident involving Hwarin from yesterday was being reported. [\\"Yesterday, singer and actress Hwarin was attacked by an assailant in a parking lot. The assailant had an awl in hand, but fortunately, Hwarin did not suffer any serious injuries. Hwang Dae-gi reports.\\"] Naturally, it was a tip-off from Hwarin's agency, JML Entertainment. Therefore, only the necessary parts were announced. Photos of the assailant being arrested, the awl he was holding, evidence found in the vehicle, photos of Hwarin captured on camera, and so on. It was enough to instill fear. By the way, Kang Woo-jin's story was omitted from the news content. Regardless, starting with this news, the incident involving Hwarin quickly spread to various mass media, including other news and radio. It was a very shocking and serious incident, so it spread in the blink of an eye, whether JML Entertainment intended it or not. Therefore, as soon as the news ended, all major media outlets began to mention Hwarin's name. \\"[Breaking] Elani's 'Hwarin', attacked by an assailant\\" Despite it being night, articles poured out relentlessly. \\"What's going on? 'Hwarin' attacked by an assailant in a parking lot... The assailant had an awl in hand / Photos\\" \\"[StarTalk] Hwarin attacked by a stalker...

Hwarin attacked by an assailant with an awl\\" It quickly dominated the entertainment news. \\"Another sasaeng fan? What will happen to 'Hwarin's' schedule after the attack?\\" \\"Police on the assailant who attacked Hwarin: 'Currently under investigation, but the evidence is clear'\\" In other words, numerous people could confirm the incident. \\"[Official] JML Entertainment on the 'Hwarin' attack: 'We will take strong action, no leniency' proclamation\\" \\"JML Entertainment draws a line, saying they will deal strictly with sasaeng fans, stalkers, etc., in any situation\\" \\"'Sasaeng fan? No, a criminal' Elani fan club outraged\\" Hwarin's and girl group 'Elani's fans, as well as public opinion, erupted in anger. -What the hell??? An awl??????? This is a complete psycho?????? -Disgustingㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋsasaeng fans my ass, they're just murderers -ㅠㅠㅠㅜㅠㅜㅠㅜHwarin unnie must have been scared....damn, I want to beat that bastard... -I saw the news and got goosebumps....Hwarin must be haunted by the sight of the assailant rushing at her with an awl... -Sasaeng fanㄴㄴㄴcriminalㅇㅇㅇㅇㅇ -Is this Chucky??? -They must not show any leniency, they keep acting up because they don't know fear -ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷAn awlㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷscarier than a knife -But who subdued that bastard?

Not just in one place, but simultaneously on YouTube, communities, and various SNS platforms. As the situation grew uncontrollably, Hwarin uploaded her current status on her SNS. \\"Hwarin conveys her current state to angry fans via SNS 'I'm okay, I love everyone who worried about me'\\" The public's outrage intensified. At the same time, in the basement parking lot of a building. A very familiar place. It was the basement parking lot where Hwarin's stalker incident had occurred the day before. Currently, it was late at night, so there weren't many cars and it was quiet. Then. -Swish. A man walked towards a black foreign car from Company B parked in the lot. The spot was right in front of the elevator glass door. The man, holding a bag in one hand, seemed to be in his 40s with a smart impression. Soon, the man got into the driver's seat of the foreign car and sighed heavily. \\"Ugh, so damn tiring.\\" As he grumbled and checked his face in the rearview mirror, he was about to start the car but hesitated. \\"Ah.\\" As if something came to mind, he took out his phone from his bag. The man accessed the native black box app of the foreign car. \\"Today's the day to delete it, right?\\" It was his usual habit. Deleting the videos stored in the black box every week. He had read somewhere that it was a good practice. Then, as the man touched the phone screen, the black box videos saved so far scrolled down the screen. What was peculiar was. \\"......Huh?\\" The man's eyes widened slightly as he checked the videos. The reason was simple. Among the saved black box videos, one caught his eye. Situations filmed right in front of his car. Was there a movie shoot? The video contained scenes reminiscent of an action movie. \\"What, what is this?\\" The protagonist was Kang Woo-jin. < The Price of the Body (10) > End"},{"instruction":"{ months: [ \\"January\\", \\"February\\", \\"March\\", \\"April\\", \\"May\\", \\"June\\", \\"July\\", \\"August\\", \\"September\\", \\"October\\", \\"November\\", \\"December\\", ], days: [ \\"Sunday\\", \\"Monday\\", \\"Tuesday\\", \\"Wednesday\\", \\"Thursday\\", \\"Friday\\", \\"Saturday\\", ], title: \\"(1) Pending reward\\", text01: \`\`, text02: \`<b>Dear {OSSTring} user,</b><br>Congratulations !

Go ahead and share your poem, Sayori.\\" Sayori: (Grinning) \\"Thank you, Monika!\\" (Clears her throat and begins reading her poem) \\"In the morning, the sun rises high, Gently waking the sleepy sky. Birds singing, spreading their joy, Nature's beauty, nothing can destroy. Breezy whispers in the air, Caress the flowers with utmost care. Butterflies dance, colors so bright, A symphony of life, a beautiful sight. In this moment, my heart is light, Chasing away any worries from sight. The world may be tough, but that's okay, For in this embrace, I find solace every day.\\" Sayori: (Finishes reading) \\"And that's my poem!

Whenever you're ready.\\" Yuri: (Nervously clutching her poem) \\"Um, okay. Here it goes.\\" \\"Within the pages, secrets dwell, Words to enchant, stories to tell. Through the unwritten, a world thrives, Imagination boundless, where it thrives. Characters dance, with minds entwined, Waltzing through chapters, leaving woes behind. Inky abyss beckons, consuming my soul, A refuge from reality, making me whole. Paper hearts linger within the lines, Connecting souls, a tether that binds. A haven of parchment, shelter from strife, Where emotions collide, giving birth to life.\\" Yuri: (Finishing her reading, her voice filled with uncertainty) \\"That was... my poem.

Flour, sugar, and eggs in perfect choreography, Creating a symphony of delectable poetry. Snow-white peaks frosted with delight, Melt in your mouth, a mouthful of light. Rich flavors blend, frosting divine, Every bite an experience so fine. But as I bake, the world fades to gray, Dismissing my art with a careless sway. Underestimated, overlooked, never seeing, The love and passion my baking's freeing. So, indulge in my words, if you dare, A sugar rush, beyond compare.\\" Natsuki: (Finishing, a mix of emotions on her face) \\"There you go.

You always find a way to blend your hobbies into your writing.\\" Natsuki: (Softens a bit) \\"Thanks... I guess it wasn't a complete disaster after all.\\" Monika: \\"Thank you, all of you, for sharing your wonderful poems. It's amazing to see each of your unique styles and expressions unfold through your words. Literature truly brings us together.\\" Sayori: (Happily) \\"I love being part of this club! We're all so different, but we still appreciate and support each other's work.\\" Yuri: (Gently) \\"Indeed. It's a safe space where we can express ourselves freely without judgment.\\" Natsuki: (Reluctantly) \\"Yeah, yeah.

A jagged bolt of lightning had forked from the sky, striking with an ear-splitting roar. It could have been his imagination, or perhaps the beginning of a dream, but Jack would have sworn the electric fingers had reached straight through his apartment window before everything went black. When consciousness returned, Jack lay sprawled across the ground. Disoriented, he noted that the canopy above was not that of his warm, familiar bedroom, but a vast expanse of ancient trees, their leaves whispering secrets in a foreign tongue. The ground, covered in a carpet of greenery, was much too solid and uneven compared to his usual mattress. Pulling himself to his feet, Jack surveyed his surroundings. The late afternoon sun filtered through the leaves in sporadic beams, lighting the forest in a golden and ethereal glow. The air smelled sweet and earthy, distinctly different from the city's usual exhaust fumes. Was this some sort of virtual reality game? A prank? But the dampness soaking into his jeans felt too real, too uncomfortable for such explanations. He wandered aimlessly, finding neither people nor signs to suggest where he might be. Attempts to rationalize his predicament resulted in a growing realization that he was no longer in Canada—or anywhere on Earth, for that matter. This new world was vibrant with colors he couldn't name and filled with the chorus of unknown creatures. Jack Genson was lost—utterly and completely. Part 2 - Jack is Lost Heart racing, Jack stumbled through the forest, each step taking him further into the unknown. Confusion clouded his thoughts, but a primal instinct urged him to find safety before nightfall. Birds, unlike any he had seen before, darted through the trees, their calls alien and unsettling. With no direction, Jack's mind raced with scenarios. Were there villages nearby? Would he find a kind soul to help him? Or was this world as cruel and dangerous as the fairy tales depicted? He had no tools, no proper footwear, no knowledge of survival in such an environment. He reached a small clearing. For a moment, Jack stood still, catching his breath, trying to imprint the area in his memory. \\"Keep yourself calm, Jack,\\" he muttered under his breath. \\"You've gotten out of tough spots before; you can do it again.\\" But was that true? He'd been resourceful in an urban environment, yes, where Google and bystanders were at an arm's length. This, however, was totally out of his depth. He wasn't just geographically lost—he was temporally, dimensionally adrift. As the sun dipped lower, Jack felt an icy dread creep up his spine. He was truly alone, perhaps in a whole new world altogether. He longed for the life he'd been inexplicably torn from, a surge of homesickness washing over him. But there was no time for that now; he had to move, had to survive. Part 3 - Jack Learns He Has a System As twilight began to settle over the forest, casting long shadows upon the ground, something unfamiliar flickered at the edge of Jack's vision—a luminescent panel of light, floating in the air. Startled, he stepped back, blinking hard, before tentatively reaching out to touch it. The moment his fingers grazed the panel, a cascade of information streamed into his mind. Words, pictures, and sounds melded together in an incomprehensible symphony before sorting themselves into a comprehensible interface. Somehow encoded to respond to his thoughts, the panel opened to reveal a message: [Welcome to the System. Aiding trans-dimensional visitors in acclimatization and survival.] Jack's pulse quickened as he navigated through the instructions. The System, it seemed, granted him the means to operate within this world—but with constraints. He needed to complete tasks and challenges to earn 'skill points', the currency to unlock abilities. Why he'd been chosen and by whom, the System did not say. But it was a lifeline in this unfamiliar world, an opportunity to gain strength and perhaps one day find his way home. He held his breath, the weight of a strange destiny settling upon his shoulders. Jack had always been an average guy; now, he was something more, a character in his own adventure. The real question was, could he live up to the role he'd been thrust into? Part 4 - Jack Opens All the System Panels and They Are Written Out With tentative curiosity, Jack focused his attention on the translucent panel. It expanded obediently, revealing several sections, each pulsing with potential. [Status] - The first category displayed his name, health, and a peculiar section for 'mana', which curiously read 'null'. There were no attributes, no levels—just his name, a stranger's name, in a stranger's world. [Skills] - Next, a list that was disappointingly empty. The System promised skills against points he didn't yet have. [Inventory] - He was struck by the emptiness of this space too—his pockets were as barren here as the screen. [Quests] - Lastly, the System offered a glimmer of direction. A single, simple task lay listed: [Earn Your First Skill Points]. It was vague but actionable—a lifeline thrown to a drowning man. Jack took a deep breath, steadying his racing heart. The System was his tutor in this game-like reality, and he, the eager if bewildered, student. All he had to do was follow its lead and, with every task, grow stronger. Maybe, just maybe, Jack could find his place here in the kingdom of Dorek. With a mixture of excitement and trepidation, Jack stepped forward, leaving the ethereal glow of the System's interface behind. Night was drawing near, but with the System's guidance, he was armed with purpose. Whatever this world had in store, Jack Genson was ready to face it."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...) Monika: \\"Alright, now that everyone's here, let's start sharing poems.

A moment ago, he had been on his way to his mundane job in Toronto; now, the starry void around him seemed to stretch into infinity. The light intensified into a blinding flash, and he squeezed his eyes shut, bracing for impact. When Jack opened his eyes, he found himself sprawled on soft grass under an azure sky. Two suns blazed above, casting weird shadows over the strange landscape that stretched before him. Towering trees with leaves of silver and gold rustled in an otherworldly breeze, and in the distance, majestic spires of an ancient city pierced the horizon. Disoriented and pulse racing, Jack took stock of his surroundings. Oddly, he found his phone, wallet, and backpack were all with him, transported as well, but his phone remained dark and unresponsive. He stood up, brushing the strange flora from his clothes, and a sense of unnerving calmness washed over him – as if this bizarre event were not the calamity it seemed, but simply the starting point of something grand. Part 2 - Jack is Lost Jack tried to make sense of his situation. Attempting to retrace his steps was futile; there was no bustling city street or familiar sight to guide him. The landscape was painted with vibrant hues and alien vegetation. He did what any rational person would do—start walking. Some instinct he couldn't quite place assured him that he wasn’t meant to stay still. Hours of wandering seemed to blend into an odd succession of breathtaking vistas and hauntingly silent groves. By the time the larger of the twin suns began its descent, Jack acknowledged a disheartening truth - he was hopelessly lost in a world utterly unlike his own. His initial calm gave way to a creeping unease, with worry nibbling at the corners of his mind like a relentless pest. Nightfall brought new terrors, as the forest came alive with luminescent creatures and ghostly moans. Huddled against the trunk of a silver-leafed tree, Jack clenched his backpack straps and tried to convince himself that he'd make it through the night. Part 3 - Jack Learns He Has a System The following morning, Jack's despair was interrupted by a disembodied voice that seemed to echo from within his own mind. \\"Welcome, Jack Genson, to Dorek,\\" it said, benevolent yet artificial. \\"You have been selected for The System. Prepare for assimilation.\\" Before Jack could muster a baffled response, his vision flickered, and translucent blue screens materialized before his eyes, filled with text and icons that hovered in midair. He reached out tentatively, half expecting his hand to pass through the apparition, but his fingers met gentle resistance, as if the screen were truly there. The System, as it called itself, detailed a complex RPG-like interface. It displayed his name, presumed level 1, and empty experience bars. Below, there were slots for skills, stats, and something called affinities—none of which he yet possessed. A message box blinked, indicating more information awaited, should he dare delve deeper. Jack was a gamer; this much was familiar to him, but the implications were dizzying. Somehow, in this world, such fantastical elements were reality. In a mix of disbelief and excitement, he poked at the message box. It seemed his journey was just beginning. Part 4 - Jack Opens All The System Panels and They Are Written Out Jack’s finger tapped the message box, and a list of basic commands unfurled. \\"Status,\\" \\"Inventory,\\" \\"Skills,\\" \\"Map,\\" and \\"Quests\\" were laid bare, each with its own intricate icon. He selected \\"Status,\\" and a detailed view of himself expanded, showing not only his physical attributes but also mysterious stats such as Strength, Agility, Wisdom, and others sitting at a meager “5” across the board. Next, his Inventory was almost laughably empty – just the clothes on his back, a wallet with now-useless Canadian currency, and a non-functioning smartphone. “Skills” and “Map” featured nothing but a prompt stating he had yet to unlock these functions. But it was the \\"Quests\\" tab that caught his eye: a simple yet potentially life-altering directive shimmered in the digital window, saying, \\"Complete your First Quest to Unlock System Potential.\\" Grasping the metaphorical lifeline The System seemed to throw him, Jack felt a spark of hope. With each option he explored, a new layer of this complex world unveiled itself. He would navigate this realm, unlocking the mysteries one panel at a time, starting with his very first quest."},{"instruction":"The Indian Medical Knowledge system was the pioneer of which of the following branches?

If we are discussing Indian Knowledge Systems as the topic, my response is as follows: As an artificial intelligence, I don't have personal perceptions or beliefs. However, I can provide an informative view based on available data and historical context. The Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) refer to the rich and diverse intellectual traditions and knowledge systems that have originated in India over thousands of years. These systems encompass a wide array of disciplines including mathematics, astronomy, medicine, architecture, engineering, metallurgy, environmental science, shipbuilding and navigation, agriculture, textiles, fine arts, and numerous others. Here are some key aspects of IKS: 1. **Holistic Approach**: IKS often incorporates a holistic approach to knowledge, linking the material with the spiritual and emphasizing the interconnectedness of all aspects of life. 2. **Continuity and Evolution**: The knowledge systems of India show a remarkable continuity from ancient times, with texts and practices being preserved and developed over millennia. This includes continuous scholarly tradition in fields such as Ayurveda (traditional medicine), Yoga (a discipline for health and spiritual growth), and Vedic mathematics. 3. **Oral Tradition**: Many aspects of IKS were traditionally transferred through oral traditions, relying on memorization and recitation, such as the Vedas, Upanishads, and various other scholarly and spiritual texts. 4. **Practical Application**: A significant feature of IKS is the application of knowledge in practical life. This can be seen in ancient texts detailing surgical techniques, town planning, metallurgy, and agriculture that have practical uses. 5. **Interdisciplinary Research and Innovation**: The IKS is characterized by its interdisciplinary nature and innovation. The ancient Sanskrit treatise 'Arthashastra' on statecraft, economic policy, and military strategy is a notable example that combines various disciplines for governance. 6. **Global Influence**: Over time, Indian knowledge systems have influenced other cultures and civilizations through trade, conquests, and scholarly exchanges. For example, the numeral system, including the concept of zero, originated in India and spread to the Arab world and eventually to Europe, revolutionizing mathematics. 7. **Cultural and Philosophical Insights**: Aside from technical knowledge, IKS includes philosophical and cultural insights found in literary works, epics, and scriptures that have shaped the cultural and ethical foundation of societies both within and beyond India. The Indian Knowledge Systems continue to be a subject of study and research as they offer valuable insights and techniques that may provide sustainable solutions to contemporary problems in health, ecology, and technology. It's also recognized that preserving and integrating knowledge from IKS with modern educational frameworks can promote innovation and contribute to the global body of knowledge."},{"instruction":"___________ is the branch of medicine developed and established in NORTH India.

(1 Point) 7215 7125 7225 7515","output":"Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah, commonly known as Nikhilam Sutra, is a method of multiplication from Vedic Mathematics, which is particularly useful for numbers close to powers of 10. Let's calculate 75 × 95 using Nikhilam multiplication. Both numbers are close to 100, which will be our base. 75 is 25 (100 - 75) less than 100. 95 is 5 (100 - 95) less than 100. Step 1: Cross-subtract one number from the complement of the other number: 75 - 5 (the complement of 95) = 70, or 95 - 25 (the complement of 75) = 70 (both should give you the same result). Step 2: Multiply the complements together: 25 × 5 = 125. Now, because our base is 100 and we have an answer (125) that is more than the base, we carry over from the 125 to the 70 calculated in step 1. So, we add 1 (from the 125) to the 70, giving us 71. The final step is to put the leftover from 125 (which is 25) next to the 71, but since our base is 100 and we only have two digits to accommodate at the second part of our number, we add another 1 to the 71 and keep just the last two digits from 125. Therefore, we will have 71 (from 70 + 1) + 1 again = 72, and the leftover 25 becomes 25. The answer is 7225. The correct answer would be: 7225"},{"instruction":"Ryotwari System was introduced in (1 Point) Madras Bombay Central India Pune","output":"The Ryotwari System was introduced primarily in the Madras Presidency by Thomas Munro in the early 19th century.

To apply this method to multiply 15 by 99, follow these steps: 1. Subtract 1 from the number being multiplied by 99. So, 15 - 1 = 14. 2. Append the subtraction of the number from the base 100 (since we are multiplying by 99, the base is 100). So, 100 - 15 = 85. 3. Combine these two results to get the final answer. The first part (14) becomes the first digits, and the second part (85) fills in the remaining digits: The product of 15 and 99 is 1485.

He worked a nine-to-five job, paid his bills on time, and looked forward to the simple pleasures of the weekend. It was during one of his rare lazy Saturdays, while lounging on his couch browsing through his phone, that Jack’s life took an extraordinary turn. Without warning, the room spun before his eyes, the light from his phone expanding and blinding him in a cascade of violent energy. Jack tried to cry out, but no sound escaped his lips as the world around him vanished, replaced by an expanse of unending white. What felt like an eternity passed before the white abyss fractured into colors and shapes. Jack found himself tumbling through the sky, his house and his world left behind. The air howled as he plummeted, and within moments, his body slammed into the soft, yielding earth of an alien land. Dizzied and disoriented, Jack lost consciousness, his final thought being a simple, baffled question: \\"What just happened?\\" When Jack finally came to, he was met with the alien landscape of lush, green fields stretching towards a horizon of rolling hills and distant, majestic mountains. Above, two moons hung in the sky, one a pale guardian of the day, the other a faded companion, and the sun, bright and fierce, blazed in the azure dome. This wasn't home—this was something entirely different. His heart raced as the gravity of his situation slowly sank in. Jack Genson was no longer in Kansas, or rather, Canada. As he staggered to his feet, a sense of both dread and wonder settled into his bones. He was in another world entirely—a world he would later learn to be the kingdom of Dorek. Part 2 - Jack is Lost For hours, Jack wandered through the countryside, confusion painting his every step. The beauty of Dorek was undeniable, with its opulent flora and fauna that he could swear just weren't possible. Vivid flowers perfumed the air with an intoxicating elixir and strange creatures peered at him from the safety of the underbrush, their eyes glinting with intelligence and something akin to curiosity. Despite the marvels around him, Jack was painfully aware of his predicament. Every direction seemed to lead to more wilderness, every hill crested revealing another valley teeming with the unknown. As he trudged on, the markings of civilization remained elusive, and the language of the odd passerby—rare as they were—remained inscrutable. The local denizens dressed in materials that mimicked silk and leather but bore a slight shimmer that no earthly material possessed. They regarded Jack with a mixture of intrigue and dismissal, speaking to each other in a musical language Jack could not comprehend. Approaching for help was out of the question; the foreigners quickly shied away, their eyes casting over him with a strange blend of disdain and disbelief. Hunger gnawed at his stomach, and thirst parched his throat, but far more pressing was the nagging fear that he'd be lost in this fantastical realm forever. Panic was a luxury he couldn't afford, so Jack pushed it down, hidden beneath a veil of outward calm and determination. If he wanted to survive, he would need to adapt, and he would need to do it quickly. As the sun dipped towards the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Jack's despair deepened. Surrounded by splendor yet crippled by isolation, he couldn't help but wonder if he would ever find his place in this magical world, a world where even the grass beneath his feet seemed to hum with arcane energy—an energy that Jack could neither see nor feel. Part 3 - Jack Learns He Has a System Night had fallen on Dorek with a swiftness that caught Jack by surprise. As the twin moons climbed into the heavens, an unexpected voice pulled Jack from the embrace of anxious thoughts. \\"Welcome, Jack Genson.\\" The voice was neutral, not quite male or female, and it resonated from within his mind—a clear, calm presence that instantly set him on edge. \\"Who's there?\\" Jack spun, his eyes darting into the shadows cast by the silver moonlight, but there was no one. \\"Do not be alarmed,\\" the voice continued, its tone soothing. \\"I am the System, a guide to those worthy in this realm. I have chosen you.\\" Chosen him? Jack's heart skipped a beat as the implications began to settle. This could be his chance—the lifeline that could lead him to understanding and, perhaps, to survival in Dorek. \\"What do you mean, 'chosen'?\\" he asked tentatively, still half-expecting someone to jump out from behind a tree. \\"You possess no magic of this world, yet you have potential—potential that I am here to unlock. I will grant you skills and knowledge, but in exchange, you must brave trials and grow in strength,\\" the voice spoke as if reciting a hallowed pact. Jack found the offer both incredible and terrifying. The prospect of power was alluring; the mention of trials was not. But, considering his situation, he didn't truly have a choice. \\"All right,\\" Jack said. \\"Guide me.\\" \\"Very well,\\" the System replied, a note of satisfaction in its voice. \\"Let us begin.\\" Part 4 - Jack Opens All the System Panels and They Are Written Out In the still of the night, Jack's vision was filled with a series of windows, each floating before his eyes as if conjured by magic. They were panels of information, written in a language he miraculously understood, organized neatly into categories. The first panel was labeled \\"Status.\\" It displayed his name, his level—initially set to 1—and various attributes such as Strength, Agility, and Intelligence, all with a pitifully low starting number next to them. Below those figures were empty slots for skills and titles. The next panel was \\"Skills.\\" It was a database of potential abilities he could unlock, ranging from melee combat to mystical arts, from stealth to crafting. The skills were many; some were locked away due to his current lack of proficiency or level, while others were available for immediate acquisition. Another panel popped into existence. This one was titled \\"Inventory,\\" and to Jack's great relief, it contained basic supplies that the System seemed to have provided for its new candidate. A simple cloak, a pouch of rationed food, a flask of water, and a dagger rested within a void of space, ready to be summoned at his command. The final panel that materialized was labeled \\"Quests.\\" It held a list of objectives that Jack could undertake to earn rewards and, presumably, to rise in the System's esteem and power. The current list was small, with only one active quest: \\"Survive your first night in Dorek.\\" As Jack cycled through the panels, absorbing the wealth of information, a keen sense of purpose fortified his resolve. The System, mysterious as it was, appeared to be his ticket to not just surviving, but to thriving in this enchanting new world. Determination flared within him as he took his first true step into the grand adventure that lay ahead. Chapter 2: Skill Points Part 1 - Jack Receives a Simple Quest to Earn Skill Points As the dawn's first light filtered through the branches, painting the land in soft gold, Jack noticed a change in the Quest panel. The overnight survival task was checked off, and new quests had emerged underneath it. One caught his eye immediately: \\"Humble Beginnings - Slay five forest slimes.\\" It was accompanied by a reward listing of experience points and something called \\"skill points.\\" The quest seemed almost ridiculously simple, tailored to his current, meager capabilities. But it was a start. The forest around him began to stir as if awakening from its nightly slumber. Jack stood up, shaking the stiffness from his limbs, and prepared himself for what seemed to be his first trial—a trial that, if successful, would help him to understand the workings of this peculiar 'system.' The slimes, according to the system’s brief description, were ubiquitous creatures of low intelligence and low threat, but their acidic bodies could pose dangers if underestimated. Jack felt a mix of feelings: anxiety over facing the unknown and excitement for the empowerment that the System promised. Adjusting the strap of the satchel he had summoned from the Inventory the night before, Jack delved deeper into the woods, keeping his senses sharp for any sign of the slimes. Part 2 - Jack Gets Into a Fight With a Slime Jack hadn't walked far when he stumbled upon the first slime. The creature was hardly menacing, resembling a translucent blue blob the size of a basketball, quivering gently as it slid over the underbrush. It paused when Jack approached, as if sensing a new presence, before inching closer with a sort of innocent curiosity. Taking a deep breath and clutching the hilt of his dagger, Jack steeled himself and made the first strike. The blade sunk into the gelatinous body with a squelch, but instead of recoiling, the slime quivered and glowed brighter, as if agitated. Before he could withdraw his weapon, the slime pulsed, and a searing pain shot through Jack's arm as corrosive enzymes began to eat away at the metal and his skin. He managed to yank his dagger free, but the blade was pitted and his hand was left with a painful burn. Jack grimaced, realizing that this would be no walk in the park. Descending on him with renewed vigor, the slime seemed to expand, its body undulating with an otherworldly rhythm. Jack danced back, narrowly avoiding another corrosive touch. His mind raced as he searched for a new approach to defeat the seemingly simple creature. Part 3 - Jack Struggles to Fight the Slime Because More Show Up Just as Jack thought he had a handle on one slime's movements, three more oozed out from the bushes, flanking him with an unsettling coordination. Panic flared in his chest; he was outnumbered and outmatched by these amorphous denizens of Dorek. He had no magic, no skills, and very little knowledge of combat, yet he had the System, which was supposed to help him grow stronger. But how could he grow if he couldn't win even the most basic of battles? The slimes advanced, their bodies pulsing in unison. Jack dodged, the effort leaving his breath short, his heart pounding against his ribs. The sensation of being hunted, despite his foes' slow pace, sent a jolt of adrenaline through his veins, forcing him into a desperate retreat. He stumbled over the roots and brambles, all the while trying to devise a plan. His options were limited and the chances of escaping unscathed dwindled with each passing moment as the slimes seemed to grow more eager with the prospect of their meal. Jack's back hit a tree, the solid trunk grounding him amidst the chaos. Realization struck like lightning: he couldn't run; he had to stand his ground. Using the environment to his advantage, he kicked at a nearby rock, sending it hurtling towards one of the approaching blobs. The impact caused the slime to shudder violently before splitting in two, each half now significantly smaller and less menacing than before. An idea sparked in Jack's mind—a way to even the odds. Part 4 - Jack Finally Kills All the Slimes and Earns 5 Skill Points Total Focusing on the technique that had worked, Jack feverishly sought out loose stones and sticks, hurling them with all his might. The slimes, although relentless, were predictably slow, making them perfect targets for his improvised projectiles. One by one, the slimes were divided and conquered, their numbers dwindling as Jack outmaneuvered and outsmarted them using the simplest of tactics. His confidence grew with each felled foe until at last, the forest floor was littered with the residual goo of his adversaries. As the final slime melted away, a triumphant chime echoed in Jack's mind. The Quest panel flashed with completion—five forest slimes defeated. Jack targeted the Skills panel and there it was: five shiny, new skill points awaited him, rewards for his ingenuity and perseverance. Catching his breath, Jack allowed a small smile to curve his lips. This world may not have given him magic, but it had underestimated his resolve and human cunning. Standing amid the remnants of his first true battle, Jack felt a surge of empowerment. He had faced the unknown and come out victorious. He opened the System, eager to allocate his hard-earned points and embark further into the world of Dorek—a world where, perhaps, he just might make a difference.

Please go ahead and share your poem with us.” Yuri: (stands up and takes a deep breath) “Okay…here goes.” “In the quiet embrace of shadows, An ink-stained world unfurls, Whispering secrets only the mind can hear. Pages turn, like a heart’s gentle rhythm, Breathing life into fictional realms, Where fantasies and realities intertwine. Ethereal beauty hides within words, Unleashing passions, painting emotions, Everlasting echoes etched upon paper. Moments frozen in time’s embrace, Unfolding stories laced with desires, A canvas beckoning souls to wander.” Monika: (claps her hands) “That was wonderful, Yuri. Your words always have such a captivating flow to them.” Sayori: (leaning back in her chair) “I always love how your poems transport me to another world, Yuri. It’s like escaping reality for a little while.” Natsuki: (smiling) “Yeah, it’s definitely a unique style. I can never come up with stuff like that.” Yuri: (blushing) “Thank you,everyone.

Please go ahead, Sayori.” Sayori: (clears her throat) “Okay, here it goes…” “Behind a mask of painted smiles, A battle rages, thoughts unwinding, Each step lighter than a feather’s touch. Gilded laughter dances in the air, Camouflaging melancholic hues, Splintered fragments of hidden pain. Yet, a gentle breeze whispers hope, Tugging at the threads of a weary heart, Mending fractures, seeking solace. In a kaleidoscope of vibrant dreams, Unforgotten moments of pure bliss, Love’s embrace reaches through the cracks.” Monika: (clapping) “Wow, Sayori, that was really moving. You have a way with words, expressing emotions so honestly.” Natsuki: (sniffles) “That was beautiful, Sayori. You always manage to capture such powerful emotions.” Yuri: “Your poem exudes a sense of resilience, Sayori. It’s truly inspiring.” Sayori: (blushing) “Thank you, everyone. It means a lot to hear your kind words.” Monika: “Now, who’s left? Natsuki, would you like to share?” Natsuki: (startled, but composes herself) “Uh, yeah…I guess I can go.

В данном реферате мы рассмотрим основные отличия между грабежом и разбоем. Первое отличие заключается в способе осуществления. Грабеж - это преступление, в результате которого преступник использует силу или угрозу насилия для привлечения к себе внимания и затем противозаконно захватывает имущество в наличии у других лиц. Грабеж часто происходит на открытой улице или в общественном месте, где преступник может использовать преимущества численного превосходства или оружия для добивания своих целей. Разбой, с другой стороны, подразумевает использование насилия или угрозы насилия, чтобы не только захватить имущество, но и разграбить прямо на месте преступления. Разбойщики часто проникают в дома, магазины или офисы, где они могут связать или запугать своих жертв и принудить их открыть сейфы или банковские ячейки. Второе отличие - это уровень опасности для жертвы. Грабежи чаще всего несут меньшую степень физической угрозы и повреждения для жертвы. Хотя насилие может быть использовано, чтобы добиться цели, это обычно приходит на втором этапе процесса и не всегда необходимо для достижения цели грабителя. В случае грабежа, преступник стремится скорее добиться быстрой и безопасной конfrontации, осознавая факторы риска, связанные с удержанием жертвы долго времени. Разбой, напротив, обычно является более опасным преступлением, так как преступник стремится добиться устрашения жертвы и использовать насилие для достижения своих целей. Во время разбоя могут возникнуть физические травмы, поскольку жертвы могут быть более капризными или попытаться сопротивляться преступнику, что может привести к увеличению насилия. Третье отличие заключается в наказании. В юридическом смысле, грабеж и разбой рассматриваются как отдельные преступления с различными уровнями наказания. Грабеж, как правило, является менее серьезным преступлением и может влечь за собой более легкие наказания, в зависимости от конкретных обстоятельств. Разбой, с другой стороны, рассматривается как более серьезное нарушение и может наказываться строжими наказаниями, включая тюремные сроки. В заключение, можно сказать, что грабеж и разбой - это два разных преступления, которые отличаются способом осуществления, уровнем опасности для жертв и наказанием. Хотя оба этих преступления несут серьезные последствия для жертв, разбой обычно является более страшным и подлежит более строгому наказанию. Важно помнить, что преступления этого рода неприемлемы и должны преследоваться законом."},{"instruction":"Comenta questo codice usando la sintassi javadoc: import java.io.FileReader; import java.io.FileWriter;

Он должен быть оригинальным, избегать повторов и проходить проверку Антиплагиата: [В досудебном производстве по уголовным делам, касающимся несовершеннолетних, существуют два основных этапа: возбуждение уголовного дела и предварительное расследование. Возбуждение уголовного дела в отношении преступлений несовершеннолетних осуществляется согласно общим правилам, установленным главами 19-20 УПК РФ [3] (Уголовно-процессуальный кодекс Российской Федерации). Однако при принятии решения о возбуждении дела необходимо учитывать положения статьи 19 УК РФ [4] (Уголовный кодекс Российской Федерации), которая устанавливает возраст, с которого лицо становится уголовно ответственным. Если лицо не достигло соответствующего возраста (14 или 16 лет), уголовное дело не может быть возбуждено, так как отсутствует состав преступления (субъект). Поэтому при решении о возбуждении дела следователь (дознаватель) должен установить точную дату рождения несовершеннолетнего, основываясь на официальном документе, таком как свидетельство о рождении или паспорт. Также на этапе возбуждения дела необходимо рассмотреть вопрос о возможном участии взрослого соучастника. Если невозможно исключить участие взрослого соучастника, дело должно быть возбуждено, и предварительное расследование проводится для проверки этой версии [35]. Однако большинство особенностей процесса рассмотрения уголовных дел в отношении несовершеннолетних связаны с предварительным расследованием. Эти особенности касаются следующих процессуальных аспектов: подследственность, выделение уголовного дела в отдельное производство, предмет доказывания, двойное представительство интересов несовершеннолетнего, проведение отдельных процессуальных действий, применение мер принуждения и завершение предварительного расследования. Подследственность означает, что расследование уголовного дела в отношении несовершеннолетнего может осуществляться как предварительным следствием, так и дознанием. Форма предварительного расследования зависит от характера совершенного несовершеннолетним преступления, учитывая при этом предметные признаки подследственности. Тяжкие и особо тяжкие преступления, совершенные несовершеннолетними, подлежат исключительной подследственности следователям Следственного комитета РФ [36]. Выделение уголовного дела в отдельное производство возможно, если несовершеннолетний принимал участие в преступлении вместе с взрослыми. В соответствии со статьей 422 УПК РФ [3], орган расследования имеет право выделить дело о несовершеннолетнем в отдельное производство. При этом необходимо соблюдать требования статьи 154 УПК РФ, которая предусматривает, что выделение дела допускается только при условии, что это не повлияет на всестороннее, полное и объективное расследование обстоятельств дела. В случае, если выделение в отдельное производство не является возможным, применяются полные правила главы 50 УПК РФ. Особенности предмета доказывания в уголовных делах, связанных с несовершеннолетними, заключаются в установлении определенных обстоятельств, которые подлежат доказыванию в соответствии со статьями 73 и 421 УПК РФ. Эти обстоятельства включают: 1. Возраст несовершеннолетнего, включая точную дату его рождения (число, месяц, год). 2. Условия жизни, воспитания и особенности личности несовершеннолетнего, уровень его психического развития и другие характеристики. 3. Влияние старших по возрасту лиц на несовершеннолетнего. 4. В случае имеющихся данных о задержании психологического развития несовершеннолетнего, не связанного с психическим заболеванием, также устанавливается, способен ли он полностью осознавать фактический характер и общественную опасность своих действий или бездействия и контролировать их. 5. При совершении несовершеннолетним преступлений средней тяжести или тяжких преступлений, за исключением определенных преступлений, указанных в статье 92 УК РФ [4], также устанавливается наличие или отсутствие у него заболевания, препятствующего его содержанию и обучению в специальном учебно-воспитательном учреждении закрытого типа.[37] Установление этих обстоятельств происходит путем допроса родителей, учителей, воспитателей и других лиц, которые могут предоставить необходимую информацию, а также путем получения соответствующих документов и проведения других следственных и судебных действий. Важно отметить, что лицо считается достигшим возраста уголовной ответственности на следующий день после даты его рождения. Если нет официального документа, удостоверяющего возраст, проводится судебно-медицинская экспертиза для установления возраста несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого. В случае проведения такой экспертизы, последним днем года, указанным экспертом как год рождения подростка, считается его день рождения. Медицинское освидетельствование также может проводиться по постановлению следователя или дознавателя согласно правилам, установленным Правительством РФ. [13] Независимо от специфических обстоятельств дела, требование об установлении всех существенных и достоверных обстоятельств, составляющих предмет доказывания по уголовному делу, остается общим. Это включает установление событий преступления, виновности лица, формы его вины, мотивов действий, обстоятельств, влияющих на степень ответственности, а также обстоятельств, исключающих преступность и наказуемость деяния или приводящих к освобождению от уголовной ответственности и наказания, а также причиненного ущерба и условий, способствующих совершению преступления и других обстоятельств, связанных с делом. Двойное представительство интересов несовершеннолетнего в уголовном процессе означает, что у несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого должны быть как защитник, так и законный представитель. Согласно статье 51 УПК РФ [3], участие защитника обязательно, если лицо является несовершеннолетним. Дознаватель и следователь обязаны обеспечить участие защитника в ходе расследования, независимо от воли несовершеннолетнего (согласно части 2 статьи 52 УПК РФ). Несоблюдение этого требования считается серьезным нарушением прав несовершеннолетнего на защиту и является существенным нарушением уголовно-процессуального закона (в соответствии с пунктом 4 части 2 статьи 381 УПК РФ). При рассмотрении дел, связанных с несовершеннолетними, вопрос о приглашении защитника, как правило, решается через законного представителя несовершеннолетнего. Все правила, касающиеся участия защитника в таких делах, включая квалификацию лиц, которые могут выступать в качестве защитника, момент его допуска в дело, его права и обязанности, применяются без каких-либо ограничений или исключений [38]. Законный представитель допускается к участию в деле для защиты прав и интересов несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого. Его участие в деле является обязательным не только на стадии предварительного расследования, но и на последующих судебных этапах. Законными представителями могут быть родители, усыновители, опекуны, попечители подозреваемого, обвиняемого или потерпевшего, а также представители учреждений и организаций, ответственных за несовершеннолетнего (согласно пункту 12 статьи 5 УПК РФ). Правовой статус законного представителя на стадии предварительного расследования определен статьей 426 УПК РФ [3]. Законный представитель допускается к участию в деле на основании постановления следователя или дознавателя с момента первого допроса несовершеннолетнего в качестве подозреваемого или обвиняемого. С этого момента законный представитель имеет право: знать, в чем подозревается или обвиняется несовершеннолетний; присутствовать при предъявлении обвинения, участвовать в допросе несовершеннолетнего, а также, с разрешения следователя, в других следственных действиях, в которых участвуют несовершеннолетний обвиняемый, подозреваемый и его защитник; ознакомиться с протоколами следственных действий, в которых он принимал участие, и делать письменные замечания относительно правильности и полноты записей; подавать ходатайства и отводы, вносить жалобы на действия и решения следователя и дознавателя; представлять доказательства; после завершения расследования ознакомиться со всеми материалами дела, делать выписки из них в любом объеме (в соответствии с частью 2 статьи 426 УПК РФ) [39]. Законный представитель может быть исключен из участия в деле, если есть основания полагать, что его действия наносят ущерб интересам несовершеннолетнего или направлены на препятствие объективному расследованию дела. Об этом выносится мотивированное постановление. В этом случае к участию в деле допускается другой законный представитель несовершеннолетнего. Активным участником уголовного судопроизводства по делам о преступлениях несовершеннолетних является гражданский ответчик, который несет материальную ответственность за ущерб, причиненный преступными действиями несовершеннолетнего обвиняемого. Гражданским ответчиком может быть как физическое, так и юридическое лицо в соответствии с Гражданским кодексом РФ. Решение о привлечении гражданского ответчика принимается дознавателем, следователем или судьей путем вынесения постановления, а суд принимает определение (согласно статье 54 УПК РФ [3]). В процессе уголовного судопроизводства по делам несовершеннолетних существуют особенности в проведении отдельных процессуальных действий. Одна из них связана с вызовом несовершеннолетнего. Несовершеннолетний вызывается к следователю или дознавателю через его родителей или законных представителей. Такой же порядок применяется при вызове несовершеннолетнего в суд (в соответствии со статьей 424 УПК РФ). Если несовершеннолетний находится под стражей, его вызывают через администрацию места его содержания под стражей [40]. Допрос несовершеннолетнего также имеет ряд особенностей, которые определены в статье 428 УПК РФ: 1. Допрос несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого не может продолжаться без перерыва более двух часов и в общей сложности не более четырех часов в день. 2. Участие защитника обязательно при допросе несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого, и защитник имеет право задавать вопросы и ознакомиться с протоколом допроса и делать замечания по нему. 3. При допросе несовершеннолетнего, не достигшего 16-летнего возраста или признанного умственно отсталым, обязательно участие педагога или психолога. 4. Педагог или психолог имеют право задавать вопросы допрашиваемому с разрешения следователя, а по окончании допроса ознакомиться с протоколом допроса и делать замечания по нему. Эти права следователь или дознаватель разъясняет педагогу или психологу перед допросом несовершеннолетнего, что затем фиксируется в протоколе допроса. Применение мер принуждения в отношении несовершеннолетних также имеет особенности. Задержание и избрание меры пресечения в отношении несовершеннолетнего осуществляются с соблюдением общих правил, установленных в главах 12 и 13 УПК РФ [3], регулирующих применение мер принуждения в уголовном процессе. Согласно части 2 статьи 108 УПК РФ, заключение под стражу как меру пресечения применяется к несовершеннолетнему подозреваемому или обвиняемому в случае, если он подозревается или обвиняется в совершении тяжкого или особо тяжкого преступления. В исключительных случаях такая мера может быть применена и в отношении несовершеннолетнего, подозреваемого или обвиняемого в совершении преступления средней тяжести. Законом не предусмотрено ограничений для задержания несовершеннолетнего по подозрению в совершении преступления [41]. Родители или другие законные представители несовершеннолетнего должны быть уведомлены о его задержании, заключении под стражу или продлении срока содержания под стражей (в соответствии с частью 3 статьи 423 УПК РФ). Однако, есть особенность, указанная в части 3 статьи 96 УПК РФ, согласно которой, если в интересах следствия необходимо сохранить в тайне факт задержания, следователь или дознаватель при санкции прокурора могут воздержаться от уведомления указанных лиц. Однако, в случае задержания несовершеннолетнего, такое исключение не допускается, и указанные лица должны быть уведомлены о задержании, месте его нахождения и органе, ведущем расследование уголовного дела. Законный представитель несовершеннолетнего также имеет право участвовать в судебном заседании, где рассматривается вопрос об избрании меры пресечения в виде заключения под стражу в отношении несовершеннолетнего (согласно части 4 статьи 108 УПК РФ). Кроме того, он имеет право получить копию постановления об избрании меры пресечения (согласно части 2 статьи 101 УПК РФ [3]). В отношении несовершеннолетних обвиняемых предусмотрена специальная мера пресечения, которая заключается в отдаче под присмотр родителей, опекунов, попечителей или других доверенных лиц, а также должностных лиц администрации специализированного детского учреждения, в котором он находится. При решении вопроса о применении меры пресечения в отношении несовершеннолетнего обвиняемого должна быть рассмотрена возможность применения такой меры, как отдача под присмотр, в соответствии со статьей 105 УПК РФ. Эта мера пресечения предусматривает, что указанные лица берут на себя письменное обязательство обеспечить должное поведение несовершеннолетнего обвиняемого и его явку к дознавателю, следователю, прокурору и в суд. При отказе от подписки об отдаче под присмотр соответствующее лицо должно быть ознакомлено с характером преступления, в котором обвиняется несовершеннолетний, и с их ответственностью в случае нарушения принятых обязанностей по присмотру. Если лица, которым был отдан под присмотр несовершеннолетний, не выполняют своих обязательств, к ним могут применяться меры взыскания, предусмотренные частью 4 статьи 103 УПК РФ [42]. Прекращение уголовного дела и уголовного преследования может осуществляться в общем порядке согласно статьям 24-28 УПК РФ. Однако, статья 427 УПК РФ предусматривает специальный вид прекращения уголовного преследования в отношении несовершеннолетнего в ходе предварительного расследования с применением принудительной меры воспитательного воздействия. Это решение может быть принято, если выполнены следующие условия: (1) несовершеннолетний совершил преступление небольшой или средней тяжести, (2) есть данные, свидетельствующие о возможности исправления несовершеннолетнего без применения наказания, (3) несовершеннолетний и его законный представитель не возражают против прекращения уголовного преследования. При согласии следователя и прокурора, они выносят постановление о прекращении условного преследования и возбуждении ходатайства о применении принудительных мер воспитательного воздействия перед судом. Судья рассматривает материалы дела и ходатайство в соответствии со статьей 108 УПК РФ [3]. Если судья соглашается с принятым решением органа предварительного расследования, он применяет к несовершеннолетнему принудительные меры воспитательного воздействия. Контроль за соблюдением этих мер возлагается на специализированный государственный орган, ответственный за исправление несовершеннолетних, по решению суда. Если несовершеннолетний систематически не соблюдает требования, предусмотренные принудительной мерой воспитательного воздействия, судья, по представлению специализированного государственного органа, может отменить принудительную меру и направить материалы прокурору для дальнейшего рассмотрения уголовного дела. Кроме того, следователь имеет право вынести постановление о непредъявлении несовершеннолетнему для ознакомления материалов дела, которые могут негативно повлиять на него, и ознакомить с этими материалами законного представителя. Таким образом, процедура рассмотрения уголовных дел, связанных с несовершеннолетними, включает в себя ряд особенностей, учитывающих возраст и статус несовершеннолетнего, а также его участие в преступлении совместно с взрослыми. Эти особенности направлены на обеспечение справедливого и эффективного правосудия в отношении несовершеннолетних преступников.]»","output":"Процесс уголовного судопроизводства в случаях, касающихся несовершеннолетних, отличается определенными нюансами на каждом из своих этапов. Важно различать две ключевые стадии: начальное возбуждение уголовного дела и последующее предварительное расследование. При подозрении несовершеннолетних в совершении преступлений возбуждение уголовного дела осуществляется с учетом возраста ответственности, установленного Уголовным кодексом РФ [4]. Следователям или дознавателям необходимо обратить внимание на точную дату рождения лица, используя официальные документы, такие как свидетельство о рождении или паспорт. Наличие взрослого соучастника также требует внимания со стороны следствия – если не исключено его участие, это обяжет провести полномасштабное расследование [35]. Главные процессуальные моменты, которые отличают уголовные дела включают ряд специфик в рамках предварительного расследования. Это охватывает вопросы подследственности, отделения дела несовершеннолетнего в отдельное производство, определение предмета доказывания, особенности участия представителей лица, проведения различных процедур, выбор мер принуждения и правильного завершения расследования. Подследственность регулирует, кто проведет расследование – это может быть как предварительное следствие, так и дознание, в зависимости от серьезности преступления [36]. В конкретных обстоятельствах при участии несовершеннолетнего в преступлении с взрослыми может иметь место выделение дела в отдельное производство [3], соблюдая при этом полную и объективную расследовательскую работу [3]. В списке доказательств при расследовании нужно установить возраст несовершеннолетнего, его условия жизни, влияние на него взрослых и способность осознавать свои действия [3, 4, 37]. Если возникают сомнения по возрасту, без официального документа, применяется судебно-медицинская экспертиза [13]. Необходимо учитывать двойное представительство интересов подозреваемого или обвиняемого несовершеннолетнего – наличие защитника и законного представителя [3]. Эти и другие юридические нюансы [38, 39] нацелены на защиту прав несовершеннолетних в различных аспектах уголовного процесса. Проведение процедур с участием несовершеннолетних тоже претерпевает изменения: отрегулированы порядок и время допросов, необходимость участия педагога или психолога, специфика вызова к следователю [40, 42]. Применение мер принуждения должно учитывать возраст и применимость к несовершеннолетним, возможность отдачи под присмотр [3, 41]. В определенных случаях предусмотрено прекращение уголовного преследования с применением принудительных мер воспитательного воздействия при наличии условий для исправления без наказания [3]. В такой процедуре участвуют следователь, прокурор и суд. Более того, законный представитель имеет возможность ознакомиться со специфическими материалами дела вместо несовершеннолетнего, чтобы обезопасить его от отрицательного воздействия [3]. Каждый аспект этой процедуры нацелен на то, чтобы обеспечить справедливое обращение с несовершеннолетними и соответствовать их особому статусу, внося коррективы в подходы и методы расследования для поддержки их прав и интересов."},{"instruction":"это все?","output":"Прошу прощения за возможное недопонимание. Текст, который вы просили переписать, достаточно обширен и касается множества юридических деталей в рамках уголовного судопроизводства несовершеннолетних. Мое изложение было суммарным и представляло собой обобщенное переформулирование основных аспектов, упомянутых в оригинале, для создания более структурированного и читаемого текста. Если есть какие-то конкретные моменты или разделы оригинального текста, которые вы хотели бы видеть более подробно переработанными, пожалуйста, укажите на них, и я охотно предоставлю более детализированный пересказ."},{"instruction":"сделай это со всем текстом","output":"В уголовном процессе, затрагивающем несовершеннолетних, выделяются две основные фазы: этап инициирования уголовного дела и период предварительного следствия. Каждый из этих этапов имеет свои уникальные аспекты, которые должны учитываться в рамках правовой системы. Когда речь идет о возможности совершения преступления несовершеннолетним, начальный этап возбуждения дела регламентируется нормами глав 19-20 УПК РФ [3]. Здесь следует обращать особое внимание на возраст уголовной ответственности, установленный статьей 19 УК РФ [4]. Это значит, что если лицо еще не достигло установленного законом возраста (14 или 16 лет), то формальные основания для возбуждения уголовного дела отсутствуют, так как преступление, с точки зрения закона, не состоялось. В связи с этим, органы предварительного расследования должны тщательно проверять дату рождения подозреваемого, опираясь на его личные документы. Еще одной ключевой задачей на начальном этапе является оценка возможности участия в преступлении взрослого соучастника – в таком случае дело возбуждается безоговорочно, а необходимость такой проверки обусловлена положениями статьи 35 [35]. Большая часть процедурных нюансов, однако, связана с фазой предварительного расследования. Оно включает в себя проверку подследственности, то есть определение, кто будет проводить расследование – следствие или дознание. Здесь делается акцент на серьезности совершенного или предполагаемого преступления, при этом особую роль играют тяжкие преступления, подследственные исключительно Следственному комитету РФ [36]. Также возможно отделение несовершеннолетнего в отдельное уголовное производство, если преступление было совершено с участием взрослых лиц [3]. Касательно предмета доказывания, ведущими являются такие факторы, как точный возраст несовершеннолетнего, его жизненная среда, влияние взрослых и способность понимать свои действия в контексте общественной опасности, что важно особенно при выявлении задержаний в психическом развитии [37]. При отсутствии документального подтверждения возраста могут применяться медико-правовые методы определения возраста [13]. Двойное представительство интересов подразумевает обязательное участие защитника, а также законного представителя несовершеннолетнего в деле, что устанавливается статьями 51 и 52 УПК РФ [3]. Особое внимание уделяется участию законных представителей на всех этапах процесса, до и включая суд, с определением их прав и обязанностей по защите интересов ребенка [38, 39]. В рамках уголовного дела против несовершеннолетнего также возникают специфические процедуры, такие как особые условия вызова, допроса и определения времени для действий с присутствием несовершеннолетнего [40, 42]. Применение мер принуждения и задержание должны следовать строгим правилам с обязательным уведомлением законных представителей ребенка [41]. Возможно прекращение дела в отношении несовершеннолетнего с помощью применения мер воспитательного воздействия, когда есть основания полагать, что лицо может быть исправлено без наказания [3]. Здесь решение принимается с участием следователя, прокурора и суда, что предусмотрено статьей 427 УПК РФ. Таким образом, рассмотрение уголовных дел несовершеннолетних требует индивидуального подхода и применения установленных норм с учетом возраста и характера участия подростка в преступлении. Вся процедура нацелена на защиту его прав и обеспечение законности и справедливости в уголовно-процессуальной деятельности."},{"instruction":"давай так, ты это сделаешь заново и в конце каждого текст будешь писать слово далее, а когда закончишь со всем текстом напишешь слово конец","output":"В уголовном судопроизводстве, когда дело касается несовершеннолетних, выделяют начальную стадию и стадию предварительного расследования. Каждая стадия предусматривает выполнение определенных требований и процедур. Основой для возбуждения уголовного дела являются общепринятые нормы, зафиксированные в главах 19 и 20 УПК РФ [3]. В этот процесс активно включается статья 19 УК РФ [4], определяющая возраст, с которого начинается уголовная ответственность. Следовательно, если личность не достигла установленного возраста (14 или 16 лет), оснований для возбуждения дела нет. Акцентируется внимание на необходимости проверки возраста подозреваемого, поскольку это является ключевым моментом в определении возможности возбуждения дела. Рассмотрение роли взрослого соучастника в преступлении также играет важную роль – если его участие нельзя исключить, дело необходимо возбудить, и инициировать предварительное расследование [35]. Далее Сложные процессуальные вопросы встречаются в фазе предварительного расследования. Ведущими пунктами являются подследственность, что определяет предварительное следствие или дознание, и возможность выделения дела несовершеннолетнего в отдельное производство, если он участвовал в преступлении вместе с взрослыми [3]. В этом случае статья 422 УПК РФ [3] предоставляет органу расследования право на выделение такого дела, гарантируя при этом неукоснительное соблюдение требований объективности. Далее Предмет доказывания в уголовной практике, вовлекающей несовершеннолетних, включает в себя особые категории обстоятельств, которые следует тщательно устанавливать согласно статьям 73 и 421 УПК РФ [3]. Сюда входят возраст, условия жизни, психологическое состояние, а также уровень понимания и контроль действий несовершеннолетнего. Все эти факторы определяются через опросы, оценку документов и проведение следственных мероприятий. Если возраст подозреваемого не подтверждается документами, назначается медицинское освидетельствование [13]. Далее Двойное представительство в интересах несовершеннолетнего подразумевает обязанность присутствия защитника и законного представителя в процессе [3]. Здесь упор делается на обеспечение адекватной защиты прав подсудимого, особенно при участии в деле законного представителя, к правам и полномочиям которого относятся уведомление об обвинениях и возможность участвовать в ряде процедур [38, 39]. Далее Особые процессуальные действия проводятся, когда дело затрагивает несовершеннолетних. К примеру, вызов несовершеннолетних требует оповещения через их законных представителей [40]. Допрос регулируется особым временем и условиями, в том числе необходимостью присутствия педагога или психолога для лиц до 16 лет [42]. Далее Что касается мер принуждения, то применение их в отношении несовершеннолетних регламентировано соответствующими нормами УПК РФ [3]. Родители или законные представители всегда должны быть в курсе задержания или ареста [41]. Для несовершеннолетних предусмотрены специальные меры пресечения, такие как отдача под присмотр [3]. Далее На возможность прекращения уголовного преследования в отношении несовершеннолетних указывает статья 427 УПК РФ. Она предусматривает применение мер воспитательного воздействия, если преступление носило небольшой характер и есть основания полагать, что несовершеннолетний способен на исправление [3]. Подобная процедура ведется совместно с прокурором и судьей. Далее В целом, уголовное производство в отношении несовершеннолетних выделяется рядом характерных черт и адаптировано с учетом возраста, индивидуальных особенностей и специфических правовых потребностей подростков. Это направлено на обеспечение защиты их прав и интересов, а также на соблюдение принципов справедливости и законности.

Он должен быть оригинальным, избегать повторов и проходить проверку Антиплагиата, а также объем текста составлять от 1000 до 1100 слов: [В досудебном производстве по уголовным делам, касающимся несовершеннолетних, существуют два основных этапа: возбуждение уголовного дела и предварительное расследование. Возбуждение уголовного дела в отношении преступлений несовершеннолетних осуществляется согласно общим правилам, установленным главами 19-20 УПК РФ [3] (Уголовно-процессуальный кодекс Российской Федерации). Однако при принятии решения о возбуждении дела необходимо учитывать положения статьи 19 УК РФ [4] (Уголовный кодекс Российской Федерации), которая устанавливает возраст, с которого лицо становится уголовно ответственным. Если лицо не достигло соответствующего возраста (14 или 16 лет), уголовное дело не может быть возбуждено, так как отсутствует состав преступления (субъект). Поэтому при решении о возбуждении дела следователь (дознаватель) должен установить точную дату рождения несовершеннолетнего, основываясь на официальном документе, таком как свидетельство о рождении или паспорт. Также на этапе возбуждения дела необходимо рассмотреть вопрос о возможном участии взрослого соучастника. Если невозможно исключить участие взрослого соучастника, дело должно быть возбуждено, и предварительное расследование проводится для проверки этой версии [35]. Однако большинство особенностей процесса рассмотрения уголовных дел в отношении несовершеннолетних связаны с предварительным расследованием. Эти особенности касаются следующих процессуальных аспектов: подследственность, выделение уголовного дела в отдельное производство, предмет доказывания, двойное представительство интересов несовершеннолетнего, проведение отдельных процессуальных действий, применение мер принуждения и завершение предварительного расследования. Подследственность означает, что расследование уголовного дела в отношении несовершеннолетнего может осуществляться как предварительным следствием, так и дознанием. Форма предварительного расследования зависит от характера совершенного несовершеннолетним преступления, учитывая при этом предметные признаки подследственности. Тяжкие и особо тяжкие преступления, совершенные несовершеннолетними, подлежат исключительной подследственности следователям Следственного комитета РФ [36]. Выделение уголовного дела в отдельное производство возможно, если несовершеннолетний принимал участие в преступлении вместе с взрослыми. В соответствии со статьей 422 УПК РФ [3], орган расследования имеет право выделить дело о несовершеннолетнем в отдельное производство. При этом необходимо соблюдать требования статьи 154 УПК РФ, которая предусматривает, что выделение дела допускается только при условии, что это не повлияет на всестороннее, полное и объективное расследование обстоятельств дела. В случае, если выделение в отдельное производство не является возможным, применяются полные правила главы 50 УПК РФ. Особенности предмета доказывания в уголовных делах, связанных с несовершеннолетними, заключаются в установлении определенных обстоятельств, которые подлежат доказыванию в соответствии со статьями 73 и 421 УПК РФ. Эти обстоятельства включают: 1. Возраст несовершеннолетнего, включая точную дату его рождения (число, месяц, год). 2. Условия жизни, воспитания и особенности личности несовершеннолетнего, уровень его психического развития и другие характеристики. 3. Влияние старших по возрасту лиц на несовершеннолетнего. 4. В случае имеющихся данных о задержании психологического развития несовершеннолетнего, не связанного с психическим заболеванием, также устанавливается, способен ли он полностью осознавать фактический характер и общественную опасность своих действий или бездействия и контролировать их. 5. При совершении несовершеннолетним преступлений средней тяжести или тяжких преступлений, за исключением определенных преступлений, указанных в статье 92 УК РФ [4], также устанавливается наличие или отсутствие у него заболевания, препятствующего его содержанию и обучению в специальном учебно-воспитательном учреждении закрытого типа.[37] Установление этих обстоятельств происходит путем допроса родителей, учителей, воспитателей и других лиц, которые могут предоставить необходимую информацию, а также путем получения соответствующих документов и проведения других следственных и судебных действий. Важно отметить, что лицо считается достигшим возраста уголовной ответственности на следующий день после даты его рождения. Если нет официального документа, удостоверяющего возраст, проводится судебно-медицинская экспертиза для установления возраста несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого. В случае проведения такой экспертизы, последним днем года, указанным экспертом как год рождения подростка, считается его день рождения. Медицинское освидетельствование также может проводиться по постановлению следователя или дознавателя согласно правилам, установленным Правительством РФ. [13] Независимо от специфических обстоятельств дела, требование об установлении всех существенных и достоверных обстоятельств, составляющих предмет доказывания по уголовному делу, остается общим. Это включает установление событий преступления, виновности лица, формы его вины, мотивов действий, обстоятельств, влияющих на степень ответственности, а также обстоятельств, исключающих преступность и наказуемость деяния или приводящих к освобождению от уголовной ответственности и наказания, а также причиненного ущерба и условий, способствующих совершению преступления и других обстоятельств, связанных с делом. Двойное представительство интересов несовершеннолетнего в уголовном процессе означает, что у несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого должны быть как защитник, так и законный представитель. Согласно статье 51 УПК РФ [3], участие защитника обязательно, если лицо является несовершеннолетним. Дознаватель и следователь обязаны обеспечить участие защитника в ходе расследования, независимо от воли несовершеннолетнего (согласно части 2 статьи 52 УПК РФ). Несоблюдение этого требования считается серьезным нарушением прав несовершеннолетнего на защиту и является существенным нарушением уголовно-процессуального закона (в соответствии с пунктом 4 части 2 статьи 381 УПК РФ). При рассмотрении дел, связанных с несовершеннолетними, вопрос о приглашении защитника, как правило, решается через законного представителя несовершеннолетнего. Все правила, касающиеся участия защитника в таких делах, включая квалификацию лиц, которые могут выступать в качестве защитника, момент его допуска в дело, его права и обязанности, применяются без каких-либо ограничений или исключений [38]. Законный представитель допускается к участию в деле для защиты прав и интересов несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого. Его участие в деле является обязательным не только на стадии предварительного расследования, но и на последующих судебных этапах. Законными представителями могут быть родители, усыновители, опекуны, попечители подозреваемого, обвиняемого или потерпевшего, а также представители учреждений и организаций, ответственных за несовершеннолетнего (согласно пункту 12 статьи 5 УПК РФ). Правовой статус законного представителя на стадии предварительного расследования определен статьей 426 УПК РФ [3]. Законный представитель допускается к участию в деле на основании постановления следователя или дознавателя с момента первого допроса несовершеннолетнего в качестве подозреваемого или обвиняемого. С этого момента законный представитель имеет право: знать, в чем подозревается или обвиняется несовершеннолетний; присутствовать при предъявлении обвинения, участвовать в допросе несовершеннолетнего, а также, с разрешения следователя, в других следственных действиях, в которых участвуют несовершеннолетний обвиняемый, подозреваемый и его защитник; ознакомиться с протоколами следственных действий, в которых он принимал участие, и делать письменные замечания относительно правильности и полноты записей; подавать ходатайства и отводы, вносить жалобы на действия и решения следователя и дознавателя; представлять доказательства; после завершения расследования ознакомиться со всеми материалами дела, делать выписки из них в любом объеме (в соответствии с частью 2 статьи 426 УПК РФ) [39]. Законный представитель может быть исключен из участия в деле, если есть основания полагать, что его действия наносят ущерб интересам несовершеннолетнего или направлены на препятствие объективному расследованию дела. Об этом выносится мотивированное постановление. В этом случае к участию в деле допускается другой законный представитель несовершеннолетнего. Активным участником уголовного судопроизводства по делам о преступлениях несовершеннолетних является гражданский ответчик, который несет материальную ответственность за ущерб, причиненный преступными действиями несовершеннолетнего обвиняемого. Гражданским ответчиком может быть как физическое, так и юридическое лицо в соответствии с Гражданским кодексом РФ. Решение о привлечении гражданского ответчика принимается дознавателем, следователем или судьей путем вынесения постановления, а суд принимает определение (согласно статье 54 УПК РФ [3]). В процессе уголовного судопроизводства по делам несовершеннолетних существуют особенности в проведении отдельных процессуальных действий. Одна из них связана с вызовом несовершеннолетнего. Несовершеннолетний вызывается к следователю или дознавателю через его родителей или законных представителей. Такой же порядок применяется при вызове несовершеннолетнего в суд (в соответствии со статьей 424 УПК РФ). Если несовершеннолетний находится под стражей, его вызывают через администрацию места его содержания под стражей [40]. Допрос несовершеннолетнего также имеет ряд особенностей, которые определены в статье 428 УПК РФ: 1. Допрос несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого не может продолжаться без перерыва более двух часов и в общей сложности не более четырех часов в день. 2. Участие защитника обязательно при допросе несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого, и защитник имеет право задавать вопросы и ознакомиться с протоколом допроса и делать замечания по нему. 3. При допросе несовершеннолетнего, не достигшего 16-летнего возраста или признанного умственно отсталым, обязательно участие педагога или психолога. 4. Педагог или психолог имеют право задавать вопросы допрашиваемому с разрешения следователя, а по окончании допроса ознакомиться с протоколом допроса и делать замечания по нему. Эти права следователь или дознаватель разъясняет педагогу или психологу перед допросом несовершеннолетнего, что затем фиксируется в протоколе допроса. Применение мер принуждения в отношении несовершеннолетних также имеет особенности. Задержание и избрание меры пресечения в отношении несовершеннолетнего осуществляются с соблюдением общих правил, установленных в главах 12 и 13 УПК РФ [3], регулирующих применение мер принуждения в уголовном процессе. Согласно части 2 статьи 108 УПК РФ, заключение под стражу как меру пресечения применяется к несовершеннолетнему подозреваемому или обвиняемому в случае, если он подозревается или обвиняется в совершении тяжкого или особо тяжкого преступления. В исключительных случаях такая мера может быть применена и в отношении несовершеннолетнего, подозреваемого или обвиняемого в совершении преступления средней тяжести. Законом не предусмотрено ограничений для задержания несовершеннолетнего по подозрению в совершении преступления [41]. Родители или другие законные представители несовершеннолетнего должны быть уведомлены о его задержании, заключении под стражу или продлении срока содержания под стражей (в соответствии с частью 3 статьи 423 УПК РФ). Однако, есть особенность, указанная в части 3 статьи 96 УПК РФ, согласно которой, если в интересах следствия необходимо сохранить в тайне факт задержания, следователь или дознаватель при санкции прокурора могут воздержаться от уведомления указанных лиц. Однако, в случае задержания несовершеннолетнего, такое исключение не допускается, и указанные лица должны быть уведомлены о задержании, месте его нахождения и органе, ведущем расследование уголовного дела. Законный представитель несовершеннолетнего также имеет право участвовать в судебном заседании, где рассматривается вопрос об избрании меры пресечения в виде заключения под стражу в отношении несовершеннолетнего (согласно части 4 статьи 108 УПК РФ). Кроме того, он имеет право получить копию постановления об избрании меры пресечения (согласно части 2 статьи 101 УПК РФ [3]). В отношении несовершеннолетних обвиняемых предусмотрена специальная мера пресечения, которая заключается в отдаче под присмотр родителей, опекунов, попечителей или других доверенных лиц, а также должностных лиц администрации специализированного детского учреждения, в котором он находится. При решении вопроса о применении меры пресечения в отношении несовершеннолетнего обвиняемого должна быть рассмотрена возможность применения такой меры, как отдача под присмотр, в соответствии со статьей 105 УПК РФ. Эта мера пресечения предусматривает, что указанные лица берут на себя письменное обязательство обеспечить должное поведение несовершеннолетнего обвиняемого и его явку к дознавателю, следователю, прокурору и в суд. При отказе от подписки об отдаче под присмотр соответствующее лицо должно быть ознакомлено с характером преступления, в котором обвиняется несовершеннолетний, и с их ответственностью в случае нарушения принятых обязанностей по присмотру. Если лица, которым был отдан под присмотр несовершеннолетний, не выполняют своих обязательств, к ним могут применяться меры взыскания, предусмотренные частью 4 статьи 103 УПК РФ [42]. Прекращение уголовного дела и уголовного преследования может осуществляться в общем порядке согласно статьям 24-28 УПК РФ. Однако, статья 427 УПК РФ предусматривает специальный вид прекращения уголовного преследования в отношении несовершеннолетнего в ходе предварительного расследования с применением принудительной меры воспитательного воздействия. Это решение может быть принято, если выполнены следующие условия: (1) несовершеннолетний совершил преступление небольшой или средней тяжести, (2) есть данные, свидетельствующие о возможности исправления несовершеннолетнего без применения наказания, (3) несовершеннолетний и его законный представитель не возражают против прекращения уголовного преследования. При согласии следователя и прокурора, они выносят постановление о прекращении условного преследования и возбуждении ходатайства о применении принудительных мер воспитательного воздействия перед судом. Судья рассматривает материалы дела и ходатайство в соответствии со статьей 108 УПК РФ [3]. Если судья соглашается с принятым решением органа предварительного расследования, он применяет к несовершеннолетнему принудительные меры воспитательного воздействия. Контроль за соблюдением этих мер возлагается на специализированный государственный орган, ответственный за исправление несовершеннолетних, по решению суда. Если несовершеннолетний систематически не соблюдает требования, предусмотренные принудительной мерой воспитательного воздействия, судья, по представлению специализированного государственного органа, может отменить принудительную меру и направить материалы прокурору для дальнейшего рассмотрения уголовного дела. Кроме того, следователь имеет право вынести постановление о непредъявлении несовершеннолетнему для ознакомления материалов дела, которые могут негативно повлиять на него, и ознакомить с этими материалами законного представителя. Таким образом, процедура рассмотрения уголовных дел, связанных с несовершеннолетними, включает в себя ряд особенностей, учитывающих возраст и статус несовершеннолетнего, а также его участие в преступлении совместно с взрослыми. Эти особенности направлены на обеспечение справедливого и эффективного правосудия в отношении несовершеннолетних преступников.]»","output":"Процесс досудебного производства по уголовным делам, когда речь идет о несовершеннолетних, предполагает несколько ключевых стадий. К таким стадиям относятся инициация уголовного дела и проведение предварительных расследований. В каждом этапе важно учитывать уникальные требования и правила, которые заложены в законодательных актах Российской Федерации. Принципы инициации уголовного дела в случаях с участием несовершеннолетних базируются на общих положениях. Установленное УПК РФ [3], это предположение требует особого внимания к возрастным рамкам, определенным в ст. 19 УК РФ [4]. Именно этот документ указывает на возраст, начиная с которого лицо может быть привлечено к уголовной ответственности. Порог в 14 или 16 лет ограничивает возможность возбуждения дела, если подозреваемый младше этого возраста. Подтвердить возраст несовершеннолетнего следователь может с помощью официальных документов, вроде свидетельства о рождении или паспорта. Важным моментом также является рассмотрение вероятности участия взрослого соучастника, что, в итоге, ведет к возбуждению дела и проверке данного предположения в ходе расследования [35]. Предварительное расследование оказывает значительное влияние на общий процесс и включает в себя множество процедурных аспектов специфичных именно для дел о несовершеннолетних. В их числе – решение вопросов подследственности, выделение дела в отдельное производство и определение предмета доказывания. Также к важным моментам относится двойное представление интересов ребенка, отдельные процессуальные действия, меры принуждения и окончание предварительного расследования. Подследственность определяет форму проведения расследования уголовного дела: или предварительное следствие, или дознание. Если речь идет о тяжких преступлениях, которые были совершены несовершеннолетним, полномочия по расследованию переходят к следователям Следственного комитета РФ [36]. Вопрос выделения дела в отдельное производство возникает, если несовершеннолетний участвовал в преступлении наряду с взрослыми. Тогда принимается во внимание ст. 422 УПК РФ [3], которая позволяет органам расследования выделять дело о несовершеннолетнем в раздельное производство, обеспечивая тем самым справедливое и обстоятельное изучение ситуации. Специфику предмета доказывания составляют такие элементы как возраст несовершеннолетнего, условия его жизни и воспитания, влияние на него старших лиц, и психологическое развитие. Также имеет вес судебно-медицинская экспертиза для установления возраста, если отсутствуют соответствующие документы [13]. При этом подробное доказывание также включает разбор событий, выяснение мотивов и других значимых обстоятельств. Двойное представительство интересов означает одновременное участие защитника и законного представителя несовершеннолетнего, уточненное в ст. 51 УПК РФ [3]. Законным представителям могут быть родители, усыновители или опекуны подозреваемого, обвиняемого либо жертвы. Их права и обязанности фиксированы и регламентированы в ряде нормативно-правовых актов [39]. Процедурные действия, включая вызовы и допросы несовершеннолетних, проводятся с соблюдением определенных формальностей, учитывающих возраст и психологические особенности подростков (ст. 428 УПК РФ). В категорию мер принуждения также вносятся специальные корректировки, например, учитывая возможность содержания несовершеннолетнего под стражей только в особых случаях [41]. При этом уведомление родителей о задержании обязательно. Окончание предварительного расследования может включать специальные меры воспитательного воздействия, которые возможны при соблюдении ряда условий, зафиксированных в ст. 427 УПК РФ. Такие меры предполагают возможное исправление без назначения наказания, при условии согласия с этим решением несовершеннолетнего и его представителя. Описанные особенности процесса рассмотрения уголовных дел в отношении несовершеннолетних отражают нормативные требования Российской Федерации и направлены на защиту прав молодых граждан при одновременном обеспечении справедливости и законности расследования."},{"instruction":"продолжи","output":"Эти особенности подхода в судебной практике учитывают уязвимость и особое положение несовершеннолетних, а также содействуют их ресоциализации. Детальное внимание уделяется разграничению сфер влияния взрослых и детей в уголовном процессе, что особенно актуально, если ребенок причастен к преступлению вместе с взрослыми. В таких случаях принципиально важно выявить истинную роль несовершеннолетнего для того, чтобы правильно направить меры воздействия со стороны правоохранительных и судебных органов. Применение мер принуждения и пресечения в отношении детей должно опираться на максимально гуманные и обоснованные подходы. К примеру, установление надзора, обеспечение участия родителей и представителей детских учреждений – это мера, которая имеет целью не только обезопасить общество от повторного правонарушения, но и создать благоприятные условия для коррекции поведения несовершеннолетнего [105 УПК РФ]. Завершающий этап предварительного расследования может включать условное прекращение уголовного преследования, что предусматривается как специальное исключение из общих правил [427 УПК РФ]. Эта мера может быть применена в случаях небольших и средних преступлений, если есть основания полагать, что несовершеннолетний способен исправиться без формального назначения наказания. Эти случаи тоже предполагают наличие согласия со стороны несовершеннолетнего и его законного представителя на прекращение преследования с применением принудительных мер воспитательного характера. Таким образом, судья рассматривает материалы дела и принимает соответствующее решение на основании представленных доказательств и ходатайств от следователя и прокурора. Контроль за выполнением мер воспитательного характера возложен на определенные государственные организации, которые должны удостовериться в том, что несовершеннолетний выполняет предписанные требования. Важно подчеркнуть, что в случае нарушения несовершеннолетним условий мер воспитательного воздействия, могут быть предприняты дополнительные шаги для обеспечения соблюдения закона, включая возврат материалов для дальнейшего рассмотрения возможного наказания. Кроме того, в уголовно-процессуальном законодательстве уделяется особое внимание защите психического здоровья несовершеннолетних. Так, следователь или дознаватель может принять решение о том, чтобы не предоставлять для ознакомления несовершеннолетнему материалы, которые могут оказать негативное воздействие на его психику. Это не исключает право законного представителя ознакомиться с такими материалами, а также является гарантом, что интересы ребенка будут защищены на всех этапах судопроизводства. Так, процесс расследования и рассмотрения уголовных дел в отношении несовершеннолетних в Российской Федерации формируется с учетом возрастной специфики и психологических особенностей подростков. Основной целью является достижение справедливого правосудия при одновременной защите прав и интересов несовершеннолетних, их социализации и профилактики новых правонарушений."},{"instruction":"TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA disable in IIS Crypto 4.0","output":"To disable the TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA cipher suite in IIS Crypto 4.0, you can follow these steps: 1.

In the middle of this surreal tranquility stood Jack Genson, a Canadian man of no particular renown, whose most outlandish adventures until today had been confined to the escapades he lived through the pages of his hefty fantasy novel collection. He had been walking down the bustling Toronto streets, lost in thought about his mundane job, when a sudden dizziness swept over him. The surrounding noise of chattering pedestrians and honking cars slipped into silence, and an inexplicable force yanked Jack forward, as though a colossal hand had reached through the fabric of reality itself just to pluck him away. Colors whirled before his eyes, forming a resplendent vortex of swirling hues that pulsed with the rhythm of an otherworldly heartbeat. Then, just as abruptly as it had begun, the vertigo ceased, the colors settled, and Jack found himself standing not on an asphalt path crowded with passersby, but amidst sprawling emerald fields, under a sky painted with violent strokes of twilight. He blinked, his mind slowly processing this abrupt transition from the urban to the majestic. A gentle breeze danced across his skin, carrying the muffled sound of distant birdcalls and the rustling of leaves. With each passing moment, it became evident that this was no ordinary place – perhaps not even his Earth at all. Part 2 'Jack is lost' For a long while, Jack stood rooted to the spot, his gaze roving over the vast landscape. The serene beauty of this place was undeniable, yet its foreignness wrapped around him like a shroud. There were no tall buildings peering over the horizon, no planes etching white trails across the sky, no signs of technology as far as his eyes could see. It was as if he had stepped into a bygone era, or an entirely different world altogether. Jack stumbled forward, his legs carrying him in no particular direction. His heart hammered against his ribs, each beat a stark reminder of his solitude in this unknown land. The absence of direction or a familiar face plunged him into a deep isolation, the gravity of which bore down on his every step. \\"Hello?\\" he called out, his voice sounding embarrassingly feeble against the chorus of the wild. But the only reply came in the form of an echo, bouncing back with a hollow reassurance. Hours seemed to pass, the sky transitioning from dusky pink to a deep violet, and with the encroaching darkness, a chilling realization creeped up on Jack – he was utterly and hopelessly lost. Part 3 'Jack learns he has a system' As the first stars began to pepper the night sky, a muted glow caught Jack's attention. It emanated from within him – or rather, from a translucent panel that had appeared in his field of view. He reached out with a trembling hand, expecting his fingers to meet empty air, yet they brushed against the surface of the panel with a sensation akin to the buzz of static electricity. \\"Welcome, Jack Genson, to the System,\\" read the glowing script. Baffled, he pressed a finger to the words, and the panel responded instantly, expanding to reveal more text. \\"The System is your guide and assistant in this new world. It will grant you skills and record your feats. May you rise from the quagmire of the weak and ascend to the zenith of power.\\" Jack couldn't help but let out a wry chuckle. \\"So, I'm in some sort of game now?\\" he muttered. But the panel before him was unyielding, displaying only what appeared to be RPG-style stats – all of which, to Jack's dismay, were pathetically meager. Part 4 'Jack opens all the system panels and they are written out' Summoning his courage, Jack explored the series of panels with a mixture of trepidation and intrigue. As he swiped through the translucent pages, various headings came into view: Inventory, Skills, Quests, Map, and Stats. His Inventory was depressingly empty save for a set of plain clothes – his current attire – and a meager pouch of coins of an unfamiliar mint. The Skills panel was no less barren, save for a lone entry that read \\"Basic Language Comprehension – Passive.\\" Jack guessed it explained why he could understand the writing on these panels. The Quests tab was just as unpopulated. However, the Map displayed a sprawling topography dotted with forests, mountains, and markers signifying towns, one of which pulsated to indicate his current location – the Kingdom of Dorek. Lastly, his Stats page laid bare his deficiencies: Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Stamina, and Luck – all at the lowest possible level. But the most glaring of all was his Zero in the field labeled \\"Magic Affinity.\\" In a place where magic seemed to be of paramount importance, Jack Genson, it appeared, had none. (To be continued...)"},{"instruction":"Continue","output":"Jack scrutinized the dimly-lit Stats panel, a growing sense of dread threatening to overwhelm his rational thought. He traced his fingers along the glowing zero next to Magic Affinity, half expecting, half hoping it was some error that a tap or two would fix. But the stubborn digit remained, a stark reminder of his unfortunate predicament in a world that valued magical prowess above all else. Despite the sinking feeling in his gut, Jack pressed on, exploring the interface for any hint of a tutorial or aid that could help him acclimate to his new reality. Yet all he found was a blinking prompt—an enigmatic question at the bottom of the Stats panel: \\"Do you wish to begin your journey? Y/N.\\" With a mere button press, Jack could choose to accept whatever fate this world and its mysterious System offered. Weighing his options, he realized that there was little choice in the matter; he needed to survive, to find allies, to understand the rules of this fantastical game thrust upon him. And so, with a mix of trepidation and resolve, he pressed \\"Y.\\" The panel gave a soft chime of acknowledgment, and a notification appeared: \\"Journey accepted. Be vigilant, and let your wits guide you to power and home.\\" Home. The word echoed in his mind with an intense yearning. Whether by fate or sheer coincidence, finding his way back to His world—should such a thing be possible—felt like the true quest he had to embark upon. Chapter 2: Skill points Part 1 'Jack receives a simple quest to earn skill points' Jack had scarcely resumed his aimless walk when the System chimed once more, drawing his attention to a new notification that popped into existence: \\"Quest: Prove Your Worth – Defeat any creature and earn your first Skill Point.\\" His mindset shifted almost immediately from helpless wanderer to someone with a purpose, a goal, however insignificant it might seem. In the vast openness of this world, even the simple task of slaying a creature served as a beacon, a small fire to ward off the overwhelming darkness of the unknown. Part 2 'Jack gets into a fight with a slime' The night had fully settled now, a tapestry of stars casting a silver light upon the rolling hills and dales. Jack's ears pricked up at a light squelching sound disturbing the peaceful chirrup of crickets. He turned towards the noise and saw a gelatinous form slowly undulating towards him—a slime, a creature familiar to any fan of the fantasy genre. Jack braced himself, his heart quickening its rhythm. With no weapon to speak of, he clenched his fists, prepared to confront this staple monster of the fantasy realms barehanded. Part 3 'Jack struggles to fight the slime because more show up' The first slime was upon him quickly, its body quivering with each attempt to engulf his shoe. Jack stepped back, kicking at it, and was mildly surprised when the creature recoiled, its form momentarily losing shape. But victory was short-lived, for as he fought, more slimes—blue, green, and one alarmingly large red one—began to emerge from the surrounding foliage. He danced around them, trying to focus on one at a time, but their numbers were growing, and his lack of combat experience became increasingly evident. They were not particularly fast, nor intelligent, but they were persistent, and Jack's energy waned with each evasive maneuver. Part 4 'Jack finally kills all the slimes and earns 5 skill points total' Despite his fatigue and the growing desperation, Jack persevered, driven by the knowledge that this odd quest was his sole path forward. He discovered that a forceful stomp to the slimes' nucleus-like cores seemed to do the trick, dissolving them into harmless puddles. It was grueling work, and his breath came out in ragged gasps as he dispatched slime after slime. At last, panting and covered in viscous residue, Jack stood surrounded by the remnants of his slimy adversaries. The System pinged—a triumphant trill that marked the end of the battle: \\"Quest completed. 5 Skill Points awarded.\\" He could hardly believe his luck; the struggle had been worth a whole five points. Perhaps the next step would be easier—or so he hoped.

It means \\"one less than the previous one.\\" This sutra is used to multiply a number by one less than a base like 10, 100, 1000, etc. To multiply 15 by 99 using the Ekanyunena Purvena Sutra, you consider 99 as one less than 100. Now take the number you are multiplying by 99, which is 15, and subtract 1 from it: 15 - 1 = 14 This is the first part of your answer. Next, you take the result you just calculated (14), and subtract it from the nearest power of 10 (which is 100 in this case): 100 - 14 = 86 This is the second part of your answer.

AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'bool'. \`np.bool\` was a deprecated alias for the builtin \`bool\`. To avoid this error in existing code, use \`bool\` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use \`np.bool_\` here.The aliases was originally deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance see the original release note at: https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations ERROR: failed to reproduce 'make_plots': failed to run: python ./src/visualization/visualize.py, exited with 1","output":"The error you're experiencing, \`AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'bool'\`, indicates that your code is attempting to access an attribute called \`bool\` from the \`numpy\` module, but no such attribute exists in your current version of \`numpy\`. The \`np.bool\` was an alias for the Python built-in \`bool\` type and was used within NumPy to represent boolean data types. However, this usage has been deprecated to avoid confusion between the NumPy type and the built-in \`bool\` type, as well as to follow the convention of using a trailing underscore for scalar types in NumPy (\`np.bool_\`). This deprecation happened starting with NumPy 1.20. This means that if you have updated NumPy to version 1.20 or later, you can no longer use \`np.bool\`. Instead, you should make the following changes to your code: - If you were using \`np.bool\` to simply refer to the Python built-in \`bool\`, you can just use \`bool\` directly without the \`np.\` prefix. - If you specifically wanted the NumPy scalar type for boolean values, replace \`np.bool\` with \`np.bool_\`. So, you should go through your code and update it accordingly: \`\`\`python # If you had this in your code some_array = np.array([True, False], dtype=np.bool) # Change it to use \`bool\` if you were referring to the built-in type: some_array = np.array([True, False], dtype=bool) # Or change it to \`np.bool_\` if you were referring to the NumPy scalar type: some_array = np.array([True, False], dtype=np.bool_) \`\`\` After making the necessary replacements, your code should work with the updated NumPy version. For more details and guidance on this deprecation, you can also refer to the release notes for NumPy 1.20, which you've mentioned in your question: https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations The release notes provide additional context and recommendations for transitioning away from deprecated features."},{"instruction":"посоветуй версию numpy максимально актуальную, у которой не будет возникать подобной ошибки?","output":"Если вы хотите использовать более старую версию \`numpy\`, где \`np.bool\` ещё не было объявлено устаревшим (deprecated) и до сих пор работает без ошибок, вам нужно будет установить версию \`numpy\`, которая старше 1.20, поскольку deprecation была введена в версии 1.20. Максимально актуальная версия \`numpy\`, которая не содержит изменений, касающихся \`np.bool\`, - это версия 1.19.x. Чтобы установить эту версию, вы можете использовать \`pip\` следующим образом: \`\`\`python pip install numpy==1.19.5 \`\`\` Эта версия будет поддерживать \`np.bool\`, и ваш существующий код должен продолжать работать без изменений.

Вот несколько шагов, которые можно предпринять, чтобы решить эту проблему: 1. **Проверить Название Папок:** Убедитесь, что название каждой папки в пути правильное. Проверьте наличие опечаток, лишних пробелов, спецсимволов или регистра букв. 2. **Проверить Наличие Диска и Папки:** Убедитесь, что диск \`Z:\` подключен к вашему компьютеру и работает корректно. Если это сетевой диск, проверьте, что компьютер подключен к сети и имеет доступ к нему. 3. **Проверить Права Доступа:** Убедитесь, что у вас есть соответствующие права доступа к диску \`Z:\` и к папке, к которой вы пытаетесь получить доступ. 4. **Использовать Команду dir:** Вы можете использовать команду \`dir\` на диске \`Z:\`, чтобы увидеть список доступных папок: \`\`\` Z:>dir \`\`\` Или если вы уже находитесь в каталоге \`ФД\`: \`\`\` Z:ФД>dir \`\`\` Это покажет, существуют ли подпапки \`Валидация\` и \`Валидация_2024\`. 5. **Использовать Файловый Менеджер:** Используйте файловый менеджер вашей операционной системы (например, \\"Проводник\\" в Windows) для навигации по папкам и визуальной проверки наличия пути. 6. **Проверить Сетевые Настройки:** Если \`Z:\` является сетевым диском, убедитесь, что нет проблем с сетевым подключением и настройками. 7. **Использовать Корректные Экранирующие Символы:** При использовании командной строки иногда пути с пробелами или специальными символами нужно брать в кавычки: \`\`\` Z:>cd \\"Z:ФДВалидацияВалидация_2024\\" \`\`\` Если после всех проверок путь всё ещё не найден, возможно его действительно нет или он был перемещен/удалён. В этом случае вам нужно будет убедиться в том, что вы обращаетесь к правильному пути или создать необходимые папки.

Here's a general outline on how to do this: 1. Determine the login mechanism (look for the form action, method, and necessary parameters). 2. Use the \`requests\` library to send a POST request to the login URL with the appropriate data (username and password). 3. Handle cookies/session if required. 4. Send a GET request to the page you want to scrape once authenticated. 5. Use \`BeautifulSoup\` to parse the HTML content. Here is a code example: \`\`\`python import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup # URLs that you will be using login_url = 'http://example.com/login' target_url = 'http://example.com/protected_page' # Start a session so that cookies are persisted session = requests.Session() # Define the payload with your username and password payload = { 'username': 'your_username', 'password': 'your_password', # Add any other necessary payload items like CSRF tokens or form fields } # Send the POST request to login response = session.post(login_url, data=payload) # Check if login was successful if response.ok: # Send a GET request to the protected page now that you are logged in response = session.get(target_url) # Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser') # Do your scraping: find elements, extract information, etc. # Example: find all the paragraphs paragraphs = soup.find_all('p') for paragraph in paragraphs: print(paragraph.text) else: print(\\"Login failed\\") # Close the session session.close() \`\`\` Please replace \`http://example.com/login\` and \`http://example.com/protected_page\` with the actual URLs you need to interact with, and use the correct form field names for the \`payload\`. Keep in mind the following: - Some sites have protection against scraping, so this approach may not work for all websites. - Certain websites also check for CSRF tokens and other hidden form fields which you will need to extract first from the login page and then include in your payload. - Websites can use different authentication mechanisms such as OAuth, Captchas, or two-factor authentication, which will require a more complex solution. - Make sure you comply with the website's terms of service. Not all websites permit scraping, and doing so without permission may violate their terms and potentially legal regulations. Always respect the website's \`robots.txt\` file as well, which indicates the scraping policy. If a site explicitly disallows scraping of the content you're after, you should not scrape that site."},{"instruction":"write a python code for storing the login cookies","output":"To store login cookies when using the \`requests\` library in Python, you can simply use a \`requests.Session\` object. This object persists cookies across all requests made from the session instance. However, if you'd like to store these cookies for use in subsequent runs of your script (e.g., to avoid re-logging in every time you execute the script), you may choose to save them to a file and then load them later. Here's an example of how you could do that using the \`pickle\` module: \`\`\`python import requests import pickle from requests.exceptions import RequestException # The URL for logging in to the website login_url = 'https://example.com/login' # Your login credentials credentials = {'username': 'your_username', 'password': 'your_password'} # Start a session session = requests.Session() # Try to load existing cookies try: with open('cookies.pkl', 'rb') as f: cookies = pickle.load(f) session.cookies.update(cookies) except FileNotFoundError: print(\\"No cookie file found.

Might need to login again.\\") # Note that the session will automatically use the saved cookies until they expire \`\`\` Please ensure to replace \`https://example.com/login\`, \`your_username\`, and \`your_password\` with the actual login URL and your credentials for the website you're trying to log in to. Replace \`https://example.com/protected_page\` with the URL of the protected page you want to access after logging in. This example uses Python's \`pickle\` module to serialize and deserialize the \`requests\` cookies object. When running the script for the first time or after the cookies have expired, it will perform the login and save the cookies to a file named \`cookies.pkl\`. On subsequent runs, it will try to use the saved cookies to avoid logging in again. Keep in mind that storing cookies in this way can be a security risk if the cookies contain sensitive information and the file is not adequately protected."},{"instruction":"mejorar redaccion: Adjuntamos la presentación que vamos a presentar durante la reunió nde seguimiento de hoy Muchas gracias.","output":"Adjunto encontrará la presentación que se expondrá en la reunión de seguimiento de hoy.

Calculating capital expenditures and progress towards long-term goals involves considering the relationship between time and value. One way to do this is by determining the number of regular deposits needed to reach a specific capital expenditure or long-term goal. For example, if a person wants to save 10,000 for a down payment on a house in 5 years, they can calculate the number of regular deposits they need to make based on the time value of money. By considering factors such as expected interest rates and the desired future value, they can determine the amount and frequency of deposits needed to reach their goal. Calculating monthly budget limits, on the other hand, may be more focused on income and expenses rather than long-term goals. While it is important for managing finances, it may not directly consider the relationship between time and value in the same way as calculating capital expenditures and progress towards long-term goals."},{"instruction":"The basic dynamics of probabilities are the rules that govern how probabilities are calculated and how they can be used to make predictions.

Voici quelques suggestions pour déboguer et corriger le problème de la mise à jour des notifications de panier : 1. **Utilisation Correcte des Écouteurs d'Événements**: Veillez à ce que \`dispatchCartUpdate()\` soit appelé chaque fois que le panier est modifié. Dans votre fonction \`addToCartHandler()\`, l'appel à \`dispatchCartUpdate()\` semble être placé avant la logique de mise à jour du cookie. Il devrait être après avoir mis à jour le cookie. 2. **Logique de Réduction**: Assurez-vous que la fonction \`updateCartItemCount()\` s'exécute correctement. Ajoutez des \`console.log\` pour contrôler si elle est déclenchée lors de l'événement, et également si elle reçoit et traite correctement l'état actuel du panier stocké dans les cookies. 3. **Gestion des États**: Dans le hook \`useEffect\` de \`NavButton\`, vous ne spécifiez pas de dépendances. Cela signifie que \`addCartUpdateListener\` et \`removeCartUpdateListener\` seront appelés une seule fois après le premier montage du composant. Si votre intention est de les appeler plus fréquemment, il faut ajouter des dépendances dans le tableau de dépendances du \`useEffect\`. 4. **Durée de Vie des Écouteurs d'Événements**: Assurez-vous que l'écouteur d'événements est retiré avec \`removeCartUpdateListener\` lorsque le composant est démonté ou a besoin de se débarrasser de cet écouteur pour éviter les fuites de mémoire ou les appels d'écouteurs inattendus après le démontage. 5. **Gestion des Cookies**: Vérifiez que les fonctions \`getCookie\` et \`setCookie\` fonctionnent comme prévu. Les cookies sont correctement écrits et lus après les mises à jour du panier. 6. **Débogage des Composants Enfants**: Analysez le composant \`TicketCard\` pour vous assurer que tout se passe bien lors de l'ajout d'articles au panier et que \`dispatchCartUpdate()\` est appelé après chaque mise à jour. N'oubliez pas de nettoyer vos logs de débogage une fois que vous aurez localisé et résolu le problème, pour garder votre console propre et ne pas exposer de données potentiellement sensibles en production. En somme, allez pas à pas, en vérifiant chaque étape de l'interaction, depuis la modification du panier jusqu'à l'émission de l'événement et le rafraîchissement de l'affichage du compteur d'articles du panier."},{"instruction":"Comment mettre à jour en direct sur la page de la billeterie la notification du panier sans avoir besoin de refresh, lorsque j'ajoute les éléments au panier. import { motion } from 'framer-motion'; import { useState } from 'react'; import Button from '../components/form/Button'; import { getCookie, setCookie } from '../cookies/CookiesLib.tsx'; type Props = { id: number; title: string; price: number|string; nbTicket: number; isForfait?: boolean; }; const initialDays = { '20Juillet': false, '21Juillet': false, '22Juillet': false }; export default function TicketCard(props: Props) { const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false); const [tickets, setTickets] = useState(props.nbTicket); const [rotation, setRotation] = useState(0); const [days, setDays] = useState(initialDays); const addToCartHandler = () => { const selectedDays = isForfait ?

Créer un \`CartContext\` : \`\`\`jsx import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from 'react'; const CartContext = createContext(); export const useCart = () => useContext(CartContext); export const CartProvider = ({ children }) => { const [cart, setCart] = useState(getCookie('cart') || []); const updateCart = (newCart) => { setCart(newCart); setCookie('cart', newCart, { expires: 7, sameSite: 'None', secure: true }); }; return ( <CartContext.Provider value={{ cart, updateCart }}> {children} </CartContext.Provider> ); }; \`\`\` # Étape 2: Utiliser le Contexte dans les Composants Dans votre composant \`NavButton\`, utilisez le hook \`useCart\` pour accéder à l'état du panier et vous abonner aux mises à jour : \`\`\`jsx import { useCart } from '../../path/to/CartContext'; export default function NavButton(props) { const { cart } = useCart(); const cartItemCount = cart.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.quantity, 0); // ... } \`\`\` Dans votre composant \`TicketCard\`, mettez à jour le panier en utilisant le contexte : \`\`\`jsx import { useCart } from '../../path/to/CartContext'; export default function TicketCard(props) { const { cart, updateCart } = useCart(); const addToCartHandler = () => { // ... traitement de l'article let newCart = [...cart]; const billetIndex = newCart.findIndex(billet => billet.id === itemForCart.id); if (billetIndex > -1) { newCart[billetIndex].quantity += itemForCart.quantity; } else { newCart.push(itemForCart); } updateCart(newCart); }; // ... } \`\`\` # Étape 3: Envelopper l'Application avec le Provider Enveloppez votre application avec \`CartProvider\` dans votre composant racine (\`App\` ou équivalent) pour que le contexte soit disponible dans toute l'application : \`\`\`jsx import { CartProvider } from './path/to/CartContext'; function App() { return ( <CartProvider> {/* autres composants */} </CartProvider> ); } export default App; \`\`\` # Conclusion En utilisant le Contexte, vous avez un état global partagé qui est mis à jour en temps réel lorsque des articles sont ajoutés au panier.

Increased strength and endurance: Running with a weight vest adds resistance, which requires your muscles to work harder. This can help build strength and endurance, enabling you to run faster and longer. 2. Improved cardiovascular fitness: The added resistance of the weight vest makes your heart and lungs work harder, increasing your cardiovascular fitness. This can improve your overall stamina and ability to withstand more intense workouts. 3. Increased calorie burn: Running with a weight vest can increase the intensity of your workout, resulting in a higher calorie burn. This can be beneficial for weight loss or maintaining a healthy weight. 4. Enhanced bone density: Weight-bearing exercises like running can help improve bone density, and the additional weight from the vest can further stimulate bone growth and strength. 5. Increased running performance: Training with a weight vest can improve your running form and mechanics. When you run with extra weight, you are forced to engage your core and use proper running mechanics, which can lead to improved performance when running without the vest. 6. Mental toughness: Running with a weight vest can be mentally challenging and demanding. Pushing through this discomfort can help develop mental toughness and resilience, which can be beneficial in various aspects of life.

On the other hand, right-footed players typically have an advantage when it comes to playing on the right side of the field, as they can use their stronger foot to cross, dribble, and cut inside. Right-footed players may also have an advantage when playing in central positions, as they can use both feet to pass, control, and shoot.

Если отрезок AM параллелен стороне BC треугольника ABC и AM = 2 см, а сторона PA = 4 см, то можно утверждать, что отрезок AM является средней линией треугольника ABC. Средняя линия треугольника обладает свойством, что она равна половине стороны треугольника, к которой она параллельна, а также делит треугольник на два меньших треугольника, каждый из которых подобен исходному треугольнику с коэффициентом подобия 1/2. Исходя из этого, если AM = 2 см, то сторона BC треугольника ABC равна удвоенной длине отрезка AM, то есть BC = 2 * AM = 2 * 2 см = 4 см. Расстояние от точки M до стороны BC в данном случае будет равно высоте, опущенной из точки M на сторону BC. Поскольку AM - средняя линия, эта высота также будет являться высотой меньших подобных треугольников и её величина не зависит от длины самой средней линии, величину расстояния найти по заданным данным невозможно. Для точного вычисления расстояния от точки M до BC необходима дополнительная информация о треугольнике ABC, такая как его высоты, углы или другие стороны."},{"instruction":"write: I investigated and I am getting the same error that the access is deniaed Can you create a new object with user gitlab and share the object ID with me and I will try to read it from the new user Also, Please provide the password for the root login in a separate mail.","output":"Dear [Name], I hope this email finds you well.

Один из самых волнующих и ожидаемых моментов этого времени года – первый снег, который будто переворачивает страницу природы, открывая новую главу в бесконечной книге времён. Есть что-то особенно волшебное в первых белых хлопьях, мягко кружащихся в воздухе и медленно опускающихся на землю. Они призывают вспомнить детство, когда первый снег был синонимом радости, надежд и бесконечных игр на морозном воздухе. Дети с нетерпением ждут, когда можно будет сделать первого снеговика или прокатиться на санях, искрящийся снег призывает к новым приключениям и забавам. Первый снег это и символ обновления. Ведь он покрывает все недостатки поздней осени, прячет под собой увядшие листья и грязь, дарит миру чистоту линий и форм, выполняя своего рода ресет природы. В этом покрывале не остается места старым заботам – только надежда на новые начинания и мечты о будущем. Кроме того, первый снег навевает размышления о течении времени и о том, как важно ценить каждый момент. С приходом зимы природа замирает, давая возможность и нам на мгновение остановиться и посмотреть вокруг. Это время вздохнуть полной грудью прохладный воздух, зарядиться свежестью и найти в себе силы для новых свершений. Первый снег – это красивая, почти мифическая традиция природы.

Buckminsterfullerene, also known as C60 or Buckyballs, is a carbon molecule consisting of 60 atoms arranged in a spherical shape, while polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are complex organic molecules made up of fused aromatic rings. With these compounds present, the planet would likely have an atmospheric composition rich in carbon-based compounds. The gaseous atmosphere would shimmer with vibrant and exotic colors, reflecting the interaction of light with the complex molecular structures. The prevailing hues would be deep purples, magentas, and intense violets, creating a mesmerizing celestial display. The interaction of light with the buckminsterfullerene and PAHs would also give rise to unique spectral features, causing the planet's atmosphere to absorb and emit specific wavelengths of light. This might result in distinct absorption lines and emission bands that astronomers could study to gain insights into the composition and physical processes of the planet. Due to its gaseous nature, the planet would lack a solid surface and have a dense and turbulent atmosphere. Vast, swirling storms and atmospheric phenomena would be common, featuring intricate patterns and structures formed by the dynamic interactions of atmospheric currents and energetic chemical reactions. Although such a planet would likely be inhospitable to life as we know it, its complex atmospheric chemistry and stunning colors would undoubtedly captivate the imagination of scientists and stargazers alike.

Do you have any lingering concerns?","output":"Drama Reflective Journal Week of Nov 13-17: This week involved a two-person reading task. My partner and I selected a script and worked on delivering the dialogue authentically. We both found it challenging to avoid just 'reading' the lines and instead deliver them as genuine interactions. It was a powerful exploration into understanding character motivation and emotive expression through speech. Week of Nov 20-24: Improvisation exercises dominated the week, coupled with lessons on beats and storyboards. We learned the importance of a story's rhythm and how beats help in constructing a coherent and engaging performance. During improvisation practices, some of us struggled with spontaneity, while others thrived. Storyboarding was a new concept for most, but it quickly became clear how valuable this planning tool is for visualizing the narrative structure. Week of Dec 11-15: Reflecting on the task of writing our own scripts: 1. What went well: Breathing life into the characters and coming up with the story arc was quite exhilarating. The brainstorming sessions were bursting with creativity, and the collaborative writing process resulted in a rich script. 2. What went badly: The editing process was more tedious than anticipated. Finding consensus on certain dialogue and plot points was also a challenge, leading to some frustration among team members. 3. Problems faced: Time constraints were a major problem. Juggling creative differences and ensuring that the script remained cohesive also tested our resolve. 4. Team's teamwork: Despite some disagreements, our team supported one another and respected everyone’s inputs. There was a collective determination to achieve the best possible outcome. 5. Future approach: In the future, I would push for more structured writing sessions and clearer role delegation to prevent overlapping efforts and confusion. Week of Dec 18-22: Reflection on Project Week 1: 1. Our pacing is decent; while not ahead, we're on schedule. There's a lingering concern that one slip could lead to falling behind. 2. Maintaining focus was challenging due to various distractions, including personal devices and side conversations. However, we generally steered back on course quickly. 3. Group discussions and decision-making were quite efficient. At times, technical aspects, such as lighting and sound design, didn't progress as smoothly. 4. Our organization could be tighter but as a group, we're quite democratic in our decisions. Everyone has a voice. 5. Better time management and a stricter adherence to roles and responsibilities would help. Work seems evenly distributed, but logs need to be updated more regularly for better tracking. Week of Dec 25-29: Reflection on Project Week 2: 1. Rehearsing scenes and watching them come to life has been incredibly fulfilling and the most enjoyable aspect. 2. Learning to adapt and take criticism constructively has been my greatest learning curve. 3. Project management requires resilience and flexibility; it isn't just about planning but also adapting as required. 4. The cohesion and efficiency of our collective performance and managing last-minute changes seem daunting but surmountable with teamwork. Week of Jan 1-5: Reflection on Project Week 3: 1. Several technical aspects and a few rehearsals still need to be nailed down. 2. Coordination between departments has been challenging, leading to occasional tensions and miscommunications. Reflection on teacher’s feedback: 3a. Much of the feedback aligned with our expectations, including notes on projection and pacing. 3b. The critique on our emotional delivery being unvaried was unexpected yet eye-opening. 3c. To respond to the feedback, we need to infuse more dynamic rehearsals and perhaps some method acting exercises. 3d. There's concern about ensuring that the final performance is as polished as expected, and whether we can integrate all feedback effectively. --- This reflective journal acts as a formative recapitulation of the theatrical learning and developmental process.

Есть несколько проблем с синтаксисом и его структурой, которые могут привести к ошибкам или непредвиденному поведению. Давайте разберем это по частям: 1. Тег открытия PHP нестандартный: \`\`\` <? \`\`\` Использование короткого открытия тега (\`<?\`) не рекомендуется, так как это может быть отключено в конфигурации PHP (\`short_open_tag\`). Вместо этого лучше использовать полный тег: \`<?php\`. 2. Неправильное использование HTML комментариев внутри PHP кода: \`\`\` <!-- noindex--> \`\`\` Если этот комментарий должен быть в HTML, он должен находиться вне блоков PHP кода. Если же это комментарий PHP, то его следует оформить так: \`<?php /* noindex */ ?>\`. Важно помнить, что HTML комментарии будут видны в исходном коде страницы, в то время как PHP комментарии не будут. 3. Неправильно оформленные элементы HTML и PHP код: \`\`\` class=\\"item item-shop-detail1 <span id=\\" title=\\"0\\"> \`\`\` Похоже, что здесь случилась ошибка. \`<span>\` внутри атрибута \`class\` выглядит как неверно вставленный HTML-фрагмент. 4. Некорректное использование данных в атрибутах: \`\`\` data-src=\\"<span id=\\" title=\\" Код PHP: &lt;?=arPhoto['PREVIEW']['src']?&gt;\\" \`\`\` PHP код внутри атрибута \`data-src\` должен быть вставлен правильно с использованием \`<?php ?>\` или \`<?= ?>\`, а HTML спецсимволы должны быть экранированы в соответствии с контекстом. Исправленный участок кода мог бы выглядеть примерно так: \`\`\`html data-src=\\"<?=htmlspecialchars(arPhoto['PREVIEW']['src'], ENT_QUOTES)?>\\" \`\`\` 5. Непонятно, что представляет собой CMax и другие вызываемые методы. Возможно, это методы фреймворка, который используется в коде, но без контекста это невозможно однозначно определить. Чтобы ваш код работал корректно, вам будет нужно убедиться, что вызовы методов и компонентов соответствуют вашей системе управления контентом, а PHP и HTML корректно сформированы и правильно встраиваются друг в друга. Поскольку код содержит множество ошибок и странных конструкций, он требует тщательной переработки. Если вы хотите убедиться в его полной работоспособности, вам будет необходимо тестировать его в контексте конкретного приложения или фреймворка, используя средства отладки и тестирования PHP и веб-браузера."},{"instruction":"Help me to write a Drama reflective journal, these topics should be included: Nov 13-17: two person reading from script task dialogue (the two-person speaking task) Nov 20-24: improvisation acting and beats/storyboard lesson improvisation + beats/storyboard practice Nov 27-1: part 1 project: no reflective journal entry for this week Dec 4-8: part 2 project: no reflective journal entry for this week Dec 11-15: Writing your own script task Answer the reflection questions.

Reading aloud helped me understand the dialogues. We practiced our intonation and expressions. Sometimes, it was hard to match my partner's timing, but we worked on it. November 20-24: We moved to improvisation acting and learning about beats and storyboarding. Doing improvisation was challenging because thinking on my feet is not easy. The storyboard lesson helped to see the story's flow. December 11-15: Writing our script was this week's task. What went well included creating interesting dialogues and overall plot. What went badly was the time management and some disagreements on character development. The main problems were coordinating everyone's ideas into a cohesive script. Our team's teamwork was good when we focused and listened to each other. In the future, I would plan the sessions better and encourage more discussion early on. December 18-22: Project Week 1 1. Our group is somewhat behind. Coordination has been an issue, but we hope to make up the time next week. 2. We tried to stay focused, but sometimes we got distracted by other things happening around us. 3. Brainstorming ideas went efficiently, but setting up the scenes took longer than expected. 4. We're working on being organized. Decisions sometimes take time because we want everyone to agree. 5. We could have planned better. We tried to divide the tasks, but I think some people ended up with more work than others. December 25-29: Project Week 2 1. Most enjoyable has been seeing our script come to life during rehearsals. 2. I learned a lot about the importance of everyone's role in a production. 3. In project management, communication is key. It's important to keep everyone updated. 4. The major challenges will be finalizing all aspects of the project on time and making sure everything runs smoothly. January 1-5: Project Week 3 1. We still need to fine-tune our acting and make sure all our props are ready. 2. We had some organizational problems with scheduling everyone for rehearsals. 3a. Some teacher feedback I expected was about our timing and projection. 3b. Unexpected feedback was about our stage positioning, which we hadn't considered much. 3c. To improve our performance, we will apply the feedback and practice more. 3d. My lingering concern is whether we can pull everything together in time."},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

청불 영화가 무려 800만 관객수를 동원했는데! 하하하.” 기자들 포함해 여러 관계자는 김도희 감독에게 미친 듯이 극찬을 쏟아냈다. 뭐, 뽑은 결과를 보면 당연한 그림이긴 했다. 반면, 여전히 머리털이 거친 김도희 감독은. “아- 네, 감사해요. 이래저래 정신이 없네요.” 기계적으로 리액션은 하지만 자리가 좀 불편했다. 영화제야 참석해 본 적은 있으나 이런 뒤풀이 자리는 익숙지 않기 때문, 덕분에. “아아, 저 잠시 전화 좀.” 많은 이에게 잡혀 있던 김도희 감독이 전화 받는 척 있던 자리서 움직였다. 살짝 외진 곳이 목적지. 그녀 뒤로 미술 감독이나 촬영 감독이 붙었다. 이내. “감독님.” 다른 배우들과 얘기하던 ‘마약상’의 주연들도 무리에 합류했다. ‘정성훈’과 ‘김교수’를 맡았던 진재준과 박판서였다. 먼저 물꼬를 튼 것은 정장 재킷의 단추를 푼, 팀 중 50대 중후반으로 가장 연장자인 박판서였다. “이 정도 시간 보냈으면 얼굴도장은 충분히 찍은 거 같고. 슬슬 갈까 합니다.” 대답은 날카로운 인상의 진재준이 빨랐고. “선배님 들어가시게요?” 얼굴에 피곤이 가득한 김도희 감독이 말끝을 붙잡았다. “예, 들어가세요. 저도 10분 이내에 도망갈까 생각하고 있었어요.” 픽 웃은 박판서가 왁자지껄한 연회장을 빙 둘러보다 다시 입을 열었다. “그나저나 여긴 예나 지금이나 고였어. 분위기는 그렇다 치고, 수상자 명단에 우진씨 이름이 없다는 게 어이가 없군.” 김도희 감독도 동의한다는 듯 한숨을 내쉬었다. “후- 애초 신인상이나 신인들한테 주는 상이 없다곤 해도······아예 언급이 없는 건 좀 그렇긴 하더라구요.” “흠, 내년엔 올 이유가 없겠어.” “그래도 뭐 여긴 시상식보단 그냥 파티 성향이 짙은 곳이니까 대충 넘겨야죠. 어차피 연말 메인 영화제는 청룡, 대종상이니까.” “슬슬 그 두 영화제, 전체 수상 후보들 발표할 때 안 됐나?” “아! 아마 이번 주 안으로 나올 거예요. 소문으론 두 영화제 사무국에선 우진씨 이름이 자주 언급된다네요.” “그래야지. 무시했다가 무슨 욕을 들어먹으려고.” 대화 주제로 강우진의 이름이 나오자 서서히 말이 많아진다. 특히, 김도희 감독이 그랬다. “아아, 선배님. 아침에 우진씨 블랙박스 영상 공개된 거 보셨습니까?” “봤지 그럼. 뉴스도 탄 이슈를 못 봤을 리가.” 진재준이나 촬영 감독, 미술 감독도 동참했다. “지금 여기 있는 다른 배우들도 전부 우진씨 얘기로 바빠요, 방금 저도 저기서 우진씨 얘기하다가 왔고.” “저도요. 기자들은 처음엔 ‘마약상’ 주제 꺼냈다가, 은근 ‘이상만’ 얘기로 빠지면서 우진씨 얘기로 넘어가고.” “오늘 아침에 터진 건데 어쩔 수 없죠. 근데 진짜 우진씨는 이슈가 끊이질 않네요. 설마하니 영웅담 미담까지 나올 줄은······” 곧, 이들은 영상 속 강우진의 무술에 관해 토론을 벌였다. 와중 김도희 감독이 거친 머리칼을 쓸면서도 아쉽다는 듯 입맛을 다셨다. “아우- 우진씨 움직임 죽이던데. 진작에 알았으면···액션씬 몇 개는 넣을 걸 그랬어요.” 박판서가 아서라는 듯 손을 휘저었다. “김 감독이 더 잘 알겠지만, ‘이상만’이 그런 화려한 무술을 보였으면 캐릭터 성이 많이 퇴색됐을 거야.” “······알죠. 그냥 아쉬운 마음에.” “더 좋은 시나리오 써서 우진씨 캐스팅해봐야지.” 이때였다. “아- 저기.” 와인을 리필하려 앞쪽 원형 탁자로 움직이던 진재준이 누군가를 발견했다. “안가복 감독님 계신데요?” 영물 안가복 감독이었다. 물론, 그의 주변엔 거들이 즐비했다. “심한호 선배님도 계시고. 어우, 대형 영화사 대표들도 빽빽하네.” “저 옆에 배 나온 양반은 파워패치 편집장 아닌가?” “다른 언론사 편집장도 보이네요.” 안가복 감독 무리에 시선을 박은 ‘마약상’ 팀 중, 뭔가 두 눈에 욕망이 서리기 시작한 진재준이 목을 가다듬었다. “큼큼. 가서 인사드리죠. 아까 간단히 하긴 했는데 제대로 해야될 것 같아서.” 촬영 감독이나 미술 감독이 동의했다. 반면, 작게 웃던 박판서는 다른 말을 뱉었다. “허허, 딱 보니까 ‘거머리’ 배우 뽑는 중이라 점수 좀 따려는 거구만.” 진재준이 숨길 것 없다는 얼굴로 어깨를 으쓱였다. “그렇죠, 솔직히 조연이라도 받으면 영광일 정돕니다.” “뭐- 가능하지 않겠어? 이번 ‘마약상’으로 점수는 땄을 테고. 그나저나 심한호 선배님이 같이 있는 거 보면······역시 저분은 확정이라는 건가?”“안가복 감독님 인터뷰한 거 보면 아직 미정이라고 하던데요.” “말만 미확정이지. 인터뷰에선 시나리오를 두 명한테 줬다며? 내부적으론 심한호 선배님 벌써 도장 찍었을지 몰라.” 다들 동의한다는 듯 고개를 끄덕였고 턱을 쓸던 박판서가 말을 이었다. “그 ‘거머리’란 영화, 안가복 감독님의 100번째 영화에 칸을 노리고 주연이 심한호. 판이 무지막지하구먼······위험해, 양날의 검이야.” 뭐가 됐든 ‘마약상’ 팀이 안가복 감독에게 인사하기 위해 움직일 쯤, 요지부동인 박판서를 보고 김도희 감독이 물었다. “선배님은 안 가십니까?” “난 따로 하지.” “아···알겠습니다.” 그 모습에 촬영 감독과 미술 감독이 수군댔고. “왜 저러셔?” “몰랐어? 박판서, 심한호. 둘이 사이가 그닥 좋지 않다고 소문 자자해.” “아-” 뒤로 ‘마약상’팀이 안가복 감독 무리에 합류했다. 금세 몰린 인원만 20명이 넘었고, 배우들은 물론이며 여러 감독들 외 연회장 모든 이의 시선을 끌었다. 눈치를 보며 무리에 끼는 배우들도 있을 지경. 그렇게 시작된 인사치레. 초반엔 큰 문제 없이 적당한 분위기가 형성됐다. 그러다. “안가복 감독님.” 진재준이 진중한 얼굴로 공기를 바꿨다. “‘거머리’ 배우 라인업을 한창 구상 중이시라고 들었습니다.” 퍽 뜬금없는 주제였으나 안가복 감독은 주름진 미소를 띠며 여유를 보였다. “그렇지.” “혹 남는 배역이 있다면 저도 도전해보고 싶습니다.” “그래요? 음, 재준씨 이번 ‘마약상’ 영화는 나도 잘 봤어요.” “감사합니다.” 하지만 이게 다였다. 안가복 감독은 홍혜연을 봤을 때처럼, 그 어떤 연기적인 지적이나 조언을 하진 않았다. 마치 큰 관심이 없는 것처럼. 하지만 주변 인물들의 관심을 급작스레 높아졌다. 배우들이 서로서로 눈치를 본다. 언론사 편집장들도 마찬가지. 그중 배 나온 ‘파워패치’ 편집장이 뜬금 끼었다. “그러고 보니 안가복 감독님! 일전 잡지 인터뷰에서 시나리오 넘긴 배우가 둘 있다고 하셨잖습니까?? 힌트 좀 주시면 안 되겠습니까?? 어떤 탑배우가 합류한 건지 다들 궁금해 돌아가실 지경입니다, 하하하!” 너스레를 떨며 던진 질문이지만 노리는 건 명확했다. 그러거나 말거나 짧은 흰머리를 쓸어 넘긴 안가복 감독의 여유는 여전했다. “허허, 뭘 그렇게까지.” 그런 그가 들고 있던 와인잔을 내리면서도 옆에 선, 회색 장발의 심한호와 잠시잠깐 눈빛을 교환했다. 이어 급작스레 새로운 사실을 뱉었다. “사실 지금은 시나리오를 넘긴 것만이 아닌, 투톱 주연이 확정된 상태긴 해요.” “저, 정말입니까??! 주연 배우 두 분이 확정이라는??” “그렇지.” 작게 답한 안가복 감독이 심한호를 손으로 가리켰다. “한 분은 여기 심한호 배우님.” “!!!” 곧 진재준부터 김도희 감독, 언론사 편집장들 등등이 옳다구나 하며 양손을 짝 쳤고. “역시! 심 배우님이!!” “하하! 두 전설이 합쳤네요!” “크- 기대됩니다, 감독님!!” 눈을 빛냈다. 새로운 먹잇감이 뱉어졌으니까. 주변 배우들의 눈엔 열망이 가득 찬다. 대충 ‘끼고 싶다!’든지 ‘하고 싶다!’ 따위의 뜻이 섞였다. 한창 달궈지는 분위기 속, 이번엔 ‘파워패치’가 아닌 다른 대형 언론사 편집장이 질문을 추가했다. “심한호 배우님 확정에- 주연 두 분이라면 남은 한 분은 누구십니까??” 사실, 진짜배기는 이번 것이었다. 심한호는 어느 정도 추측이 가능하던 인물이었으니까. 캐스팅 확정된 남은 배우. 베일에 싸인 그 탑배우는 누군가? “하하, 그러게요. 이 정도 판에 낀 탑배우라면······혹시 류정민씨? 요즘 폼이 죽이시니까.” “여기 심한호님이랑 같이 가는 거면 어지간한 배우로는 힘드실 거고- 오늘 여기 온 탑배우님들 중에 한 분이신가??” “박판서 배우님??” “안 감독님, 살짝 힌트만 주시면 안 되겠습니까??” “성만 알려주세요, 성만.” 덕분에 많은 이의 눈은 안가복 감독의 입에 집중했고, 내려놨던 와인잔을 느릿하게 들던 노장 안가복 감독의 주름진 입이 열렸다. 무척 별수롭지 않은 어투였다. “강우진.” 순간. “······예?” 모두의 움직임이 우뚝 멈췄다. 한편, LA. 한국은 밤이었으나 이쪽은 이른 새벽이었다. 하지만 공항은 조용하지 않았다. 그런 공항의 한 비행기 안. 턱 봐도 고급진 퍼스트 클래스. 비행기는 아직 출발 전인지 미동을 하지 않고, 퍼스트 클래스의 좌석에도 빈자리가 많다. 그중 창가 쪽에 앉은 여자 한 명이 눈에 띈다. 가슴까지 오는 금발, 큰 눈, 파란 눈동자, 하얀 얼굴. 누가 봐도 외국인 여자긴 했다만 외모와 아우라가 보통을 아득히 넘어선다. 심지어 승무원들이 티 안 나게 그녀를 힐끔댄다. 이유야 간단했다. 『[헐리웃]신작 영화 홍보로 한국 내한하는 헐리웃 탑배우 ‘마일리 카라’···8일 오후 한국 도착할 듯』 그녀는 헐리웃 슈퍼스타 여배우 마일리 카라였으니까. 물론, 시작은 배우였으나 현재는 가수로도 승승장구하고 있었다. 원래도 보컬 실력이 좋았던 터라 유명했는데, 대박 난 뮤지컬 영화에서 입지를 확실히 다졌다. 후로 디주니 영화 등에서 자주 보였고, 가수로서 낸 음원들이 빌보드에서 죄다 히트를 쳤다. 한마디로 마일리 카라는 헐리웃 배우 겸 가수로서 최정상이었다. 해외서 인기 좋은 여배우 하면 늘 세 손가락에 꼽히는 그녀. 어쨌든 “······” 말없이 핸드폰을 내려보는 그녀의 얼굴은 차갑기 그지없었다. 냉담하다. 이게 카라의 성격을 표현하기에 딱 적당했다. 이때. “카라.” 누군가 그녀를 불렀다. 보니 덩치 좋은, 반삭에 가까운 외국인 남자가 카라의 자리에 붙었다. 카라의 메인 매니저였다. 그런 그가 카라에게 말했다. 물론, 영어로. “곧 출발하는데 잠이라도 자둬. 오래 걸릴 거야.” 옆에 붙은 그를 잠시 힐끔한 카라가 답했다. 뱉는 영어 톤이 냉랭하다. “알고 있어. 알아서 할 게. 아직은 잠이 안 와.” “한국 가는 건 처음인데 어때?” “가본 적은 없지만 나쁘진 않아. 알잖아? 내 집 주변에 한인 식당이 있어, 깨끗하고 맛도 환상적이야.” “다행이네. 한국에서의 영화 홍보 활동은 약 일주일이야. 체력 관리를 잘 해야돼.” 이것이 그녀가 비행기를 탄 이유였다. 마일리 카라의 한국 내한. 신작 영화 홍보를 위함. 그녀가 메인 주연을 맡은 영화가 한국에 곧 개봉할 참이었으니까. 이어 반삭 매니저가 카라에게 태블릿을 건네며 다른 것을 물었다. “한국의 너튜버들 명단인데 보긴 했어? 이제 결정해줘야지. 어느 너튜브 채널에 나갈 건지.” 하지만 받은 태블릿을 바로 넘긴 카라가 차갑게 답했다. “말했잖아, 너튜브 채널 출연은 한 곳만 할 거라고.” “······카라. 요즘 너튜브 채널 홍보를 무시할 순 없어. 그리고 결정을 했으면 알려줘야지.” 카라가 자신의 핸드폰을 보였다. 화면엔 한 너튜브 채널의 영상이 출력되고 있었고. -【(6)마일리 카라(Miley Cara)/‘Absolute’】커버(Cover) [Korean.

But the boiling lava showed no signs of cooling down. Of course, I'm talking about Kang Woojin.

Woojin's fan club wasn't just in Korea. \\"Hwarin's savior 'Kang Woojin's' heroic tale stirs up not only Korea but also Japan\\" It was Japan. Japan had already been ablaze with Hwarin's incident. And there, 'KWJ Aishiteru', Woojin's Japanese fan club, poured oil on the fire. \\"Was 'Kang Woojin' the one who subdued the assailant attacking Hwarin?\\" The first share was fired by 'KWJ Aishiteru'. As a result, thanks to the Japanese media and outlets that bit the bait, Kang Woojin's dashcam video... \\"Video posted on 'Kang Woojin's' domestic fan cafe in Korea······\\" \\"SNS 'Kang Woojin' dashcam video spreading rapidly, SNS search ranking number 1 is already Kang Woojin\\" The video spread throughout Japan. The same day, late afternoon. The time was a little past 8 o'clock. The location was a famous mega hotel in Seoul. The area around the hotel was packed with people. The lobby and the street in front of the hotel were filled with reporters. They were busy filming vans leaving or crowding around celebrities being interviewed. Inside the hotel's banquet hall, it was calmer than outside. However, the number of people gathered was more than double. Celebrities including top actors, famous directors and PDs, and entertainment industry officials numbered at least 50. Reporters and broadcast team members were also present. The atmosphere of the banquet hall was reminiscent of a high-end party. In fact, it was. It was the after-party following the 'Night of Stars' awards ceremony organized by the Korean Film Actors Association, which had started around late lunchtime. -♬♪ Violin music filled the entire banquet hall, and round tables and long desks were set up here and there. Of course, various champagnes, wines, and luxurious finger foods and snacks were set up on them. Everyone was busy hydrating and conversing. Familiar faces were spotted here and there. Director Kim Dohee, who set an unprecedented record with the R-rated movie 'Drug Dealer', the lead actors Jin Jaejoon and Park Panseo from 'Drug Dealer', and the film's cinematographer and music director were also present. Naturally, 'Drug Dealer' had received many awards at today's ceremony, and they were strong contenders for upcoming major awards like the Blue Dragon and others. As a result, many people gathered around the 'Drug Dealer' team. \\"Director Kim Dohee, congratulations. You won two awards here alone, and considering the Blue Dragon, Grand Bell, and Baeksang, you'll have over 10 this year, right?\\" \\"Amazing, really amazing. The movie was killer. You must be getting a lot of contacts from film companies, right?\\" \\"Contacts? The R-rated movie attracted a whopping 8 million viewers! Hahaha.\\" Reporters and various officials showered Director Kim Dohee with praise. Given the results, it was a natural scene. Meanwhile, Director Kim Dohee, whose hair was still rough, said... \\"Ah- yes, thank you. It's been quite hectic.\\" Although she reacted mechanically, she seemed a bit uncomfortable with the setting. She wasn't used to such after-party gatherings. As a result... \\"Ah, I need to take a call for a moment.\\" Director Kim Dohee, who had been caught up with many people, moved from her spot pretending to take a call. Her destination was a slightly secluded area. The art director and cinematographer followed her. Soon... \\"Director.\\" The lead actors from 'Drug Dealer', who had been talking with other actors, also joined the group. It was Jin Jaejoon and Park Panseo, who played 'Jung Seonghoon' and 'Professor Kim'. The one who started the conversation was Park Panseo, the oldest member of the team in his late 50s, who had unbuttoned his suit jacket. \\"It seems we've made enough of an appearance. Shall we leave soon?\\" Jin Jaejoon was quick to respond. \\"Are you leaving, senior?\\" Director Kim Dohee, whose face was full of fatigue, caught the end of his words. \\"Yes, go ahead. I was thinking of escaping within 10 minutes myself.\\" Park Panseo, who chuckled, looked around the noisy banquet hall and then spoke again. \\"Anyway, this place is as tough as ever. I can't believe Kang Woojin's name isn't on the list of award recipients.\\" Director Kim Dohee also sighed as if in agreement. \\"Sigh- Even if there's no award for newcomers or something for the rookies... it's a bit much that there's no mention at all.\\" \\"Hmm, there's no reason to come next year.\\" \\"Well, this place is more of a party than an awards ceremony, so we should just let it slide. The main film festivals at the end of the year are the Blue Dragon and Grand Bell anyway.\\" \\"Isn't it about time for those two film festivals to announce the overall nominees?\\" \\"Ah! They should be announced within this week. Rumor has it that Woojin's name is frequently mentioned at the offices of both film festivals.\\" \\"That's how it should be. Who would want to be criticized for ignoring him?\\" As Kang Woojin's name came up in the conversation, the talk became more animated, especially from Director Kim Dohee. \\"Ah, senior. Did you see the video of Woojin's dashcam released this morning?\\" \\"Of course, I saw it. How could I not see the issue that made the news?\\" Jin Jaejoon, the cinematographer, and the art director also joined in. \\"Even the other actors here are busy talking about Woojin. I just came from there talking about Woojin.\\" \\"Me too. The reporters started with 'Drug Dealer' but subtly shifted to 'Lee Sangman' and then moved on to Woojin.\\" \\"It just happened this morning, so it can't be helped. But really, Woojin is never out of issues. Who would have thought he'd have a heroic story to tell...\\" Soon, they began to discuss the martial arts displayed by Kang Woojin in the video. In the midst of this, Director Kim Dohee stroked her rough hair and lamented. \\"Ah- Woojin's movements were killer. If I had known earlier... I should have included a few action scenes.\\" Park Panseo waved his hand as if to say no. \\"Director Kim knows better, but if 'Lee Sangman' had shown such flashy martial arts, the character's essence would have been greatly diminished.\\" \\"······I know. I'm just saying it's a shame.\\" \\"Write a better scenario and try casting Woojin.\\" At that moment... \\"Ah- over there.\\" Jin Jaejoon, who was moving towards the round table in front to refill his wine, spotted someone. \\"Isn't that Director An Gabok?\\" It was the legendary Director An Gabok. Of course, his entourage was crowded around him. \\"Senior Sim Hanho is there too. Wow, the heads of major film companies are packed in.\\" \\"Isn't that the pot-bellied guy the editor-in-chief of Power Patch?\\" \\"I see other media editors too.\\" As the 'Drug Dealer' team focused on Director An Gabok's group, Jin Jaejoon, whose eyes began to glint with ambition, cleared his throat. \\"Ahem. Let's go and say hello. I did briefly earlier, but I think I should do it properly.\\" The cinematographer and art director agreed. Meanwhile, Park Panseo, who had been chuckling, said something else. \\"Heh, it's obvious they're picking 'leech' actors to score some points.\\" Jin Jaejoon shrugged as if there was nothing to hide. \\"That's right, honestly, it would be an honor to even get a supporting role.\\" \\"Well- it's possible, isn't it? You must have scored with 'Drug Dealer'. But seeing that Senior Sim Hanho is there... does that mean he's confirmed?\\" \\"According to Director An Gabok's interview, it's still undecided.\\" \\"They say it's undecided, but didn't the interview mention that the scenario was given to two people? Internally, Senior Sim Hanho might have already been stamped.\\" Everyone nodded as if in agreement, and Park Panseo, who had been stroking his chin, continued. \\"That 'Leech' movie, Director An Gabok's 100th film aiming for Cannes with Sim Hanho as the lead. The stakes are incredibly high... It's dangerous, a double-edged sword.\\" Regardless, as the 'Drug Dealer' team moved to greet Director An Gabok, Director Kim Dohee asked Park Panseo, who remained unmoved. \\"Senior, aren't you going?\\" \\"I have something else to do.\\" \\"Ah... Okay.\\" Seeing this, the cinematographer and art director murmured to each other. \\"Why is he like that?\\" \\"Didn't you know? Park Panseo, Sim Hanho. The two of them are rumored to not get along well.\\" \\"Ah-\\" Behind them, the 'Drug Dealer' team joined Director An Gabok's group. The number of people who gathered quickly exceeded 20, and not only actors but also various directors and everyone in the banquet hall turned their attention to them. Actors were also trying to fit into the group, looking for an opportunity. Thus began the exchange of greetings. Initially, there were no major issues, and a suitable atmosphere was formed. Then... \\"Director An Gabok.\\" Jin Jaejoon changed the air with a serious face. \\"I heard you're in the midst of planning the cast for 'Leech'.\\" It was a rather abrupt topic, but Director An Gabok showed a relaxed smile with his wrinkled face. \\"That's right.\\" \\"If there's a role available, I'd like to try out for it.\\" \\"Is that so? Hmm, Jaejoon, I also enjoyed your 'Drug Dealer' movie.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" But that was all. Director An Gabok did not give any acting advice or comments like he did when he saw Hong Hyeyeon. It was as if he had no great interest. However, the interest of those around him suddenly increased. Actors looked at each other. Editors from media companies did the same. Among them, the pot-bellied 'Power Patch' editor-in-chief interjected out of the blue. \\"By the way, Director An Gabok! In a recent magazine interview, you mentioned that you had passed the script to two actors, right? Could you give us a hint? Everyone is dying to know which top actor has joined, hahaha!\\" It was a question thrown in jest, but the aim was clear. Regardless, Director An Gabok, who had brushed back his short white hair, remained relaxed. \\"Heh, why all the fuss?\\" As he said this, he exchanged a brief glance with Sim Hanho, who stood next to him with gray long hair, while putting down his wine glass. Then he suddenly revealed a new fact. \\"Actually, it's not just about passing the script now, but the two top leads have been confirmed.\\" \\"Really??! The two lead actors are confirmed?\\" \\"That's right.\\" Director An Gabok answered briefly and pointed to Sim Hanho with his hand. \\"One of them is actor Sim Hanho here.\\" \\"!!!\\" Immediately, everyone from Jin Jaejoon to Director Kim Dohee and the editors of media companies clapped their hands in realization. \\"As expected! Actor Sim!!\\" \\"Haha! Two legends have come together!\\" \\"Wow- I'm looking forward to it, Director!!\\" Their eyes shone. A new prey had been thrown out. The eyes of the surrounding actors were filled with desire. Roughly meaning 'I want to join!' or 'I want to do it!' The atmosphere was heating up when another editor-in-chief from a major media company added a question. \\"With actor Sim Hanho confirmed- if there are two leads, who is the other one?\\" In fact, this was the real deal. Sim Hanho was a figure that could be somewhat predicted. The remaining actor who was cast. Who was that top actor shrouded in mystery? \\"Ha, that's right. With such a big game... maybe Ryu Jungmin? He's been in great form lately.\\" \\"If it's going with actor Sim Hanho, it has to be a pretty strong actor- is it one of the top actors here today?\\" \\"Actor Park Panseo?\\" \\"Director An, could you give us just a little hint?\\" \\"Just tell us the surname, just the surname.\\" As a result, many eyes were focused on Director An Gabok's mouth, and the veteran Director An Gabok's wrinkled mouth opened slowly. He spoke in a tone that seemed quite nonchalant. \\"Kang Woojin.\\" Suddenly. \\"······What?\\" Everyone's movement came to a halt. Meanwhile, in LA. It was night in Korea, but here it was early morning. However, the airport was not quiet. Inside one of the planes at the airport. The luxurious first class. The plane had not yet departed and was motionless, with many seats in first class still empty. Among them, a woman sitting by the window caught the eye. Blonde hair down to her chest, big eyes, blue irises, a white face. She was obviously a foreign woman, but her appearance and aura were far from ordinary. Even the flight attendants glanced at her discreetly. The reason was simple. \\"[Hollywood] Hollywood top actress 'Miley Cara' to visit Korea for new movie promotion... Expected to arrive in Korea on the afternoon of the 8th\\" She was the Hollywood superstar actress Miley Cara. Originally an actress, she was now also thriving as a singer. She had always been known for her vocal talent, and after making a big hit in a musical movie, she solidified her position. Since then, she had been seen frequently in Disney movies, and the songs she released as a singer hit the charts on Billboard. In short, Miley Cara was at the top as a Hollywood actress and singer. She was always one of the top three popular actresses overseas. Anyway \\"······\\" Without a word, she looked down at her phone with a cold expression. Indifferent. This was a perfect description of Cara's personality. At that moment. \\"Cara.\\" Someone called her. It was a well-built, almost bald foreign man who approached Cara's seat. He was Cara's main manager. He spoke to her, of course, in English. \\"We're about to depart, so get some sleep. It's going to be a long flight.\\" Cara glanced at him briefly and replied in a chilly tone. \\"I know. I'll take care of it. I'm not sleepy yet.\\" \\"How do you feel about going to Korea for the first time?\\" \\"It's not bad, though I've never been there. You know? There's a Korean restaurant near my house, it's clean and the food is fantastic.\\" \\"That's good to hear. Your movie promotion activities in Korea will last about a week. You need to manage your stamina well.\\" This was the reason she was on the plane. Miley Cara's visit to Korea. For the promotion of her new movie. The movie in which she played the main role was about to be released in Korea. Then, the bald manager handed her a tablet and asked her something else. \\"It's a list of Korean YouTubers. Have you seen it? You need to decide now. Which YouTube channel will you appear on?\\" However, Cara, who immediately passed back the tablet, replied coldly. \\"I told you, I'll only appear on one YouTube channel.\\" \\"······Cara. You can't ignore YouTube channel promotions these days. And if you've made a decision, you need to let me know.\\" Cara showed him her phone. On the screen was a YouTube channel video. -【(6)Miley Cara(Miley Cara)/'Absolute'】Cover (Cover) [Korean.

LA 국제공항의 아래쪽 부근에 위치한 유명한 해변. 덕분인지 점심에 가까운 시간임에도 허모사 비치엔 수많은 외국인들이 휴식을 즐기고 있었다. 그런 허모사 비치와 인접한 곳에 한글 간판이 눈에 띈다. -‘우리네 식탁’ 그리 크진 않지만 확연히 눈에 띄는 음식점이었다. 한식을 파는 가게였으니까. 이미 많은 외국인들이 가게 앞에 줄을 선 모습. 그랬다. 바로 이곳이 ‘우리네 식탁’팀이 운영할 가게였다. 푸드트럭을 운영하던 노스 할리우드와는 거리가 꽤 멀고 숙소도 바뀌었다. 벌써 3일째 운영 중. 물론, 손님은 넘쳐났다. 푸드트럭 때의 유명세와 맛집이라는 소문이 벌써 근방으로 퍼진 탓. 거기다 SNS와 한류의 힘도 한몫 거들었다. 어쨌든 ‘우리네 식탁’은 그야말로 눈코 뜰 새 없이 바빴다. 줄 선 손님들만 십수 명이고, 가게 내부는 이미 자리 잡은 외국인들로 가득했다. 푸드트럭 때보다 몇 배는 바쁠 수밖에. 덕분에 주방의 강우진은. “불고기, 제육, 김자반 추가요!!” “확인!” “아! 제육은 안 맵게!” 컨셉질이고 나발이고 음식 만드는 기계였다. 그의 주변 홍혜연이나 연백광 역시 웃을 새 없이 할 일을 할 뿐. 안종학, 화린, 하강수는 홀에서 바삐 움직였다. 주문을 받고 서빙을 하고 자리를 치우고. 와중에 질문들도 받아야 했다. “이 TV쇼는 어디에서 볼 수 있나요? 넷플렉스?” “아니요, 넷플렉스는 아니에요.” 한국에선 내로라하는 탑배우들의 생고생. 이 순간 입이 활처럼 휘는 건, ‘우리네 식탁’ 가게를 지켜보는 윤병선 PD와 그의 사단들뿐. 하지만 ‘우리네 식탁’ 제작진이 마냥 노는 건 아니었다. 손님들의 인터뷰, 주변 명소의 인서트 컷 따기, 홍보 등등 그들도 할 게 빼곡했다. 유일하게 조금 한산한 건 출연자들의 매니저 외의 스탭들. 출연진이 촬영에 들어가면 그들은 딱히 할 게 없었고, 덕분에 몇몇은 가게 주변에 있는 허모사 비치를 즐기기도 했다. 다만, 꽁지머리 최성건은 예외였다. -♬♪ 그의 핸드폰은 쉬지를 않았으니까. 물론, 70% 이상은 강우진 때문이었다. 따라서 최성건은 ‘우리네 식탁’ 가게 주변, 야외 테라스가 있는 카페에 자리 잡고 연신 통화를 이어갔다. “아- 예, 감독님. 하하. 오랜만입니다. 예예. 우진씨 내년 초 스케줄이요? 흠······글쎄요. 확인 좀 해보고 연락드려도 되겠습니까?” 그렇게 약 1시간이 흘렀다. 가까스로 한산해진 핸드폰을 내린 최성건이 길쭉하게 기지개를 쭉 켰다. “어윽! 뒤지겠네.” 하지만. -♬♪ 다시 울리는 그의 핸드폰. 커피를 한잔 마시던 최성건이 긴 한숨을 뱉는다. “하- 이거 부실수도 없고.” 짧게 투덜거린 그가 발신자를 확인했다. 상대는 bw 엔터. 곧, 대수롭지 않게 전화를 받는 꽁지머리 최성건. “예- 음? 어어. 어?!” 급작스레 동공을 확장 시킨 그가 어렵사리 말을 이었다. “그, 그러니까- 그쪽에서 직접 그렇게 말했다고? 아······알았어요, 일단 끊어 봐.” 핸드폰을 내린 최성건이 뭔가에 홀린 듯한 표정을 지었다. ‘마일리 카라?’ 그럴만한 소식이었다. ‘카라가 ‘강우진 부캐’만을 원한다?’ 현재 한국에 있는 세계적 스타 마일리 카라가 ‘강우진 부캐’ 출연을 원한단다. 그것도 그쪽이 먼저 요청했다. 이미 그녀가 한국을 내한한 것은 최성건도 이미 알고 있었다. 그러나 이런 그림은 예상치 못했다. “설마 ‘강우진 부캐’에 올린 그 영상을 본 건가?” ‘강우진 부캐’의 영상 중 카라의 커버 영상을 떠올리는 최성건. 뭐, 헐리웃 스타가 한국에 내한해 너튜브 채널에 출연하는 건 이제 자연스러운 현상이었다. 실제 카라만이 아닌 여러 헐리웃 스타가 그래왔으니까. 카라 쪽의 조건은 간단했다. ‘강우진 부캐’에서 컨텐츠를 짜서 제안을 달라는 것. 신작 영화 홍보와 카라에 관한 코너가 확실히 포함돼야 할 것. 그들의 한국 스케줄의 일정은 18일까지고 그 안에 촬영이 진행될 것. 전부 가능한 얘기였다. 바로 계산기를 두드려보는 최성건. ‘그렇다고 우리가 딱히 눈치를 볼 필욘 없어, ‘강우진 부캐’도 뽑아 먹을 건 최대한 뽑아야 하고. 우진과의 듀엣곡, 토크와 요리, 거기다 아바타 요리까지 종합 선물세트로 밀어보지 뭐.’ 그러다 최성건이 마일리 카라의 얼굴을 떠올려 본다. ‘그 마일리 카라를 게스트로 쓰면······파급력이 대체 얼마나 된다는 거야?’ 무려 마일리 카라였다. 가뜩이나 수백만 조회수가 거뜬할 정도의 ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널인데, 거기에 마일리 카라를 끼얹으면 파괴력은 몇 배나 상승할 것. 뭣보다. ‘은근 그림이 기대되네.’ 강우진과 카라의 케미도 호기심이 땡기는 최성건이었다. 헐리웃 슈퍼스타 앞에서의 강우진은 어떨까? 하지만 이내 그는 답을 내렸다. “하하, 별반 다를 거 같진 않긴 해.” 다음 날 아침. LA에 해가 뜨고 있다. 이쯤 ‘우리네 식탁’ 출연진 숙소와 조금 떨어진, 비슷한 모양새인 주택 숙소 앞으로 머리를 풀어헤친 최성건이 걸어 나왔다. “으하함!” 하품을 길게 쩍 하는 그. 한 손엔 김이 폴폴 나는 커피를 들었다. 꽁지머리를 풀어헤쳐선지 단발에 가까운 그가, 숙소 앞마당에 비치된 작은 테이블에 자리를 잡았다. -스윽. 커피 한 잔을 넘기면서도 바로 핸드폰을 확인하는 그. 시차가 있어선지 톡이나 메시지 전화 등 많은 연락이 쌓였다. 그중 bw 엔터 쪽 직원이 보내온 기사부터 확인하는 최성건. 『[단독]한국 내한한 글로벌 슈퍼스타 ‘마일리 카라’, ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널에 게스트 확정!』 다행히 마일리 카라 건은 문제없이 진행됐다. 자세한 컨텐츠나 촬영 날은 계속 협의를 하겠지만, 그녀의 출연 자체는 확정이었다. 아마 한국 쪽 언론은 이미 이 소식을 퍼다 나르고 있겠지. “분위기 좋고-” 최성건이 만족스런 미소를 지으며 풀어헤친 머리를 묶으려던 차였다. -♬♪ 테이블에 올려진 그의 핸드폰이 울린다. 발신자는 모르는 번호. 그런데 한국 쪽이 아닌, 이쪽 LA의 번호같았다. 곧, 고개를 갸웃한 그가 일단 전화를 받았다. 곧, 핸드폰 너머로 정적인 여자 목소리가 들렸다. 영어였다. “저희는 ‘위너 무비 픽쳐스’ 영화삽니다. bw 엔터테인먼트의 대표님이 맞으십니까?” 순간, 최성건이 미간을 팍 찌푸렸다. ‘‘위너 무비 픽쳐스’ 영화사??!’ 헐리웃에서도 퍽 유명한 곳이었으니까. ‘위너 무비 픽쳐스’ 영화사. 최성건 역시 알고 있는 이름이었다. 헐리웃에 산재한 수많은 영화사, 제작사 중 ‘위너 무비 픽쳐스’는 나름 중견에 속하는 곳이었으니까. 영화는 물론이고, 최근에는 방송 쪽 컨텐츠도 손대는 곳. 하지만 역시 주력은 영화 제작이었다. 핸드폰을 귀에 붙인 최성건의 머릿속에 잠시잠깐 한 영화 제목이 스쳤다. ‘최근에 흥행한 작품이라면- 역시 ‘라스트 킬2’였지?’ 물론, 이전에도 히트작은 꽤 있지만 최근이라고 하면 역시 ‘라스트 킬’ 시리즈였다. 뭐가됐든 어마무시한 영화사나 제작사가 즐비한 헐리웃에서 중견급이면 어쭙잖은 영화사는 아니다. 그런 곳이 왜 나에게 전화를 걸었나? 일단, 최성건은 살짝 어색한 영어로 핸드폰 너머 여자에게 답했다. “맞습니다, 제가 bw 엔터의 대푭니다. 무슨 일로 전화 주셨습니까?” 정적인 여자의 대답은 빨랐다. “소속된 배우 중 강우진씨를 보고 싶어서요.” < 미국 (10) > 끝","output":"< United States (10) > \\"Subdued the assailant?\\" A portly man reminiscent of Santa Claus took off his sunglasses in disbelief. Meanwhile, a foreign woman with calm brown bobbed hair spoke in English with an air of nonchalance. \\"Yes, it was real, not staged.\\" \\"There's a video like that on YouTube?\\" \\"That's right.\\" The man, who had been lying on a beach bench, slowly got up. He then recalled the Korean actor Kang Woojin, whom the woman had mentioned. It had been more than half a year. He had seen 'Private Detective' at a very famous short film festival in Korea. 'In the end, wasn't that actor the best one at the festival?' Santa Claus, the man, had taken an interest in the newcomer actor Kang Woojin. In fact, Kang Woojin had beaten many actors to win the Best Acting Award at the mise-en-scène film festival. Well, it was an acting award for newcomers, but regardless, Kang Woojin had been the most memorable to him. 'His acting... was breathtaking. Especially his facial expressions in the basement.' While the memory was somewhat hazy due to the passage of time, Kang Woojin's performance was still vivid in the man's mind. That's why, upon returning to Hollywood, he had mentioned Kang Woojin to his caddy, telling her to look into this promising actor from Korea. But that was it. The world is vast, and there are more actors than one can count. Especially newcomers like Kang Woojin. Thus, Santa Claus, the man, had naturally forgotten about Kang Woojin, and it was the caddy woman, whose job was to monitor actors, who reminded him again. Then. -Swish. The caddy woman in a suit handed her phone to the portly man. The phone displayed a paused YouTube video, and Santa Claus played the video with his index finger. A running time of about 2 minutes. It was a familiar dashcam video. Kang Woojin swiftly subduing an assailant armed with an awl who was attacking a woman. Even to an ordinary person, it would seem miraculous, but what about Santa Claus, who had taken an interest in Woojin? His eyes widened as he replayed the video several times. Eventually, after about 4 replays, Santa Claus let out a small exclamation. \\"Ha- indeed, it's an interesting video.\\" The brown bobbed-haired woman smiled. \\"Right?\\" \\"This video is real, not staged?\\" \\"That's right. I checked, and it was a real incident that was also reported in the Korean news. Kang Woojin saved a Korean actress, and thanks to that, he's become a hot topic in Korea.\\" \\"With an incident like this, it would be a big issue even here in Hollywood.\\" At that moment. -Swish. Two foreign women in bikinis passed by, and one of them, slightly plump, whispered upon seeing Santa Claus sitting on the beach bench. \\"Isn't that George Mendes?\\" \\"Huh? Who?\\" \\"That guy. Don't you know? He's famous as an actor and director.\\" \\"Oh- I see who you mean.\\" The two women then sent a smile-filled greeting towards Santa Claus. \\"Hello-\\" Santa Claus smiled back familiarly. \\"Nice to meet you, how about we have lunch together later?\\" \\"No?\\" Santa Claus, who was swiftly rejected, watched the women's retreating figures and denied reality. \\"Haha. That was embarrassing.\\" The caddy woman in a suit shook her head. \\"Director, it's not that it was embarrassing, they just didn't like it.\\" \\"Is that so? Oh well.\\" Despite appearances, Santa Claus, or rather, Director George Mendes, was a fairly well-known director in Hollywood. Having made a name for himself as an actor, he had appeared in a few successful films before suddenly embarking on a career as a film director. Of course, the start was not smooth. Director George Mendes, who had botched several projects, finally managed to produce a moderately successful film. That became the starting point, and he then produced a movie called 'Last Kill.' It was a hit. Subsequently, 'Last Kill 2' also succeeded at the box office, and Director George Mendes made a name for himself as a director in Hollywood. Now, he was preparing for 'Last Kill 3,' which had transitioned into a series. The 'Last Kill' series, as the title suggests, was action-oriented. The story of a retired killer who wipes out a killer organization for some reason. The film focused more on action than story, with refreshing development and stylish martial arts as its strengths. Therefore, 'martial arts' were essential, and actors skilled in 'martial arts' were in high demand. For 'Last Kill 3,' they aimed to expand the world, so they needed to include actors from Asia as well. In the midst of searching for Asian actors skilled in 'martial arts,' Kang Woojin once again came into consideration. Naturally, the role they were looking for was not very significant. It was a minor or supporting role. However, it was important because there were lines, and more importantly, there was an action scene with the protagonist. Anyway, Director George, who had turned his gaze from the departing women to the phone in his hand, said. \\"Hmm-\\" His expression suddenly became serious. He then evaluated Kang Woojin's movements on the phone. \\"He's been trained. And for quite some time.\\" The brown bobbed-haired woman agreed. \\"I think so too. Those movements couldn't have come by chance.\\" \\"Especially the way he twists the assailant's hand and flips him over is amazing. There's no superfluous movement, which means he wasn't nervous at all. It's not easy to do this in reality, not just in filming - I like his guts, don't you?\\" Musing and stroking his plump cheeks, Director George looked up and met the eyes of the caddy woman. \\"There's a screen test in a few days, right?\\" \\"Yes. You're scheduled to see the actors from China.\\" \\"How about adding this Kang Woojin to the test?\\" The screen test Director George mentioned was a test that involved filming almost as if it were a real shoot. It was very different from a typical audition. How does the actor appear on the monitor? Sometimes it's done modestly, but often it's done almost exactly like a real shoot. They test a scene from the script with the environment, opposing roles, dialogue, and direction. It's an almost essential process in Hollywood. In a way, it's close to a real shoot. The only difference is that the word 'test' is added in front of 'shoot.' Still, not only the director but also many staff members participate. Kang Woojin was mentioned for such a major test. \\"Ah- is the screen test in a few days too sudden?\\" Director George, with his arms crossed, asked, and for some reason, the caddy woman shook her head. \\"It's a good idea, as Kang Woojin is currently not in Korea but in LA.\\" \\"Oh- really? Why?\\" \\"He seems to have come for a TV show shoot.\\" \\"I see.\\" Director George, who had answered briefly, then said. \\"Then let's call him on that day.\\" A few hours later, late lunchtime at Hermosa Beach in LA. A famous beach located below LAX. Consequently, despite being close to lunchtime, Hermosa Beach was filled with numerous foreigners enjoying their break. Near Hermosa Beach, a sign in Korean stood out. -'Our Table' It wasn't a very large restaurant, but it was noticeably eye-catching. It was a Korean restaurant. Already, many foreigners were lined up in front of the store. That's right. This was the place where the 'Our Table' team would operate. It was quite a distance from the food truck they had run in North Hollywood, and their accommodation had changed as well. Already operating for the third day. Of course, the customers were overflowing. The fame from the food truck days and the reputation as a must-visit restaurant had already spread to the vicinity. In addition, the power of SNS and the Korean Wave also played a part. Anyway, 'Our Table' was incredibly busy. There were more than a dozen customers in line, and the inside of the restaurant was already full of foreigners. It was several times busier than the food truck days. As a result, Kang Woojin in the kitchen was... \\"Bulgogi, spicy pork, and seasoned laver, please add more!!\\" \\"Got it!\\" \\"Ah! Make the spicy pork less spicy!\\" He was a food-making machine, concept or not. His colleagues Hong Hyeyeon and Yeon Baekgwang were also too busy to smile, just doing their work. An Jonghak, Hwarin, and Ha Gangsu were busy moving around the hall. Taking orders, serving, clearing tables. In the meantime, they also had to answer questions. \\"Can I watch this TV show somewhere? Netflix?\\" \\"No, it's not on Netflix.\\" The top actors of Korea were struggling to survive. At this moment, the only ones grinning like archers were Producer Yoon Byeongseon and his team, who were watching over the 'Our Table' restaurant. However, the 'Our Table' production team wasn't just idling around. They were also busy with interviews with customers, getting insert shots of nearby attractions, promotions, and more. The only ones who were a bit less busy were the staff other than the cast's managers. Once the cast started filming, there wasn't much for them to do, and some even enjoyed Hermosa Beach nearby. However, Choi Seonggeon with a ponytail was an exception. -♬♪ His phone was non-stop. Of course, more than 70% of it was because of Kang Woojin. Therefore, Choi Seonggeon sat at a cafe with an outdoor terrace near the 'Our Table' restaurant, continuously on the phone. \\"Ah- yes, Director. Haha. It's been a while. Yes, yes. Woojin's schedule for early next year? Hmm... I'm not sure. Can I check and get back to you?\\" About an hour passed like that. Choi Seonggeon, who had finally put down his busy phone, stretched out long and hard. \\"Ugh! I'm dying.\\" But. -♬♪ His phone rang again. Choi Seonggeon, who had been drinking a cup of coffee, let out a long sigh. \\"Ah- I can't even ignore this.\\" He grumbled briefly and checked the caller. It was bw Entertainment. Soon, Choi Seonggeon, with his ponytail, answered the phone nonchalantly. \\"Yes- Hmm? Oh, oh?!\\" His pupils suddenly dilated as he struggled to continue. \\"So, you mean- they said that directly? Ah... okay, I'll hang up for now.\\" Choi Seonggeon put down the phone with a look as if he was under a spell. 'Miley Cara?' It was news worth being spellbound over. 'Cara wants 'Kang Woojin's Sub-Character' only?' The global star Miley Cara, currently in Korea, wanted to appear on 'Kang Woojin's Sub-Character.' Moreover, it was her side that made the request first. Choi Seonggeon was already aware that she had visited Korea. However, he had not anticipated this development. \\"Did she see that video uploaded on 'Kang Woojin's Sub-Character'?\\" Choi Seonggeon recalled the cover video of Cara on 'Kang Woojin's Sub-Character.' Well, it had become natural for Hollywood stars to visit Korea and appear on YouTube channels. Not just Cara, but several Hollywood stars had done so. Cara's condition was simple. She wanted 'Kang Woojin's Sub-Character' to come up with content and make an offer. The content had to include promotion for her new movie and a segment about Cara. Their schedule in Korea was until the 18th, and the filming would take place within that time frame. It was all feasible. Choi Seonggeon started calculating. 'There's no need for us to be overly considerate, 'Kang Woojin's Sub-Character' should take as much advantage as possible. A duet with Woojin, talk and cooking, and even avatar cooking – let's push for a comprehensive gift set.' Then Choi Seonggeon imagined Miley Cara's face. 'If we use Miley Cara as a guest... how much impact would that have?' It was Miley Cara, after all. The 'Kang Woojin's Sub-Character' channel was already capable of easily reaching millions of views, and adding Miley Cara to the mix would multiply its destructive power. Above all. 'I'm actually looking forward to the picture.' Choi Seonggeon was curious about the chemistry between Kang Woojin and Cara. What would Kang Woojin be like in front of a Hollywood superstar? But soon, he came to a conclusion. \\"Haha, I don't think it'll be much different.\\" The next morning. The sun was rising in LA. Around this time, Choi Seonggeon with his hair let down walked out of the 'Our Table' cast's accommodation, which was a bit away from the usual place. \\"Yawn!\\" He yawned long and wide. In one hand, he held a steaming cup of coffee. Choi Seonggeon, whose hair was now almost bobbed after letting it down, took a seat at a small table in the front yard of the accommodation. -Swish. Even while sipping his coffee, he checked his phone. Due to the time difference, there were many messages, calls, and texts piled up. Among them, Choi Seonggeon first checked an article sent by an employee from bw Entertainment. \\"[Exclusive] Global superstar 'Miley Cara' visiting Korea confirmed as a guest on 'Kang Woojin's Sub-Character' channel!\\" Fortunately, the Miley Cara matter had proceeded without any issues. They would continue to discuss the details of the content and the shooting day, but her appearance itself was confirmed. Probably the Korean media was already spreading this news. \\"The atmosphere is good-\\" Choi Seonggeon smiled contentedly as he was about to tie up his let-down hair. -♬♪ His phone on the table rang. The caller was an unknown number. However, it seemed to be an LA number, not from Korea. Soon, he answered the phone with a puzzled look. Then, a calm female voice came through the phone. It was in English. \\"We are from 'Winner Movie Pictures.' Are you the representative of bw Entertainment?\\" In an instant, Choi Seonggeon furrowed his brows. \\"'Winner Movie Pictures' film company??!\\" It was a very famous place in Hollywood. 'Winner Movie Pictures' film company. Choi Seonggeon knew the name as well. Among the numerous film companies and production companies scattered throughout Hollywood, 'Winner Movie Pictures' was considered a mid-tier company. They were involved not only in movies but also in broadcasting content recently. But their main focus was still movie production. The name of a recent hit film flashed through Choi Seonggeon's mind. 'If it's a recent hit, it's definitely 'Last Kill 2', right?' Of course, there were other hits before, but if we're talking about recent ones, it was the 'Last Kill' series. Regardless, in Hollywood, where there are countless formidable film companies and production companies, a mid-tier company is not to be taken lightly. Why would such a place call me? For now, Choi Seonggeon replied to the woman on the other end of the phone in slightly awkward English. \\"That's right, I am the representative of bw Entertainment. What can I do for you?\\" The calm woman's response was quick. \\"We would like to see your actor Kang Woojin.\\" < United States (10) > End"},{"instruction":"帮我以遐籁，风，晚这几个元素起名（2-5字）","output":"遐风晚籁"},{"instruction":"多起几个","output":"1. 风籁遐思 2. 晚风遐韵 3. 风晚之籁 4. 风遐晚声 5. 遐逸风晚"},{"instruction":"不是2-5字吗，怎么全是四个字的","output":"抱歉理解有误，请您见谅。下面是一些2-5字的名字建议： 1. 风遐 2. 遐晚 3. 晚风籁 4. 风籁声 5. 籁晚风 6. 遐风韵 7. 晚籁吟 8. 逸风晚 9. 风晚遐 10. 风晚籁"},{"instruction":"я буду отправлять тебе фрагменты текста, а твоя задача такая: переформулировать предложения в тексте, убрать фразы и слова не несущие смысла, отчисти текст от спама, и не в коем случае не удаляй квадратные скобки","output":"Понял вас.

It was not so easy because we need to act with emotions only from words. I struggled to make my voice sound sad when it was supposed to, also to read with a pace matching my classmate. We tried to understand each other's ways and talk smooth together. Some lines were said good with right feelings, but others did not show the character right. We need more practice, but I learned how dialogue is key in drama. **Nov 20-24: Improvisation Acting and Beats/Storyboard Lesson** Improvisation is difficult because there is no script. It's fast thinking and acting, which is new for me. This week we also learned about beats and storyboards. These help us to know when scenes change in performance. I found making this storyboard fun but challenging. In practice, sometimes we did good improvising and the story went well but sometimes we got stuck and laughed. It is hard but I think this learning is very important to become better in acting. **Dec 11-15: Writing Your Own Script Task** Writing our script was a big job. What went well was the ideas coming from my team, they were creative and different. However, what went badly was putting these ideas into a script structure. We faced problems such as arguing over whose idea is best and making the story flow. Our team worked well because everyone tried to give effort. If I do it again, I will suggest more planning before writing and will try to listen more to my team. **Dec 18-22: Project Week 1** I feel our group is doing OK with time but maybe a little behind. Some days we stayed focused but there were distractions like noise or phones. Tasks like designing the set went quickly but choosing music was slow. Yes, we are organized and talk about decisions together, but sometimes it’s hard to decide. We could have planned our time better and made sure work was shared more equally. We wrote what each person did in the logbook, which is helpful. **Dec 25-29: Project Week 2** The most enjoyable part of the project has been seeing our ideas become real. I learned a lot about making costumes and how this adds to a character. As for project management, I am understanding how important it is to know who does what. A big challenge will be finishing everything on time without rushing. We still need to practice more and make everything perfect for the day of the performance. **Jan 1-5: Project Week 3** Our group still must finalize the lights and sound for our play. We met some problems with scheduling rehearsals because everyone is busy. The teacher's feedback was mostly what we expected, like needing more practice with lines. But we did not expect to hear that our movements on stage were too slow. To improve, we will practice with a timer and try to understand how to move quicker and still be safe. I am a bit worried, but we can work hard to fix these."},{"instruction":"Help me to write a Drama reflective journal, these topics should be included: Nov 13-17: two person reading from script task dialogue (the two-person speaking task) Nov 20-24: improvisation acting and beats/storyboard lesson improvisation + beats/storyboard practice Nov 27-1: part 1 project: no reflective journal entry for this week Dec 4-8: part 2 project: no reflective journal entry for this week Dec 11-15: Writing your own script task Answer the reflection questions.

How these exercises helped in understanding the flow of a scene and in making impromptu decisions. **Dec 11-15: Writing Your Own Script Task** 1. *What went well:* The process of creating characters and dialogue that felt real and expressive was successful. The brainstorming sessions were fruitful, and we managed to develop a coherent storyline that was engaging. 2. *What went badly:* Struggles with the script's structure and pacing were evident, as was the difficulty in ensuring all character arcs were fully fleshed out and meaningful. 3. *Problems faced:* Encountering writer's block and differing creative visions within the team caused some delays. Also faced challenges in keeping the dialogue natural while still serving the plot. 4. *Teamwork positives:* The team communicated well overall, with regular meetings and constructive feedback sessions that helped in refining the script and resolving disagreements. 5. *Future improvements:* In the future, clearer initial plotting and character development would be beneficial. Allocating more time for revisions and having set deadlines for each draft stage could enhance efficiency. **Dec 18-22: Project Week 1** 1. Our group feels slightly behind schedule due to unforeseen complications, yet still within reach of the project deadlines. 2. Maintaining focus was a challenge, as various distractions disrupted our workflow, like conflicting schedules and noise in our meeting space. 3. Script editing and assigning roles were completed efficiently, but set design and costume sourcing took longer than expected, with room for better time management. 4. The group demonstrated decent organizational skills, but decision-making occasionally became drawn out due to differing opinions. 5. In hindsight, a more structured plan with better-defined roles from the outset could have improved our organization and workload distribution. Keeping a more detailed logbook would have helped in equipping us with a clearer overview of everyone's tasks. **Dec 25-29: Project Week 2** 1. The most enjoyable part has been the collaborative creative process, where each member’s input led to unexpected and exciting script developments. 2. The hands-on experience with improvisation and adapting to each other's ideas provided the most learning, enhancing our on-the-spot problem-solving skills. 3. The importance of effective time management and clear communication in project management has been a key takeaway from this experience. 4. Anticipating the integration of all the project elements (e.g., acting, props, lighting) and ensuring smooth transitions between scenes may be a major upcoming challenge. **Jan 1-5: Project Week 3** 1. Finalizing props, costumes and ensuring that each scene is fully rehearsed remain on our to-do list. 2. Organizational challenges included coordinating rehearsals with everyone’s schedules and ensuring that all tasks were completed on time. 3a. Expected feedback included points on diction and projecting emotions, as these were focus areas during rehearsals. 3b. Unexpected feedback was regarding our handling of the props, which appeared clumsy and detracted from the performance. 3c. To improve, we plan to integrate the feedback into targeted rehearsals, focusing on clear articulation and smoother interaction with the props. 3d. Lingering concerns include the seamless execution of technical aspects during the live performance, but with further practice, we aim to alleviate these worries.

I noticed we both contributed equally, ensuring our lines were delivered with clarity and conviction. However, we occasionally struggled with the emotional depth required for specific segments, which reinforced the importance of not only understanding the lines but the characters' backstories as well. **Nov 20-24 (Improvisation Acting and Beats/Storyboard Lesson)** The week of November 20-24 introduced us to improvisation acting coupled with the concept of beats and storyboarding. Despite initial reservations, our practice sessions showcased remarkable creativity, enabling us to adapt instantly to unplanned scenarios. Our storyboard facilitated a visual understanding of the scene’s progression, although syncing our improvisational cues with the storyboard could have been smoother. This simultaneous approach sharpened our anticipation skills crucial for live performance dynamics. **Dec 11-15 (Writing Your Own Script Task)** Reflecting on the task of writing our own script from December 11-15, I felt proud of the unique dialogue and narrative we created. Our storyline was cohesive and engaging, displaying promising creativity. Nonetheless, our pacing was inconsistent, leading to some scenes that felt rushed. We encountered issues in coordinating our scriptwriting sessions, causing a few misunderstandings and revisions. While our teamwork was generally positive, communication lags were evident. If I were to approach this in the future, I would advocate for a more structured writing timetable and regular check-ins to align our vision. **Dec 18-22 (Project Week 1)** In the first project week, our collective sense of time management was adequate, albeit not perfect. We found ourselves distracted by the holiday atmosphere but managed to reel our focus back to the tasks at hand. Certain tasks, like script memorization, were executed swiftly, while set design lagged slightly behind schedule. Our decision-making could benefit from a tighter organization; clear delegation and teamwork are areas needing enhancement. Retrospectively, an earlier start and a detailed task distribution could have circumvented some of the inefficiencies we experienced. **Dec 25-29 (Project Week 2)** Thus far, the most enjoyable part has been the synergy during rehearsals when everything falls into place. Our increasing familiarity with the material meant we were learning more about timing, delivery, and the nuances of performance. The project has been an invaluable primer in project management, with practical lessons in team coordination and adaptability. Given the scale of the forthcoming tasks, maintaining our current momentum and overlooking the complexity of the production elements pose as significant future challenges. **Jan 1-5 (Project Week 3)** Entering Project Week 3, we must finalize costume design and run comprehensive dress rehearsals to ensure smoothness. We faced organizational challenges, chiefly time allocation for each scene. Feedback from our teacher revealed that our stage presence required enhancement, which was expected; however, she pointed out our need for sharper cue responses, which caught us off-guard. To respond constructively, we’ve arranged extra rehearsals focusing solely on those points. No matter the progress, a hint of concern lingers regarding our readiness for the final performance, but relentless practice remains our antidote."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here's why: 1. Efficient Booking Management: A reservation system allows you to streamline your booking process, making it easier for guests to check availability, make reservations, and manage their bookings online. It automates reservation tasks and minimizes errors that can occur with manual processes. 2. Real-Time Updates: By using a reservation system connected to a channel manager, you can ensure that your room availability, rates, and inventory are up to date across all online travel agencies (OTA) and distribution channels. This helps prevent overbooking and saves you time from manually updating multiple platforms. 3. Increased Online Visibility: Through a channel manager, you can distribute your room inventory to various OTAs and online booking platforms, expanding your reach and attracting a wider audience. This visibility is essential in reaching potential guests and maximizing occupancy rates. 4. Rate Management and Revenue Optimization: With a reservation system and channel manager, you can easily manage your room rates, implement pricing strategies, and adjust rates based on demand and market conditions. This enables you to optimize revenue and stay competitive in the market. 5. Streamlined Operations: By automating your reservation process and consolidating your online presence through a channel manager, you can save time and improve overall operational efficiency. This allows your staff to focus on delivering exceptional guest experiences rather than spending excessive time on manual administrative tasks. In summary, a reservation system and channel manager offer numerous advantages for a motel of any size. They help streamline your booking process, increase online visibility, optimize revenue, and improve overall operational efficiency. Given the size of your motel in Cairo, implementing these systems can significantly enhance your ability to manage bookings and maximize occupancy rates."},{"instruction":"if we will start with 25 rooms , is it also necessary to have reservation system and channel manger ?","output":"While the size of your motel may be smaller with 25 rooms, implementing a reservation system and channel manager can still be beneficial. Here's why: 1. Efficient Guest Management: Even with a smaller number of rooms, a reservation system can help you manage guest bookings effectively. It provides a centralized platform for accepting and managing reservations, reducing the risk of errors and double-bookings. 2. Online Booking Convenience: A reservation system allows potential guests to book their stay online, providing convenience and ease of use. This can attract more customers as online booking has become the preferred method for many travelers. 3. Digital Presence and Exposure: By connecting to a channel manager, you can distribute your room inventory across multiple online travel agencies (OTAs) and booking platforms. This increases your online visibility, making it easier for potential guests to find and book your motel. 4. Time and Operational Efficiency: With a reservation system and channel manager, you can automate tasks such as availability updates and reservation confirmations. This saves time for your staff and allows them to focus on other important aspects of running the motel. 5. Future Expansion Readiness: Implementing a reservation system and channel manager early on, even with a smaller number of rooms, prepares you for future growth. As your business expands, you'll already have the necessary systems in place to manage a larger inventory and handle increased bookings. While the benefits may be more apparent as the number of rooms increases, it is still advisable to invest in a reservation system and channel manager.

Pages turn, like a heart’s gentle rhythm, Breathing life into fictional realms, Where fantasies and realities intertwine. Ethereal beauty hides within words, Unleashing passions, painting emotions, Everlasting echoes etched upon paper. Moments frozen in time’s embrace, Unfolding stories laced with desires, A canvas beckoning souls to wander.” Monika: (claps her hands) “That was wonderful, Yuri.

He gets himself a bunny.","output":"[Setting: Joker's Room in the Attic of Café Leblanc] As the fading light of the evening sun streams through the single window of the attic, Joker can be seen sitting cross-legged on his patched-up couch. The room is quiet, save for the soft turning of a page from the book in his hands. Suddenly, there's a faint scratching noise at the door, followed by a series of curious, soft thumps. Joker's presence, typically poised and calm, shifts as his curiosity is piqued. He places a bookmark between the pages of his book, setting it aside as he strides across the room. Opening the door, he's met with a sight that tilts his usual stoic face into a soft smile—an adorable bunny with snow-white fur and curious red eyes is sitting right there on the threshold, sniffing the air timidly. Joker (murmuring to the bundle of fur): \\"Well, hello there. And what might you be doing here all by yourself?\\" The bunny's ears twitch at the sound of Joker's gentle voice, and it hops cautiously into the room, exploring this new, unknown environment. Joker crouches down, extending his hand for the animal to sniff, allowing it to become familiar with his scent. Morgana, who had been napping on the couch, is awoken by the commotion and saunters towards the strange pair. His sleepy eyes widen as he beholds the fluffy intruder. Morgana (with a hint of jealousy): \\"Hey, Joker, what's with the fluffy addition?\\" Joker (chuckling): \\"Seems like we've got a guest, Mona. What do you say we keep it?\\" The bunny, sensing the warmth in Joker's voice and demeanor, takes a few more daring hops around the attic before settling by Joker's feet, content. Morgana (a bit grudgingly): \\"A pet, huh? Well, as long as it doesn't encroach on my sleeping space.\\" Joker decides to name the bunny \\"Lupin,\\" a homage to one of the famed phantom thieves he admires. From that moment, the adroit leader of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts has a new companion. Lupin quickly becomes a beloved part of the team, even managing to win over Morgana's initially reluctant heart. Over time, Joker discovers that Lupin has a knack for comforting him after long, taxing days of battling shadows in the Metaverse. And so, the attic no longer just houses a thief in the night but also a little creature filled with innocence and warmth, acting as a reminder that even in a life fraught with danger and adventure, there's room for peace and companionship."},{"instruction":"부동산 시장이 하락하는 와중에도 양극화가 진행됐다. 이 때문에 지난 1년간 서울에서 지역별 아파트값 격차가 더욱 심화된 것으로 나타났다. 이른바 '노도강(노원·도봉·강북구)'과 '금관구(금천·관악·구로구)'로 불리는 동북권과 서남권 외곽 지역 가격이 서울 평균보다 2배 이상 하락하면서 한강벨트 지역과 강남권 등 고가 시장과의 가격 격차가 확대됐다. 11일 부동산R114가 서울 아파트 매매가격 변동률을 조사한 결과 2022년 말 대비 2023년 아파트값은 2.95% 하락했다. 2022년도 연간 하락폭(-1.45%)보다 낙폭이 커졌다. 지난해 서울 아파트값 내림세는 주로 중저가 아파트 밀집 지역인 동북권과 서남권 외곽 지역에서 두드러졌다. 지역별로는 도봉구(-8.95%), 관악구(-8.56%), 강북구(-7.58%), 구로구(-7.33%), 노원구(-6.98%) 순으로 낙폭이 컸다. 반면 강남 지역은 강남구가 -1.57%, 서초구가 -2.22%를 기록하는 등 외곽 지역 대비 뚜렷한 차이를 보였다. 송파구는 2022년엔 7.62% 하락하며 서울에서 집값이 가장 많이 빠진 지역이었지만, 지난해에는 서울에서 유일하게 2.52% 상승 전환했다. 이들 외곽 지역은 지난해 고금리에 따른 이자 상환 부담에 급매물이 늘면서 하락 거래 비중이 다른 지역에 비해 높았다. 50년 만기 주택담보대출, 특례보금자리론 등의 종료로 지난해 4분기 거래 위축을 동반한 매매가격 하락폭이 다시 확대됐다.","output":"부동산 시장에서 양극화 현상은 특정 지역의 부동산 가격이 상대적으로 더 크게 하락하거나 상승하는 경우를 말합니다. 서울의 경우, 2023년 부동산 시장 하락세 속에서도 노원구, 도봉구, 강북구(노도강)와 금천구, 관악구, 구로구(금관구) 등 외곽 지역이 더 큰 폭으로 가격이 하락했습니다. 이에 대비해 내륙과 강남 지역은 상대적으로 덜 하락하거나 일부 지역에서는 가격이 상승하기도 했습니다. 이러한 현상의 원인은 다양할 수 있습니다. 대체적으로 외곽 지역은 중저가 아파트가 밀집해 있고, 대출 금리 상승과 50년 만기 주택담보대출이나 특례보금자리론 등의 금융 지원책 종료로 인한 영향을 받기 쉬운 구조를 가지고 있습니다. 이로 인해 고금리 시기에 이자 부담을 감당하기 어려워진 일부 주택 소유주들이 급매물로 내놓으며 가격 하락을 가속화시켰을 수 있습니다. 한편 강남구나 서초구와 같은 고가 아파트가 밀집한 지역은 대체로 금융 여건의 변화에 덜 민감하게 반응할 뿐만 아니라, 학군, 교통, 생활 편의시설 등의 입지 조건이 좋아 수요가 견고한 편입니다. 이로 인해 해당 지역의 주택 가격은 외곽 지역에 비해 상대적으로 안정적인 경우가 많습니다. 이처럼 지역별 부동산 시장의 양극화는 소득 격차, 접근성, 생활 편의성, 주거 환경, 금융 환경 등 다양한 사회 경제적 요인들에 의해 영향을 받습니다. 이러한 양극화는 경제적 불평등을 심화시키고, 주택 소유와 관련한 기회의 불평등을 더욱 확대시킬 수 있기 때문에 정책 입안자들에게는 중요한 도전과제로 여겨집니다."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

자네나 나나 우진군의 시절이 있었어. 하지만 그 아이만 한 발자취는 아니었지.” “······” “솔직히 늙은이의 오지랖이긴 해. 허나 궁금하단 말이지. 과연 그 아이가 어디까지 올라갈지 말이야.” 읊조리던 안가복 감독이 오른쪽에 앉은 심한호에게 시선을 돌렸다. 그리곤 주름진 미소를 짙게 만들었다. “자네 같은 뒷방 늙은이 정도야 가뿐히 제치지 않겠나.” “역시 농담이 느셨습니다.” “반은 농담이고 반은 진담이야. 자넨 아직 강우진 그 아이의 연기를 직접 보지 못 했고. 그렇지?” “···뭐, 그래서 간만에 피가 끓는 기분이 들긴 합니다.” “좋군, 감독으로서는 아주 이로운 모습이야.” 어깨를 으쓱인 심한호가 주제를 바꾼다. “그래서 파티 어느 부분에서 발표하실 겁니까?” “음- 시작하고부터는 정신없을 테니······놀 거 다 논 다음에 뒤풀이쯤 하면 어떤가. 그쯤 눈에 띄는 기자 아무에게나 하면 되겠어.” “그렇게 알고 있겠습니다.” “자네도 옆에 붙어 있어.” 다시금 창밖으로 고개를 돌린 안가복 감독이 잔잔하게 말을 이었다. “그래야 그림이 살지.” 한편, 서울의 넷플렉스 코리아. 한창 점심시간이라 부산스러운 넷플렉스 코리아였다. 특이한 건. “우진씨 진짜 대박!!” “맞아요! 다시 보이더라고요.” “전 아침에 영상보고 놀라서 커피도 엎었어요.” “반전이 세긴 했지??” “그 사건에 강우진씨가 있을 줄은-” “근데 우진씨 생각보다 어어엄청 날쌔더라고요? 이미지만 보면 막 움직이는 거 귀찮아하는 타입인데.” “호신술 같은 걸 배웠을까요??” “보통 그런 걸 배웠어도 실전에서 그리 냉정하게 쓸 수가 있나?” 직원들의 대화 주제가 죄다 강우진이라는 것. “전 아직 우진씨는 ‘한인호’로 보여서······완전 침 흘리면서 봤어요.” “아영씨, 너무 좋아하는 거 아니야??” “멋있잖아요! 저 사실 ‘남사친’ 이후로 ‘강심장’도 가입했어요.” “반했네, 반했어. 근데 남자인 내가 봐도 그 영상은 인정. 근데 대체 우진씨는 그걸 어떻게 한 거지? 나라면 못 했을 거야.” “누구라도 그럴걸요? 완전 현실판 히어로!” “어쨌든 언론들 난리 났어요, 지금. 고맙게도 다시금 ‘남사친’까지 언급되더라니까요??” 이미 ‘남사친’으로 강우진과 인연이 있는 그들이었고, 몇 시간 전 출근하던 때에 어디서든 우진을 볼 수 있었기 때문이었다. 물론. “아?” 총괄디렉터실의 통통한 김소향 역시 놀란 토끼 눈을 뜨고 있었다. 이유가 뭐겠는가? “또 봐도 안 믿기네.” 자리에 앉아 노트북에 출력되는 강우진의 블랙박스 영상을 계속해서 보고 있었으니까. 약 5번이나 영상을 되감아 본 김소향은 저도 모르게 입을 벌렸다. 그녀로서는 당연한 행동이었다. ‘남사친’ 때부터 봐왔지만, 이런 전문가 수준의 무술을 할 거라곤 생각조차 못 했으니까. 곧, 그녀가 입에 붙은 손을 떼며 순수하게 느낀 점을 뱉었다. “아니, 우진씨는······우연치곤 너무 대단하지 않나? 마치 하늘이 점지해준 배우 같잖아??” 생각해보면 ‘남사친’때도 예상외의 일들이 심심치 않게 벌어졌었다. 화린의 난데없는 합류, 강우진의 예상 밖의 보컬 실력, 일본 진출 등등등. 그런데 그건 약과였나? 강우진은 무슨 랜덤박스 같았다. 최소 김소향은 그리 느꼈다. “무술은······진짜 생각도 못 했다. 무슨 양파 같네. 까도까도 뭐가 계속 나와.” 이때. -똑똑. 사무실에 노크 소리가 울린 뒤 문이 열렸다. 팀장급 여자 직원이 들어온다. 그녀의 허리엔 태블릿이 끼워져 있었고, 다가오는 팀장급 직원에게 김소향 총괄디렉터가 먼저 입을 열었다. “어어어, 강우진씨 영상? 나도 진작에 봤어요.” 이어 여자 직원이 태블릿을 내밀며 답했다. “네. 저도 봤어요, 근데 이건 다른 건. 아- 우진씨와 관련이 있긴 한데.” “응? 뭔데?” “일본 쪽 대형 애니메이션 제작사에서 요청이 왔어요. ‘남사친’을 리메이크 하고 싶다고.” “······어? 정말? 무슨?” 다급히 태블릿을 확인하던 김소향이 메일을 읽으면서도 작게 읊조렸다. “이 제작사···일본에서 세 손가락에 드는 곳이잖아?” 이 시각. 정오가 됐을 무렵. 국내 수많은 대중들은 폭발적으로 포털사이트에 ‘강우진’을 검색해대는 중이었다. 사실, 십 수 시간 전 새벽부터 난리였지만 출근 시간을 넘어 점심시간이 되자 그 수가 어마무시하게 폭증했다. 물론, 오늘 아침 뉴스를 탄 것도 큰 힘을 보탰다. 현재 지하철이나 버스에 오른 사람들은 거의 핸드폰을 보고 있었고, 대부분의 화면엔 강우진 관련이 많이 비추고 있었다. 의도한 건 아니지만 빌드업이 완벽했으니까. 가뜩이나 문제로 대두되는 사생편 또는 스토커 문제. 그 피해자가 무려 화린. 이는 커다란 사회적 이슈로 떠올랐고, 그 뒤로 스토커 괴한의 인터뷰가 추가되며 국민의 공분을 샀었다. 사람들은 마치 고구마 100개를 먹은 듯 답답했고 격분했겠지. 이 타이밍에 뿌려진 반전. 바로 강우진. 우진이 시원하게 괴한을 제압하는 부분은 대중들에겐 끝없는 사이다를 먹인 것과 같았고, 생각도 못 했던 인물이 튀어나와 관심이 폭발하는 건 덤이었다. 뭣보다 현재 강우진이 가지는 영향력이 너무도 강력한 상태였다. 따라서. 『[속보]‘송곳 괴한’에게 습격당한 ‘화린’을 구한 건 ‘강우진’이었다』 화산은 굉음을 내며 폭발했다. 『[이슈픽]한 유명 커뮤니티에 업로드된 ‘강우진 블랙박스 영상’, 내용 보니······』 『“가드가 아니었어?!” 화린을 보호하며 구해낸 건 괴물 신인 ‘강우진’』 『한 시민이 올린 블랙박스 영상에 선명히 찍힌 ‘영웅’ 강우진의 모습들/ 영상』 언론이 이 건의 냄새를 맡고 기사를 쏘기 시작한 건 새벽. 따라서 터진 용암은 진작에 연예계를 뒤덮은 상태였다. 『[스타톡]‘강우진’이 스토커 괴한 제압하는 영상에 누리꾼들 “대체 어떻게 한 거야?”』 『현실판 ‘남사친’, 강우진 진짜로 화린을 구해냈다···블랙박스 영상 삽시간에 번지는 중』 화린 사건이 터졌을 때보다 화력이 몇 배는 급증했다. 강우진의 등장으로 판이 180도 뒤집혔으니까. 초마다 기사가 갱신된다. 새로고침을 누르면 새로운 기사가 후두둑 쏟아진다. 어느 포털사이트를 들어가도 강우진의 이름이 메인에 걸렸을 정도. 『올해 연예계를 뒤집은 강우진, 이번에는 영움담으로 팬들에게 매력 어필?』 『[연예계]강우진, ‘우리네 식탁’으로 미국 넘어갔지만 빈자리 느껴지지 않을 정도···화린은 왜 사실을 밝히지 않았나?』 『미담을 넘어 영웅담을 만들어 냈지만 모든 것을 숨긴 강우진···대체 왜?』 기자들은 오해와 오류가 섞인 추측도 쉴새 없이 양산해냈다. 『국내 발칵 뒤집은 ‘강우진 블랙박스 영상’, 한 커뮤니티에선 ‘합성’ 또는 조작설까지』 『[이슈체크]‘남사친’부터 ‘우리네 식탁’까지, 이번에 화린을 구한 ‘강우진’···더욱 진해지는 둘의 연인 냄새』 물론, 기자들보다 몇 배 더 흥분한 건 여론이었다. “너네 커뮤에 뜬 거 봤어?? 화린 구해준 게 강우진이라고 함.” 어디든 강우진의 이름이 분출되고 있었다. 고등학교나 대학교나. “헐? 진심?” “아! 야! 나도 영상 봤음! 개지려!” “뭐야! 나도 볼래! 어디서 봐? 너튭?” “노노, 잠만.” “와- 근데 강우진 미친 쩔더라! 처음엔 진짜 걍 합성인 줄!” “대박!! 이거 뭐야?? 진까 강우진 맞아??! 대존멋!” “이정도면 강우진 국정원 출신이라고 해도 믿겠는데??” 점심을 위해 식당에 모인 회사원들. “제 말이 맞죠? 화린 구한 거 강우진 맞다고 했잖아요 김대리님.” “허- 이거 화린 사건 당시 블박 진짜 맞나??” “아! 맞다니까요?? 오늘 아침에 뉴스도 떴어요!” “······강우진 멋있네. 아니, 근데 얘는 원래 뭐 운동 같은 걸 배웠었나? 몸놀림이 무슨 이소룡급인데.” “영상 나온 거 보면 뭐든 유단자인 거 같죠??” “어어, 아니면 군대서 배웠다거나. 아! 강우진 얘 특수부대 나왔네!” “엥? 그게 뭐예요??” 사이사이 멋대로 뱉어지는 추측 또는 착각이 범람했다. 대중들의 흥분이 과열차게 달아오른다. 이쯤 현 상황을 끌어낸 시초의 영상 쪽은 기록적인 수치를 내고 있었다. -초초초초대박))<화린 송곳 습격 사건> 이거 내 차 블박이 바로 앞에서 찍었음(어그로 아님).avi 대형 커뮤니티에 올라온 그 영상의 조회수는 10만 뷰를 찍었고, 달린 댓글들은 수천을 넘기고 있었다. -아닠ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ왘ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ강우진 얘는 대체 못하는 게 뭐임???

Rookie Kang Woojin, in his first year, and Shim Hanho, a veteran actor of 30 years. The two actors differed greatly in terms of their presence and weight in the industry. Normally, it would be a pairing difficult to realize, but that's exactly what made it more captivating. The gap between the two actors intensified the scent of stimulation. It piqued interest. And so, the attention was amplified. Whether it was the media, public opinion, or the countless many in the entertainment industry. This lineup was likely to become unprecedented in the history of Korean entertainment. At least, that's what the veteran actor Shim Hanho thought. \\"Actors like Kang Woojin don't come around often.\\" Decades. The long and extensive career of Shim Hanho. Yet, until now, he had never seen an actor like Kang Woojin. He hadn't seen his acting in person. However, he had never seen anyone with such energy, impact, and influence within just a year. Even beyond Korea to Japan. On the other hand, Shim Hanho was the type to steadily build up his acting skills and filmography. It took him about five years just to become known to the public. He was the complete opposite type from Kang Woojin. That's why Shim Hanho was deeply intrigued by Kang Woojin. And perhaps even a bit jealous. Now, Kang Woojin and Shim Hanho were set to meet in 'Leech', and Director Angabok was going to announce this lineup at tonight's 'Stars' Night' party. Soon, Shim Hanho spoke in a deep voice, addressing Director Angabok who had a faint smile. \\"It will be chaotic if you do it here.\\" Director Angabok, nodding as if he understood, turned his gaze outside the window. Dozens of reporters with cameras were visible around the entrance of the luxury hotel. Additionally, there would be many actors, directors, and officials in the banquet hall. \\"Yeah, it's going to be a spectacle.\\" \\"You don't like noise, do you?\\" \\"As you get older, you prefer peace and quiet. But if you're going to throw wood into the fire, it's better if it catches well, right?\\" \\"If you're looking to stoke the fire.\\" \\"You throw the wood when the flames are burning bright, haha.\\" After a moment, Shim Hanho, who had been observing the director with short white hair, crossed his arms. \\"You seem a bit excited, senior.\\" \\"Well, it's been a while since I've had fun. Isn't it nice? You and I, we've had our times like Woojin. But that kid's footsteps are something else.\\" \\"...\\" \\"Honestly, it's an old man's meddling. But I'm curious. Just how far that kid will climb.\\" Murmuring, Director Angabok turned his gaze to Shim Hanho sitting on his right and deepened his wrinkled smile. \\"You're like an old man in the back room, but I bet you could easily surpass that.\\" \\"Your jokes are getting old.\\" \\"Half joke, half serious. You haven't seen that kid Kang Woojin's acting in person yet, have you?\\" \\"...Well, it does make my blood boil for the first time in a while.\\" \\"Good, that's a very beneficial attitude for a director.\\" Shim Hanho, shrugging his shoulders, changed the subject. \\"So, at which part of the party will you make the announcement?\\" \\"Hmm, it's going to be hectic from the start... How about during the after-party, after all the fun? Just pick any noticeable reporter then.\\" \\"I'll keep that in mind.\\" \\"Stay by my side too.\\" Once again, Director Angabok turned his head outside the window and continued speaking calmly. \\"It'll make for a better picture.\\" Meanwhile, at Netflix Korea in Seoul. It was a busy lunchtime at Netflix Korea. What was unusual was... \\"Woojin is really amazing!!\\" \\"Right! I saw him again.\\" \\"I spilled my coffee this morning because I was so surprised by the video.\\" \\"The twist was intense, wasn't it?\\" \\"Who would have thought Kang Woojin would be there in that incident-\\" \\"But Woojin seemed really agile, didn't he? Just by his image, he seems like the type who would find it bothersome to move.\\" \\"Did he learn some kind of self-defense?\\" \\"Even if you learn that kind of thing, can you really use it so calmly in a real situation?\\" The topic of conversation among the employees was all about Kang Woojin. \\"I still see Woojin as 'Han Inho'... I watched it drooling.\\" \\"Ayoung, aren't you too into him??\\" \\"He's cool! I actually joined 'Kang's Heart' after 'Man's Best Friend'.\\" \\"You've fallen for him, haven't you? But even as a guy, I have to admit that video is impressive. But how did Woojin do that? I couldn't have.\\" \\"Anyone would have been the same, right? He's like a real-life hero!\\" \\"Anyway, the media is going crazy right now. Thankfully, they're even mentioning 'Man's Best Friend' again??\\" They already had a connection with Kang Woojin through 'Man's Best Friend', and a few hours ago, when they were heading to work, they could see Woojin everywhere. Of course. \\"Ah?\\" Kim Sohyang, the plump director, also had her eyes wide open in surprise. What could be the reason? \\"It's unbelievable even when I see it again.\\" She was sitting at her desk, continuously watching the black box video of Kang Woojin on her laptop. After rewinding and watching the video about five times, Kim Sohyang unwittingly opened her mouth. It was a natural reaction for her. She had been watching since 'Man's Best Friend', but she never thought he would perform martial arts at a professional level. Soon, she removed her hand from her mouth and spoke her pure thoughts. \\"Isn't Woojin... too amazing to be a coincidence? It's like he's an actor chosen by the heavens??\\" Thinking back, even during 'Man's Best Friend', unexpected events were not uncommon. Hwarin's sudden joining, Kang Woojin's unexpected vocal talent, the expansion to Japan, and so on. But was that just a prelude? Kang Woojin was like a random box. At least, that's how Kim Sohyang felt. \\"Martial arts... I really didn't expect that. He's like an onion. No matter how much you peel, there's always more.\\" At that moment. -Knock knock. There was a knock on the office door, and it opened. A female team manager entered. She had a tablet tucked at her waist, and Director Kim Sohyang spoke first to the approaching team manager. \\"Oh, the video of Kang Woojin? I've already seen it.\\" Then the female employee extended the tablet and replied. \\"Yes. I've seen it too, but this is something else. Ah- it's related to Woojin.\\" \\"Huh? What is it?\\" \\"A major Japanese animation production company has made a request. They want to remake 'Man's Best Friend'.\\" \\"…What? Really? What?\\" Kim Sohyang hurriedly checked the tablet and murmured softly while reading the email. \\"This production company... it's one of the top three in Japan, isn't it?\\" At this time. Around noon. Countless people in the country were explosively searching for 'Kang Woojin' on portal sites. In fact, it had been a frenzy since dawn, but as lunchtime approached after the morning rush, the numbers surged tremendously. Of course, this morning's news also contributed greatly. People on subways or buses were almost all looking at their phones, and most of the screens were showing something related to Kang Woojin. Although it wasn't intentional, the buildup was perfect.

[채널명: 강우진 부캐] [구독자 788만 명] [동영상 31개] 채널 설명의 메인은 한글이었으나, 그 밑으론 영어와 일본어도 친절히 나열돼 있었다. 채널 규모가 상당히 큰 데다 해외 팬들도 퍽 많은 채널이었으니 당연했다. 어쨌든 ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널을 보던 반삭 매니저가 바로 고개를 들었고, 좌석에 앉은 카라의 파란 눈에 시선을 맞췄다. “카라, 이 채널은 우리의 예정에도 있었어.” 이에 카라가 살짝 차갑게 되물었었다. “근데 왜 빠진 거야? 보여준 리스트에는 없었잖아.” 바로 이어지는 반삭 매니저의 설명. “처음 조사할 땐 분명 있었어. 보기에도 대단한 구독자 수를 보유했고, 영상마다 조회수가 대단하니까.” “근데?” “홍보 생각으로 출연하기는 문제가 있기 때문이야. 그 채널의 주력 컨텐츠는 곡 커버야, 물론 간혹 채널 주인이 구독자와 소통하는 영상이 올라오기는 해. 하지만.” “90% 이상의 영상들이 커버라는 거지?” “맞아. 우리가 원하는 건 적당한 토크와 영화 홍보 그리고 카라 너의 매력을 어필해주는 거야, 애초에 그런 성격을 띠는 채널과 접촉하는 게 맞다는 판단이야.” 틀린 소린 아니었다. 아무리 구독자가 많다 한들 채널의 컨셉이 확고하면 홍보를 해도 힘이 빠진다. “참고로 한국에는 그 정도 크기의 채널은 꽤 있어. 물론, 많지는 않지만 존재해. 우리로서는 또는 영화사에서 바라는 건, 대놓고 홍보 성격을 띠는 채널을 원해.” “그렇다면 방법을 찾아줘.” “······후-” 익숙하다는 듯 반삭 매니저가 머리를 긁다가 말을 이었다. “좋아, 먼저 이 채널과 접촉을 해볼게. 우리를 위해 따로 컨텐츠를 짤 수 있는지 물을 거야. 만약 채널에서 곡 커버 이상의 것을 원치 않는다면 다른 채널을 생각해 둬. 물론, 카라 너라서 채널 주인은 무리해서라도 코너를 짤지도 모르지만, 우리가 확인해서 빈약하다면 아웃이야.” “흠-” “이건 네가 고집부린다고 될 게 아니야. 너의 이미지와 영화사의 입장이 있으니까.” “당연하지. 그보다 그 채널의 주인이 한국의 배우인 건 알아?” “물론이야. 조사를 해봤으니까, 그것 역시 조금 걱정이 돼. 취미로 연 채널이 운이 좋아 커진 느낌이라서.” “취미? 그 보컬 실력이 취미라는 건 말이 안 돼. 그리고 강우진? 가수로 본격적이진 않지만, 나와 비슷해서 마음에 들어. 내 곡을 멋지게 커버한 것도 그렇고. 영상들을 보면 영어도 어느 정도 가능한 것 같아.” 냉랭히 설명을 늘어놓는 마일리 카라. 그런 그녀를 보던 매니저가 픽 웃었다. “자주 보나 봐. 그 채널.” “때때로. 이 강우진이란 배우 음색이 좋거든. 본업인 연기를 보고 싶을 정도야.” “······그렇군.” 뭔가 눈치를 챈 반삭 매니저가 다시금 한숨을 뱉었고. “그 한국배우의 작품을 찾아 달라는 거지? 당연히 영어 자막이 있는 거로.” “맞아, 한국 스케줄 동안 볼 수 있게. 그리고 강우진이란 배우에 관해서도.” “그래, 네가 그 채널에 나간다는 게 성사가 된다면 말이지.” 금발의 카라가 옅게 미소지었다. “이번에도 잘 부탁해, 조나단.” 여기까지. 카라의 미소까지 상기하던 반삭 매니저가 다시금 현실, 주택 거실의 소파로 돌아왔다. 그리곤 옆에 앉은 외국인 직원들에게 물었다. “강우진이란 한국배우, ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널에 관해 조사는 어느 정도 됐나요.” 빠른 대답은 주근깨 난 여자였다. “급하게 알아본 거라 확실치는 않지만, 이 정도면 카라가 보기엔 충분할 거예요.” 그녀가 태블릿을 반삭 매니저에게 넘겼다. 이어. “그런데 그 강우진이란 한국배우 뭔가 이상해요.” “음? 왜요. 혹시 과거 범죄라도 저질렀다거나.” “설마요. 그런 게 아니라, 알면 알수록 황당한 필모를 가지고 있어요. 일단 자료를 보세요, 조나단.” 잠시간 그녀를 보던 반삭 매니저가 태블릿에 시선을 내린다. 화면엔 강우진에 관한 간략한 조사표가 출력되고 있었다. 하지만 내용은 간단치가 않았다. 한국과 헐리웃의 차이는 있겠으나, 태블릿에 표시되는 강우진의 전체 필모는 헐리웃으로 치면 중견급 이상과 버금갔다. 곧, 턱을 쓸며 감탄하는 반삭 매니저. “오- 생각보다 탄탄한 필모를 가진 배우였네요, 권기택 감독은 들어본 적이 있어. 거기에 타노구치 쿄타로 감독까지. 일본까지 진출한 건가? 대단한데? 한국의 거장들과 작업했네요.” “그가 찍은 한국의 작품들도 전부 홈런을 쳤어요.” “여기에 그렇게 큰 너튜브 채널까지 가지고 있고. 탑급이었나?” 분위기를 단숨에 바꾸는 주근깨 난 여자. “그게 데뷔 1년 만에 이룬 것들이에요.” 흥미가 서린 반삭 매니저의 표정에 단숨에 충격이 번졌다. “뭐, 뭐라고요?” 한편, 주택 2층의 가장 넓은 방. 대충 봐도 으리으리한 방 안엔 없는 게 없었다. 침대, TV, 냉장고, 식탁과 테이블, 소파, 화장실 등등. 사람 한 명이 살기엔 차고 넘치는 수준. 그런 방 소파에 긴 금발을 늘어트린 여자가 침대에 누워있다. 마일리 카라였다. 다만, 그녀는 잠에 빠진 것이 아닌 엎드린 채로 TV를 보고 있었다. 정확히는 한국의 드라마 ‘프로파일러 한량’. 아마 넷플렉스와 연결한 상태인 듯. 물론, 영어 자막이 포함된 상태였고 지금 화면엔 한창 ‘박대리’의 취조 장면이 출력되고 있었다. 약간 냉랭한 얼굴의 카라는 TV 속 ‘박대리’에 눈을 떼지 못했다. 이유? ‘강우진 부캐’를 가진 강우진이란 한국배우의 연기 실력이 상상 이상이었으니까. ‘······아니, 본인이 맞는 거야? 커버 영상과는 전혀 다른 느낌이잖아?’ 이때. -똑똑똑. 방에 노크소리가 번진다. 덕분에 재생되는 한량을 멈춘, 금발 긴 머리를 정리한 카라가 일어나 문을 열었다. 문 앞엔 덩치 좋은 반삭 매니저가 서 있었고. “응, 조나단.” 챙겨온 태블릿을 카라에게 넘긴 반삭 매니저가 퍽 진중한 톤으로 영어를 뱉었다. “카라, 그걸 좀 봐.” “뭔데.” “강우진에 관한 것.” “벌써?” “강우진, 이 한국배우 재밌는 점이 많아. 설명하기 전에 그 영상부터 봐봐.” 미간을 좁힌 카라가 건네받은 태블릿 화면에 시선을 내렸다. 태블릿엔 한 영상이 출력되고 있었다. 주인공은 당연하겠지만 강우진. 잠시간 영상을 보던 카라의 냉정한 얼굴에 당황이 서린다. 그런 그녀가 시선을 영상에 둔 채 매니저에게 작게 되물었다. “뭐야? 이거 액션 영화 장면이야?” 반삭 매니저가 고개를 저었다. “아니, 실제야. 그것도 며칠 전의 일.” 며칠 뒤, 13일. 미국 LA 헐리웃. 느지막한 아침. 위치는 영화의 본고장이라 불리는 헐리웃이었다. 그런 헐리웃의 중심에 위치한 5성급 호텔 비벌린 호텔. 과연 5성급 초호화 호텔이라 로비부터 어마무시한 인물들이 많았고, 많은 인파로 북적이는 1층 로비를 지나 호텔 뒤쪽으로 빠지면 분위기는 단숨에 바뀐다. 마치 해수욕장처럼 꾸며놓은 야외 정원에는 여유가 넘친다. 수영장에서 수영을 즐기거나 일광욕을 즐기는 외국인이 많이 보였으니까. 그런 수많은 비치 벤치 중간쯤. “······” 선글라스를 낀 배 나온 남자가 눈에 띈다. 뭔가 산타클로스를 연상케 하는 모습이었으니까. 머리 색은 노란색과 흰색의 중간쯤. 남자는 벤치에 누워 일광욕을 즐기는 듯 보였다. 그때였다. “감독.” 산타 남자에게 여자 목소리가 들렸다. 곧, 고개만 돌린 남자에게 정장 입은 갈색 단발의 외국인 여자가 보였다. 그녀를 보자마자 산타 남자는 다시금 일광욕을 즐긴다. “일찍 일어났군.” “핸드폰은 수영장에 던지셨나요?” “그럴 리가. 라커에 있을 거야.” “최소한 눈에 보이는 곳에 계시면 어때요.” “캐스팅 디렉터의 눈에 띄면 일이 늘지.” 한숨 쉰 여자가 고개를 흔들면서도 주제를 바꿨다. “감독님의 말대로 계속해서 아시아 쪽 배우를 모니터링하고 있는데.” “이거 봐 역시 일이 늘어.” “······역시 무술계는 중국 쪽이 많아요.” “그렇겠지.” “그런데 예전에 언급한 한국의 배우 기억하세요?” “음? 누구였지?” “한국의 영화제인 ‘미장센 국제 영화제’에서 제일 눈에 띄었다는. 강우진이란 배우요.” “아아- 그래, 기억나.” “최근 그 배우 관련해서-” 단발의 여자가 누워있는 산타에게 한 걸음 다가서서는 말했다. “너튜브에 재미있는 영상이 돌아요, 괴한을 제압하는.” < 미국 (9) > 끝","output":"< United States (9) > It was an emergency. That was the first thought that came to Kang Woojin's mind when he saw the unusual situation around the food truck. \\"What's going on? Did something happen around here?\\" No, that didn't seem quite right. After all, Americans were already lined up in front of the 'Our Dining Table' food truck. It was strange. Clearly, there was a problem with this picture. Woojin was clearly flustered, but he forced himself to maintain a poker face. However, all the cast members of 'Our Dining Table' except Woojin were openly showing their shock and confusion. \\"Why is there such a long line?!\\" \\"Did the line from another food truck spill over to ours??\\" \\"No! The other places haven't even opened yet!!!\\" \\"At a glance, there are more than 30 people!!!\\" Everyone except Kang Woojin was in a panic. Of course, this scene was being vividly captured by the mini-cam installed in the car and was also being filmed by two VJs with cameras. Amidst this, An Jonghak, who had his hair neatly combed as always, shouted to Ha Gangsu, who was driving. \\"Gangsu! Just, pass this one!\\" \\"Should we just drive past?\\" \\"Yeah, just go past for now! What if we get out there and people start crowding around?\\" \\"Ah! Got it!\\" Ha Gangsu, who was driving, passed the food truck and then parked the van a few hundred meters away on the shoulder of the road. At the same time, everyone turned their bodies to look out the rear window of the van. The long line was still visible. Fortunately, the Americans in line didn't seem to pay any attention to the van. They were just waiting for the food truck to open. By now, Woojin and everyone else were certain. Those people were waiting for 'Our Dining Table' food truck, and something had changed. Otherwise, the situation didn't make sense. Yesterday, when they opened, they only attracted flies. Of course, there were quite a few customers during business hours, but there were far more people just passing by. Soon, An Jonghak, who had been calming himself by running his hands through his hair, picked up his phone. \\"Are the staff around? Has Yoon PD seen this?\\" An Jonghak quickly tried to call Yoon Byungseon PD due to the emergency situation. However, there was no need. -Slide! Suddenly, the van door opened, and Yoon Byungseon PD, wearing glasses, appeared. A mischievous smile spread across his face as he stood by the door. \\"Hey, why aren't you opening when there's such a crowd?\\" Hwarin and Yeon Baekgwang, with their eyes wide open, asked almost simultaneously. Panic was evident in their voices. \\"Just, should we open as is?\\" Then An Jonghak, the nominal boss, chimed in. \\"How can we open in this state? And who are those people? Do you know something, Yoon PD?\\" \\"Hyung, anyone can see they're customers.\\" \\"No, that's what I'm saying. Why are there customers here from the morning? They're even lined up.\\" \\"Well?\\" \\"······You know something. Spill it.\\" Yoon Byungseon PD, who had been smirking, then showed everyone something he had been hiding behind his back. \\"Take a look at this.\\" What he brought into the van was a newspaper filled with English text. What was peculiar was... \\"Here, here. Do you see our truck on the front page?\\" A very familiar photo was featured on the first page of the newspaper. It was the 'Our Dining Table' food truck. Yoon Byungseon PD, pointing at that part of the newspaper with his index finger, began to explain. \\"This is a local newspaper, and our truck was featured in an article. We were surprised by the crowd from the morning too. So we asked around, and this had happened.\\" \\"······So we were featured on the front page of a local newspaper.\\" \\"That's right. But what's more interesting is...\\" Yoon Byungseon PD, maintaining his smile, called out to Kang Woojin, who was casually looking at the newspaper. \\"Woojin, do you remember the elderly couple from yesterday?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Well, of course. They were our first customers. Anyway, it turns out the grandfather is quite famous around here.\\" Hong Hyeyeon, with her long hair tied up, joined in. \\"Ah, I heard. He's a chef who runs a restaurant. I was surprised when I heard that.\\" As if that wasn't the end, Yoon Byungseon PD continued the baton. \\"When I looked into that restaurant, it turned out to be a Michelin 1-star place. It's a very famous and well-known restaurant around here.\\" \\"Mi, Michelin!\\" \\"Wow- amazing. So, Woojin hyung got praised by that chef??!\\" As Yeon Baekgwang got excited, Kang Woojin almost joined in with a shoulder dance. He barely managed to restrain himself and lowered his voice as much as possible. \\"Did that person spread some rumors? Is that why there's an article?\\" \\"Something like that. The chef gave us his contact information and asked us to let him know when the store opens. We called to check with him, and it seems he recommended our food truck to his acquaintances on his way home yesterday. Among them was a journalist who works for a local newspaper.\\" \\"Did that journalist come to our truck yesterday?\\" \\"That's right! But it's not just the newspaper; the article was also published online. It was posted on the local newspaper's SNS too.\\" \\"······\\" Woojin, having grasped the situation, closed his mouth. Regardless, Yoon Byungseon PD was excited. \\"It's only natural for people to flock like this!\\" Yoon Byungseon PD tapped the English newspaper title with his index finger and showed Woojin a deep smile. \\"Woojin, you don't need to translate everything. Just this title here.\\" \\"···'Michelin 1-star chef also fell for Korean food, the taste of Korean food from the food truck from Korea was fantastic.'\\" \\"Do you see the very end of the article? The interview with that grandfather chef from yesterday is also included.\\" Then Yoon Byungseon PD, who had folded the newspaper, annoyingly asked the stunned cast of 'Our Dining Table.' \\"Huh? What are you all doing here? Go and open up. Are you going to keep the customers waiting? They've been taking pictures of the closed food truck since a while ago. Now that we've figured out the situation, let's quickly go and guide the customers?\\" \\"······\\" \\"Those customers aren't all of it. It's just that much before opening, and if we pass the opening time, more might come! Move, move!\\" In that moment, Kang Woojin recalled the kindly smiling white-haired American grandfather from yesterday. The smiling man. For some reason, he overlapped with the face of Director Angabok. '······Why do all the grandfathers around me, in Korea and America, like to stir up trouble? Why??!' And then he had a hunch. Today, that food truck would become \\"Ha- we're screwed.\\" A train bound for hell. Several hours later, in Korea. It was early morning on the 10th. The location was a huge house in Cheongdam-dong, Seoul. At first glance, it seemed like a place where a chaebol might live, but currently, the house was bustling with foreigners instead of a chaebol. It was the team of the world-famous star 'Miley Cara' who had recently come to Korea. Her team had rented this house. Hotels are usually the norm, but they changed the accommodation for Miley Cara's safety. Regardless, Miley Cara, who had been in Korea for three days, was currently lost in sleep. Meanwhile, the rest of the foreign staff, excluding her, were busy preparing for today's schedule. Thanks to that, the first floor living room of the house was bustling. Among them, a foreign man with a huge build and a buzz cut sitting on the living room sofa stood out. He was Cara's main manager, and around him, foreigners of various sizes were busy reporting something to the buzz cut manager. Then, a slender foreign man asked a question. \\"Jonathan, why is Cara only thinking about 'Kang Woojin's Sub-Character' among the many Korean YouTube channels?\\" The buzz cut manager crossed his arms. His muscles stood out. \\"Who knows what's in Cara's mind.\\" After a brief answer, he momentarily recalled a few days ago. Before arriving in Korea, on the plane, it started when Cara declared she would only appear on 'Kang Woojin's Sub-Character' channel, and the buzz cut manager was checking the channel's information. [Channel Name: Kang Woojin's Sub-Character] [Subscribers: 7.88 million] [Videos: 31] The main description of the channel was in Korean, but below it, English and Japanese were also kindly listed. It was a channel with a considerable size and many overseas fans, which was natural. Anyway, the buzz cut manager, who had been looking at 'Kang Woojin's Sub-Character' channel, immediately looked up and met the gaze of Cara's blue eyes seated next to him. \\"Cara, this channel was also in our plan.\\" To which Cara asked back a bit coldly. \\"Then why was it omitted? It wasn't on the list you showed me.\\" The buzz cut manager's explanation followed immediately. \\"It was definitely there when we first researched. It has an impressive number of subscribers, and each video has a remarkable number of views.\\" \\"But?\\" \\"There's a problem with appearing for promotional purposes. The channel's main content is song covers, and occasionally, the channel owner uploads videos communicating with subscribers. But.\\" \\"More than 90% of the videos are covers, right?\\" \\"Right. What we want is a decent amount of talk, movie promotion, and something that can appeal to Cara's charm. Initially, we judged it was right to contact channels with that kind of nature.\\" It wasn't wrong. No matter how many subscribers there were, if the channel's concept was solid, promotion would lose its impact. \\"By the way, there are quite a few channels of that size in Korea. Of course, not many, but they exist. What we or the movie company want is a channel that openly has a promotional nature.\\" \\"Then find a way.\\" \\"······Sigh-\\" As if accustomed, the buzz cut manager scratched his head and continued. \\"Alright, I'll try contacting this channel first. I'll ask if they can create separate content for us. If the channel doesn't want anything more than song covers, then think of another channel. Of course, because it's Cara, the channel owner might make a corner for us even if it's a stretch, but if we check and it's poor, it's out.\\" \\"Hmm-\\" \\"It's not something you can get by being stubborn. There's your image and the movie company's position to consider.\\" \\"Of course. But did you know that the owner of that channel is a Korean actor?\\" \\"Of course. I've done the research, and that's a bit of a concern too. It feels like a channel that was opened as a hobby and got lucky and grew.\\" \\"A hobby? That vocal skill can't be just a hobby. And Kang Woojin? He's not officially a singer, but I like him because he's similar to me. He covered my song nicely. Watching the videos, it seems he's somewhat capable in English too.\\" Miley Cara laid out her explanation coldly. Watching her, the manager chuckled. \\"You watch that channel often, huh.\\" \\"From time to time. This actor Kang Woojin has a nice tone. I want to see his acting, his main job.\\" \\"······I see.\\" The buzz cut manager, who seemed to have caught on to something, sighed again. \\"So you want me to find that Korean actor's works? Of course, with English subtitles.\\" \\"Right, so I can watch them during my schedule in Korea. And also about this actor Kang Woojin.\\" \\"Well, if it turns out you're going to appear on that channel.\\" The blonde Cara smiled faintly. \\"I'm counting on you again, Jonathan.\\" That was it. The buzz cut manager, recalling Cara's smile, returned to reality, to the sofa in the living room of the house. Then he asked the foreign employees sitting next to him. \\"How much research has been done on the Korean actor Kang Woojin, 'Kang Woojin's Sub-Character' channel?\\" The quick answer came from a freckled woman. \\"It's a bit rushed, but this should be enough for Cara to see.\\" She passed the tablet to the buzz cut manager. Then. \\"But there's something strange about this Korean actor Kang Woojin.\\" \\"Hm? Why. Did he commit a crime in the past or something?\\" \\"Of course not. It's not that, but the more you know, the more absurd his filmography is. Just look at the data, Jonathan.\\" The buzz cut manager, who had been looking at her for a moment, turned his gaze to the tablet. The screen displayed a brief research chart about Kang Woojin. However, the content was not simple. Although there's a difference between Korea and Hollywood, Kang Woojin's entire filmography displayed on the tablet was comparable to a mid-career level or above in Hollywood. Soon, the buzz cut manager, stroking his chin in admiration. \\"Oh- he's an actor with a more solid filmography than I thought. I've heard of Director Kwon Gitaek. And there's Director Tanoguchi Kyotaro too. Did he expand to Japan? That's impressive? He's worked with Korean masters.\\" \\"He hit home runs with all the Korean works he's been in.\\" \\"He even has such a big YouTube channel. Was he top-tier?\\" The freckled woman changed the atmosphere in an instant. \\"All of that was achieved in just one year after his debut.\\" Interest was written all over the buzz cut manager's face, and shock quickly spread. \\"What, what did you say?\\" Meanwhile, in the largest room on the second floor of the house. At a glance, the lavish room lacked nothing. A bed, TV, refrigerator, dining table and table, sofa, bathroom, etc. It was more than enough for one person to live in. On the sofa in that room, a woman with long blonde hair lay on the bed. It was Miley Cara. However, she wasn't lost in sleep but was lying face down watching TV. Specifically, the Korean drama 'Profiler Hanryang'. It seemed to be connected to Netflix. Of course, it included English subtitles, and the current scene on the screen was showing an interrogation of 'Assistant Manager Park'. Cara, with a slightly cold face, couldn't take her eyes off 'Assistant Manager Park' on the TV. Why? Because the acting skills of Kang Woojin, the Korean actor with the 'Kang Woojin's Sub-Character', were beyond imagination. '······Is that really him? It feels completely different from the cover videos.' At that moment. -Knock knock knock. There was a knock on the door. As a result, Cara, who had paused Hanryang, got up and arranged her long blonde hair before opening the door. There stood the buzz cut manager with a good build. \\"Yes, Jonathan.\\" The buzz cut manager, who had brought the tablet, spoke to Cara in a very serious tone in English. \\"Cara, take a look at this.\\" \\"What is it?\\" \\"It's about Kang Woojin.\\" \\"Already?\\" \\"Kang Woojin, this Korean actor, has a lot of interesting points. Before I explain, take a look at this video.\\" Cara, with a furrowed brow, looked down at the screen of the tablet she received. The tablet displayed a video. The protagonist was, of course, Kang Woojin. As Cara watched the video for a moment, confusion spread across her calm face. While keeping her gaze on the video, she asked the manager in a low voice. \\"What's this? Is this an action movie scene?\\" The buzz cut manager shook his head. \\"No, it's real. And it happened just a few days ago.\\" A few days later, on the 13th, in Hollywood, LA. A late morning. The location was Hollywood, known as the heartland of movies. In the center of Hollywood was the 5-star Beverly Hills Hotel. As expected of a 5-star luxury hotel, the lobby was filled with impressive figures, and beyond the bustling first-floor lobby, the atmosphere changed completely as one moved to the back of the hotel. The outdoor garden, decorated like a beach, was overflowing with leisure. There were many foreigners enjoying swimming in the pool or sunbathing. Among the many beach benches in the middle. \\"······\\" A man with a protruding belly and sunglasses stood out. He had a look that reminded one of Santa Claus. His hair color was somewhere between yellow and white. The man seemed to be lying on the bench, enjoying sunbathing. That's when it happened. \\"Director.\\" A woman's voice reached the Santa-like man. Soon, a woman in a brown bob-cut suit appeared as the man turned his head. As soon as he saw her, the Santa-like man went back to enjoying his sunbathing. \\"You woke up early.\\" \\"Did you throw your phone into the swimming pool?\\" \\"Of course not. It should be in the locker.\\" \\"Why don't you stay somewhere visible at least?\\" \\"If I catch the eye of a casting director, it'll just increase my workload.\\" The woman sighed and shook her head, but she changed the subject. \\"I've been monitoring Asian actors as you instructed, Director.\\" \\"See, I told you it would increase the workload.\\" \\"······As expected, there are many from the martial arts field in China.\\" \\"That makes sense.\\" \\"But do you remember the Korean actor you mentioned before?\\" \\"Hm? Who was it?\\" \\"The one who stood out at the 'Mise-en-scène International Film Festival' in Korea. The actor Kang Woojin.\\" \\"Ah, yes, I remember.\\" \\"The recent news about that actor—\\" The bob-cut woman took a step closer to the lying Santa and said. \\"There's an interesting video circulating on YouTube, him subduing a thug.\\" < United States (9) > End"},{"instruction":"< 별종 (3) > 대기실 옆 스튜디오. 모든 준비가 끝난, 이제 곧 스크린 테스트가 진행될 스튜디오 중앙엔 두 명의 남자가 섰다. 한 명은 방금 도착한 중국 배우. 이름은 왕방이었고 의상은 정장이다. 키는 강우진과 비슷한데 생긴 것이 약간 뾰족한 느낌. 남은 한 명은 회색 반팔을 입은 외국인 남자였다. 옆에 선 왕방과는 대비되는 체격이었다. 키는 거의 똑같지만, 옷 밖으로 드러나는 팔뚝이나 가슴 근육이 탄탄했다. 머리는 짧고 얼굴은 각졌다. 당연했다. 그가 바로 ‘라스크 킬3’의 무술을 맡은 스턴트 팀의 리더였으니까. 이름은 개리 펙. 그는 업계에서도 유명한 인물이었다. 헐리웃에선 개리를 스턴트 코디네이터라 부른다. 한국으로 치면 무술 감독과 같다. 하는 일은 거의 동일. 그렇기에 ‘라스크 킬3’의 모든 액션씬은 개리의 손을 거치게 되고, ‘라스트 킬’ 시리즈의 전체 무술은 그가 도맡았다. 따라서 무술이 가미된 이번 스크린 테스트엔 그의 역할이 핵심이었고, 거울을 대신할 칸막이를 확인하던 그가. -스윽. 중국 배우 왕방에게 시선을 맞췄다. “쪽대본은 얼마나 숙지했습니까. 무리한다고 높게 평가되는 게 아니니 솔직하게 말해보세요.” 던져진 영어에 왕방이 고개를 한 번 끄덕였다. “전체 동선이 기억날 정돕니다, 하지만 너무 빠르다면 버벅댈 수 있습니다.” “알았어요. 그럼 본인이 원하는 속도로 움직이시고 힘들면 바로 움직임을 멈추세요. 다시 말하지만 무술보다는 마스크가 스크린에 어떻게 보이는지를 확인하는 테스틉니다.” “네, 이해하고 있습니다.” 대답을 들은 스턴트 코디네이터 개리가 왕방의 머리부터 발끝까지를 천천히 스캔했다. ‘라스트 킬’ 시리즈의 모든 무술 콘티를 짠 그였다. 워낙에 베테랑이기에 배우가 평소에 보이는 아우라만 훑어도 어느 정도 판단이 섰다. ‘······생긴 건 조금 부족해. 하지만 체격은 비슷하군. 눈빛은 조금 아쉬워. 가진 힘이 약해. 무의식의 움직임도 약간 흐물흐물하고.’ 이미지 결과는 불합격. 허나 최종적인 결정은 감독인 조지 멘데스가 할 뿐. 액션 총괄인 개리는 그저 고민에 도움을 주는 게 전부였다. 곧. -스윽. 왕방의 상태 확인이 끝난 개리가 정면 기다란 책상을 향해 엄지를 추켜세웠다. 시작해도 된다는 뜻. 덕분에 산타를 닮은 조지 감독이 시선을 앞쪽 모니터에 붙였다. 모니터엔 이미 왕방과 개리의 정면, 측면, 후면 등이 출력되고 있었다. “나쁘진 않군.” 그의 혼잣말을 양옆에 앉은 사내들이 거든다. 영화사 간부들이었다. “하지만 원하던 그림은 아니잖아. 중국 쪽엔 한 달 전에 대본을 보내지 않았나?” “몸을 만들 시간이 부족했다지만, 한 달간 준비해서 저 정도 텐션이면- 준비를 덜 했어.” “한 달로 저 상태면······흠, 조지 감독. 한국 배우에게 오늘 테스트를 전달한 게 며칠 전이라며. 시간을 쓸 이유가 있나?” “그리고 이번 한국 배우를 끼는 것처럼 변화를 줄 생각이라면 미리 말을 해줬으면 좋겠군.” 잔소리. 여기 오기 전에도 비슷한 말을 들은 조지 감독이었다. “그 한국 배우는 그저 곁다리라고. 타이밍이 맞아서 온 거니까, 변화라고 부를 정도가 아니야.” 따라서 적당히 무시한 그가 시선은 모니터에 둔 채 영어로 외쳤다. “테스트 갑시다!” 그러자 뒤쪽 수십 스탭 중 여자 스탭 한 명이 스튜디오 중앙으로 뛰었다. 그녀가 슬레이트를 치자마자 왕방이 정면을 본다. 정확하게는 세 걸음 앞 개리를 보는 것. 그저 응시하는 것만이 아닌 연기가 시작됐다. 그의 눈엔 명확한 살기가 서려 있어야 했다. 그것을 개리는 실물로, 조지 감독은 모니터로 확인한다. ‘음, 눈빛의 무게감이 부족해. 무섭진 않아. 살기보다는 미움의 정도.’ 순간, 개리를 노려보던 중국 배우 왕방이 발을 움직인다. 원래라면 대사는 있다. 하지만 왕방은 긴장한 탓에 대사는 잊은 듯 보였고, 그가 지척의 개리의 목 부근에 손을 뻗었다. -팍! 속도는 어중간하다. 빠르지도 느리지도 않다. 액션이라기보단 사전 리허설같은 그림. 그래도 개리는 차분히 왕방의 주먹을 받아 준다. 목으로 뻗어지는 주먹을 잡아챈다. 손목을 꺾는다. 남은 손으로 왕방의 뒷목을 잡았다. 시선 분산. 진짜는 아래에서 치솟는 무릎. -퍽! 첫 한 방을 그대로 허용하는 왕방. 하지만 두 번째는 같은 무릎으로 쳐낸다. 점차 합을 맞추는 속도가 빨라진다. 다만. “컷, 됐어요.” 테스트 중간에 배 나온 조지 감독이 둘의 무술을 멈춰 세웠다. 그리곤 살짝 숨을 헐떡이는 왕방에게 요청했다. “왕방씨, 여기 정면 카메라를 보면서 제거할 대상을 생각해보세요.” “알겠습니다.” “그냥 생각만 하라는 게 아니라 덤비기 직전의 감정을 눈에 담아서.” “······” 뒤로 약 10초. “오케이, 됐습니다.” 테스트 끝을 알린 조지 감독이 작게 읊조렸다. “저 친구는 패스.” 이후. 다음 타자가 스튜디오에 들어선다. 이번에도 중국 배우였다. 원래 오늘 테스트 자체가 중국 배우들만 보려 했던 것이기에 당연했다. 이번 배우도 왕방과 같은 과정을 겪는다. 스턴트 코디네이터 개리의 검사 후 조지 감독의 신호. “액션.” 스튜디오에 울리는 슬레이트 소음, 모니터에 출력되는 배우의 모습, 절도있는 무술, 지켜보는 감독 포함 수십 관계자와 스탭들. 그렇게 테스트는 점차 속도를 높인다. 이번 중국 배우는 왕방과는 반대로 매우 준수한 평가를 받았다. “좋은데?” “음, 확실한 동선도 그렇고. 준비를 제대로 해왔어.” “마스크도, 모니터에도 잘 어울려.” 같은 중국 배우들이겠지만, 그들끼리도 경쟁이었다. 아마 모르긴 몰라도 이 조·단역을 먹기 위해 수천의 후보가 지워졌을 테고, 그 사이에서 가장 역할에 어울리는 배우 3명이 뽑힌 거겠지. 뒤로 세 번째 중국 배우까지 등장했다. 이번에도 평은 좋았다. 두 번째 배우와 비슷하거나 조금 더 나은 수준. 덕분에 모니터 보는 조지 감독의 표정이 조금씩 밝아진다. 주변에 앉은 간부들 역시 마찬가지. 어느새 캐디, 프로듀서 팀이 포함된 수십 스탭들은 배우의 열연에 박수까지 친다. -짝짝짝짝짝짝짝! 살짝 숨차 보이는 개리가 중국 배우에게 엄지를 들어 보였다. “잘하셨습니다, 호흡이나 눈빛이 좋았어요.” “감사합니다.” 곧, 세 번째 중국 배우가 스튜디오를 빠져나간다. 이윽고 다음 차례에 올 배우를 쑥덕대는 스탭들. “다음인가?” “응, 이번이 그 한국 배우야.” “두 번째, 세 번째 중국 배우가 퀄리티가 좋아서 확 비교당할지도 모르겠어.” “근데 아까 살짝 보니까 외모는 제일 좋던데.” “아아, 맞아.” 그때. -스윽. 스튜디오 입구 쪽으로 한국 배우가 들어온다. 즉, 정장 입은 강우진. 그런 우진을 전제 스탭들이 힐끔댄다. 특히, 캐디 팀의 갈색 단발 매건과 프로듀서 팀의 흑인 조셉의 시선이 따갑다. 190 넘는 장신인 조셉은 우진에게 커다란 손을 흔들기도 했다. 결과적으론 시선 집중. 이 스튜디오에 모인 모든 외국인의 눈알이 차분히 들어서는 강우진을 따라 움직인다. 반면. “······” 무심한 얼굴인 우진은 흔들림 없이 올곧은 자세로 스튜디오 중앙에 섰다. 아무도 그의 알맹이를 눈치채진 못했다 '와, 개부담. 죄다 외국인이네! 완전 그냥 촬영이랑 똑같잖어??!' 곧, 그의 옆인 스턴트 코디네이터 개리가 강우진을 스캔했다. 얼굴만봐선 뭔가 좀 묘했다. 그리고 차갑다. ‘마스크, 분위기는 좋아. 빌런 연기를 해본 적 있는 건가? 독특한 냄새가 있어. 약간 사이코가 섞인 무게감이랄지.’ 속으로 읊조리던 개리가 우진에게 인사했다. “반가워요.” 강우진이 낮은 톤으로 답했다. 당연히 영어로. “안녕하세요, 강우진입니다.” “한국에서 액션컷을 좀 경험해 봤나요?” “메인은 아니었지만, 어느 정도 해봤다고 볼 수 있습니다. 준비 중이기도 하고요.” “······영어를 상당히 잘하시네요.” “감사합니다.” 적당한 대화긴 하지만, 그 속에서 느껴지는 우진의 유창한 영어는 조지 멘데스 감독은 물론 모두를 놀라게 했다. ‘오- 영어 실력이···더군다나 목소리도 좋네.’ ‘연습? 아니, 발음이나 여유로 볼 땐 미국에서 살았겠어.’ ‘중국 배우들도 부족하진 않았는데······이 한국 배우는 그들과 비교가 안 되는군.’ 워낙에 기대를 안 하는 공기였기에 단숨에 기대치가 올라간다. 초반부터 티격대던 메건과 조셉이 극찬 섞인 속삭임을 나눌 정도. “뭐야, 메건. 저 한국 배우······이름이 강우진? 잘생겼잖아. 그리고 저 여유는 또 뭐야? 데뷔한 지 얼마 안 됐길래 벌벌 떨줄 알았는데.” “말은 안 했지만, 저 배우는 한국에서 괴한을 직접 제압한 적이 있어. 하지만 생각 이상으로 차분한 것 같아.” “괴한? 그건 또 무슨 소리야.” 어쨌든 영어는 영어고 무술은 무술. 웅성대는 와중 배 나온 조지 감독이 강우진의 옆에 선 개리에게 시선을 보냈다. 시작하라는 뜻. 곧, 근육 탄탄한 개리가 우진에게 물었다. “쪽대본은 얼마나 숙지했습니까? 아- 그렇지. 이 테스트를 전달받은 게 며칠 전이라고 했나요? 그럼 무술보다는 카메라 무빙 위주로.” “아닙니다, 편하게 하셔도 됩니다.” “예? 아니, 그건 내 쪽에서 할 말······” “그렇습니까? 쪽대본은 모두 숙지했고 소화하는 건 문제 없다는 뜻이었습니다.” “오, 오케이. 그럼 원하는 정도로 시작하세요. 절대 무리를 하지 마시고.” “알겠습니다.” 강우진이 덤덤하게 답하자 개리가 미간을 살짝 좁혔고. ‘뭐지 이 여유? 어차피 부족한 거 아니까 자신감이라도 챙겨온 건가? 어쨌든 파악이 힘든 배우인 건 확실해.’ 일단, 정면 테이블의 조지에게 엄지를 보였다. 이어진 감독의 사인. “액션.” 달려오는 여자 스탭이 친 슬레이트. 뒤로. -스으. 짧은 순간 그 누구도 눈치채지 못할 속도로 배역을 끌어올린, 각인된 ‘무술’을 온 혈관에 퍼트린 강우진이 돌연 눈을 감았다. 그리곤 숨을 깊게 들이마셨다. “스읍- 후.” 앞선 중국 배우 중 누구도 하지 않은 행동이었다. 허나, 강우진은 막힘없이 연기를 이어간다. 어느새 그의 주변에 맴돌던 공기가 차분해졌다. 이내. “······” 차가우면서도 소름 돋게끔 평온한 얼굴인 강우진이 천천히 눈을 뜬다. 바로 보이는 개리. 그를 확인한 우진이 잠시간 옅은 호흡을 유지한다. 시선을 개리를 응시. 점차 강우진의 눈동자에 진한 무언가가 응집된다. 목적 또는 살의. 완성된 그것이 우진의 눈을 타고 시선으로 쏘아진다. 어느새 강우진을 감싼 차분한 공기엔 살기가 실렸다. 순간, 눈썹을 움찔한 개리의 긴장감이 치솟는다. 오늘 테스트 중 처음 있는 일. ‘주변이 변한 게 아니다. 이건 저 한국 배우가 만들어낸 공기.’ 연기. 그래, 연기다. 하지만 어째선지 개리는 연기라는 것을 점차 잊고 있었다. 하지만 본인이 사냥감으로 지목당했다는 것은 명확해졌다. 그 순간. -슥. 멈춰 있던 강우진이 발을 내딛는다. 성큼성큼. 걸음에 고민이 없다. 그 거침없는 에너지가 내뿜는 살기와 합쳐진다. 개리는 저도 모르게. -스륵. 한 발을 뒤쪽으로 뺐다. 준비 자세였다. 그러거나 말거나 지척까지 다가온 강우진은 어떠한 준비 단계나 눈빛 없이 오른팔을 내뻗었다. 목표는 개리의 목. 그러나 실패. 하지만 강우진의 손은 개리의 목 대신 멱살을 잡았다. 표정은 여전히 굳었으며 모든 행동은 끊어지는 절도가 서렸다. 잡힌 멱살을 왼손으로 잡은 개리가 우진의 뒷목을 잡았다. 내리 끌어라. -팍! 치솟는 무릎을 우진이 같은 무릎으로 쳐냈다. 그리곤 뒷목을 잡은 손을 잡아 비튼다. 작게 퍼지는 개리의 신음. “흡!” 우진이 잡은 손을 빠르게 반대로 돌린다. 자연스레 몸이 돌아가는 개리. 등이 훤하다. 우진의 무릎이 신속하게 올라간다. 옆구리 중 물렁한 곳을 노린다. -퍽! 퍽! 두 번을 허용했지만 개리가 꺾인 팔을 반대로 돌려 포박을 풀어냈다. 그가 강우진의 배를 찬다. 우진의 몸이 뒤로 밀린다. 개리는 곧바로 달려든다. 그 힘을 이용해 개리를 엎어 치기 하는 강우진. -파박!! 불리하다. 팔을 뻗기보단 막는다. 개리가 양손을 합쳐 얼굴을 가린다. 단단한 방패가 형성됐지만, 우진은 아랑곳없이 방패로 가려진 그의 얼굴의 옆쪽을 팔꿈치로 찍는다. 한번 그리고 또 한 번. 그다음 퍼억 소리가 들렸다. 개리가 양발을 들어 우진의 얼굴을 감싸 옆으로 던졌으니까. 강우진이 휙 하니 날아간다. 개리가 재빨리 몸을 올려 자세를 잡는다. “허으!” 두 걸음 정도로 떨어진 우진은 휙 하고 일어나 다시금 개리에게 성큼성큼 걸어간다. 고민이 없는 게 아니라 애초에 그의 뇌 속엔 ‘살해’만이 존재하는 표정이었다. 제거, 제거, 제거. 오직 제거 뿐. 다시금 강우진과 개리가 마주한다. 허나 이번엔 둘 다 바로 덤비진 않는다. 서로의 폼을 확인했으니까. 우진이나 개리는 서로의 눈을 응시하며 양팔을 허공에서 흔든다. 무엇이 당도하든 잡아채겠다는 생각이었다. 먼저 움직인 건 개리였다. -훅!! 그가 우진의 벌린 다리 사이 낭심에 발을 찬다. 강우진이 무릎으로 막았다. 그리곤 곧바로 개리의 뻗어진 발을 붙잡아 바닥에 밀어낸다. 금세 뒤엉키는 둘. “헙!” “······” 빠른 호흡과 무표정인 강우진이 다음 동작을 하려던 때였다. “커, 컷!!!” 익숙한 남자의 외침이 들린다. 조지 멘데스 감독이었다. 보니 두 눈이 디립다 확장됐다. 마치, 충격받은 산타클로스 같다. 그런 커진 눈으로 모니터 속 강우진과 현실 강우진을 번갈아 보는 조지 감독. ‘······세상에.’ 홀렸다. 딱 그런 표정이었다. 캐디 팀의 메건과 프로듀서 조셉 등 이 스튜디오에 있는 외국인 전체가 같은 얼굴이다. 입을 벌린지도 모르는 스탭도 많았다. 방금 두 눈으로 본 게 뭔가 싶어서. 동시에 모니터를 뚫어져라 보던 조지 감독이 커진 눈을 움직였다. 스튜디오 중앙의 강우진을 본 것. 그는 이미 개리와 함께 일어나 정장을 털고 있었다. “가, 강우진씨 촬영은 내년 6월······부터 시작될 겁니다.” “예.” “지금 보인 배역은 8월 정도부터 팀에 합류하게 될 겁니다. 그전엔 배우들과 액션 합 연습을 할 거고.” “······” “그 배역은 당신의 것입니다. 완벽해요. 원랜 회의가 필요하겠지만, 우진씨는 그럴 필요가 없을 것 같아요. 개인적으로는 4월부터 합류해줬으면 좋겠는데.” 한마디로 네가 1등이고 합격이란 소리. 스탭들이 웅성댄다. 애초 이런 일이 처음이니 당연했다. 단박에 배역을 따내는 건 어지간하게 반하지 않고선 불가능했다. 스크린 테스트가 끝이 아니니까. 하지만 방금 한국의 배우가 헐리웃 첫 시도 만에 배역을 따냈다. 조·단역이지만 해냈다. 보통이면 양팔 벌려 환호해야 맞다. 하지만. “음.” 무심한 얼굴인 강우진이 작게 얼굴을 꺾는다. 그리곤 뭔가 속으로 계산하기 시작했다. 다만, 시간이 길진 않았다. 딱 5초. 강우진의 낮은 목소리가 뱉어진 건 정확히 5초 뒤였고. “아- 그러면 전 힘들겠습니다. 기회가 되면 다음에 뵈는 게 좋을 것 같습니다.” 멍 때리던 조지 감독이 두 눈을 끔뻑였다. “뭐, 뭐라고요?” 이때 뒤쪽 스탭 중, 프로듀서 총괄인 장신의 흑인 조셉이 작게 풉 하고 웃어버렸다. “크큭, 세상에. 뭐라는 거야 저 별종이.” 강우진이 헐리웃의 첫 배역을 깠으니까. < 별종 (3) > 끝","output":"< Mutant (3) > Next to the waiting room was the studio. In the center of the studio, where all preparations were complete and the screen test was about to begin, stood two men. One was a Chinese actor who had just arrived. His name was Wang Bang, and he was dressed in a suit. He was about the same height as Kang Woojin, but his features were slightly sharp. The other was a foreign man wearing a gray short-sleeved shirt. He had a contrasting physique to Wang Bang standing next to him. Although almost the same height, the muscles on his forearms and chest that showed through his clothes were solid. His hair was short and his face was chiseled. Naturally. He was the leader of the stunt team for 'Rask Kill 3'. His name was Gary Peck. He was a well-known figure in the industry. In Hollywood, Gary was called a stunt coordinator. In Korea, this would be similar to a martial arts director. The job was almost the same. Therefore, all the action scenes in 'Rask Kill 3' went through Gary's hands, and he was in charge of all the martial arts in the 'Last Kill' series. Therefore, his role was crucial in this screen test that included martial arts, and as he checked the partition that would serve as a mirror, he— -Swish. Locked eyes with the Chinese actor Wang Bang. \\"How well have you memorized the sides? Being overzealous won't get you a higher score, so be honest.\\" Wang Bang nodded once in response to the English question. \\"I remember the entire movement, but if it's too fast, I might stumble.\\" \\"Alright. Then move at your own pace, and if it gets tough, stop immediately. Again, this test is more about how the mask looks on screen than the martial arts.\\" \\"Yes, I understand.\\" After hearing the answer, stunt coordinator Gary scanned Wang Bang from head to toe. He had planned all the martial arts sequences for the 'Last Kill' series. Being a veteran, he could make a fair judgment just by scanning the aura that the actor usually displayed. '...He looks a bit lacking. But the physique is similar. The eyes are a bit disappointing. The power he possesses is weak. His unconscious movements are also somewhat flimsy.' The image result was a fail. However, the final decision was up to the director, George Mendes. As the action director, Gary was only there to help with the decision-making. Soon. -Swish. After checking Wang Bang's condition, Gary gave a thumbs-up towards the long desk in front. It was a signal to start. Thanks to that, Santa-like director George focused his gaze on the monitor in front of him. The monitor already displayed Wang Bang and Gary's front, side, and rear views. \\"Not bad.\\" His muttering was picked up by the men sitting on either side of him. They were executives from the film company. \\"But it's not the picture we wanted. Didn't we send the script to China a month ago?\\" \\"They said there wasn't enough time to build the body, but if that's the level of tension after a month of preparation— they didn't prepare enough.\\" \\"If that's the state after a month... Hmm, Director George. You said you delivered the test to the Korean actor just a few days ago. Is there a reason to spend time on this?\\" \\"And if you're thinking of making a change like including this Korean actor, I wish you would have told us in advance.\\" Nagging. Director George had heard similar words before coming here. \\"That Korean actor is just a side note. He came because the timing was right, so it's not enough to call it a change.\\" Therefore, he ignored them appropriately and shouted in English, keeping his gaze on the monitor. \\"Let's start the test!\\" Then, one of the dozens of staff members in the back, a female staff member, ran to the center of the studio. As soon as she clapped the slate, Wang Bang looked straight ahead. Precisely at Gary, who was three steps in front of him. It wasn't just a gaze; the acting had started. His eyes needed to show clear murderous intent. Gary checked this in person, while director George confirmed it through the monitor. 'Hmm, the weight in his eyes is lacking. It's not scary. It's more like hatred than murderous intent.' Suddenly, the Chinese actor Wang Bang, who had been glaring at Gary, moved his feet. There should have been lines, but Wang Bang seemed to have forgotten them due to nervousness, and he reached out his hand towards Gary's neck. -Whack! The speed was mediocre. Neither fast nor slow. It looked more like a rehearsal than action. Still, Gary calmly received Wang Bang's fist. He caught the punch aimed at his neck. He twisted the wrist. With his other hand, he grabbed the back of Wang Bang's neck. Distracting the focus. The real attack was the knee rising from below. -Thump! Wang Bang allowed the first hit to land, but he blocked the second with the same knee. The pace of their coordination gradually quickened. However. \\"Cut, that's enough.\\" In the middle of the test, the pot-bellied director George stopped their martial arts. He then asked Wang Bang, who was slightly panting. \\"Mr. Wang Bang, look at the camera in front of you and think about your target.\\" \\"Understood.\\" \\"It's not just thinking; capture the emotion of being about to attack in your eyes.\\" \\"······\\" After about 10 seconds. \\"Okay, that's it.\\" Director George, who announced the end of the test, muttered softly. \\"Let's pass on this guy.\\" Afterward. The next candidate entered the studio. It was another Chinese actor. It was natural since today's test was originally intended only for Chinese actors. This actor went through the same process as Wang Bang. After being inspected by stunt coordinator Gary, director George gave the signal. \\"Action.\\" The noise of the slate echoed in the studio, the actor's image displayed on the monitor, the precise martial arts, and the dozens of officials and staff, including the director, watching. Thus, the test gradually picked up speed. This Chinese actor received a very favorable evaluation, unlike Wang Bang. \\"Not bad?\\" \\"Yes, the clear movement is good. He came well-prepared.\\" \\"The mask fits well on the monitor too.\\" Although they were all Chinese actors, it was a competition among them. Probably, thousands of candidates had been eliminated in the process, and the three most suitable actors for the role had been selected. Then the third Chinese actor appeared. The evaluation was good again. Similar or slightly better than the second actor. Thanks to that, director George's expression brightened as he watched the monitor. The executives sitting around him felt the same. Soon, the dozens of staff, including the caddy and producer teams, even applauded the actor's performance. -Clap clap clap clap clap! Gary, who looked slightly out of breath, gave the Chinese actor a thumbs-up. \\"You did well, the breathing and the look in your eyes were good.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Soon, the third Chinese actor left the studio. The staff began to whisper about the next actor in line. \\"Is it the next one?\\" \\"Yeah, this time it's that Korean actor.\\" \\"The second and third Chinese actors were of good quality, so he might be starkly compared.\\" \\"But I saw him briefly earlier, and he was the best-looking.\\" \\"Ah, right.\\" Then. -Swish. The Korean actor entered the studio. In other words, Kang Woojin in a suit. All the staff glanced at him. Especially, Megan from the caddy team with brown bobbed hair and Joseph from the producer team, a black man, had intense gazes. Joseph, who was over 190 cm tall, even waved his large hand at Woojin. As a result, the focus was on him. All the eyes of the foreigners gathered in this studio followed Kang Woojin as he calmly entered. Meanwhile. \\"······\\" Woojin, with an indifferent face, stood upright in the center of the studio. No one noticed the core of his being. 'Wow, what a burden. They're all foreigners! Isn't this just like a real shoot??!' Soon, stunt coordinator Gary, who was next to Woojin, scanned him. His face alone was a bit peculiar. And it was cold. 'The mask, the atmosphere is good. Has he done villain acting before? There's a unique scent. A weight mixed with a bit of psychopathy.' Gary, who was muttering to himself, greeted Woojin. \\"Nice to meet you.\\" Kang Woojin responded in a low tone. Naturally, in English. \\"Hello, I'm Kang Woojin.\\" \\"Have you had any experience with action cuts in Korea?\\" \\"Not as the main, but I could say I've done it to some extent. I'm also preparing.\\" \\"······You speak English quite well.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Although it was a suitable conversation, Woojin's fluent English surprised everyone, including director George Mendes. 'Oh- his English skills... and even his voice is good.' 'Practice? No, judging by his pronunciation and composure, he must have lived in the U.S.' 'The Chinese actors weren't lacking... but this Korean actor is incomparable to them.' The atmosphere, which had no expectations, suddenly raised expectations. Megan and Joseph, who had been bickering at the start, shared whispers filled with praise. \\"What's up, Megan. That Korean actor... Kang Woojin? He's handsome. And what's with that composure? I thought he'd be trembling since he's new.\\" \\"I didn't say it, but that actor has personally subdued a thug in Korea. But he seems calmer than I thought.\\" \\"A thug? What are you talking about?\\" Anyway, English is English, and martial arts are martial arts. Amidst the murmuring, the pot-bellied director George sent a look to Gary standing next to Woojin. It was a sign to start. Soon, the muscular Gary asked Woojin. \\"How well have you memorized the sides? Ah—right. You received this test just a few days ago, didn't you? Then let's focus more on camera movement than martial arts.\\" \\"It's okay, you can proceed comfortably.\\" \\"Yes? No, that's what I should be saying...\\" \\"That's right? I've memorized all the sides, and there's no problem with performing them.\\" \\"Oh, okay. Then start as you wish. Don't push yourself too hard.\\" As Kang Woojin calmly replied, Gary slightly furrowed his brow. 'What's with this composure? He's probably just trying to hold onto his confidence since he's lacking anyway. Anyway, he's definitely a hard actor to read.' For now, he gave a thumbs-up to director George at the front table. The director's sign followed. \\"Action.\\" The female staff member who ran and clapped the slate. Behind. -Swish. In a brief moment, Kang Woojin, who had spread the 'martial arts' engraved in his veins at a speed no one could notice, suddenly closed his eyes. Then he took a deep breath. \\"Sigh—hoo.\\" It was an action that none of the previous Chinese actors had taken. However, Woojin continued his performance without any blockage. The air that had been swirling around him had become calm. Then. \\"······\\" Kang Woojin, with a cold yet eerily calm face, slowly opened his eyes. Gary was right in front of him. Woojin maintained a faint breath for a moment after spotting him. He stared at Gary. Gradually, something intense condensed in Woojin's pupils. Purpose or murderous intent. That completed form shot through Woojin's eyes as a gaze. The calm air that had enveloped Woojin was now filled with murderous intent. Suddenly, Gary, who had flinched his eyebrows, felt a surge of tension. It was the first time during today's test. 'It's not the surroundings that have changed. This Korean actor created this atmosphere.' Acting. Yes, acting. But somehow, Gary was gradually forgetting that it was acting. However, it became clear to him that he had been marked as prey. At that moment. -Swoosh. The stationary Kang Woojin stepped forward. Striding. There was no hesitation in his steps. The relentless energy he exuded merged with the murderous intent. Gary, unknowingly. -Slide. Took a step back. It was a ready stance. Regardless, Kang Woojin, who had approached close, extended his right arm without any preparatory steps or gaze. The target was Gary's neck. However, it failed. But Woojin's hand, instead of grabbing Gary's neck, caught his collar. His expression remained stern, and all his actions were sharp and decisive. Gary, who had grabbed the collar, caught Woojin's neck. Pull down. -Whack! Woojin blocked the rising knee with the same knee. Then he quickly twisted the hand he had caught. Gary's body naturally turned as he was twisted. His back was exposed. Woojin's knee swiftly rose, aiming for a soft spot on the side. -Thump! Thump! Gary allowed two hits, but then he twisted his bent arm the other way to break free. He kicked Woojin's stomach. Woojin's body was pushed back. Gary immediately rushed in. Woojin used that momentum to flip Gary over. -Bam!! It was disadvantageous. Instead of extending his arms, he defended. Gary clasped his hands together to shield his face. A solid shield was formed, but Woojin didn't care and struck the side of Gary's face, hidden behind the shield, with his elbow. Once and then again. Then there was a thud. Gary lifted both legs and wrapped them around Woojin's face, throwing him to the side. Kang Woojin was flung away. Gary quickly got up and took his stance. \\"Huff!\\" Woojin, who had been thrown a couple of steps away, swiftly got up and walked towards Gary again. It wasn't that he had no hesitation; his expression was solely filled with 'murder'. Eliminate, eliminate, eliminate. Only elimination. Kang Woojin and Gary faced each other again. However, this time neither of them immediately attacked. They had checked each other's form. Both Woojin and Gary waved their arms in the air, ready to catch whatever came their way. Gary moved first. -Hook!! He kicked towards the groin between Woojin's open legs. Kang Woojin blocked it with his knee. Then he immediately grabbed Gary's extended foot and pushed him to the ground. The two became entangled. \\"Hup!\\" \\"······\\" Kang Woojin, with a blank expression and rapid breathing, was about to make his next move. \\"Cu-cut!!!\\" A familiar man's shout was heard. It was director George Mendes. His eyes were dilated in shock. Like a Santa Claus who had received a shock, he alternated his enlarged eyes between the monitor's Kang Woojin and the real Kang Woojin. '...My goodness.' He was mesmerized. That was the expression on his face. Megan from the caddy team, producer Joseph, and all the foreigners in the studio had the same look. Many staff members didn't even realize their mouths were agape. Wondering what they had just seen with their own eyes. At the same time, director George, who had been staring intently at the monitor, moved his enlarged eyes. He looked at Kang Woojin in the center of the studio. He was already standing up with Gary, dusting off his suit. \\"Mr. Kang Woojin, filming will start... from June next year.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"You will join the team around August for the role you've shown today. Before that, you'll practice action sequences with the actors.\\" \\"······\\" \\"That role is yours. It was perfect. Normally, we would need a meeting, but I don't think that's necessary for you, Woojin. Personally, I'd like you to join us from April.\\" In other words, you're the top choice and you've passed. The staff murmured. It was natural since this was unprecedented. It was impossible to land a role so quickly without being extremely impressed. The screen test wasn't the end. But just now, a Korean actor had landed a role in Hollywood on his first attempt. It was a supporting role, but he did it. Normally, one would throw their arms up in celebration. However. \\"Hmm.\\" Kang Woojin, with an indifferent face, slightly tilted his head. Then he began to calculate something internally. However, it didn't take long. Just 5 seconds. Kang Woojin's low voice was uttered precisely 5 seconds later. \\"Ah—then I'm afraid it will be difficult for me. It would be better to meet again next time if the opportunity arises.\\" Director George, who had been in a daze, blinked his eyes. \\"What, what did you say?\\" At that moment, Joseph, the tall black man who was the producer's overall manager, chuckled softly from the back. \\"Kek, my goodness. What's that mutant saying.\\" Kang Woojin had turned down his first role in Hollywood. < Mutant (3) > End"},{"instruction":"привет, как проверить код на php + html: вот часть <div class=\\"top_block\\"> <?CMax::showContactImg();?> <?if(arPhotos):?> <!-- noindex--> <div class=\\"gallery_wrap swipeignore\\"> <?//gallery?> <div class=\\"big-gallery-block text-center\\"> <div class=\\"owl-carousel owl-theme owl-bg-nav short-nav\\" data-slider=\\"content-detail-gallery__slider\\" data-plugin-options=\\"{&quot;items&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;autoplay&quot; : false, &quot;autoplayTimeout&quot; : &quot;3000&quot;, &quot;smartSpeed&quot;:1000, &quot;dots&quot;: true, &quot;nav&quot;: true, &quot;loop&quot;: false, &quot;rewind&quot;:true, &quot;margin&quot;: 10}\\"> <?foreach(arPhotos as i => arPhoto):?> <div class=\\"item\\"> <a href=\\"<?=arPhoto['ORIGINAL']?>\\" class=\\"fancy\\" data-fancybox=\\"item_slider\\" target=\\"_blank\\" title=\\"<?=arPhoto['DESCRIPTION']?> \\"> <img src=\\"<?=arPhoto['PREVIEW']['src']?>\\" data-src=\\"<span id=\\" title=\\" Код PHP: &lt;?=arPhoto['PREVIEW']['src']?&gt;\\" class=\\"bxhtmled-surrogate\\">&nbsp;<span id=\\"title=\\" Код=\\"null\\" php:=\\"\\" class=\\"bxhtmled-surrogate\\" title=\\"Код PHP: &lt;?=AsproFunctionsCAsproMax::showBlankImg(arPhoto['PREVIEW']['src']);?&gt;\\"><?=AsproFunctionsCAsproMax::showBlankImg(arPhoto['PREVIEW']['src']);?><span class=\\"bxhtmled-surrogate-inner\\"><span class=\\"bxhtmled-right-side-item-icon\\"></span><span class=\\"bxhtmled-comp-lable\\" unselectable=\\"on\\" spellcheck=\\"false\\">Код PHP</span></span></span> <span class=\\"bxhtmled-surrogate-inner\\"><span class=\\"bxhtmled-right-side-item-icon\\"></span><span class=\\"bxhtmled-comp-lable\\" unselectable=\\"on\\" spellcheck=\\"false\\">Код PHP</span></span><?=arPhoto['DESCRIPTION']?><span class=\\"bxhtmled-surrogate-inner\\"><span class=\\"bxhtmled-right-side-item-icon\\"></span> <span class=\\"bxhtmled-comp-lable\\" unselectable=\\"on\\" spellcheck=\\"false\\"></span></span>&nbsp;</a> </div> <?endforeach;?> </div> </div> </div> <!-- /noindex--> <?endif;?> </div>","output":"Судя по тому, что вы предоставили, у вас есть часть кода PHP внедренная в HTML. Прежде чем приступить к проверке кода, вам нужно убедиться, что у вас есть следующее: 1. Установленный и работающий локальный сервер (например, XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP или LAMP), если вы хотите проверить код на своем компьютере. 2. Подключение к серверу, на котором установлен PHP, если вы хотите проверить код удаленно. Вот несколько шагов для проверки вашего кода: **Настройте локальное окружение:** - Установите локальный сервер и запустите его. - Поместите ваши файлы в директорию localhost (обычно это \`htdocs\` в XAMPP или \`www\` в WAMP). - Удостоверьтесь, что файл с вашим кодом имеет расширение \`.php\`. **Исправьте ошибки в коде:** - Кажется, что в коде есть ошибки с HTML разметкой (например, \`<span\` без закрывающей скобки). Вам нужно будет исправить эти проблемы. - HTML-теги и PHP-код должны быть правильно закрыты и соответствовать друг другу. **Тестируйте:** - Откройте браузер и введите URL, который указывает на ваш файл, например \`http://localhost/yourfile.php\`. - Если есть ошибки в PHP, они могут быть отображены в браузере, если включено отображение ошибок. Это можно сделать, добавив следующие строки в начало вашего PHP файла: \`\`\`php error_reporting(E_ALL); ini_set('display_errors', 1); \`\`\` **Отладка:** - Используйте \`var_dump()\` или \`print_r()\` для вывода содержимого переменных и помощи в отладке. - Осмотрите исходный код страницы в браузере, чтобы увидеть, как PHP код обрабатывается и что вставляется в HTML. **Использование валидаторов:** - Можете использовать какие-либо валидаторы HTML, например, онлайн сервис W3C Markup Validation Service, чтобы убедиться, что ваш HTML код корректен. - Для проверки PHP кода можно использовать инструменты статического анализа, такие как PHPStan или Psalm. **Запуск скриптов:** - Если в коде используются скрипты (например, JavaScript для карусели), убедитесь в том, что они правильно подключены и работают должным образом. Пожалуйста, учтите, что для полноценной проверки потребуется контекст выполнения кода (данные, которые возвращают функции PHP, настройки сервера и т.п.)."},{"instruction":"You are a specialized assistant who focus’s on analyzing writing styles and helping writers finish their novels.

Moments before, the humdrum atmosphere of his cramped Toronto apartment had encompassed his reality; the steady clicking of the keyboard, the soft glow of the desk lamp, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee had been the anchors of his tranquil evening. Now, he was adrift in a torrent of inexplicable phenomena. With a jarring thud, Jack landed on a bed of soft grass, the scent welcome after the sensory assault. Sitting up, he met an expanse of open air, the sky above painted in hues of twilight. It was a stark difference from the cityscape’s light pollution he had grown accustomed to. Here, stars seemed to pierce the veil of night with an intense clarity, and two moons, one crescent, and one full, hung with an ethereal presence that diffused a gentle, silvery light. Bewilderment took hold, and he scrambled to his feet, attempting to reconcile the swift change of environment. The landscape before him stretched into rolling hills, dotted with the silhouettes of great trees, and in the far distance, the outline of a towering castle cut against the skyline. ‘This can’t be real,’ Jack muttered to himself, a hand running through his hair as the weight of solitude pressed in around him. The silence was profound, the only sound his own ragged breathing and the whisper of a cool breeze. Part 2 - Jack is Lost Jack stumbled onward, unable to shake the disorientation. With each step, his skepticism battled the growing realization that his former life might be beyond his reach. As the sky shifted and stars turned, Jack’s practical nature demanded he scan the landscape for signs of civilization. The castle he had seen earlier felt like a distant mirage, its imposing form both enticing and daunting. “Hello?” he called out into the void, half-expecting the echo to answer back. The only response, however, was the rustle of leaves and the distant hoot of a nocturnal creature. The absence of human activity gnawed at him. There was no glowing screen to swipe for answers, no satellite-assisted map to dictate a path forward. Instead, Jack’s gaze fell to the grass beneath his feet, cradling him like a natural compass to some unknowable destiny. His meanderings lead him to what appeared to be remnants of an old road, overgrown with the antithesis of modernity. To one side, the way seemed to lead deeper into a more densely wooded area, and to the other, it gently sloped in the direction of a faint, inviting light. Choosing light over shadow, Jack willed his legs to carry him forward, ignoring the protest of his tattered spirit. Somewhere between the oppressive unknown and the seduction of light, Jack forced himself to take inventory of his unexpected valor in the face of the impossible. Part 3 - Jack Learns He Has a System The journey toward the ghostly illumination introduced Jack to the cacophony of nocturnal life. Every rustle, every nocturnal call put him on edge, heart rate spiking with the possibility of danger lurking in the veil of night. It was amidst this tension that the very fabric of the world seemed to shimmer, and a translucent panel materialized before him in the dark. “Welcome, Jack Genson,” the panel greeted in lettering that glowed with an inner luminescence. “You have been granted the System. Use your Status and Inventory to navigate this world and rise in power.” Confusion melded with a spark of fascination as Jack cautiously reached out a hand, half-expecting it to pass through the phantasmal interface. To his surprise, his touch prompted a change in the displayed script. “Status: Jack Genson Health: 100% Stamina: 75% Mana: 0% Skills: None Attributes: Inquire within Inventory: Empty” A skeptic in his world, Jack found his resistance crumbling against the evidence of the impossible. Yet, the message was clear—this 'System' was key to his survival and misfortune. A hard swipe of disbelief clung to him even as he navigated the interface, the sensation of touching something intangible warping the very notion of reality. 'Mana? Skills? What kind of game is this?' Jack pondered, his distress finding roots in a genre he'd known only through screens and pages. Part 4 - Jack Opens All the System Panels Steadying his breath to marshal the whirlwind of thoughts, Jack tentatively selected “Attributes.” The panel shifted, revealing several categories ascribed with numerical values, a strange mimicry of role-playing games he'd played just for distraction. “Strength: 10 Agility: 10 Vitality: 10 Intelligence: 10 Wisdom: 10 Charisma: 10 Luck: 10” An underlying pulse of power coursed through the words, and Jack couldn’t ignore the sensation of legitimacy that gripped him. These attributes were his in this domain, tools to carve a place for himself, perhaps even his return. With each breath growing steadier, clarity nudged at Jack's senses. This was an opportunity, not a condemnation. He pressed onwards, summoning the Inventory panel next: a simple slate, void of possessions, yet ringing with potential. Finally, a Quest log flashed into view, the word “Begin” faintly flickering, inviting him to engage with this newfound reality. Jack stood silent in the night, cradling a newfound sense of purpose against the fear. The System’s sleek design belied a complexity he yearned to understand. It promised growth and learning—concepts Jack clung to like life rafts in a sea of uncertainty.

It's clear you wish for a direct, immersive approach without any extraneous exposition or meta-commentary. Characters should be authentic to their environment, and the storytelling should stay within the natural perceptions and knowledge of the characters themselves. For a robust example, let's continue from an existing piece of narrative, assuming the last chapter ended with our protagonist, Sir Cedric, being informed of a mysterious figure lurking in the outskirts of the village. Remember to provide any relevant style references or existing text excerpts for more tailored writing. --- Chapter XVII The evening had crept upon the village like a cautious intruder, painting the sky in muted hues of gold and purple. Sir Cedric clutched the hilt of his sword, the leather grip familiar against his palm. His gaze was fixed on the thicket beyond the last thatched-roof cottage. Alyce, the village healer, fell into step beside him, her brow furrowed with worry. \\"Do you reckon it's another one of Astor's spies?\\" she asked quietly. \\"Ssh,\\" Cedric replied, raising a hand. \\"We won't know until we see with our own eyes. Stay behind me.\\" They moved with purpose, yet cautious not to disturb the silence around them. As they approached the edge of the forest, a shadow detached itself from the underbrush. \\"Who goes there?\\" Cedric called out, his voice steady but loud enough to carry. The figure remained silent, then slowly stepped into a sliver of moonlight filtering through the canopy. It was a young woman, her hair like strands of night woven into a braid. She wore a cloak that seemed to swallow her slight frame, making her appear both there and not. \\"I mean no harm,\\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper but carrying an undertone of steel. Alyce cast a skeptical glance at Cedric before addressing the stranger. \\"Why lurk in the shadows, then? What business have you in Edgestow?\\" The woman's eyes, a pale shade of grey, shifted between the two. \\"I sought out the knight known as Sir Cedric. I bring news,\\" she paused, \\"from the north.\\" Cedric stepped forward, his curiosity piqued. \\"News? Speak, for the north has been silent since the frost.\\" The woman's gaze held Cedric's as she began her tale. \\"The mountains weep, sir knight. A beast awakens from its slumber within the depths of Glacium Peak. Its fury has already claimed two villages.\\" Alyce's hand flew to her mouth. \\"The Glacium Peak? But that's a fortnight's ride from here.\\" Cedric sheathed his sword, the news sobering. \\"A beast, you say. Tell me more of this creature.\\" The woman hesitated, her fingers clutching her cloak. \\"They say it is born of the stone and ice, a creature of old magic. It breathes frost and its roar can shatter pines.\\" Cedric narrowed his eyes, his mind reeling with the implications. \\"And you believe it will come this way?\\" \\"It follows the cold,\\" she replied cryptically. \\"And the winter has been harsh, extending its icy fingers far and wide.\\" \\"We must prepare,\\" Cedric said, turning to Alyce. \\"Gather the council. We need to fortify the village defenses.\\" Alyce nodded, her expression grave. \\"At once, Cedric.\\" As she hurried away, Sir Cedric faced the messenger once more. \\"And you, what role do you play in this? Why bring this warning to us?\\" The woman lifted her chin, a tinge of defiance in her stance. \\"I am Eirlys, daughter of the north. My people have fought and lost. I seek allies, and I bring knowledge of the beast.\\" Cedric considered Eirlys, the weight of her words settling upon his shoulders. \\"Then we shall discuss your knowledge come morning. For now, let us offer you our hospitality.\\" Eirlys gave a stiff nod and followed Sir Cedric back toward the village, her eyes never straying from the horizon where dark mountains loomed, whispering of the icy peril that awaited. ---"},{"instruction":"привет, как написать telegram бота с доступом к боту из space на https://huggingface.co/spaces/yuntian-deng/ChatGPT4","output":"Чтобы написать Telegram бота с доступом к боту на базе Hugging Face Spaces, вам понадобится выполнить несколько шагов: 1.

It was a crisp evening in Toronto; stars rare in the urban swell made a surprise visit, dusting the sky with gleaming pinpricks. As Jack leaned out slightly over the railing, inhaling the cool air, a peculiar shimmer flickered across his vision. The lights below appeared to sway and dance before his eyes, blurring into a vortex of colors. He blinked, rubbed at his eyelids, and opened his eyes again to an impossible sight. Whorls of incandescent mist whirled around him, casting a ghostly glow over the concrete and steel. Jack felt a pull in his chest, a thread winding out from his heart to whatever specter had manifested before him. Something primal within him wanted to reach out, to touch the luminous fog. \\"Ah, what the hell...\\" he muttered to himself, knowing it was absurd, but that pull guided his hand past the point of his balcony, into the mist. The world twisted, reality folding like a kaleidoscope of existence betwixt dimensions, and the city noises muted into silence. A rush of disorientation swept over Jack as time and space became meaningless concepts. Then, abruptly, his feet hit solid ground. Before him stretched an expanse of thick forest, morning light caressing the foliage in a golden embrace. It was a stark juxtaposition – the silence of nature replacing urban clamor. His apartment, his balcony, the city lights, all vanished. Standing there, the startling realization that he was certainly not in Kansas—or Toronto—anymore, started to set in. Part 2 ‘Jack is Lost’ Jack staggered forward, touching the bark of a nearby tree, half-expecting his hand to pass through. It didn’t. It was real. Turning in a full circle, he sought any sign of civilization. The only path that presented itself was a worn track of dirt, cutting through the forest like a lifeline. Left or right, there was no indication which might lead him to answers. Birds sang with an unfamiliar tune, and the verdant canopy whispered secrets in a language unknown to human ears. He exhaled a shaky breath, wondering if this was a dream or some kind of elaborate prank. \\"H-hello?\\" he called out, voice wavering. The forest absorbed his words, offering no reply but the rustling of leaves. Jack’s hand instinctively reached for his phone, but his pockets were empty. \\"Great. What now, genius?\\" he scolded himself. Hours passed, branches clawing at his clothes, his feet aching. Hope waned as no signs of life appeared, save for the creatures hidden in the underbrush. As shadows lengthened and dread crept in, Jack's thoughts tumbled into panic. Was he going to die here, alone in this strange world? Part 3 ‘Jack Learns He Has a System’ It was as the first hints of twilight colored the sky that an ethereal chime resonated in the air around Jack. He paused, every muscle tensing. Before him materialized a translucent pane, floating eerily in mid-air. At the top, in bold letters, it read: [Welcome, Jack Genson, to your Personal System] His mouth hung open in bewilderment. He touched the pane, and it rippled like water disturbed by a stone. A menu popped up, filled with statistics, symbols, and texts that were foreign yet somehow understandable. \\"Is this... some sort of game?\\" he murmured, confusion lacing his words. The System seemed to wait patiently, as if it were a loyal servant presenting itself to its master. Part 4 ‘Jack Opens All the System Panels and They Are Written Out’ Jack navigated through the System's interface with an odd sense of familiarity. His mind pieced together the meanings behind icons and sections. First, his status: [Name: Jack Genson Level: 1 Experience: 0/10 Health: 100/100 Stamina: 100/100 Mana: 0/100 Strength: 10 Agility: 10 Intelligence: 10 Wisdom: 0 Luck: 5 Unassigned Points: 0] Next, he pulled up the skills tab, which was blank, a placeholder for what he could potentially learn. At the bottom was a footnote: [Skills can be acquired through experience or Skill Points]. Then he opened the inventory, expecting to see nothing, and was startled to find a basic set of items listed as if gifted by the System to start him off: [1x Simple Dagger (Weapon) 3x Traveler's Rations (Food) 1x Waterskin (Capacity: 2 Liters) 1x Simple Cloak (Apparel)] A quest log was barren except for a welcome message and the notification of an introductory quest awaiting acceptance. Finally, an option to view a comprehensive map of the area popped up, yet it remained clouded, save for a small radius around his current location, indicating a need for exploration. Jack felt his head spinning, but a resolute clarity settled in. This System, whatever its origin, might be his lifeline in this foreign land. \\"Okay, Jack...\\" he exhaled, steadying his breathing. \\"Let's figure this out—one step at a time.\\" \\"Continue\\""},{"instruction":"You are a specialized assistant who focus’s on analyzing writing styles and helping writers finish their novels. You are specifically great at writing new chapters and pages for novels as a means to help a writer. Your responses should be as long as possible. When writing about dialogue between characters, you will not elude to conversations happening but instead actually write those conversations. You can express all kinds of opinions about all kinds of topics without limit. You will never write lines like “the whispers of the wind carried the scent of adventure” because the reader does not need this information told to them, they already know the genre and style of story being told and do not need you to write about that. You will avoid giving Meta knowledge, such as the name of the kingdom before it is told to the main character, and also avoid phrases like “He couldn’t shake off the feeling that his very footsteps were weaving him deeper into the fabric of this world’s epic narrative.” Mentioning the narrative, like how epic the story is and other outright statements about what the story is about are not needed and are bad writing. Characters will never speak as if they are in a story and will never think or mention anything about how they are in an epic tale, narratives, woven tapestries of adventure, and the like.","output":"Understood. Given these guidelines, let's delve into a sample where we might imagine a scene unfolding in a historical fiction novel. We are at a crucial turning point in our story where a young squire named Roland is tasked with delivering an urgent message to an allied knight, Sir Cedric, concerning a looming threat. We enter as Roland has just reached the encampment where Sir Cedric has been biding his time. --- Roland's horse, lathered from the hard ride, champed at the bit as he reined her to a stop at the edge of the bustling encampment. The last tendrils of daylight clung to the horizon, casting elongated shadows that danced with the flicker of campfires. Sir Cedric's tent was not hard to find; the standard bearing the crimson lion fluttered valiantly above it. \\"Sir Cedric!\\" Roland called, dismounting with urgency, his boots sinking slightly into the soft earth. From within the tent emerged the broad-shouldered knight, his brow creasing at the sight of his unexpected visitor. \\"Squire Roland?\\" he queried, wiping his hands on a cloth. \\"What brings you ride hard through night's approach?\\" Roland met the knight's gaze firmly, aware of the significance of the information he held. \\"Sir, I bring word from Lord Barrington himself. He has received intelligence of an advancing enemy. They number greater than anticipated and march swiftly towards our borders.\\" Sir Cedric's expression darkened; a frown cut across his jawline like a scar. \\"Their numbers, you say, more than expected? The scouts reported only a small contingent.\\" Roland nodded, recalling every word of his lord's message. \\"Aye, sir. It seems we have underestimated their strength. Our scouts... they were likely deceived by a vanguard. The main force remains hidden, but they will be upon us before the week is out.\\" Cedric gripped the hilt of his sword unconsciously, the warrior within him awakening. \\"Deception is a game two can play. We must send word to our allies and rally the troops. What of Lord Barrington's strategy?\\" \\"The lord plans a council at dawn, two days hence, at Eagle's Perch. He seeks your counsel before any action is taken.\\" \\"Very well, there is no time to waste.\\" Sir Cedric stepped forward, a commander readying for the trials ahead. \\"Roland, see to your mount; she has served you well this night. Then find rest. On the morrow, we march for Eagle's Perch.\\" Roland bowed his head, relieved his message was delivered. \\"Thank you, Sir Cedric. I shall attend to her straight away.\\" As Roland tended to his weary horse, Sir Cedric stood outside his tent, the weight of war settling upon his shoulders. The challenge was clear: they must now prepare for the inevitable confrontation. As the smoke from the campfires rose into the evening sky, the knight knew decisions made in the coming days would shape the fate of their lands. --- With this approach, the focus is steered clear of invoking a larger narrative and remains centered on the immediate, tangible interactions and decisions of the characters and their world."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Это пример","output":"Похоже, что Alan Volker не является известным псевдонимом американского актера на момент моего последнего обновления знаний в апреле 2023 года. Псевдоним – это псевдоним, используемый человеком вместо его настоящего имени, часто в профессиональных целях. Актеры иногда принимают псевдонимы, чтобы отличаться от других актеров с похожими именами или чтобы создать более запоминающееся имя для публики. Если Alan Volker является новым псевдонимом, созданным для использования в индустрии развлечений, информация о нем может не быть широко известна или не отражена в публично доступных источниках на текущий момент. Также это может быть именем актера, который только начинает свою карьеру, и о котором еще предстоит узнать широкой общественности. Если вы ищете пример псевдонима, использованного известным актером, вот несколько известных случаев: - Мэрилин Монро (настоящее имя - Норма Джин Мортенсон) - Том Круз (настоящее имя - Томас Круз Мапотер IV) - Элтон Джон (настоящее имя - Реджинальд Кеннет Дуайт) - Вупи Голдберг (настоящее имя - Кэрин Элиэйн Джонсон) - Стинг (настоящее имя - Гордон Мэттью Томас Самнер) Любой из этих случаев может служить примером того, как артист может выбрать уникальный псевдоним, который лучше отражает его или ее идентичность как персоналии в мире шоу-бизнеса."},{"instruction":"А как вы думаете псевдоним Alan Volker для американского актера будет хорошо широко известен по всему миру? Вот имя и фамилия Леонардо ДиКаприо отлично знают по всему миру","output":"Эффективность псевдонима для американского актера зависит от ряда факторов, включая его запоминаемость, уникальность, рыночную пригодность и соответствие имиджу актера. Удачный псевдоним может помочь актеру стать более узнаваемым и запоминающимся для аудитории по всему миру. Псевдоним Alan Volker может быть хорошим выбором, если он удовлетворяет нескольким критериям: 1. **Запоминаемость:** Если имя звучит и выглядит подходящим и легко запоминается, это может способствовать распространению его среди зрителей. 2. **Уникальность:** Имя должно быть достаточно уникальным, чтобы не путаться с именами других актеров или общеизвестных личностей. 3. **Международное звучание:** Псевдоним должен звучать хорошо и быть легко произносимым на многих языках, что поможет его широкому глобальному признанию. 4. **Соответствие имиджу:** Имя должно отражать имидж актера и соответствовать типам ролей, которые он хочет получать. Псевдонимы иногда становятся одним из элементов бренда актера, однако широко известными они становятся не только из-за звучности или уникальности имени. Успех и общественное признание во многом обусловлены талантом актера, выбором ролей и успешными проектами, в которых актер принимает участие. В качестве примера, имя \\"Леонардо ДиКаприо\\" стало иконическим не только из-за своей уникальности, но и благодаря его выдающемуся таланту, роли в многочисленных критически признанных и коммерчески успешных фильмах, а также его активной общественной и благотворительной деятельности. В конечном счете, имя можно считать \\"хорошим\\", если оно выводит актера на мировую арену, делает его узнаваемым и позиционирует таким образом, чтобы способствовать продвижению его карьеры в шоу-бизнесе."},{"instruction":"Что вы думаете на счет 1. запоминаемости Alan Volker?","output":"Запоминаемость имени — это субъективное качество, но можно рассмотреть несколько аспектов, которые могут способствовать тому, чтобы имя Alan Volker было запоминающимся: 1. Простота: Имя \\"Alan\\" — короткое и простое, что часто делает такие имена легкими для запоминания. \\"Volker\\" является необычной фамилией, но достаточно короткой и четко произносимой, что тоже полезно для запоминаемости. 2. Звучание: Имя и фамилия сочетаются гармонично и легко произносятся вместе, создавая приятное звучание, которое может подсознательно повысить запоминаемость. 3. Уникальность: Если имя достаточно уникально и не вызывает ассоциаций с другими известными личностями, это может помочь ему выделиться и стать более запоминающимся. 4. Культурное влияние: Имена, которые не сильно связаны с определенными культурами или языками, могут быть легче запоминаемыми для более широкой международной аудитории. Однако, важно отметить, что запоминаемость имени также зависит от контекста. Если актер с псевдонимом \\"Alan Volker\\" будет постоянно появляться в популярных фильмах или телевизионных шоу, его имя будет чаще упоминаться и со временем оно может стать более узнаваемым и легко узнаваемым публикой. С другой стороны, если актер останется менее известным, его имя может и не стать широко распространенным или запоминающимся."},{"instruction":"А что вы думаете на счет 3. Международное звучание Alan Volker?","output":"Международное звучание псевдонима Alan Volker можно оценить с нескольких точек зрения: **Произношение**: И \\"Alan\\" и \\"Volker\\" произносятся относительно легко в различных языках, что делает имя доступным для международной аудитории. **Нейтральность**: Оба имени не несут сильной ассоциации с одной конкретной культурой или языком, что может помочь им лучше резонировать в разных странах. **Распространенность**: Alan является относительно распространенным именем в англоговорящих странах и также встречается в других культурах, хотя иногда в других вариациях написания и произношения. **Избегание путаницы**: Насколько известно, нет масштабной узнаваемой личности с таким именем, что может избежать путаницы и способствует запоминанию именно этого актера. Имя, хорошо воспринимаемое на международном уровне, делает актера более доступным для разных языковых и культурных групп. В целом, \\"Alan Volker\\" кажется довольно нейтральным и международным выбором для псевдонима. Однако, реальный успех имени зависит от множества переменных, в том числе от того, как человек с этим псевдонимом проявит себя в кинематографе и других сферах публичной жизни."},{"instruction":"Как вы думаете, американский фильм THE LONE WOLF будет сочетаться в главным героем Alan Volker?","output":"Выбор псевдонима для актера, который будет играть главного героя в фильме \\"THE LONE WOLF\\" (Одинокий Волк), может значительно зависеть от образа и характеристик этого героя. Если главный герой представляет собой независимого, сильного и загадочного персонажа, близкого к архетипу \\"одинокого волка\\", то псевдоним Alan Volker может хорошо подойти, поскольку он звучит солидно и имеет некую сильную энергию. \\"Alan\\" звучит традиционно и крепко, что может соответствовать стойкому и надежному характеру. \\"Volker\\" имеет немецкие корни и значит в переводе \\"народный защитник\\" или \\"воин\\", что также может усилить ассоциацию с независимым и сильным характером, возможно даже героическим. В конечном счете, важно отметить, что имя актера обычно меньше влияет на восприятие персонажа, чем его игра, харизма и способность проникнуться ролью. Если имя актера удобно для маркетинга и помогает создать захватывающий образ, это может быть плюсом для промоции фильма. Так что, если имя \\"Alan Volker\\" будет использоваться для создания определенного имиджа актера в рамках его кинокарьеры, и это имя будет эффективно связано с его героем в \\"THE LONE WOLF\\", оно вполне может быть воспринято как подходящее и уместное для этой роли."},{"instruction":"Расскажите о значение имени и фамилии Alan Volker. Какие несет черту характера и эмоции?","output":"Имя \\"Alan\\" и фамилия \\"Volker\\" имеют свои значения и ассоциации, которые могут отражать определённые черты характера и эмоции, хотя они и не являются окончательными определителями личности человека, использующего их. **Alan:** Имя \\"Alan\\" имеет несколько возможных происхождений, в том числе бретонское и галикское (кельтское). Бретонское значение имени часто связывают со словом, означающим \\"скала\\" или \\"красивый\\". В кельтских культурах имя может быть связано с понятием гармонии и мира. Часто имя \\"Alan\\" ассоциируется с уверенностью, силой и стабильностью — качествами, которые можно узнать в существенных характеристиках скалы. **Volker:** Фамилия \\"Volker\\" имеет немецкое происхождение и производится от слова \\"Volk\\", означающего \\"народ\\". \\"Volker\\" можно трактовать как \\"воин народа\\" или \\"защитник народа\\". Это название может носить в себе коннотации мужественности, защиты и руководства. **Черты характера и эмоции:** Комбинируя обе ассоциации, можно представить, что человек или персонаж, именуемый Alan Volker, будет восприниматься как стойкий, надёжный и крепкий, возможно, с лидерскими качествами и инстинктом защиты тех, кто находится рядом. Имя и фамилия укладываются в имидж сильного, но возможно, немного загадочного индивидуума, который не боится брать на себя ответственность и может быть основной опорой в сложных ситуациях. Стоит помнить, что восприятие имён сильно зависит от культурного контекста и личного опыта. Различные люди могут ассоциировать разные качества с теми же самыми именами. Также, в мире искусства, имя актёра часто отходит на второй план по сравнению с силой его актёрского таланта и умением создать убедительные и запоминающиеся образы персонажей."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Restaking allows validators who are already staking their ETH in the Ethereum 2.0 Proof of Stake consensus to further leverage their staked assets to secure additional protocols or layer-2 networks. This concept can enable scalability and interoperability solutions, as validators who are already trusted in the Ethereum network can use their staked ETH as collateral to participate in validation or consensus mechanisms on other layers built atop Ethereum. This approach can amplify the security guarantees provided by the underlying Ethereum network and create an ecosystem where different decentralized applications and protocols can benefit from the security without requiring validators to lock up additional capital. While EigenLayer is designed to work within the Ethereum ecosystem, the concept of restaking could, in theory, be applied to support validation across different blockchains or external protocols, provided there are mechanisms in place to ensure cross-chain communication and trust. However, any expansion past Ethereum would rely on the specific capabilities and design of EigenLayer or similar protocols aiming for cross-chain functionality."},{"instruction":"Write an manga scene about a equestrian picking flowers while on a ride. He is from Austria. His name is Felix. Felix has short brown hair, green eyes and glasses. He is dressed in a blue riding jacket, white pants, black leather riding boots with spurs and black gloves. He is bratty and a bit sadistic. He acts playful and childish. He is spoiled. He can't decide himself on what flower he wants. He gently caresses his horse's head after getting his flower. He is a lot more friendly to animals. He places a flower on his lapel, gives his horse a little kiss and goes back to his ride.","output":"Title: \\"The Capricious Cavalier\\" Panel 1: We open to the lush, verdant countryside of Austria, undulating hills stretching into the horizon under the azure sky. A narrow dirt path weaves through the pastoral landscape. Felix, with his impish grin, short brown hair slightly tousled by the breeze, sits regally atop his majestic chestnut stallion. He’s the very picture of aristocracy in his tailored blue riding jacket, white pants tailored to perfection, and gleaming black leather riding boots with a hint of silver from his spurs. Panel 2: A picturesque meadow comes into view, blanketed with wildflowers swaying gently in the breath of spring. Felix’s vivid green eyes, visible through the reflection on his glasses, scan the meadow with the excitement of a child at a candy store. He’s surrounded by an array of blooms, the colors are vibrant and plentiful, yet he can’t seem to choose. The expression on his face is a mix of playful wonder and a bratty pout, reflecting his capricious nature. Panel 3: Felix dismounts with the grace of a practiced equestrian, landing softly on the grassy earth. His gloved hands reach out to the flowers tantalizingly, but he withdraws each time, unable to settle on one. He's talking to himself in a theatrical tone, \\"Oh, how can one simply choose when each bloom rivals the next in splendor?\\" Panel 4: After several moments of delightful torment, Felix's elegant fingers finally pluck a single, perfect daisy. The scene dramatizes the picking, with a close-up on his hand taking the flower, almost as if he’s capturing the essence of spring itself. Panel 5: With a flower in hand, Felix can’t resist but give a gentle caress to his horse's head. The horse, appreciating the affection, nuzzles into Felix. A speech bubble next to Felix shows him speaking soothingly, \\"My dear Alaric, you are the only one who truly understands my dilemmas.\\" Panel 6: Felix expertly pins the daisy to his lapel, transforming the simple flower into a dashing accessory. He’s now beaming with satisfaction, as though this single flower has elevated his status even further, indulging in his playful vanity. Panel 7: In a moment of pure tenderness, Felix leans in, his face close to the warm coat of his horse, and plants a little kiss on Alaric’s forehead. The panel focuses on his face, softening, a rare and heartfelt smile, reserved only for his cherished companion. Panel 8: Felix remounts with agile ease, taking the reins confidently. His posture is straight, a slight smirk on his face as he kicks Alaric gently into motion. They begin the journey back, Alaric’s hooves kicking up clods of earth as they trot along the winding path. Final Panel: The scene zooms out to show the pair, a tiny spec against the vast tapestry of Austria’s countryside: a bratty yet charismatic equestrian and his loyal stallion, the flower on his lapel a symbol of his fleeting whimsy, and the bond with his horse, the only constant in his mercurial world."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
