The Late Middle Ages, which span from the 13th to the 15th centuries, was a crucial period marked by substantial transformations in European history. This era witnessed the rise of powerful monarchies and their impact on the economic, social, and political structures of Europe. 1. Decline of Feudalism: The Late Middle Ages saw the decline of the traditional feudal system. This decline can be attributed to multiple factors, including the rise of powerful monarchies, the growing influence of cities and the bourgeoisie, and the weakening of the aristocracy. As the feudal system weakened, it provided a window of opportunity for centralizing power, leading to the rise of strong monarchies. 2. Growth of Trade and Commerce: At this time, Europe experienced significant growth in trade and commerce, leading to the rise of wealthy merchant classes. As a result, the cities became more powerful, and their influence increased. The monarchs often relied on these cities and merchants for economic support, adding to their overall strength. 3. Military Innovations: During the Late Middle Ages, Europe saw advancements in military technology and tactics. These innovations included the development of gunpowder weapons, artillery, and professional standing armies. These advances allowed the monarchs to assert their dominance over their territories and expand their realms. 4. Consolidation of Power: The monarchs were successful in centralizing power in the hands of a single ruling authority, which allowed them to maintain control over their territories and people more efficiently. They gained control over multiple domains, such as law, taxation, and military affairs, allowing them to impose their rule and authority more effectively. 5. Hundred Years' War: The Hundred Years’ War (1337-1453) between England and France was a significant event that marked the emergence of two powerful monarchies. The war resulted in the reaffirmation of the French monarchy, while the English monarchs centralized power in Britain. 6. Marriage Alliances and Diplomacy: During this period, European monarchs focused on marriage alliances and diplomacy to strengthen their positions. These strategic actions allowed them to secure inheritances and territories, form military alliances, and hold more authority. The rise of powerful monarchies in the Late Middle Ages influenced the political, economic, and social landscape of Europe in many ways. Politically, the centralization of power led to a more unified and stronger centralized state, which could manage its territories and people better. Monarchs also used their influence to develop diplomacy and create alliances, affecting the international relations of Europe. Economically, the monarchs wielded considerable power in areas like taxation, land ownership, and trade. By supporting trade and commercial growth, they fostered economic development, paving the way for the rise of capitalism and the emergence of a new middle class. Socially, the rise of powerful monarchies impacted the social structure of Europe. The decline of the feudal system and the weakening of the aristocracy changed social hierarchies and provided new opportunities for social mobility. Moreover, the growth of trade and commerce led to the rise of a strong and influential burgher class, which contributed to a more complex and diverse social fabric in Europe. In conclusion, the rise of powerful monarchies during the Late Middle Ages transformed the political, economic, and social landscape of Europe. These changes laid the foundation for the modern nation-states and the rise of capitalism, shaping the course of European history in significant ways."},{"instruction":"Electric charge is a physical property. It occurs between particles or objects. It causes them to attract or repel each other. They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged.

Title: Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events Movie plot: Inventive Violet Baudelaire, her intelligent younger brother Klaus, and their sharp-toothed, precocious baby sister Sunny are orphaned when a mysterious fire destroys their parents' mansion. Mr. Poe, in charge of the Baudelaire estate, entrusts them to their \\"closest relative,\\" the obnoxious Count Olaf, who is only interested in the money Violet will inherit when she turns 18. He loses custody of the children after unsuccessfully attempting to kill them in a train accident.Poe then sends the Baudelaires to live with their uncle, Dr. Montgomery Montgomery, a cheerfully eccentric herpetologist. Planning a trip with the children to Peru, their stay with Uncle Monty is cut short when Olaf appears in disguise as a man named Stephano, who murders Monty and frames a large and poisonous viper for the killing. As the disguised Olaf prepares to spirit the children away, Sunny reveals the snake's true gentle nature, and Olaf's plot is exposed. Poe accepts Olaf's guilt, though not his true identity. Olaf abandons his disguise and escapes.The orphans are then sent to live in Lake Lachrymose, where their Aunt Josephine resides in a house perched precariously on the edge of a cliff overlooking the waters of the vast lake. She has numerous irrational fears, and yet lives in a house populated with many of those things of which she is terrified by - her fear of realtors prevents her from moving. A room of photographs and documents apparently contains clues to the cause of the fire that killed the orphans' parents. However, Olaf arrives once again, disguised as a sailor named Captain Sham, and quickly gains Josephine's confidence.

So think first.","output":"All of the given sentences make sense, but it's important to understand the context and intention behind each sentence. - Sentence A: \\"A thing you might want to do before traveling to another country is to download a movie\\" In this sentence, the suggestion of downloading a movie before traveling to another country makes sense in the context of in-flight entertainment or having something to watch during downtime while abroad. This is a reasonable suggestion, especially if the traveler has a long flight or some waiting time during their trip. - Sentence B: \\"A thing you might want to do before traveling to another country is to download a map\\" In this sentence, the suggestion of downloading a map before traveling to another country makes sense in the context of navigation and being prepared for getting around in an unfamiliar place. Downloading a map, especially an offline one, is useful for finding your way, discovering points of interest, or if you have limited internet access while abroad.

Options: - jump in a swimming pool - starting fire - pleasure - increase of temperature - feeling comfortable Let's give stream of consciousness first:","output":"Jumping in a swimming pool might not be the best option for getting warm, as water can remove body heat faster than cold air. Plus, if the pool is outside in the cold weather, it would likely make the situation worse. Starting a fire is a practical and potentially life-saving choice, as it will create a direct source of warmth. A fire will not only provide heat for your body but can also help dry any wet clothing. Make sure to gather enough fuel to keep the fire going and find a suitable location protected from the wind. Pleasure won't provide any significant source of warmth. While physical activities could increase body temperature, they may not be enough to combat the cold, especially when naked. Increase of temperature is a desirable outcome, but without listing any specific method, it doesn't provide a solution. Feeling comfortable is a subjective term and doesn't necessarily imply that you're warm. It's essential to address the actual issue, which is the need for warmth while naked in the snow. In conclusion, starting a fire would be the most effective method for getting warm in this situation."},{"instruction":"Please check if these have the same meaning. OPT: + no. + yes.

A:","output":"To answer this question, we need to break it down into smaller parts. We can identify three essential components in the question statement: 1. Richard Hopkins 2. A ruler he opposed 3. The Revolution of 1688 Step 1: Identify Richard Hopkins' role First, we need to establish who Richard Hopkins is and his significance in history. Richard Hopkins was a noted politician in 17th-century England. Step 2: Determine rulers Richard Hopkins opposed Now, we need to find out which rulers Richard Hopkins opposed during his political career. Research reveals that Hopkins was a supporter of the Whig party in England, which implies that he would have likely opposed rulers backed by the opposing Tory party. Step 3: Investigate the Revolution of 1688 The Revolution of 1688, also known as the Glorious Revolution, refers to the events that led to the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland and James II of Ireland). He was replaced by his daughter Mary II and her husband William III. The revolution marked an essential milestone in the development of a constitutional monarchy in Britain. Step 4: Identify the overthrown ruler As we already know, the ruler overthrown by the Revolution of 1688 is King James II. Step 5: Verify the relationship between Hopkins and the ruler Now, we have to verify whether Richard Hopkins had an opposing stance against King James II. Since Hopkins was a Whig supporter, he would have likely opposed the reign of James II, given that James II was favored by the Tories. Considering all the steps above, the ruler that Richard Hopkins opposed, who was overthrown by the Revolution of 1688, is: A: King James II."},{"instruction":"I just recently watched this on the Sundance channel.

It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk.

Produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is the sequel to the 2009 film, \\"The Hangover.\\" The story follows the same characters, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis), and Doug (Justin Bartha), as they embark on another adventure full of misadventures and unexpected surprises. This time, the setting shifts from Las Vegas to Bangkok, Thailand, where the group travels for Stu's upcoming wedding to his fiancée, Lauren (Jamie Chung). Similar to the first film, the group participates in a memorable night of celebration with friends, only to wake up the next morning with no recollection of the events that transpired. Stu, Phil, and Alan find themselves in a disarrayed hotel room with their memories of the previous night wiped clean. Moreover, they discover that Stu's future brother-in-law, Teddy (Mason Lee), has gone missing.

Choices: - nucleus - molecule - neutron - atom A:","output":"A: Atom John Dalton, an English chemist, physicist, and meteorologist, proposed the atomic theory in the early 19th century. This theory was based on the idea that all matter is composed of indivisible, fundamental particles called atoms—from the Greek word \\"atomos,\\" meaning \\"indivisible,\\" or \\"uncut.\\" Dalton's atomic theory was a significant development in the history of chemistry and laid the foundation for our modern understanding of matter. Before Dalton, ancient philosophers like Democritus and Leucippus had also proposed the idea of atoms. However, their work was more philosophical in nature and did not have significant experimental evidence to support their claims. Dalton's theory, on the other hand, combined experimental results with philosophical interpretations, ultimately leading to a more accurate and scientific understanding of matter. According to Dalton's atomic theory: 1. All matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms. 2. Atoms of the same element are identical in mass and chemical properties, while atoms of different elements have different masses and distinct chemical properties. 3. Atoms cannot be created or destroyed during a chemical reaction. They can only be rearranged to form new compounds. 4. Compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in fixed, whole-number ratios. At that time in history, it was believed that atoms were the smallest particles of matter. The discovery of subatomic particles like protons, neutrons, and electrons in the late 19th and early 20th centuries showed that atoms could be further divided into smaller, constituent particles, ultimately disproving the idea that atoms were the smallest possible unit of matter. Through various experiments, scientists discovered the nature and structure of these subatomic particles. The nucleus, a central, positively charged core within the atom, was found to be composed of protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge). Electrons, which are negatively charged particles, orbit around the nucleus in specific energy levels. Despite these discoveries, Dalton's atomic theory still remains a vital foundation for our current understanding of chemistry and the world around us."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Title: Not a very appealing text Review: Chapters are disjoint at times, with no reference to similar concepts between them.

Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The given review can be categorized as negative. To provide a comprehensive analysis of the review, let's break it down into its key components and assess the critical feedback provided. 1. \\"Chapters are disjoint at times, with no reference to similar concepts between them\\": This statement suggests that the reader found the organization of the text to be lacking in coherence. The chapters appear unrelated, making it difficult for the reader to comprehend how the different concepts are interconnected. This disjointed structure may hinder the user's ability to fully grasp the content, leading to an unsatisfactory reading experience. 2. \\"Almost as if they were all written separately without any editing to tie them all together\\": This observation conveys the idea that the text might be poorly edited, giving an impression of a fragmented collection rather than a well-structured, cohesive work. Proper editing plays a critical role in ensuring a smooth flow of thoughts and ideas. Failing to do so can result in a confusing and challenging text for the reader, which contributes to a negative review. 3. \\"Information is presented in something less than an interesting manner - it's pretty dry!\\": This comment highlights that the presentation of the content is not engaging, and the reader found it dull. A compelling and captivating writing style is essential to maintain the reader's interest and evoke enthusiasm for the subject matter.

Step 3: The combined speed of the boat and stream when going downstream is (84 km / 2 hours) = 42 kmph. The combined speed of the boat against the stream when going upstream is (48 km / 2 hours) = 24 kmph. Step 4: We have two equations: - Downstream speed = Boat speed (B) + Stream speed (S) =42 kmph - Upstream speed = Boat speed (B) - Stream speed (S) = 24 kmph Step 5: Add the two equations to eliminate S (Stream Speed): Downstream speed + Upstream speed = 2 x Boat speed 42 kmph + 24 kmph = 2B 66 kmph = 2B B = 66 kmph / 2 = 33 kmph (Boat speed) Step 6: Substitute B (Boat speed) back into one of the original equations to find S (Stream speed): Downstream speed = B + S 42 kmph = 33 kmph + S S = 42 kmph - 33 kmph S = 9 kmph (Stream speed) So, the correct answer is (C) 9 kmph as the speed of the stream."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

What do you think of the decision by the Indian government to demonetize 500 and 1000 rupee notes? Do those questions have the same meaning? OPT: I. no. II. yes.","output":"The Indian government abruptly banned the 500 and 1000 Rupee currency notes on November 8, 2016, as part of a demonetization policy aimed at tackling the problems of black money, counterfeit notes, and corruption. The ban came as a shock to the nation, as these were the two highest-denomination currency notes at the time, accounting for around 86% of the total value of currency in circulation. There were multiple reasons behind this decision: 1. Black money: One of the primary objectives of the demonetization policy was to curb the hoarding of black money, which refers to income obtained through illegal means or on which taxes have not been paid. The accumulation of black money contributes to parallel economies and undermines the country's tax system. By rendering the high-denomination notes invalid, the government aimed to force people with unaccounted wealth to either deposit their money into the banking system (and face taxation and penalties) or risk their wealth becoming worthless. 2. Counterfeit currency: Counterfeiting of high-denomination currency notes was a prevalent issue in India, with such activities often being financially backed by smugglers, terrorists, and other criminals. Demonetization offered an opportunity to eliminate a large number of counterfeit notes from the system and to replace old designs with new notes equipped with enhanced security features. 3. Terrorism and Naxalism financing: It has been reported that the networks of both terrorist and Naxalite organizations in India heavily relied on counterfeit currency and black money for funding their activities. By invalidating the 500 and 1000 Rupee notes, the government intended to disrupt these organizations' financial networks and constrain their sources of funding. 4. Formalizing the economy and promoting digital transactions: Another objective of demonetization was to push the Indian economy towards becoming cashless and digitized by promoting electronic transactions and bringing more people into the formal banking system. The sudden shortage of cash in the economy encouraged individuals and businesses to turn towards digital transactions and other cashless payment methods. As for the second question, asking for an opinion on the Indian government's decision to demonetize the 500 and 1000 Rupee notes, it is essential to understand the context in which it was implemented. While the intentions behind the policy were commendable, its execution was widely criticized due to the immense hardship it caused to the general public, particularly the poor, vulnerable, and rural populations. Moreover, the long-term impact of demonetization on curbing black money and counterfeit currency has been debated by economists and policymakers. In summary, while the questions may appear similar, they differ in their focus and scope. The first question seeks an explanation as to why the Indian government decided to ban the currency notes, whereas the second question requests an analysis and opinion on the government's decision. Thus, the correct answer is \\"I. no.\\" since the two questions do not have the same meaning."},{"instruction":"fresh'n yo has a wide selection of food, drinks and desserts.

May 20, 2014, 11:42 PM GMT / Updated May 21, 2014, 12:00 AM GMT Five men were convicted Tuesday in Moscow in the 2006 execution-style murder of Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Russian state media reported. Politkovskaya, a crusading reporter for the liberal newspaper Novaya Gazeta who worked almost full-time on documenting allegations of human rights violations in the breakaway province of Chechnya, was 48 when she was gunned down in the elevator of her apartment building in October 2006. The murder raised worldwide questions about freedom of speech and of the press under Russian President Vladimir Putin — especially after three of the defendants were initially acquitted in 2009. The Supreme Court overturned those acquittals and ordered a new trial. ||||| People hold portraits of slain journalist Anna Politkovskaya on the sixth anniversary of her death, next to her block of flats in central Moscow October 7, 2012. MOSCOW (Reuters) - Five men were convicted on Tuesday of murdering 2006 of investigative journalist and Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya, including three defendants who had been acquitted in a previous trial. Politkovskaya's killing drew attention to the risks faced by Russians who challenge the authorities and deepened Western concerns for the rule of law under President Vladimir Putin, who was then serving his second term. Another jury's 2009 acquittal of three of the men who were found guilty of murder on Tuesday embarrassed Russian prosecutors and was later thrown out by the Supreme Court, which ordered a new trial. The defendants were three Chechen brothers, one of whom was accused of shooting Politkovskaya in the lobby of her Moscow apartment building on October 7, 2006, as well as their uncle and a former police officer. The convictions are a victory for Russian prosecutors and the state, but rights activists and relatives of Politkovskaya say that justice will not be done until those who ordered her contract-style killing are identified and convicted. \\"The murder will only be solved when the name of the person who ordered it is known,\\" a lawyer for Politkovskaya's family, Anna Stavitskaya, was quoted as saying by RIA news agency. She welcomed the jury's verdict but said the men found guilty \\"are only a few of the people who should be brought to justice\\", RIA reported. A spokesman for the federal Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, said the authorities were doing all they can to identify and track down the person behind the killing, Russian news agencies reported. Kremlin critics say they doubt that will ever happen because of suspicions the trail could lead too close to the government. Politkovskaya, a reporter for Novaya Gazeta who was 48 when she was shot dead while returning home after shopping for groceries, was best known for her dogged reporting on human rights violations in the North Caucasus province of Chechnya. Lawyers for the defendants - Rustam Makhmudov, his brothers Ibragim and Dzhabrail, their uncle Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, and former Moscow police officer Sergei Khadzhikurbanov - said they would appeal. Investigators say Gaitukayev organised the logistics of the killing while in jail for another matter, while Khadzhikurbanov was in charge of preparing for the slaying and Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov helped track her. Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov and Khadzhikurbanov were previously acquitted. The five men will be sentenced by a judge at a later date and could face life in prison. Prosecutors will recommend sentences at a court session on Wednesday, RIA reported.

One man was found guilty of the shooting and the other four of organising the killing. Three of the men were brothers from Chechnya. Ms Politkovskaya, a 48-year-old investigative reporter and vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya, was shot in a lift in her block of flats. Three of the men had been acquitted of the murder in a 2009 trial. The initial verdict was overturned by Russia's supreme court, which ordered their retrial. One of the brothers, Rustam Makhmudov, was found guilty of pulling the trigger. His brothers were found guilty of acting as getaway drivers. The brothers' uncle and a retired policeman were also found guilty of organising the killing. Ms Politkovskaya's reporting for Novaya Gazeta newspaper won international renown for her dogged investigation of Russian abuses in Chechnya. But her pieces, which were highly critical of President Vladimir Putin, then serving his second term, and the Chechen leadership, angered many in authority. The five men, who face possible life terms, will be sentenced on Wednesday morning. A committee set up to investigate the shooting said it was still looking for the person who ordered the operation. Her family welcomed the verdict but also expressed disappointment that the mastermind of the killing had not yet been found. Last year a former police officer, Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for supplying the murder weapon. Magnitsky sanctions In a separate development, the US announced on Tuesday that it was imposing sanctions on a further 12 Russians believed to be involved in the death of a Moscow lawyer in 2009. Sergei Magnitsky found evidence of a 230m tax-refund fraud Sergei Magnitsky died in prison, allegedly because of torture and neglect, after accusing Russian officials of tax fraud. Following his death, the US passed the Magnitsky Act, aimed at punishing officials involved in his death, and last year published a list of 18 individuals banned from entering the country. Among the names added to the list on Tuesday are three doctors alleged to have withheld treatment from Magnitsky while he was in custody. One of them, Larisa Litvinova, was chief physician at Butyrka maximum security jail where Magnitksy died while another, Dmitry Kratov, was its deputy director. A judge involved in a posthumous prosecution of Magnitsky for tax fraud has also been added to the sanctions list.

Available options: (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;...I think the answer is","output":"(3). no. The statement \\"A child is walking\\" is quite broad and does not contain specific details about where the child is walking, what the child is wearing, or what is happening around the child. Hence, it is not possible to draw the specific conclusion that \\"A child dressed as a monkey walks in front of a woman playing with finger puppets\\" based on this statement alone. Let's break down this scenario to further understand why the conclusion isn't accurate. Firstly, the first statement does not give any information about the child's attire. The child could be dressed in any manner – as a monkey, as a superhero, as a princess, or in regular clothes. Based on the information \\"A child is walking,\\" we have no way of knowing for sure that the child is dressed as a monkey. Secondly, the first statement does not include any details about the child's location or what is happening around them. While it is possible that a woman playing with finger puppets might be in the same vicinity as the walking child, we cannot infer this from the statement \\"A child is walking.\\" We aren't told about the presence of any woman or any finger puppets. Finally, the first statement also doesn't convey the relative positions of the child and the woman (if a woman is even present). There is no detail to conclude definitively that the child is walking \\"in front\\" of the woman. Even if we did have information that a woman was present and the child was walking, the child could just as well be walking behind her, beside her, or in a completely different area. For these reasons, the answer is (3) no, you cannot accurately conclude from the generic statement \\"A child is walking\\" that \\"A child dressed as a monkey walks in front of a woman playing with finger puppets.\\" More detailed and specific information would be necessary for such a conclusion."},{"instruction":"Teacher:\\"Yes, and\\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\\"Yes\\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\\"and...\\").

Article: It was a great day for American girl D' Zhana Simmons when she got a new heart. However, her dream died when the new heart started not to work properly. The doctors had to take it away. She needed another heart transplant . But the doctors couldn't find a proper heart so soon. Then they came up with an idea -- they would use two machines to keep her blood _ in her body. After waiting for about four months, D' Zhana had another heart transplant. It was very successful. When doctors use a man-made heart to keep a patient's life, they usually leave the patient's own heart in the body. \\"She, we believe, is possibly one of the youngest that had the machines without her own heart,\\" one of D' Zhana Simmons' doctors said. Living without a heart for 118 days -- that's great. When a heart transplant doesn't work, doctors have no time to waste. If they don't get a new heart or some machines to help the patient, he or she will die. The patient's life is in their hands. This story once again shows how important the medical world really can be. I hope that one day I will be a doctor. I hope I can be so quick and helpful to my patients.

Problem:3, ['Q', '2261', 'm', '1869', '6817', '3611', '529', 'L', '369', 's'] Solution:","output":"What this task is asking: The task involves a list 'A' and a number 'i'. The goal is to identify all elements from the list 'A' that occur before the last 'i' elements. Here's a step-by-step explanation: Step 1: Understand the inputs. - You are given two inputs: 'i' and 'A'. 'i' is an integer and 'A' is a list. You can think of 'A' as a row of items and 'i' as a certain number of items from the end of the row. Step 2: Look at the specific problem. - In our specific problem, 'i' is 3 and 'A' is ['Q', '2261', 'm', '1869', '6817', '3611', '529', 'L', '369', 's']. - So, these are the last 3 numbers: '369', 'L' & 's'. All other elements are preceding these 3 last elements. Step 3: Implement the task. - List everything else in 'A' excluding the last 'i' elements. - This means all elements of the list 'A' until the third element from the end. Step 4: Find the Solution. - The elements of 'A' preceding the last 3 elements are: ['Q', '2261', 'm', '1869', '6817', '3611', '529']. This is your answer. Remember to be careful when counting the 'i' elements from the end. In this case, 'i' was 3. So, you need to exclude the last 3 elements from the list 'A' to find the answer."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Wilfred Glendon is a wealthy and world-renowned English botanist who journeys to Tibet in search of the elusive mariphasa plant. While there, he is attacked and bitten by a creature later revealed to be a werewolf, although he succeeds in acquiring a specimen of the mariphasa. Once back home in London he is approached by a fellow botanist, Dr. Yogami, who claims to have met him in Tibet while also seeking the mariphasa. Yogami warns Glendon that the bite of a werewolf would cause him to become a werewolf as well, adding that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease. Glendon does not believe the mysterious Yogami. That is, not until he begins to experience the first pangs of lycanthropy, first when his hand grows fur beneath the rays of his moon lamp (which he is using in an effort to entice the mariphasa to bloom), and later that night during the first full moon. The first time, Glendon is able to use a blossom from the mariphasa to stop his transformation. His wife Lisa is away at her aunt Ettie's party with her friend, former childhood sweetheart Paul Ames, allowing the swiftly transforming Glendon to make his way unhindered to his at-home laboratory, in the hopes of acquiring the mariphasa's flowers to quell his lycanthropy a second time. Unfortunately Dr. Yogami, who is revealed to be a werewolf, sneaks into the lab ahead of his rival and steals the only two blossoms.

Stir in 1 tbsp. (12 g or 14.8 ml) of the sweetener for every 4 cups (0.95 l) of unsweetened almond milk. Stir very well, until the granules dissolve. Add more, if desired. Flavoring should be done to taste, starting with the measurements below. You can measure enough flavoring to mask the taste of the almond milk altogether or simply to enhance it. Pour in 1 tsp. (4.9 ml) of vanilla extract for every 4 cups (0.95 l) of almond milk. Double the amount if you prefer a strong vanilla taste. Stir well. Create a stronger almond taste by adding almond extract. Pour in 1 tsp. (4.9 ml) of almond extract for every 4 cups (0.95 l) of almond milk. Stir well. Add 1 tbsp. of sugar or agave syrup and 2 tbsp. (14 g) of cocoa powder to 4 cups (0.95 l) of unsweetened almond milk to create chocolate almond milk. Add a pinch of salt. Stir well, until everything has dissolved. Withhold the sugar if you are using plain, sweetened almond milk. Add 1 tbsp. of sugar or agave syrup, 1/2 tsp. (1.3 g) of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. (0.5 g) of nutmeg and 1/8 tsp. (0.25 g) of cloves to 4 cups (0.95 l) of unsweetened almond milk to create chai almond milk. Do not add the sugar if you are using sweetened almond milk. Stir well. The longer you allow the spices to sit in the milk before drinking, the stronger the taste will be.","output":"So think of making your own flavored almond milk like making a fun potion! The store-bought chocolate and vanilla almond milk have a lot of sugar - it's like eating more than a spoonful of sugar in each glass. But don't worry! You can make it at home and it's very easy. Once you have unsweetened almond milk, you add a spoonful of sweetener like sugar or agave syrup for every 4 cups - that's about as much milk as in a large jug. Stir it until you can't see the sweetener anymore - be sure to stir very well! Now the fun part, adding flavors! To make it taste like vanilla, add a teaspoon of vanilla extract for every 4 cups of milk. If you really love vanilla, you can add more! Just don't forget to mix it well. If you want a more almond flavor, put a little bit of almond extract too. For chocolate almond milk, you add a spoonful of sugar or agave syrup and 2 spoonfuls of cocoa powder to your milk. You also add a tiny bit of salt, and mix it until everything has disappeared. If you are using already sweetened almond milk, no need to add more sugar. To make chai almond milk, add the sugar or agave syrup, plus a little bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Mix it very well. The longer you let the spices sit in the milk, the more it will taste like your favorite chai drink. But remember not to add sugar if you're using sweetened almond milk.

You finish drinking the tea. Now, what do you do with the box? Do you drop it on the ground? Or, do you do the right thing and drop it in a trash can? Hopefully, you drop it in the trash can because, besides harming the environment, littering is also very impolite. Recently, a magazine published a list of the most polite cities in the world. They looked three things: did people litter, did shop clerks say thank you and did people hold the door open for the person behind them? The top three politest cities were New York, USA, Zurich, Switzerland, and Toronto, Canada. Hong Kong, China was number 35. Shanghai wasn't even on the list. Does that mean that Shanghai is not a polite city? Well, maybe. There are different ways to judge politeness but the survey was looking at how a visitor to a city would feel when walking around its public places. Visitors don't like to step over empty tea boxes as they walk down the street. They don't like it when they buy something and the shop clerk doesn't say thank you or even give them a smile. They also don't like it when someone lets a door slam into them instead of holding it open. Shanghai is a nice city but it is not always the most polite city. I don't think this is intentional . I think it's just a lack of awareness . China is becoming a popular place for tourists to visit.

Furthermore, the critic feels that a few moments verge on melodrama, which somewhat detracts from the overall message. Despite these minor concerns, the overall tone of the critique is undeniably positive. It is evident that the reviewer appreciates the movie's ability to prompt conversations and challenge assumptions regarding African American professionals.

They were highly advanced in technology and science, which they used to make their lives better. However, their hunger for resources soon led them to the brink of destruction. Krypton's core, being rich in a precious element, attracted the attention of miners who exploited it without considering the consequences. It was not long before the relentless mining began to destabilize the planet's core, leading to catastrophic tectonic events and an impending apocalyptic scenario. Amidst this crisis, the planet's council convened an urgent assembly to discuss possible solutions. Many brilliant minds proposed various strategies, but none seemed to hold the key to the salvation of Krypton. It was during this chaotic time that a highly respected scientist named Jor-El emerged as a voice of reason. His research had long predicted the danger of mining Krypton's core, and he had been hard at work attempting to devise a suitable plan of action. In light of the rapidly deteriorating situation, the council decided to entrust Jor-El with the control of the genetics codex, which held the entire biological knowledge and heritage of the Kryptonian race. Jor-El worked tirelessly to find a way to save his people. However, he soon discovered that Krypton's core was beyond salvation, and that the destruction of their planet was imminent. Desperate to preserve the Kryptonian legacy, Jor-El conceived a bold plan to entrust the future of his race to his infant son, Kal-El. He devised a preprogrammed spacecraft that would carry the young child to safety on a distant, habitable planet. When the time came, the selfless Jor-El prepared to say goodbye to his beloved wife and son. He knew that staying behind meant sacrificing his life, but his love for his people and hopes for his son steeled his resolve. Before parting, he placed the genetic codex into his son’s escape vessel, ensuring that the essence of Krypton would live on in the blood of his child. As the planet's destruction drew near, Jor-El launched the spacecraft carrying his precious cargo into the vast reaches of space. Following Jor-El's meticulously calculated coordinates, the spacecraft journeyed across the cosmos and arrived on a small, blue-green planet called Earth. It crash-landed, as designed, near a small Kansas town called Smallville. Here, a kind couple named Jonathan and Martha Kent, who were unable to have children of their own, discovered the infant Kal-El. They loved and raised him as their own, and named him Clark. As Clark grew up, he realized that he was unlike other humans. Burdened by the knowledge of the fate that had befallen his true home, and feeling immense guilt for being the sole survivor of Krypton, he decided that he needed to find a new purpose in life. He knew that he possessed extraordinary abilities given to him by his Kryptonian heritage, and he wanted to use these powers to help others. Thus, Clark set out on a journey around the world. He learned about different cultures, discovered new ways of thinking, and was inspired by the resilience and ingenuity of humankind. During his travels, he realized that he could use his great power to protect Earth, the planet that had taken him in and given him a second chance at life. And so, the once lost and guilt-ridden young man from a distant world embraced his destiny and became Earth's greatest protector, the iconic superhero known as Superman."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end?

What does President Obama's visit to California this week on behalf of embattled Sen. Barbara Boxer have to do with passage of the financial reform bill? Far more than you'd imagine. That Boxer is in any trouble says much of what you need to know about this year's election. California has become a Democratic bastion, and Boxer has been a liberal institution who never before faced a serious reelection challenge. Now she is seen as sufficiently vulnerable that Obama will come to the state for another fundraiser for her next month. The threat to Boxer is grim news for Democrats. Is this sense of the election about to be overtaken? That's where financial reform comes in. If health-care legislation had to fight uphill against a public mood that is skeptical of government's capacities, the financial reform bill that Democrats are pushing has the advantage of flowing with a public view devoutly critical of Wall Street, bankers and all their works. And for the first time in Obama's presidency, Republicans are uncertain as to whether resolute opposition to a Democratic idea is in their political interest. There are strong indications that the GOP would prefer to avoid an all-out confrontation over re-regulating the financial system, and several Republican senators are saying that they would like to negotiate with Democrats. Suddenly, it's Democrats -- and, in particular, the often conflict-averse Obama -- who are relishing a fight. This raises what might be the essential question for November: Can Democrats finally put the Republicans on the defensive? Obama is betting that they can. His speech at a fundraiser for Boxer in Los Angeles on Monday offered a template for a new Happy Warrior in the tradition of Al Smith. After a year in which he repeatedly and almost apologetically insisted that he was -- really, really -- trying as hard as he could to work with Republicans, he turned the beat around and asked why Republicans weren't willing to work with him. He used his praise of Boxer -- \\"she wants to cooperate with folks on the other side of the aisle where she can, but she's willing to fight where she has to\\" -- as a pivot to what he hopes will be a central theme of this year's national election campaign. His words about Boxer, he said, were \\"not a bad adage . . . for the Democratic Party. \\"In this entire year and a half of cleaning up the mess, it's been tough because the folks very responsible for a large portion of this mess decided to stand on the sidelines,\\" Obama declared. \\"It was as if somebody had driven their car into the ditch and then just watched you as you had to yank it out, and asked you: 'Why didn't you do it faster -- and why do I have that scratch on the fender?' And you want to say: 'Why don't you put your shoulder up against that car and help to push?' That's what we need, is some help.\\" In one paragraph, Obama did what many of the dispirited in his party have long been urging him to do: He linked the economic mess to past Republican policies -- much as Ronald Reagan blamed the economic downturn of the early 1980s on Democrats and liberals -- and turned the tables on bipartisanship by asserting that it is Republicans who are blocking concord. And then he connected this argument to the struggle over financial reform, aimed at changing \\"a situation where people are allowed to take wild risks and all the downsides are socialized even as the profits are privatized.\\" Obama said that \\"some of the rhetoric that's coming out of the other side of the aisle\\" suggested that Republicans \\"so far, at least, don't seem to acknowledge that we're going to have to make some tough decisions and reform the system.\\" Note the words \\"so far, at least.\\" Democrats clearly see financial reform as a winner either way. With Republican cooperation, they have a bill. With Republican obstruction, they have an election issue. For once, Democrats are negotiating from strength. No one doubts the Democrats are in a deep electoral hole. But Obama has now joined the battle with a strategy to transform the election from a referendum on his own party into a contest with a Republican Party the public doesn't much like, either. Boxer's fate, but also the fate of a lot of other Democrats, hangs on its success. ejdionne@washpost.com ||||| The United States Senate. Feel the love. “... You have been great.” “... I am grateful, very grateful, for your friendship.” “... I want everyone to know how deeply committed you are to reform.” “... I also wanted to thank you for your hard work.” This was Wednesday at the Senate Agriculture Committee, which was considering the regulation of derivatives. These are extremely complicated financial instruments, and they are under the control of the agriculture committee because, really, when you get right down to it, everything is a crop. “Members of this committee check their partisan politics at the door,” boasted the chairwoman, Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat of Arkansas. Then, in between compliments, the members approved Lincoln’s bill on derivatives in a series of party-line votes. Except for Charles Grassley, a Republican of Iowa, who sided with Lincoln. Truly, this was a day for the record books. Somebody finally got a Republican to vote for something. And perhaps a sign of things to come. As President Obama prepared to make his big financial reform speech near Wall Street on Thursday, the G.O.P. seemed increasingly eager to find a way to work this one out. “We probably generally agree on 90 percent,” said the agriculture committee’s ranking minority member, Saxby (“I golf, therefore I am”) Chambliss. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, took credit for forcing bipartisan negotiations with his innovative threat-of-a-filibuster tactic. Chris Dodd, the chairman of the banking committee who has been negotiating with the Republicans for months, said it was like a rooster taking credit for the sunrise. The Republican leadership originally seemed to believe that financial reform could be a replay of health care reform, with a political payoff for total obstruction. They’re discovering that the only real similarity is that both are almost impossible to explain. People love their doctors, but they tend to hate their bankers. Nobody is going to scare voters by predicting that if the Democratic bill passes, they may not be able to keep seeing the same hedge fund manager. It’s a sign of the shift that Blanche Lincoln has gone to the front of the populist pack. She was one of the weakest reeds on the Democratic side of the health care reform debate. Before that, she was obsessed with trying to cut the estate tax. Before that  well, let’s be frank. We have no idea what she was up to. Given her record, people had expected a weak, boring package from her committee. But Lincoln came up with rules that were tougher than anyone had expected, requiring derivatives to be traded on public exchanges so investors could compare prices. The banks hate this idea, possibly because it will drive down their profits. For sure because it will drive down their profits. “The bridge of cooperation has been washed out,” said Republican Pat Roberts of Kansas crankily, as Lincoln nudged the bill through committee. He also warned that the senators were “smothering ourselves in the milk of human kindness and hoping it doesn’t curdle,” nailing down first place in the hotly contested Senate metaphor-making competition. It was the first time Lincoln seemed like an interesting political figure since 1998, when, at 38, she became the youngest woman ever elected to the United States Senate. Now her seat is in jeopardy. Conservatives smell blood. The left is backing her opponent in a primary next month. Bill Clinton expressed his support by saying, “I wouldn’t be surprised to see her coming back from the dead.” Which is really not what you want to hear from the former president while you’re out fund-raising. So it’s pretty easy to figure out what caused Lincoln’s hard line on financial reform. She is tacking to the left the same way John McCain, struggling in a hot primary in Arizona against a Tea Party-type opponent, is tacking to the right. But let’s give her credit for never having gotten desperate enough to claim that cars full of illegal immigrants were “intentionally causing crashes on the freeway.” Unlike some former mavericks we could mention. Americans are certainly in the market for some leadership on the subject of derivatives. It’s hard to even figure out how to worry about them, since we have no clue exactly what they are, beyond bets on whether prices will go up or down. Try to think of derivatives as being like the Tribbles in that classic “Star Trek” episode. For all of history, there was no such thing. Then somebody found the first ones, which looked cute and made soothing noises. We liked them fine, until the population grew to be worth about 600 trillion. When they got into the financial engine, all hell broke loose. And there is absolutely no political percentage in allowing them free run of the ship. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a shorter version of a longer piece of text or story, which includes the main points and important details.

Chain of thought and solution: 1. The statement is about the age at which humans can reproduce. 2. Reproductive age for humans is not fixed at a single age. 3. Females usually begin menstruating and are capable of reproducing around the ages of 12-15, while males tend to become capable of reproducing around the ages of 11-14. 4. Several factors, such as genetics and overall health, can impact the beginning of a person's reproductive capacity. 5. Some limited fertility issues or medical conditions might restrict reproduction for certain individuals until they reach a particular age, but this is not universal or set at a specific age such as thirty. Therefore, the statement is not accurate, as human reproduction can happen well before and well after the age of thirty, depending on individual circumstances."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What position was held by the man that Bach served as Kappelmeister for?, using the article: As far as we know, the earliest cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4. Bach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. He was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche. The first cantatas he composed in the new position were Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, for Palm Sunday, Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday, and Erschallet, ihr Lieder, BWV 172, for Pentecost. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, Salomo Franck, they contain recitatives and arias. When Johann Samuel Drese, the Kapellmeister (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.In Köthen, Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself. The court was Calvinist, therefore Bach's work from this period was mostly secular, including the orchestral suites, the cello suites, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos. He composed secular cantatas for the court for occasions such as New Year's Day and the prince's birthday, including Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV..., what would be the answer ?

As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated.

Her mother, Carmen Milady Rodriguez (nee Pared Espinal), is Dominican, and her father, Rafael Rodriguez, was a Puerto Rican, who served in the U.S. Army. Rodriguez moved to the Dominican Republic with her mother when she was eight years old and lived there until age 11. Later, she moved to Puerto Rico until the age of 17, and finally settled in Jersey City, New Jersey. In March 2002, Rodriguez was arrested for assault after getting into a fight with her roommate, but charges were later dropped after the roommate declined to press the allegations in court. In November 2003, Rodriguez went to court to face eight misdemeanor charges based on two driving incidents including a hit and run and driving under the influence (DUI). In June 2004, Rodriguez pleaded no contest in Los Angeles to three of the charges: hit and run, drunken driving, and driving with a suspended license. She went to jail for 48 hours, performed community service at the morgues of two New York hospitals, completed a three-month alcohol program, and was placed on probation for three years. In 2005, while filming Lost in Hawaii, Rodriguez was pulled over by Honolulu police multiple times for speeding violations and on December 1 she was arrested for DUI. In April 2006, she pleaded guilty to one charge of driving under the influence and chose to pay a US500 fine and spend five days in jail. She cited her high doses of allergy-relieving steroids as part of the reason for her erratic behavior. Because the incident was a violation of her Los Angeles probation, she was sentenced to 60 days in jail, a 30-day alcohol rehabilitation program and another 30 days of community service, including work for Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Because of overcrowding, she was released from jail on the same day she entered. In September 2007, Rodriguez allegedly violated her probation by not completing her community service and not following an alcohol education program. Her lawyer claimed it was a clerical error. On October 10, 2007, following a hearing, she was sentenced to 180 days jail time after agreeing to admit to violating her probation. She was expected to spend the full 180-day term in jail, but she was released eighteen days later due to overcrowding. In January 2009, Rodriguez completed her community service.

Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Step 1: Identify key information from the premise. - A guy is in a white apron - He is cooking a pizza - The pizza is being cooked in a stone oven Step 2: Compare key information with the hypothesis. - The guy is identified as a chef in the hypothesis - The context is a chef cooking pizza for customers Step 3: Assess the degree of alignment between the premise and the hypothesis. - The premise provides evidence that someone is cooking a pizza using a stone oven, which is a clue that the person might be a chef or someone with expertise in cooking pizzas. Step 4: Identify gaps or assumptions. - The use of a white apron is mentioned, but this is not concrete evidence that the person is a professional chef. While aprons are common for chefs, they can also be worn by non-professional cooks. - The premise does not specifically mention customers, so it's an assumption that the pizza is being cooked for customers. Step 5: Make the conclusion. While there are some clues suggesting that the hypothesis \\"A chef is cooking a pizza for his customers\\" may be true, we cannot state definitively that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.

This is because the phrase is indicating that something should avoid being frustrating, boring, and forgettable, implying that it should be the opposite of these negative qualities. The use of \\"anything but\\" in the phrase means that the attributes listed afterward are meant to be undesirable. In this context, it suggests that the situation, experience, or subject being referred to is expected to be more engaging, interesting, and memorable, which are positive characteristics. Additionally, the adjectives frustrating, boring, and forgettable are inherently negative in nature. By advocating for something to not possess these qualities, the phrase steers toward a positive direction. The implication here is that the speaker is encouraging or expecting that whatever they are addressing will exhibit desirable (positive) attributes instead. In summary, the phrase \\"be anything but frustrating, boring, and forgettable\\" is positive, as it promotes the avoidance of negative characteristics and suggests a preference for their positive counterparts – engaging, interesting, and memorable experiences or situations."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step in the process of waste removal and filtration in the kidneys is the blood entering the kidney through an important blood vessel called the renal artery. The renal artery branches out into smaller blood vessels, ultimately leading to a complex network of capillaries. These capillaries form the structural and functional units of the kidney called nephrons. Each kidney contains approximately one million nephrons, and it is within these microscopic structures that the actual process of waste and fluid removal occurs. The first part of the nephron is called the glomerulus, which is a tangled cluster of capillaries. As blood flows through the glomerulus, the high pressure forces water, waste products, and other small molecules to pass through the thin walls of the capillaries into a surrounding capsule called Bowman's capsule, initiating the filtration process. This mixture of waste products and water, known as the filtrate, consists of various substances such as urea, creatinine, glucose, ions, and other molecules that need to be efficiently sorted and processed by the kidney. The filtrate then moves from the Bowman's capsule into a series of twisted tubular structures called the proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule. Throughout this tubular system, a series of selective reabsorption and secretion processes occur. The beneficial materials, such as glucose, ions, and water, are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream through the capillary network surrounding the tubules. This reabsorption is facilitated by active and passive transport mechanisms, ensuring that the essential components are returned to the body while the waste substances remain within the tubules. Simultaneously, additional waste products and toxins that were not filtered out by the glomerulus are actively secreted into the tubules from the capillaries. The filtrate becomes increasingly concentrated with waste products as it progresses through the nephron. Upon leaving the distal convoluted tubule, the remaining filtrate, now consisting predominantly of waste products and excess water, enters the collecting duct. Here, the final adjustments to the fluid's composition take place, with the fine-tuning of water reabsorption to maintain the body's water and electrolyte balance. The collecting ducts from multiple nephrons converge and empty the final product, urine, into larger renal structures called renal calyces. The renal calyces merge to form the renal pelvis, which is a funnel-shaped cavity that collects the urine and channels it through the ureter, a tube-like structure that connects the kidneys to the urinary bladder. The urine is stored in the bladder until it is eventually excreted from the body during urination. In summary, the first step in the kidney waste and fluid filtration process is the blood entering the kidney through the renal artery and being forced through the capillary network of the glomerulus. This initiates the intricate and highly regulated series of processes within the nephrons, ultimately producing urine and maintaining the body's essential balance of water, electrolytes and waste product removal."},{"instruction":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Was the temperature of the melted bag higher or lower than the temperature of the frozen bag? Susan went to the store to buy some bags of ice for a party she was having later in the day. When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer. When she returned, the bag of ice had melted. Hint: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. The answer to this question is:","output":"The temperature of the melted bag was higher than the temperature of the frozen bag. When Susan left the one bag of ice in the sink, the ice was exposed to the ambient temperature of the room, which was higher than the freezing point of the ice. This caused the ice to melt as the temperature of the bag increased.

The Justice Department had accused Apple and five publishers in April of illegally colluding on prices as part of an effort to fight internet retailer Amazon.com Inc's dominance of e-books. The publishers who agreed to settle are News Corp's HarperCollins Publishers Inc, CBS Corp's Simon & Schuster Inc and Lagardere SCA's Hachette Book Group.

Options: a ) 5 mph , b ) 10 mph , c ) 20 mph , d ) 30 mph , e ) 40 mph Output:","output":"Step 1: Let's define some variables for given information. Let x = average speed on the first day (in mph), y = hours traveled on the first day Then, (x-10) = average speed on the second day (in mph), (y+3) = hours traveled on the second day Step 2: We have two equations from the problem. First equation is from total miles: xy + (x-10)(y+3) = 280 (because distance = speed × time for both days) Second equation is from total hours: y + (y+3) = 12 (total hours traveled) Step 3: Solve the second equation for y to get value of y: y + (y+3) = 12 2y + 3 = 12 2y = 9 y = 4.5 (hours traveled on the first day) Step 4: Substitute y back into the first equation and solve for x: 4.5x + (x-10)(4.5+3) = 280 4.5x + (x-10)(7.5) = 280 4.5x + 7.5x - 75 = 280 12x = 355 x = 29.58 (approximately, which is the average speed on the first day in mph) Step 5: Calculate average speed on the second day which is (x-10): 29.58 - 10 = 19.58 (approximately) The closest option to our answer is: c) 20 mph"},{"instruction":"working on homework all day Select your answer from the options.

In its original sense, the word specifically denoted a full suit of armor, but it has since evolved to encompass a wider range of meanings. The Russian word \\"паноплия\\" similarly carries these meanings. It can be used to describe an extensive assortment of objects or an impressive display of something. For example, one could say that a well-stocked library contains a panoply of books (or \\"паноплия книг\\" in Russian), highlighting the wide range of literary works available in the library. Alternatively, an art gallery featuring a diverse collection of paintings and sculptures can be described as exhibiting a panoply of art forms (or \\"паноплия художественных форм\\" in Russian). The word \\"паноплия\\" can also be encountered in historical contexts, where it refers to full suits of armor worn in ancient times. In these cases, the word \\"паноплия\\" similarly depicts a full and striking assemblage of elements coming together as a functional and visually impressive whole. It's crucial to remember that when translating words or phrases, the specific context in which they are used plays a significant role in determining the most accurate translation. Additionally, depending on the context, there could be other possible translations or more specialized terms in Russian. Nonetheless, \\"паноплия\\" is a suitable translation for \\"panoply\\" in a broader sense."},{"instruction":"Review: ear-pleasing Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?

However, let me provide you with a general, detailed response on the importance of crafting a concise and effective sentence. Writing a brief, yet impactful sentence requires thought, clarity, and precision. In our fast-paced world, being able to convey a message effectively within a limited word count is a valuable skill. It serves as a testament to the writer's ability to communicate their thoughts and knowledge in a manner that is easily understood by the reader. A well-crafted brief sentence not only grabs the attention of the reader but also leaves a lasting impression in their minds. To achieve this, you must focus on the essential elements of your message and remove any extraneous details. This process requires an objective examination of the content and a willingness to revise and iterate. A few techniques to guide you in writing a concise sentence include: 1. Choose strong, specific words: Opt for words that accurately express your idea, so there is little room for ambiguity. Consider the connotations that each word carries, as this can affect the overall tone and message of your sentence. 2. Remove redundant words: Examine your sentence for repetitions or unnecessary words that do not add value to the message. These words tend to clutter your message, making it more difficult for the reader to understand. 3. Use active voice: Writing in the active voice contributes to a more direct and engaging tone, making it easier for the reader to comprehend the main point. 4. Simplify your sentence structure: Focus on the most critical information in your sentence, and avoid complex sentence structures that may confuse the reader. 5. Keep your audience in mind: Tailor your language and tone to the reader's knowledge and background, ensuring that they can easily grasp your message. In summary, writing a brief but effective sentence requires a balance of strong and specific word choice, elimination of redundancy, usage of active voice, streamlined sentence structure, and consideration of the target audience. Mastering these techniques will enable you to communicate your ideas and engage your readers efficiently."},{"instruction":"Complete the following sentence. The company bought more bar stools than booths although the patrons like to sit at the pick from the following. (A). stools . (B). booths .","output":"The company bought more bar stools than booths although the patrons like to sit at the booths. This decision was made after conducting a thorough analysis of the available space, financial constraints, and patrons' preferences. While it might seem counterintuitive to purchase more stools than booths, there were several factors that influenced this decision. Firstly, the space within the establishment was a significant factor. Bar stools take up less room than booths, allowing for more efficient use of the limited floor area. By placing more stools along the bar and around high-top tables, the company was able to maximize the seating capacity and create a more open, spacious environment for their patrons to socialize in. Additionally, bar stools are more flexible in terms of arrangement, as they can be easily moved around to accommodate large groups, events, or changes in the layout. Secondly, financial constraints played a substantial role in the decision to buy more bar stools. Generally, booths are more expensive to purchase and maintain due to their size, materials, and upholstery. On the other hand, bar stools typically have a lower price point and are more cost-effective in the long run. By choosing to invest in more bar stools, the company was able to allocate a larger portion of their budget to other important aspects, such as expanding their food and beverage offerings, enhancing the ambiance through decor and lighting, and providing top-notch customer service. Despite the preference of some patrons to sit at booths, the company also recognized that there is a diverse clientele with varying preferences when it comes to seating options. Those who enjoy mingling and engaging with others, for instance, might appreciate the more casual and communal atmosphere offered by bar stools. Additionally, placing more stools in strategic areas provided the opportunity for patrons to interact with the bartenders, fostering a sense of connection and camaraderie that can contribute to a more enjoyable experience. Furthermore, the company took note of the general trend in modern bars and restaurants to provide a more dynamic, multi-functional space where patrons can move around freely and engage in various activities or events. By incorporating more bar stools, they were able to create a versatile setup that can cater to different needs, such as live music performances, trivia nights, or networking events, where patrons may prefer a more casual seating arrangement. In conclusion, the company's choice to purchase more bar stools than booths, despite the patrons' preference for booths, was ultimately a strategic decision to maximize the use of space, adhere to financial constraints, appeal to different preferences, and create a multi-functional environment. By weighing these factors and adapting to the dynamic nature of the hospitality industry, the company has positioned itself for success and long-term customer satisfaction."},{"instruction":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

If Robin is always late, it's possible that others might want to take some steps to address the issue and improve future planning. 1. Communication: Friends or colleagues of Robin may want to have an open and honest conversation about his tardiness and the impact it has on them. This would give him an opportunity to understand how his late arrivals affect others and potentially address the issue. 2. Setting clear expectations: Establishing specific plans and asking Robin to commit to a time or deadline may help in making him more punctual. For example, others may want to confirm the meeting time, make sure Robin is aware, and remind him closer to the event. 3. Creating a buffer: Those planning with Robin could factor in a buffer time to minimize the impact of his tardiness on group plans. This might mean scheduling events with a time frame rather than an exact start time, or arranging other activities for the group to do in the event that Robin is late. 4. Assigning responsibilities: If others depend on Robin for specific tasks in a group setting, they may want to assign him responsibilities that are less time-sensitive or can be completed independently, reducing the importance of his punctuality. 5. Offering support: If there is an underlying reason for Robin's consistent tardiness, such as disorganization or personal issues, friends and colleagues can offer support and encouragement to help him overcome these challenges. Ultimately, how others proceed will depend on the nature of their relationship with Robin and the specific circumstances at hand.

The band, fronted by Dangers (the only permanent member), has proven versatile over the years, experimenting with techno, dubstep, drum and bass, IDM, industrial, dub and jazz fusion while touring the world and influencing major acts such as Nine Inch Nails, The Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy. Some of the band's earlier work has been credited with influencing the rise of the trip hop, big beat, and drum and bass genres. Dangers and Stephens had formed the English pop group Perennial Divide in 1986 with Paul Freeguard and released the first few Meat Beat Manifesto singles as a side project. They left Perennial Divide in 1988 to record a full Meat Beat album. The tapes of what would have been the debut MBM album were claimed to have been destroyed in a studio fire before it could be released (detailed in a publicity statement). The former founder of Sweat Box Records (Rob Deacon) said that the fire never happened. Jack Dangers confirmed the story of the fire in a 2010 interview. The pair then recorded the LP Storm The Studio, which got them pigeonholed as an industrial act because Sweat Box Records sold the rights to the LP to Wax Trax Records for release in the United States. In response, they released 99%, which was more techno-influenced, in May 1990. In August they released Armed Audio Warfare, which was an effort to re-create the lost tracks of the would-be debut album. The band's live show was conceived as an intense audio-visual experience, with dancers, led by choreographer Marcus Adams, in costumes and sets designed by artist Craig Morrison and video clips accompanying live instruments, sequenced electronic instruments, and live DJing. In the United States, they opened for Nine Inch Nails on their debut national tour in 1990. In 1991, they performed at The Limelight in Manhattan. Despite his contributions being nonmusical in nature, Adams was credited as a full band member and appeared in many of the band's record sleeves and promo photos until the release of Satyricon in 1992. Adams also appeared in several of MBM's early videos, such as \\"Strapdown\\" and \\"Psyche-Out\\". 1992's Satyricon continued to show Meat Beat adopting a more mainstream electronic sound, crediting influences of such newly popular dance bands as Orbital, The Shamen, and The Orb, all of whom had either remixed or been remixed by MBM. The album produced the hits \\"Mindstream\\" and \\"Circles\\". \\"Original Control (Version 2)\\", renamed \\"I Am Electro\\" in later compilations, is the best-known track from the album, featuring samples of recordings from the 1939 World's Fair exhibit Elektro The Robot, and was the opening song in MBM's 2005-2006 tour.

Drummer Jon Coghill described it as the most difficult Powderfinger song to play live at the time, because it was so \\"fast and offbeat\\". The music video for \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out\\" was unpopular and drew criticism from band members. \\"Good-Day Ray\\" was dedicated to Australian television presenter Ray Martin and his public disagreements with former Media Watch host Stuart Littlemore. Its lyrics verged on punk, though Coghill denied that Powderfinger were a punk band. He also described the music video for \\"Good-Day Ray\\" as being one of the better videos the band had made.Internationalist's third single was \\"Already Gone\\", released on 12 February 1999. The song was a tribute to the Beatles and their influence on Powderfinger's music. The fourth and final single from the album was \\"Passenger\\", released on 9 August 1999. \\"Passenger\\" was influenced by Elvis Presley, and included a big horn section, as well as backing vocals from folk group Tiddas. \\"Passenger\\" won the ARIA Award for \\"Song Of The Year\\" in 1999. The song's music video was one of Powderfinger's first to feature computer graphics, and was produced by Fifty Fifty Films. \\"Passenger\\" spent 11 weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #30. It appeared at #48 on Max's top 100 songs from the 1990s list. Answer:","output":"The name of the album for which the fourth and final single was \\"Passenger\\" is \\"Internationalist\\"."},{"instruction":"Like the other two, he lived a life of isolation, but one that had made him fantastically rich.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Senator Jader Barbalho has a couple corruption charges.","output":"Based on the given paragraph, we can infer that Senator Jader Barbalho has faced serious corruption charges. The paragraph states, \\"The PMDB is also the party led by Senator Jader Barbalho, the recently elected Senate President heaped with serious corruption charges.\\" This suggests that there are multiple corruption charges against Senator Jader Barbalho. However, it is important to note that the paragraph does not provide specific details regarding these corruption charges, such as the nature of the allegations, the number of cases, or whether the charges have been proven true or false. Additionally, the paragraph does not indicate the possible impact of these charges on Senator Jader Barbalho's political career or his ability to lead the PMDB party. Moreover, the paragraph implies an alignment between Senator Jader Barbalho and the PMDB party. It is worth noting that the PMDB, or Brazilian Democratic Movement (in Portuguese, Partido do Movimento Democrático Brasileiro), is a Brazilian political party that has historically held significant political power in the country, both during the military dictatorship and in the modern democratic era. Senator Jader Barbalho, being elected as the Senate President and leading the PMDB, is an influential political figure in Brazil. While it is reasonable to conclude that Senator Jader Barbalho has faced multiple corruption charges based on the paragraph, it is crucial to seek additional information and sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of the issue. Reiterating the sentence as \\"Senator Jader Barbalho has a couple of corruption charges\\" puts a limit to the number of charges, whereas the paragraph suggests that there are several serious corruption charges against him. A more accurate summary sentence based on the supplied information might be: \\"Senator Jader Barbalho is facing serious corruption charges.\\" In conclusion, based on the paragraph provided, we can deduce that Senator Jader Barbalho has faced multiple serious corruption charges, but the specifics of these charges are not detailed in the text. Therefore, it would be prudent to research further information concerning this topic to ensure a thorough understanding of the situation."},{"instruction":"the european parliament and brussels luxembourg train station are 100 metres away.

To provide the answer to the question about traditional mass music, we must dive into the history of liturgical music. Traditional Catholic Mass has a long history of music, dating back to the early Christian church. The types of music used in traditional Catholic Mass have evolved over centuries, with different forms and genres emerging. Two of the most prominent forms of music utilized in traditional Mass are Gregorian chant and polyphony. Gregorian chant, named after Pope Gregory the Great, is the earliest known form of liturgical music that has been performed in the Catholic Church. This monophonic, unaccompanied sacred song features a simple melody and is sung in Latin. Gregorian chants were designed to be easily memorizable for choirs and were primarily used in the celebration of the Mass and the Divine Office. During the late Middle Ages and Renaissance periods, polyphony emerged as a prominent form of sacred music. Polyphony is a musical texture in which two or more melodic voices or lines are woven together, resulting in a more complex and harmonically rich sound. Several composers of this era, such as Palestrina, Byrd, and Tallis, are renowned for their contributions to sacred polyphony. Their works, often written for a choir and in Latin, were featured in the celebration of the Mass, and many of these compositions are still performed today. Following the Second Vatican Council, the Mass of Paul VI was introduced, leading to the widespread use of vernacular languages, new music, and various musical styles in liturgy. While this opened the door for contemporary compositions and local musical traditions, the importance of preserving and fostering the rich heritage of sacred music, such as Gregorian chant and polyphony, was also emphasized. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"What type of music was used in traditional mass?\\" is that traditional Mass predominantly featured Gregorian chant and polyphonic music, with Latin being the primary language used in these compositions."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence that about [Strada eatType pub; Strada food Italian; Strada customer rating average; Strada near Yippee Noodle Bar].","output":"Step 1: Understand the given information. - There is a pub eatery called Strada. - Strada serves Italian food. - Strada has an average customer rating. - Strada is near the Yippee Noodle Bar.

Considering various situations, PersonX might cover their eyes to shield themselves from a bright light, hide from someone or something, or playfully engage in a game like \\"peekaboo\\" with a child. With these possibilities in mind, the potential emotional reactions largely depend on the reason why PersonX performed this action, but they could range from relief (from blocking out a bright light), fear (from hiding), or joy (from engaging playfully with someone).

Geographically situated in the central region of upstate New York, Albany lies approximately 150 miles (241 kilometers) north of the bustling metropolis of New York City and about 140 miles (225 kilometers) west of Boston. This strategic location has been central to Albany's development and growth since its establishment in the 17th century. Albany is part of the Capital District, an area encompassing the four neighboring counties of Albany, Schenectady, Rensselaer, and Saratoga. This region serves as a crucial economic, political, and cultural hub of the state. With a population of roughly 98,000 in the city proper (2020 census) and over one million inhabitants in the greater Capital District, Albany is the sixth-largest city in New York State by population. The area that is now Albany was originally inhabited by Native Americans, particularly the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) and the Mohican tribes. Dutch settlers began colonizing the area in 1624, and the Dutch Trading Post of Fort Nassau was built on the west bank of the Hudson River the same year, marking the beginning of European settlement in the region. In 1629, the Dutch West India Company established a patroonship formally named New Netherland, with the city of Beverwijck as its central hub in the region. The city was later renamed Albany, after the English Duke of Albany, when the English conquered New Netherland in 1664. Albany has a rich history that dates back over 400 years and is well-established as a key center in the development of the United States. The Albany Congress of 1754, which saw representatives from seven of the Thirteen Colonies gather to discuss a common defense against the French, led to the signing of the Albany Plan of Union, a proposal to create a unified government for the British colonies in what later became the United States. During the American Revolution, Albany was a strategic location, and the city saw the passage of troops, supplies, and crucial information. After the Revolution, the city became a center of trade, transportation, and industry, taking advantage of its strategic location and access to the Hudson River. In 1797, the city of Albany was officially named the capital of New York State. Today, Albany continues to serve as a governmental center, hosting the New York State Capitol and the Governor's Mansion, as well as being home to numerous government agencies and institutions. The city also boasts numerous parks, historic sites, museums, and cultural attractions that provide a glimpse into its rich and storied past. Some notable sites include the Albany Institute of History and Art, the New York State Museum, and the Palace Theatre. In addition to its political and historical significance, Albany and the surrounding Capital District have emerged as important centers for higher education and business. The region is home to several distinguished universities, including the University at Albany (SUNY), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Union College. Additionally, the area has become a research and development hub for cutting-edge industries such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, and alternative energy. In conclusion, Albany is located in the eastern part of New York State, in the central region of upstate New York along the Hudson River. As the state capital and a key center for history, culture, education, and industry, Albany plays a significant role in the continuing development and growth of New York State and the United States."},{"instruction":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

At the 2018 Hungarian Ladies Open, she achieved a serve speed of 220 kilometers per hour (136.7 miles per hour). However, this record is unofficial because it was not recorded at a main draw match or Grand Slam. The official fastest serve in women's tennis is generally recognized to be held by tennis icon, Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands. She is known for the incredible speed of her serve. On 30 July 2006, during the Western & Southern Open (Stanford Classic), she made a serve that clocked in at 210 kilometers per hour (130 miles per hour), the record recorded speed in an official match or Grand Slam. Schultz-McCarthy's speed has been bested a few times, but unfortunately, these were not during a main draw match or Grand Slam, and thus, are not recognized as official records. Sabine Lisicki of Germany notched an unofficial speed of 211 kilometers per hour (131.0 miles per hour) at the 2014 Stanford Classic, a speed that has yet to be replicated in an official setting. Venus Williams, also known for her power serve, has topped speeds of 207 kilometers per hour (128.6 miles per hour), and her sister Serena, often hailed as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, has reached 207 kilometers per hour (128.6 miles per hour) as well, during the 2013 Australian Open. The ability to serve with such speed is a notable advantage in tennis, as it can catch opponents off guard and limit their response time. However, it's not the sole determinant of success. Accuracy, spin, and placement are equally, if not more, important. Combining a high speed serve with these other factors can greatly increase a player's effectiveness during their serve. Tennis is a multidimensional game and while having the fastest serve can be a beneficial weapon, it is the combination of skills, resilience, strategy and mental strength that often determines who comes out on top in this challenging sport."},{"instruction":"What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who played the tambourine? from the following article ? Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places.

A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly.

The United Nations in Pakistan has pulled all staff involved in the campaign off the streets, spokesman Michael Coleman said. The government said immunization was continuing in some areas without U.N. support although many workers refused to go out. Women health workers held protests in the southern city of Karachi and in the capital, Islamabad. \\"We go out and risk our lives to save other people's children from being permanently handicapped, for what? So that our own children become orphans?\\" health worker Ambreen Bibi said at the Islamabad protest. The government was caught off guard by the violence, saying they had not expected attacks in areas far from Taliban strongholds and they would have to change tactics in the health campaign. \\"We didn't expect such attacks in Karachi,\\" said Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, minister for human rights, who oversees the polio campaign. He was referring to the southern commercial hub where there have been attacks this week. \\"In far flung areas where the threats are more pronounced, we have been providing polio teams security.\\" Wednesday saw four separate attacks, all in the north. In the district of Charsadda, men on motorbikes shot dead a woman and her driver, police and health officials said. Hours earlier, gunmen wounded a male health worker in the nearby provincial capital of Peshawar. He was in critical condition, said a doctor at the Lady Reading Hospital where he is being treated. Four other women health workers were shot at but not hit in nearby Nowshera, said Jan Baz Afridi, deputy head of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation. Two women health workers were shot at in Dwasaro village in Charsadda, police said. It was not clear who was behind the violence. Many Islamists, including Taliban militants, have long opposed the campaign. Some say it aims to sterilize Muslims, while one militant commander said it could not continue unless attacks by U.S. drone aircraft stopped. The Taliban have repeatedly threatened health workers involved in the campaign. Some said they received calls telling them to stop working with \\"infidels\\" just before the attacks. But a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, Ihsanullah Ihsan, told Reuters his group was not involved in the violence. \\"BETTER COORDINATION\\" On Monday and Tuesday, six health workers were killed in attacks in the southern port city of Karachi and in Peshawar. Five were women and the youngest was 17. Five of the shootings happened in Karachi, home to 18 million people. Health authorities there suspended the polio eradication campaign in the entire province of Sindh. Karachi police spokesman Imran Shaukat said teams were supposed to tell police of their movements but had not done so. \\"There has to be better coordination between the health department and police,\\" he said. \\"We have decided that we will be more forthcoming and contact polio team heads ourselves.\\" Minister Khokhar said the drive would resume as soon as security was in place. \\"The teams go into every little neighborhood. You can understand that enormous resources are needed if we have to protect each and every team and worker, which we will have to now,\\" he said. On Wednesday, police said they killed two people and arrested 15 during raids connected to the shootings. Authorities in the northern Khyber Paktunkhwa province, the capital of which is Peshawar, said they would not accept the U.N.'s recommendation to suspend the campaign. \\"If we stopped the campaign it would encourage the forces opposing the polio vaccination,\\" said provincial official Javed Marwat. But their insistence the campaign continue angered health workers who said their colleagues told officials in Charsadda about threats before Wednesday's shootings. The officials insisted the vaccinations take place anyway. Khokar said Taliban hostility to the campaign increased after it emerged that the CIA had used a fake vaccination campaign to try to gather information about Osama bin Laden, before he was found and killed in a Pakistani town last year. Pakistan had 20,000 polio cases in 1994 but vigorous vaccination efforts had brought the number down to 56 in 2012, the government said. A global vaccination campaign has eradicated the disease from everywhere except Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria. Polio can paralyze or kill within hours of infection. It is transmitted person-to-person, meaning that as long as one child is infected, the disease can be passed to others. (Additional reporting by Mehreen Zahra-Malik in Islamabad and Imtiaz Shah in Karachi; Writing by Katharine Houreld; Editing by Michael Perry and Robert Birsel) ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bruce Aylward, World Health Organisation: Attacks \\"absolutely horrific\\" Two polio vaccination workers have been killed in north-western Pakistan in the latest of a spate of deadly attacks. The shootings in the Peshawar region left a vaccination supervisor and her driver dead, and injured a volunteer. The deaths brought to eight the number of health workers killed in this week's anti-polio drive. The three-day drive is now over. No group has claimed responsibility, but the Taliban have issued threats against the UN's anti-polio efforts. The militants have accused health workers of working as US spies and say the vaccine makes children sterile. Pakistan is one of just three countries where the disease is still endemic. Coming after five deaths on Tuesday, and one on Monday, the UN children's agency Unicef and the World Health Organisation halted work in Sindh province in the south and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the north-west on Tuesday. The suspension was extended nationwide on Wednesday. The UN provides technical and financial support to employees and volunteers of the local health departments who administer the polio drops. Despite the killings, the immunisation drive continued in some areas on Wednesday - although a number of local health workers refused to go out, Reuters news agency reported. 'We risk our lives' In Wednesday's violence, the vaccination supervisor and her driver died when their car was sprayed with bullets by gunmen riding motorbikes in Charsadda district, north-east of Peshawar, police said. The student volunteer was shot in the head and critically injured when gunmen on two motorbikes fired at a team of vaccinators in a northern suburb of Peshawar. Polio's last stand? 2012 cases Nigeria - 97 Pakistan - 47 Afghanistan - 26 Chad - 5 Source: IMB Polio killings a major setback Gunmen riding motorbikes also shot at polio vaccinators in another area of Charsadda and in the adjoining district of Nowshera, although no injuries were reported. On Tuesday, four female health workers were shot dead in the space of 20 minutes in Karachi, and a fifth woman died after being shot in Peshawar. A day earlier a male health worker working on the anti-polio drive was also killed in Karachi, although police have suggested other factors may also lie behind his death. Correspondents say the authorities were caught off guard by the violence - until now most attacks on health workers have taken place in north-western areas near militant strongholds. At a rally in Islamabad, health worker Ambreen Bibi told Reuters: \\"We go out and risk our lives to save other people's children from being permanently handicapped, for what? So that our own children become orphans?\\" Wednesday was the final day of a three-day nationwide anti-polio drive - during which an estimated 5.2 million polio drops were to be administered. There has been opposition to such immunisation efforts in parts of Pakistan, particularly after a fake CIA hepatitis vaccination campaign helped to locate Osama Bin Laden in 2011. Militants have kidnapped and killed foreign NGO workers in the past in an attempt to halt the immunisation drives, which they say are part of efforts to spy on them. Polio facts Highly infectious viral disease Transmitted via contaminated faeces Can cause irreversible paralysis, usually in the legs A minority of cases are fatal Afghanistan and Nigeria are the only other countries where polio is still endemic. Pakistan is considered the key battleground in the global fight against the disease, which attacks the nervous system and can cause permanent paralysis within hours of infection. Almost 200 children were paralysed in the country in 2011 - the worst figures in 15 years. Earlier this year, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative warned that tackling the disease had entered \\"emergency mode\\" after \\"explosive\\" outbreaks in countries previously free of polio. The World Health Organization said polio was at a tipping point, with experts fearing it could \\"come back with a vengeance\\" after large outbreaks in Africa and Tajikistan, and China's first recorded cases for more than a decade. Declaring polio a national emergency, the Pakistani government is targeting 33 million children for vaccination with some 88,000 health workers delivering vaccination drops. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"In an unprecedented series of attacks in Pakistan, three workers in a polio eradication campaign were shot, two of whom were killed.

After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

Why is the narrator appearing so eager ?","output":"The narrator appears to be very eager for a few reasons, which are interconnected and shed light on their emotional state and the significance of the situation in their life. 1. Personal Journey and Emotional Investment: The narrator might have been through a long and difficult journey trying to conceive. The process of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) can be physically, emotionally, and financially draining. Their eagerness may have been built over time as they faced challenges and disappointments during their journey to conceive a child. 2. Positive Results Beyond Expectations: The quote mentions that the person the narrator is referring to underestimated the maturity of the harvested eggs. Since the retrieved eggs are a crucial part of the IVF process, hearing this news might have given the narrator a sense of hope, relief, and sheer joy. The fact that the results exceeded their expectations amplifies their eagerness to find out just how many eggs were mature and how many fertilized successfully. 3. Anticipation of the Outcome: The IVF process is filled with uncertainties and waiting for test results. The narrator may be keen to know the maturity and fertilization levels of the eggs, as this information would provide some degree of prediction about the chances of success for this IVF cycle. This anticipation and eagerness are likely fueled by the importance they place on the outcome of their fertility treatment. 4. Support System: The narrator is expressing their appreciation for the person who performed the procedure, and this could be indicative of a strong support system. The encouragement and validation they receive from those involved in the process may contribute to the narrator feeling more enthusiastic and confident in their journey to conceive a child. 5. A Significant Life Goal: For many people, parenthood is a significant life goal and is something experienced intensely and personally. The emotional and psychological attachment they have towards becoming a parent could contribute to the eagerness the narrator feels in sharing their news. In conclusion, the narrator's eagerness stems from a variety of factors, including their personal journey, emotional investment, anticipation of the outcome, support system, and the significance of achieving parenthood in their life. As a result, their excitement and enthusiasm are deeply rooted in their experiences, emotions, and aspirations, which makes their feelings both understandable and relatable."},{"instruction":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how many black people live in green bay Suggested answer: Green Bay is home to the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League , making it by far the smallest metropolitan area in the USA to host a major professional sports franchise.

Context: Today, I want to share why I think you should interview real estate agents before hiring one. Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt.

LOS ANGELES â Like those apocryphal monks who spent the Middle Ages quarreling over the number of angels per pinhead, stand-up comics endlessly obsess over the minutiae of their lives. Perhaps no stand-up obsesses more compulsively than Brody Stevens, a 43-year-old un-funnyman whose canniest career move has been a nervous breakdown. Broadcast live. On Twitter. His most intense fixation â himself â is the subject of a new reality show, âBrody Stevens: Enjoy It!,â an expanded and updated version of an HBO web series, that has its premiere Sunday on Comedy Central. The showâs executive producer, Mike Gibbons, calls it the channelâs first drama. âHalf of Brodyâs life is a bit, and the other half is bringing his life into a bit,â the comic Jen Kirkman said. âIf viewers arenât freaked out by him and think heâs a complete loon, he could become a sensation.â The unnerving back story: Two summers ago, Mr. Stevens stopped taking his anti-anxiety medication and fired off a fusillade of screwy tweets, one of which involved sticking a gun into his mouth. He was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. Until that point he was best known (when known at all) as an audience warm-up comic on âChelsea Latelyâ and for eye-blink cameos in the first two âHangoverâ films. The still-unfolding front story: Mr. Stevens is now on mood stabilizers, pulling his life together and, like a recovering alcoholic, making amends with friends and relatives he offended during his very public crackup. These reconciliations are chronicled through animation, mockumentary footage and interviews with people like prospective dates and the in-house shrink at a comedy club here. Whether viewers will enjoy âEnjoy It!â may depend on how endearing they find Mr. Stevens and his many peculiarities. Heâs presented as an amiable innocent with manic elations and a childlike attachment to his mother (a scene stealer). He seems to have little awareness of anyone not named Brody Stevens. âIâve got adult-onset autism,â he more or less explained during an interview conducted while watching a college ballgame. Twitter-ready gibberish (âPositive energy. #Yes!â) bursts forth, as if from a parrot. Is it a routine or a reflex? Zach Galifianakis, the actor-comedian, who helped conceive the show and is Mr. Stevensâs biggest fan, observed: âBrody is an open book that I donât think a lot of people would check out of the library. By the way, do they publish one-page books?â In the comic cosmos, the crazy world of Mr. Stevens is just one small planet. Madly spinning supernovas like Jonathan Winters, Peter Sellers and Richard Pryor have milked the comedy of lunacy as well as the horror. Few stand-ups have mined their mental instability more poignantly or pointedly than Maria Bamford, whose 2009 web series showcases a breakdown in a Los Angeles comedy club that lands her back home in Minnesota, where she lives in her parentsâ attic. âThe Maria Bamford Showâ was a rubber room for self-examination. In contrast, the earnest, irony-free Mr. Stevens performs the comedy of excruciating awkwardness, daring club audiences to not laugh at his unfunny material. Heâs less interested in amusing people than abusing them. âWith Brody, itâs never about the jokes,â Mr. Galifianakis said. âItâs about the in between the jokes.â Between jokes, Mr. Stevens self-medicates by chanting non sequiturs (âMagnets. #Push and Believe!â) in the mesmerizing staccato of a TV sportscaster. Discomfited audiences seldom know when theyâre supposed to laugh. On a recent evening in a West Hollywood club, Mr. Stevens stood astride the stage. Stroking his neatly trimmed beard, he glared at the crowd. And glared at the crowd. And glared at the crowd. Brows furrowed like twin caterpillars, arms spread like a bird of prey showing off its menacing wingspan, he unleashed a mess of mostly feeble gags. (âI was a model in Serbiaâ was not the worst of them.) After an especially lame one-liner was met by uneasy silence, Mr. Stevens screamed, âWhy ... did ... you ... not ... laugh? On cadence alone, support me!â And which accounts for why fellow comics marvel at Mr. Stevensâs escape artistry. âThe less response Brody gets, the more he confronts the crowd,â Ms. Kirkman said. âHe does what the rest of us only wish we could do.â Summary:","output":"\\"Brody Stevens: Enjoy It!\\" is a new reality show on Comedy Central, offering an in-depth look into the life of stand-up comedian, Brody Stevens. This reality show follows Stevens's personal healing journey from a public breakdown initially broadcasted on Twitter, involving him posting messages about his mental state and his cessation of anti-anxiety medication. The show provides insight into Stevens's process of getting back on track and reconciling with the friends and relatives he offended during his public meltdown. These heartfelt reconciliations are portrayed through a mix of animation, mockumentary-style footage, and interviews with various individuals in Stevens's life. The comedian's personal struggles with mental health play a significant role in augmenting his comedic charm on the show. However, his unique comedy style doesn't always aim to amuse the audience. Instead, he often focuses on making people uncomfortable with his painfully awkward sense of humor, challenging audiences not to laugh at his seemingly unfunny material. Fellow comedian Zach Galifianakis, who helped develop the show, has described Stevens as \\"an open book that I don’t think a lot of people would check out of the library.\\" In the bigger picture of the comedy cosmos, Stevens's world may only be a small planet, but his honesty, ironically-free routines, and the raw exploration of his life's eccentricities set him apart. Whether the audience will appreciate \\"Enjoy It!\\" hinges on their acceptance of Stevens's idiosyncratic comedic style and his personal peculiarities. According to Jen Kirkman, another comic, if viewers are not perturbed by his unconventional style and personality, Stevens could become a sensation. Ultimately, \\"Brody Stevens: Enjoy It!\\" is a ground-breaking new reality show that features a deeply human narrative about grappling with personal demons and vulnerabilities, cleverly intertwined with the world of comedy."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

The name \\"man of war\\" has historical roots with the ships used by pirates and navies during the late medieval times known as \\"men of war,\\" which were aggressive and skilled in robbery at sea. Similarly, the Magnificent Frigatebird engages in piracy-like theft in the sky. Other frigatebird species, such as the Great Frigatebird, also exhibit similar behavior. The Magnificent Frigatebird is a large, seabird found throughout the subtropical and tropical regions in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as along the coasts of the Americas. It has unique physical characteristics that make it well-suited for its life in the air and stealing food from other birds. The bird has a long, curved bill attached to a deeply hooked upper mandible for gripping. It also possesses an extraordinary wingspan to body weight ratio resulting in exceptional maneuverability and aerial acrobatics. For an average body weight of around 1.5 kg, the wingspan can span up to 2.5 meters (or around 7 feet), which allows the frigatebirds to stay airborne for extended periods and cover vast distances while scanning for prey. Though the Magnificent Frigatebird can catch its own food, which consists mostly of fish and squid, it is notorious for its kleptoparasitic feeding habits. This bird has mastered harassing other birds, like gulls, terns, and even boobies, in mid-air and using its superior agility to force them into releasing their hard-earned catches. Once the target bird drops its prey, the frigatebird swoops in and snatches the food out of the air or from the water's surface. This kleptoparasitic behavior isn't just the result of opportunism; it is an evolutionary trait that the Magnificent Frigatebird has developed in response to its natural limitations. Unlike other seabirds, frigatebirds are not equipped for diving or swimming, as they have short, partially webbed feet and their feathers are not waterproof. Therefore, they need to find their food without diving or sinking into the water. Taking everything into account, the Magnificent Frigatebird is an exceptional creature that thrives in its marine environment by employing its unique kleptoparasitic methods and taking advantage of its remarkable physical characteristics. The nickname \\"man of war\\" accurately represents this impressive bird's ability to completely dominate its realm in the skies and the seas."},{"instruction":"Q:Who has tim howard played for?

Hmmm, my chain of thoughts:","output":"1. First, we need to consider the customer's preference: Different customers have varied preferences when it comes to taste, so some customers may appreciate the gamey flavor while others might not. Personal preference plays a significant role in their happiness with the meat's taste. 2. Next, consider the context: Is the gamey taste intentional or a result of improper handling/storage? If the grocery store is purposefully offering gamey meat options, customers who seek game-flavored meats will be happy. However, if the taste is unintended and the result of poor handling, a customer would likely be unhappy. 3. Quality Assurance: If the grocery store consistently provides high-quality meat, a gamey taste may not necessarily make the customer unhappy, provided that it is marketed and communicated properly. Poor quality standards, on the other hand, will likely result in dissatisfaction, regardless of the meat's gamey flavor. 4. Marketing and communication: If the grocery store effectively communicates the taste profile of the meat and its target audience, customers who prefer game-flavored meat will likely be satisfied. However, if the store fails to communicate this, customers with different taste preferences may be unhappy with their purchase. 5. Expectation vs. Reality: Customers who are expecting the grocery store to provide traditional, non-gamey meats may be unhappy if the meat tastes like game. On the other hand, customers who are open to gamey tastes or are specifically looking for such flavors may find the meat to their liking. In conclusion, customer happiness with the meat's taste largely depends on personal preferences, proper handling and storage, quality assurance, marketing and communication of the product by the grocery store, and whether their expectations are met."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Voici une phrase en français, qui est une autre langue que l'anglais."},{"instruction":"Q:I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Question: What will Remy want to do next? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: were ready to go home B: wait for the ride C: walk home Answer:","output":"B: wait for the ride The context given suggests that Alex made Remy call his mother to come and pick them up at the park.

Here's a step-by-step analysis to justify this choice: 1.

This rules out taverns since they typically serve alcohol along with food. 4. Between a dining hall and a restaurant, a restaurant is more likely to have a setup where people sit on bar stools, order food, and expect to have a meal. Dining halls, on the other hand, are typically more casual and associated with a buffet-style setup or catering to larger groups for a specific purpose, such as at an educational institution or event.

So the rest of the books are sold for 2 each. 10 - 4 = 6 Therefore, Lovely can sell 6 books at the price of 2 each. 3. Calculate the earnings from selling 4 books at 2.50 each. 4 books * 2.50 = 10 4. Calculate the earnings from selling 6 books at 2 each. 6 books * 2 = 12 5. Calculate Lovely's total earnings from selling all 10 books. 10 (from 4 books sold at 2.50 each) + 12 (from 6 books sold at 2 each) = 22 So, Lovely will earn 22 if all 10 books were sold."},{"instruction":"Choose how you want this story to end.

(Photo: T-Mobile) NEW YORK—Your cellphone coverage is pretty good in the neighborhoods where you live and work, but securing a decent signal inside your house has proved to be a challenge. On Monday, T-Mobile announced T-Mobile 4G LTE CellSpot, an 8.5-inch tall and 8.5-inch wide box which plugs into your Internet router and which the company claims can provide an average of 3,000 square feet of full-bar LTE coverage indoors. Based on \\"femtocell\\" or \\"small cell\\" technology, T-Mobile says this is the first-ever 4G LTE mini-tower available from a U.S. wireless provider. LTE (Long Term Evolution) is the prevailing 4th generation of speedy wireless. T-Mobile's solution is like putting a tiny cell phone tower in the home to improve coverage in the basement or other areas where network coverage might be shaky. T-Mobile is giving CellSpot to its post-paid customers for free, though you'll have to leave a refundable 25 deposit, and remain a T-Mobile customer. Post-paid refers to the lucrative segment of customers who pay their wireless bills each month. The low-power box becomes available on Wednesday. If you're a qualifying customer, you can request CellSpot in a T-Mobile store but the company won't have them in stock and is instead shipping out units. T-Mobile is also pushing the benefit to its small business customers, since the 4G LTE CellSpot supports up to 16 calls at one time and works with any 3G, 4G or LTE device that is compatible with T-Mobile's network. But you'll need a T-Mobile phone to tap into the signal. It's a \\"huge feat of engineering,\\" T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in a statement. Under Legere, T-Mobile has been building out and bolstering its 4G LTE network coverage, while attempting to also improve the company's reputation. Its 4G network now reaches more than 300 million people in the U.S., which T-Mobile claims puts the carrier on par with Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Still, the 4G LTE CellSpot could help provide coverage to consumers in less populated areas , where T-Mobile's coverage may not be as strong as its rivals. This isn't the first time T-Mobile has tried to bolster indoor coverage. In September of last year, T-Mobile unveiled a CellSpot Wi-Fi router that lets customers make Wi-Fi calls and text in areas beyond cell coverage. More than 1 million of the routers are currently in circulation; T-Mobile customers are making more than 11 million Wi-Fi calls daily, the company says. T-Mobile also offers customers a 4G LTE CellSpot Signal Booster. That raises the question of where the new 4G LTE CellSpot box fits in, especially if you can already use a router to make Wi-Fi calls. T-Mobile says that LTE is often faster and more reliable than Wi-Fi, and that the new box is compatible with the latest network technologies, including HD Calling, VoLTE (Voice over LTE), advanced messaging, and video calling. And once installed, T-Mobile's chief operating officer Mike Sievert said in an interview that \\"customers have to do absolutely nothing to make it work.\\" Today's announcement comes ahead of T-Mobile's next big \\"Un-carrier\\" promotional event, scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on Nov 10. Though T-Mobile hasn't said what next week will bring, the speculation is that the company might let you use popular streaming video services--perhaps, HBO, Hulu, Netflix, and so on—without having it count against your monthly data usage. T-Mobile already does this with many popular music services. Sievert wouldn't spill the beans ahead of time. Email: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY personal tech columnist @edbaig on Twitter Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Mtc0yJ ||||| Customers browse in a T-Mobile store in Budapest on Monday. (Akos Stiller/Bloomberg) T-Mobile has begun giving out miniature cell towers to customers in an attempt to create little hotspots of LTE where the carrier's network is weak or nonexistent. The devices, which cost little more than a 25 refundable deposit, are being promoted to homes and small businesses and can connect any T-Mobile customer's smartphone to mobile data, including 3G and 4G. The company says they can cover a range of 3,000 square feet. So should you get one? In some individual circumstances, maybe, but for the vast majority of consumers, you might be better off using plain, old, boring WiFi. Here's why. T-Mobile's CellSpot doesn't provide an Internet connection all by itself. It has to be plugged into an existing wired broadband connection, the kind of service you might buy from Comcast or Verizon. That requirement ultimately makes the CellSpot impractical for many consumers. Think about your current home Internet provider. Chances are, the company included a WiFi router with your installation, and if it didn't, you likely went out and bought your own. Not only does the CellSpot effectively duplicate an Internet access technology already present in many people's homes — it comes with other drawbacks. The CellSpot's data speeds are only as fast as your fixed broadband connection, so it's not as though you can plug the device into a 10 Mbps service and suddenly be surfing at 60 Mbps. \\"Imagine putting a race car in rush hour traffic in the scenario you describe,\\" said Joel Rushing, a T-Mobile spokesperson. What's more, using the CellSpot drains your T-Mobile data plan, whereas surfing on WiFi is completely free (except in places where wired Internet providers have implemented data caps themselves). If any other T-Mobile customers happen to be nearby, their devices can link to the CellSpot, too. Giving out access to T-Mobile's network might be nice when you've invited guests over. But then again, why not just give them access to your home WiFi network? If you're not interested in broadcasting LTE beyond your apartment or other small space, Rushing said, the T-Mobile Personal CellSpot Router might be a better choice. It's basically a regular WiFi router that happens to be optimized to handle T-Mobile's WiFi calling features. But again, with that choice you'd be going back to WiFi. Any households that might be thinking of getting an LTE CellSpot from T-Mobile will need to consider a few things: Does being on T-Mobile's network matter more to you than being on WiFi? Compared to the LTE CellSpot, WiFi costs nothing to surf, supports faster speeds, and you have more control over it (through your router's settings, whereas you can't set a password on the LTE CellSpot). ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The T-Mobile 4G LTE CellSpot is a small box that you can plug into your Internet router at home or in your office. It helps make your cellphone signal stronger inside your house, especially in places where the signal might not be very good. It is like having a mini cellphone tower inside your home. T-Mobile gives these CellSpots to some of their customers for free, but you have to leave a 25 deposit and stay as their customer. This can help people who live in areas where T-Mobile's signal isn't as strong as other cellphone companies. However, it uses your T-Mobile data plan, so using it instead of Wi-Fi could use up your monthly data allowance."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a sentence in the Swedish language and your task is to convert it into the English language.

Her first experience as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker \\"Violin\\" to the wistful waltz of hit single \\"Army Dreamers\\". Never for Ever was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top. The top-selling single from the album was \\"Babooshka\\", which reached number five in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again\\", which reached number 29 in the UK charts. September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become \\"less accessible\\".

This creative endeavor not only helps to foster a love for learning but also promotes a sense of independence and responsibility in young learners. Whether you have an entire room to spare or simply wish to carve out a small nook within an existing space, creating a dedicated learning area can help your child thrive academically and personally. In this article, we will explore several essential tips and elements to consider when designing your home classroom. Step 1: Determine the Space Before you begin designing your home classroom, assess the available space in your house. If you have an extra room, you can transform it into a dedicated learning environment that offers ample space for various activities and storage for educational materials. However, if space is limited, consider setting up a classroom within a multi-functional room, such as a living room or den, where your child can still focus and engage in their learning activities. Step 2: Choose an Area without Distractions Regardless of the space you have allotted for your home classroom, selecting an area away from distractions is crucial. This will help your child concentrate on their school work and minimize potential sources of interruption, such as noise from the television, conversations, or high-traffic areas. Step 3: Flooring Considerations When designing your home classroom, proper flooring is an essential aspect to consider. Opt for a space without carpets to minimize allergens and ensure easy cleanup for art projects and spills. If your chosen area has carpeting or delicate flooring, consider investing in floor mats or protective coverings. These options can provide a barrier against damage and offer a more comfortable seating area when working on educational activities. Step 4: Add Character with Paint and Decals Now that the basic setup of your home classroom is complete, it's time to make it inviting and engaging for your child. Painting the room with vibrant colors can stimulate creativity and encourage a positive learning atmosphere. Consider discussing color options with your child, allowing them to select the hue that sparks their interest and creativity. If painting an entire room is not feasible or desired, an alternative option is incorporating educational or decorative decals on the walls. Decals can add a touch of creativity and fun to the space without the permanent commitment of paint. Choose decals that are visually appealing and also promote learning, such as a world map, the alphabet, or mathematical symbols. Step 5: Furnish the Learning Space Selecting the appropriate furniture and storage solutions for your home classroom will contribute significantly to the success of your child's academic journey. Invest in a sturdy desk or table with ample space for various tasks, such as writing, drawing, or working on a laptop or tablet. Comfortable chairs or seating options are essential to ensure your child remains focused for longer periods. Additionally, bookshelves and storage bins can keep educational materials and toys organized and easily accessible. Step 6: Personalize the Environment Finally, personalize the classroom to suit your child's interests and learning style. Create a reading corner with cozy seating and a stock of their favorite books or a science station with lab equipment and various specimens. Strategically place motivational posters or inspirational quotes on the walls to encourage a positive mindset and instill a love for learning. Conclusion Designing a home classroom tailored specifically to your child will nurture their academic growth and independence. Be it a dedicated room or a small corner within a living space, following these design tips will help create the perfect learning environment that promotes creativity, focus, and a lifelong love of education."},{"instruction":"A fireman climbing on a charred ceiling beam need not necessarily be having his visor down.is the reasoning for what question and answer pair?","output":"The question and answer pair could be: Question: \\"Does a fireman always have to wear his visor down while climbing on a charred ceiling beam?\\" Answer: \\"No, a fireman climbing on a charred ceiling beam need not necessarily have his visor down, as it depends on factors such as the level of remaining hazards, the intensity of the heat and the degree of visibility in the area.\\""},{"instruction":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: Saturday 10 February, 2018 61815393 requests since Tuesday 16 December, 2003","output":"The sentence without spaces becomes: Saturday10February,201861815393requestssinceTuesday16December,2003"},{"instruction":"Whole Foods places ban on seafood A Whole Foods ban on seafood starts this week.

They share many morphological features with the scorpionfish of the family Scorpaenidae. - Cirrhitichthys is a genus of hawkfishes found on tropical reefs in the Indian and western Pacific oceans . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'parent taxon' with 'cirrhitidae'. The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided and perform a step-by-step assessment of the relationships between the taxa mentioned. 1. Hawkfishes are members of the family Cirrhitidae, which is associated with coral reefs in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions. 2. Cirrhitichthys is a genus of hawkfishes, so it belongs to the family Cirrhitidae. 3. In biological classification, the genus lies below the family and above the species. 4. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name is the first part of the species name, followed by the specific species name. Based on this information, the entity that has the relation 'parent taxon' with 'Cirrhitidae' is the order Perciformes. This is because the first information presented said that hawkfishes are strictly tropical, perciform marine fishes belonging to the family Cirrhitidae. So, the 'parent taxon' of Cirrhitidae, as family, should be its corresponding order, which is Perciformes."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

PUBLISHED:. 11:45 EST, 13 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 11:47 EST, 13 September 2013. Karen Welsh, pictured, was strangled in her home by paranoid schizophrenic John Constantine. A damning investigation into the killing of a nurse by a paranoid schizophrenic has revealed a series of blunders by the NHS, police and probation service. Karen Welsh, 52, was strangled at home by John Constantine, 33, who had been discharged from a psychiatric hospital. Constantine beat Mrs Welsh and cut her wrists in March 2010 – while he had already breached the conditions of a suspended prison sentence. Mrs Welsh, a nurse, had let Constantine, stay in her Cardiff home as he was homeless after being let out. At the time he was only receiving treatment for depression. But a report into her death by Healthcare Inspectorate Wales has said that he was misdiagnosed by doctors, and should also have been arrested by police years earlier. It said that his hospital treatment was ‘inadequate’, and that he was only properly diagnosed as a ‘floridly psychotic’ paranoid schizophrenic after killing Mrs Welsh. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, which initially assessed Constantine, was criticised for underestimating the risks he posed. The report said: ‘Had there been a more assertive and less fragmented attempt to gain a better understanding of the risks that he posed, it is possible the killing may have been preventable.’ It also revealed that police and probation officers repeatedly failed to arrest Constantine - who breached the conditions of his suspended sentence for a hammer attack, burglary and car theft in 2008. Karen Welsh, pictured right with her daughter Joanne, left, might not have died if police and doctors had acted properly, a report said. It said: ‘On more than one occasion opportunities were missed to apprehend him and bring him back under the supervision of the probation service or the courts.’ Her daughter Joanne Welsh described her heartbreak on finding out that her mother’s death was preventable. She said: ‘It is extremely upsetting to hear the conclusions. ‘My mother could still be alive had it not been for misdiagnosis, failures in communication between the relevant agencies and a lack of mental health awareness. ‘These failings meant that a very dangerous and unwell man was let down and allowed to commit such a devastating crime.’ When Constantine was tried in court for Mrs Welsh’s murder, it emerged that he was a paranoid schizophrenic who had been fit and well until suffering a mental breakdown in 2008. He denied murder but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility and was sent indefinitely to a maximum security hospital. The court heard that he had changed his name from Kevin Astley to John Constantine after a Keanu Reeves character. Reeves played the occult detective in Constantine, a 2005 occult thriller in which his character can talk to demons. Ruth Walker, head of nursing at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: ‘It is clear that communication between statutory agencies fell short of expectation. ‘Both patients were let down by that failure, with tragic consequences.’ Dr Ruth Hussey, chief medical officer for Wales, said: ‘In this complex case, there were several key findings of concern. ‘The Welsh Government expects the local health board involved to work with other partners to take the appropriate actions and learn from this tragic case. ‘On behalf of the NHS in Wales, I would like to apologise sincerely to everyone affected by this tragedy.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"So, this story is about a sad event that happened to a lady named Karen Welsh. She was a nurse who let a man named John Constantine stay in her home because he didn't have a place to live. John had some problems with his mind, and the doctors didn't understand how bad his problems were. They thought he was just very sad, but he actually had a more serious condition called paranoid schizophrenia. Unfortunately, John hurt Karen very badly, and she passed away. After this happened, people looked into what went wrong and found out that the hospital, police, and probation service made mistakes in taking care of John. They should have known that he had a very serious mental problem and needed help, but they didn't. Karen's daughter is very sad because she found out that if the people taking care of John had done a better job, her mother might still be alive. Now the people in charge are saying sorry and they want to learn from this mistake so it doesn't happen again."},{"instruction":"An archaeological party explore some caverns underground .

The author starts by expressing a positive opinion about the movie \\"Gran Torino\\" by saying that it was good.

The surprise element comes into play when the author mentions that, for a moment, they thought Clint Eastwood's character might be from Landskrona because of his portrayal of bitterness on-screen.

Here's the breakdown of his earnings: 1. Phones: - Last Monday, Gondor repaired 3 phones. Since he earns 10 per phone, he made 3 * 10 = 30 on Monday. - Last Tuesday, he repaired 5 phones. So, he made 5 * 10 = 50 on Tuesday. 2. Laptops: - Last Wednesday, Gondor repaired 2 laptops. He earns 20 per laptop, so he made 2 * 20 = 40 on Wednesday. - Last Thursday, he repaired 4 laptops. He made 4 * 20 = 80 on Thursday. Now, we can find the total amount of Gondor's earnings by adding his earnings from each day: Total earnings = Monday earnings + Tuesday earnings + Wednesday earnings + Thursday earnings Total earnings = 30 + 50 + 40 + 80 Total earnings = 200 So, Gondor earned a total of 200 from repairing phones and laptops last week."},{"instruction":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . pick from the following.

In the last century, the great critics of corrupt political language were British authors who wrote dystopian novels. In \\"1984,\\" Orwell described a totalitarian society in which meaningless political language, dubbed Newspeak, veiled horrible truths. Earlier, In \\"Brave New World,\\" Aldous Huxley described toddlers conditioned in laboratories to be afraid of books. And in \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" Anthony Burgess imagined a world in which ultraviolent teens rampaged in a distinctive English-Russian patois that defined their alienation from society and authority. Now in the 21st century, there is Colbert's \\"truthiness\\" -- political half-truths, quarter-truths and what the website Politifact describes as \\"Pants-on-Fire\\" prevarications. On his Comedy Central show, \\"The Colbert Report,\\" he introduced \\"The Word,\\" a regular deconstruction of language contortion designed, in Orwell's notion, to defend the indefensible. (One example: \\"A Perfect World,\\" as in, journalists should demand to investigate torture, but it's not a perfect world.) It's sharp political humor and a canny critique of American culture, language and iconography. And it's helped the comic emerge as this nation's court jester, licensed by the youthful cable TV audience to speak truth to power. Such is Colbert's power and influence that he has been invited to testify before Congress today on the issue of illegal immigration -- and to testify in character. It's as if the Congress of the Eisenhower years invited Harpo Marx to offer testimony by beeping his bicycle horn. Colbert has long been on to something important about the nature of our political discourse at the beginning of a new postmodern millennium: that ideology has become the lens through which Americans found their particular truth, let the evidence be damned.

Instead of going to your local supermarket, consider shopping at a health store for cosmetics. You may be able to find an all-natural cosmetic store in your area.","output":"Choosing chemical-free cosmetics is an essential step in ensuring that the products you use on your skin are safe and gentle. Here is a detailed breakdown of how to select the best natural cosmetics: 1. Educate yourself about harmful chemicals: Before shopping for cosmetics, it is crucial to familiarize yourself with the harmful chemicals commonly found in these products. Do some research on the ingredients to avoid in cosmetics such as parabens, phthalates, sulfates, synthetic fragrances, and artificial colors. 2. Look for certifications: When purchasing natural cosmetics, it is essential to look for recognizable certifications like USDA Organic, Certified Natural, or EcoCert. These certifications help ensure that the products have undergone rigorous testing and meet strict criteria for natural or organic ingredients. 3. Read product labels carefully: Always read the labels of cosmetic products to understand the ingredients used. Make sure that the majority of the ingredients in the product are natural, and avoid any products containing known harmful chemicals. Remember that \\"natural\\" and \\"organic\\" are not interchangeable terms, so make sure to read carefully. 4. Opt for fragrance-free products: If possible, choose cosmetics that are fragrance-free or use natural fragrances like essential oils instead of synthetic options. Synthetic fragrances can cause skin irritation and allergies, while natural alternatives are typically gentler on the skin. 5. Prioritize eco-friendly packaging: Another aspect to consider when choosing chemical-free cosmetics is the packaging. Look for brands that are committed to sustainable packaging, such as using recycled materials, biodegradable packaging, or refillable containers. This can help reduce the environmental impact of your beauty routine. 6. Do a patch test: When deciding to switch to a new brand or product, it is essential to conduct a patch test by applying a small amount of the product to your inner arm or behind your ear to observe any adverse reactions or sensitivities before using it on your face or the intended area. 7. Research the brand and their practices: Aside from reading labels, it is important to research the brand's values, ethics, and sustainability practices. Look for brands that are transparent about their ingredient sourcing, manufacturing processes, and environmental impact. Often, companies that prioritize natural and eco-friendly practices will provide this information on their website or product packaging. 8. Consult with a dermatologist or skin care professional: If you have specific skin concerns or are unsure about which natural cosmetics are right for your skin type, consult with a dermatologist or skin care professional. They can recommend natural products that are suitable for your skin and help address any unique concerns you might have. 9. Read online reviews: Before purchasing a natural cosmetic product, take the time to read online reviews from verified users who have tried the product you are considering. This can give you an idea of how well the product works, and if other users experienced any common issues or side effects. In conclusion, selecting chemical-free cosmetics involves doing your research, reading labels, prioritizing brands with sustainable practices, and being vigilant about the ingredients and certifications of the products you are considering. By following these steps, you can ensure that your cosmetic choices are not only gentle on your skin but also environmentally responsible and supportive of brands that prioritize health and sustainability."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

I was the only person in the five-state area in which the silver burglar was hitting who got him on fingerprint evidence. He never left fingerprint evidence . . . except when he did. Every other police agency quit looking, because his MO was unmistakable. We didn't. A detective got prints from a bamboo tree he had used to climb in a window, and I got several prints from items he had handled inside the house. After the trial he was being led back to the jail and I was walking down the hall. He stopped and said, “I want to talk to that lady.” The bailiff told him he couldn't talk to the witness, but I said I wanted to hear what he had to say. He said, “Lady, you're the smartest cop I ever saw, and I hope to God I never see you again.” I think that was the best compliment I ever got. I have other accomplishments.

The answer is:","output":"Portia Nelson was an American singer-songwriter, actress, and author who made significant contributions to the world of entertainment and literature. Born as Betty Mae Nelson on May 27, 1920, she hailed from the quiet town of Brigham City, Utah. Over her lifetime, Portia Nelson built a reputation that went beyond the confines of her small-town roots, becoming a prominent figure in the 20th-century American entertainment industry and leaving a lasting legacy. As a young woman, Nelson continued honing her talents and found her love for music and acting during her early years. Determined to pursue a career in the entertainment industry, she made her way to New York City, a place that was (and still is) famous for providing countless artists with the opportunity to showcase their gifts and make their mark in the world of showbiz. Little did she know that her journey would lead to her becoming a respected and well-known figure in the entertainment world. Portia Nelson's career kicked off in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as she appeared in various Broadway productions, including \\"The Golden Apple,\\" \\"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,\\" and \\"Sally.\\" However, her big break came when she was cast in the original Broadway production of \\"The Sound of Music\\" in 1957, in which she portrayed Sister Berthe. Nelson's captivating performance made her a household name, and her talents shone on stage as well as on screen. Throughout her career, Nelson made several appearances in films and television shows, such as \\"The Trouble with Angels,\\" \\"The Mike Douglas Show,\\" and \\"Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!\\" Among these, one of her most memorable performances was in the film \\"The Trouble with Angels,\\" in which she played the sassy and witty Sister Leonic.

The quiet location would have a significant effect on the bat's perception of sound waves, making their echolocation more accurate and precise. When the environment is quiet, there is minimal interference from other sounds, which allows the bat to detect the subtleties of the returning sound waves more effectively. Consequently, the bat would be able to obtain more accurate information about the size, shape, and position of objects in its surroundings, thereby increasing its chances of successfully hunting for prey and avoiding obstacles. In a noisy environment, bats face the challenge of interference from various competing sounds or noises in the surroundings. These could be generated by other animals or human activities, among other factors. These additional sounds make it difficult for the bat to recognize the returning sound waves generated by its own high-pitched tones with the same level of accuracy and precision, as they get masked or interfered with by the external noises. As a result, bats may require more energy and time to compensate for this challenge and rely more on their other senses as well to accurately navigate their environment. To sum up, a quiet location would lead to less interference and better perception of sound waves for a bat using echolocation, resulting in more accurate and effective navigation of its surroundings. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Less."},{"instruction":"Q: Jordan lost their hair. It was a genetic disorder. Given the context: How would you describe Jordan?

School is easy for me besides chemistry and gym class. I've never been good at memorizing the","output":"periodic table or mastering the different chemical reactions, and gym class has always been a challenge for me due to my lack of physical prowess. However, I've always managed to persevere and get through these difficult subjects. One reason chemistry has been a struggle for me is because it requires an immense amount of memorization. The periodic table alone has 118 elements, each with its own unique symbol, atomic number, and atomic mass. Besides remembering these basic properties, comprehending the various trends and patterns among the elements can be quite difficult. Additionally, understanding the different electron configurations, valence electrons, and how these factors influence chemical reactivity is essential when studying chemistry. Another difficult aspect of chemistry for me is the sheer amount of different reactions and mechanisms I need to be familiar with. From simple acid-base reactions to intricate organic synthesis, each reaction has its own set of rules and conditions. Balancing chemical equations and predicting the products of a reaction requires a deep understanding of stoichiometry, which I have often found confusing. When it comes to gym class, it's not only the various activities that pose a challenge for me but also the stress that comes with it. I've never been athletically gifted or particularly coordinated, which makes participating in certain sports like basketball, volleyball, or even track and field a daunting task. Moreover, the pressure to perform well in front of my classmates can be overwhelming for someone without a natural affinity for physical activities. In addition to the embarrassment I occasionally experience, gym class can be physically demanding as well. Endurance exercises such as running can be especially challenging for me, given that I'm not used to pushing my body to its limits. The physical discomfort that often accompanies these intense activities can further exacerbate my feelings of inadequacy, as I struggle to keep up with my more physically capable peers. Despite the various challenges I face in chemistry and gym class, I've always been a determined individual who seeks to overcome my weaknesses. For chemistry, I've tried numerous techniques such as using mnemonic devices and creating flashcards to help remember the myriad facts and concepts. Additionally, I constantly seek help from my teachers and classmates, as well as participate in study groups to ensure I have a strong understanding of the material. As for gym class, I've learned that although I may never be the star athlete, I can still work hard to improve my abilities. By setting realistic goals and taking small steps to build up my physical strength and endurance, I've gradually been able to increase my performance in various activities. Most importantly, I've learned to accept that it's okay not to be perfect at everything and that with dedication and persistence, I can still achieve success in areas where I initially struggled. In conclusion, chemistry and gym class have certainly presented their fair share of challenges for me throughout my school experience. However, by adopting various strategies and maintaining a growth mindset, I've been able to push through these difficulties and grow as both a student and an individual. As I continue to face challenges in these difficult subjects and others, I'm confident that my perseverance and determination will help me achieve my goals and ultimately find success in my academic journey."},{"instruction":"In morning trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 8.76, or 0.1 percent, at 9,310.20, having gained 201 points Monday.

Your job is to determine which sentence(s) from the passage can be used to search for further information needed to answer the question. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many years passed between the end of Roosevelt's Presidency and the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty? Passage:The Allied occupation of Japan at the end of World War II was led by General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, with support from the British Commonwealth. Unlike in the occupation of Germany, the Soviet Union was allowed little to no influence over Japan. This foreign presence marks the only time in Japan's history that it has been occupied by a foreign power. At MacArthur's insistence, Emperor Hirohito remained on the imperial throne. The wartime cabinet was replaced with a cabinet acceptable to the Allies and committed to implementing the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, which among other things called for the country to become a parliamentary democracy. Under MacArthur's guidance, the Japanese government introduced sweeping social reforms and implemented economic reforms that recalled American \\"New Deal\\" priorities of the 1930s under President Roosevelt. The Japanese constitution was comprehensively overhauled and the Emperor's theoretically-vast powers, which for many centuries had been constrained by conventions that had evolved over time, became strictly limited by law. The occupation, codenamed Operation Blacklist, was ended by the San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed on September 8, 1951, and effective from April 28, 1952, after which Japan's sovereigntywith the exception, until 1972, of the Ryukyu Islands was fully restored. Student:","output":"To answer the question about the number of years passed between the end of Roosevelt's Presidency and the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, we can refer to the following sentences from the passage: 1. \\"Under MacArthur's guidance, the Japanese government introduced sweeping social reforms and implemented economic reforms that recalled American \\"New Deal\\" priorities of the 1930s under President Roosevelt.\\" This sentence gives us information about President Roosevelt's term during the 1930s. Specifically, his term ended in 1945. 2. \\"The occupation, codenamed Operation Blacklist, was ended by the San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed on September 8, 1951, and effective from April 28, 1952, after which Japan's sovereignty with the exception, until 1972, of the Ryukyu Islands was fully restored.\\" This sentence provides information on the signing date of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which is September 8, 1951. Now we can calculate the number of years passed between the end of Roosevelt's Presidency in 1945 and the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1951: 1951 - 1945 = 6 years Therefore, 6 years passed between the end of Roosevelt's Presidency and the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty."},{"instruction":"What would be an example of an negative review?","output":"Title: A Massive Disappointment at \\"The Fancy Diner\\" Rating: 1 out of 5 stars Review: After hearing countless raving reviews about “The Fancy Diner,” my expectations were sky-high as I walked through the restaurant’s ornate front doors. However, upon experiencing the dining establishment for myself, I couldn't be more disappointed. From the lackluster service to the mediocre food quality, \\"The Fancy Diner\\" does not deserve the reputation it has managed to muster. Upon arrival, we were greeted by an indifferent host who seemed to care more about updating his social media than warmly welcoming the guests. As we patiently waited 25 minutes for our reserved table, it appeared that the staff did little to prioritize the order of arrival. This lack of common courtesy was further exacerbated by the absence of an adequate waiting area, forcing us to stand in a cramped space by the restaurant's entrance. Once seated, we couldn't help but notice the poorly laid-out dining area. Tables were placed in uncomfortably close proximity to one another, barely providing enough space for the servers to navigate. This resulted in an overall unpleasant atmosphere with the constant sound of clattering plates and patrons struggling to maintain private conversations. Our server, unfortunately, continued the trend of poor customer service. It took her 20 minutes to acknowledge our presence at the table. Throughout the evening, she rarely checked on our table, filled our water glasses, or even cracked a smile. Her lack of enthusiasm left us feeling disheartened and craving a sense of appreciation. As for the food itself, the dishes that had been highly praised by others left us greatly underwhelmed. We started with the calamari appetizer, which, while not terrible, was woefully bland and slightly rubbery. The main courses unfortunately weren't much better. My halibut was overcooked, resulting in a tough texture that made it a struggle to finish. My partner's filet mignon was ordered medium-rare but arrived well-done, a mishandling that tainted the overall gastronomical experience. To conclude the disappointing meal, we decided to try the cheesecake dessert in hopes of salvaging some level of satisfaction from the dinner. Sadly, even the once-famous cheesecake failed to deliver. The crust was hard while the filling seemed stale as if it had been sitting in the fridge for days. In a nutshell, \\"The Fancy Diner\\" was a massive disappointment. Its staff delivered inattentive service, the ambiance of the dining space was far from relaxing, and the food left much to be desired, a stark contrast to the glowing recommendations we had received. It would be challenging for anyone to justify paying their premium prices for a dining experience that severely lacks quality. Unless the restaurant makes considerable changes to improve its offerings and service, I cannot recommend \\"The Fancy Diner\\" to friends or family and will not return for another visit."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to German: In congratulating my Slovak fellow Members on this success, I would also like - as a Polish MEP - to express the hope that my country will soon be joining them.","output":"Herzlichen Glückwunsch an meine slowakischen Kollegen zu diesem Erfolg.

Answer the above question based on the context below: As a composer Holst was frequently inspired by literature. He set poetry by Thomas Hardy and Robert Bridges and, a particular influence, Walt Whitman, whose words he set in \\"Dirge for Two Veterans\\" and The Mystic Trumpeter (1904). He wrote an orchestral Walt Whitman Overture in 1899. While on tour with the Carl Rosa company Holst had read some of Max Müller's books, which inspired in him a keen interest in Sanskrit texts, particularly the Rig Veda hymns. He found the existing English versions of the texts unconvincing, and decided to make his own translations, despite his lack of skills as a linguist. He enrolled in 1909 at University College, London, to study the language.Imogen commented on his translations: \\"He was not a poet, and there are occasions when his verses seem naïve. But they never sound vague or slovenly, for he had set himself the task of finding words that would be 'clear and dignified' and that would 'lead the listener into another world'\\". His settings of translations of Sanskrit texts included Sita (1899–1906), a three-act opera based on an episode in the Ramayana (which he eventually entered for a competition for English opera set by the Milan music publisher Tito Ricordi); Savitri (1908), a chamber opera based on a tale from the Mahabharata; four groups of Hymns from the Rig Veda (1908–14); and two texts originally by Kālidāsa: Two Eastern Pictures (1909–10) and The Cloud Messenger (1913).Towards the end of the nineteenth century, British musical circles had experienced a new interest in national folk music. Some composers, such as Sullivan and Elgar, remained indifferent, but Parry, Stanford, Stainer and Alexander Mackenzie were founding members of the Folk-Song Society. Parry considered that by recovering English folk song, English composers would find an authentic national voice; he commented, \\"in true folk-songs there is no sham, no got-up glitter, and no vulgarity\\". Vaughan Williams was an early and enthusiastic convert to this cause, going round the English countryside collecting... A:","output":"Based on the context provided, the opera Sita (1899-1906) by Holst, based on an episode in the Ramayana, was performed at Queen's Hall in 1910.

John Aloysius Fahey (February 28, 1939 - February 22, 2001) was an American fingerstyle guitarist and composer who played the steel-string acoustic guitar as a solo instrument. His style has been greatly influential and has been described as the foundation of American Primitive Guitar, a term borrowed from painting and referring mainly to the self-taught nature of the music and its minimalist style. Fahey borrowed from the folk and blues traditions in American roots music, having compiled many forgotten early recordings in these genres. He would later incorporate classical, Portuguese, Brazilian, and Indian music into his oeuvre. While Fahey lived in Berkeley, Takoma Records was reborn. Fahey decided to track down blues legend Bukka White by sending a postcard to Aberdeen, Mississippi (White had sung that Aberdeen was his hometown, and Mississippi John Hurt had been rediscovered using a similar method). When White responded, Fahey and ED Denson, a friend from the Washington, D.C., area, who had also moved west, decided to travel to Memphis and record White. The recordings by White became the first non-Fahey Takoma release. Fahey also released a second album in late 1963, called Death Chants, Breakdowns and Military Waltzes. To their surprise the Fahey release sold better than White's and Fahey had a career going. His releases during the mid-1960s employed odd guitar tunings and sudden style shifts rooted firmly in the old-time and blues stylings of the 1920s. But he was not simply a copyist, as compositions such as \\"When the Catfish Is in Bloom\\" or \\"Stomping Tonight on the Pennsylvania/Alabama Border\\" demonstrate. Fahey described the latter piece as follows: \\"The opening chords are from the last movement of Vaughan Williams' Sixth Symphony. It goes from there to a Skip James motif. Following that it moves to a Gregorian chant, \\"Dies Irae\\". It's the most scary one in the Episcopal hymn books, it's all about the day of judgment. Then it returns to the Vaughan Williams chords, followed by a blues run of undetermined origin, then back to Skip James and so forth.\\" A hallmark of his classic releases was the inclusion of lengthy liner notes, parodying those found on blues releases. In the later half of the sixties, Fahey continued to issue material through Takoma as well as Vanguard Records, which had signed him along with similar instrumental folk guitarists Sandy Bull and Peter Walker. Albums from this period, such as Days Have Gone By, The Voice of the Turtle, Requia, and The Yellow Princess, found Fahey making sound collages from such elements as Gamelan music, Tibetan chanting, animal and bird cries and singing bridges. In 1967, Fahey recorded with Texas psych-rock trio The Red Crayola at the 1967 Berkeley Folk Festival, music that resurfaced on the 1998 Drag City release The Red Krayola: Live 1967. The Red Crayola subsequently recorded an entire studio album with Fahey, but the Red Crayola's label demanded possession of the tapes and recorded documentation of those sessions has been missing ever since. In addition to his own creative output, Fahey expanded the Takoma label, discovering fellow guitarists Leo Kottke, Robbie Basho, Bola Sete and Peter Lang, as well as emerging pianist George Winston. Kottke's debut release on the label, 6- and 12-String Guitar, ultimately proved to be the most successful of the crop, selling more than 500,000 copies. Other artists with albums on the label included Mike Bloomfield, Rick Ruskin, Rabindra Danks, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Maria Muldaur, Michael Gulezian, and Canned Heat. In 1979, Fahey sold Takoma to Chrysalis Records. Jon Monday, who had been the general manager of the label since 1970, was the only employee to go with the new company. Chrysalis eventually sold the rights to the albums, and Takoma was in limbo until bought by Fantasy Records in 1995.

Lithification is the process of turning loose sediment into solid sedimentary rocks through compaction, cementation, and/or recrystallization. After minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve, the following processes take place to form sedimentary rocks: 1. Compaction: As more layers of sediment accumulate on top of the existing layers, the weight of the overlying material creates pressure, causing the lower layers to be compressed. This process reduces the spaces (pores) between the sediment grains, forcing them to pack more closely together, and ultimately results in a more compact and denser sediment layer. 2. Cementation: Dissolved minerals in the groundwater, often including silica, calcium carbonate, or iron oxides, start to precipitate as the water moves through the sediment. These minerals fill up the spaces between the sediment grains and then harden, acting like a glue or cement, and binding the sediment grains together. This process is known as cementation, and it plays a critical role in transforming loose sediment into a coherent, solid rock. 3. Recrystallization: In some cases, the minerals within the sediment can undergo chemical or physical changes. This can lead to recrystallization, where the minerals grow and interlock with each other, further strengthening the rock and contributing to its final consolidation. Upon completion of these processes, the loose sediment is now transformed into a solid, cohesive sedimentary rock. These rocks can be classified into three main types based on their composition and mode of formation: a) Clastic Sedimentary Rocks: Formed from clastic sediments (broken fragments of rock) that have been transported and deposited by wind, water, or ice, such as sandstone, shale, and conglomerate. b) Chemical Sedimentary Rocks: Formed from the precipitation of minerals from water, such as rock salt, gypsum, and limestone. c) Organic Sedimentary Rocks: Formed from the accumulation of plant and animal remains, such as coal and some types of limestone. Sedimentary rocks play a significant role in understanding Earth's history, as they often contain fossils, provide valuable information about past depositional environments, and serve as important reservoirs for natural resources like water, oil, and gas."},{"instruction":"Q:The night when she thought she would finally be a star, Maria Isabella du'l Cielo struggled to calm the trembling of her hands, reached over to cut the tether that tied her to the ground, and thought of that morning many years before when she'd first caught a glimpse of Lorenzo du Vicenzio ei Salvadore: tall, thick-browed and handsome, his eyes closed, oblivious to the cacophony of the accident waiting to occur around him.

Robert F. McDonnell and his sister last year, and the governor did not disclose the money as a gift or loan, according to people with knowledge of the payments. The donor, wealthy businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr., also gave a previously unknown 50,000 check to the governor’s wife, Maureen, in 2011, the people said. The money to the corporation and Maureen McDonnell brings to 145,000 the amount Williams gave to assist the McDonnell family in 2011 and 2012 — funds that are now at the center of federal and state investigations. Williams, the chief executive of dietary supplement manufacturer Star Scientific Inc., also provided a 10,000 check in December as a present to McDonnell’s eldest daughter, Jeanine, intended to help defray costs at her May 2013 wedding, the people said. Virginia’s first family already is under intense scrutiny for accepting 15,000 from the same chief executive to pay for the catering at the June 2011 wedding of Cailin McDonnell at the Executive Mansion. View Graphic Timeline: Star Scientific and Gov. McDonnell All the payments came as McDonnell and his wife took steps to promote the donor’s company and its products. The payments to the corporation, confirmed by people familiar with the transactions, offer the first public example of money provided by Williams that would directly benefit the governor and not just his family. The money went from a trust, controlled by Williams, to MoBo Real Estate Partners, a limited-liability corporation formed in 2005 by McDonnell and his sister, the sources said. McDonnell viewed the payments to MoBo and to his wife as loans and not gifts, according to three people familiar with the transactions. State law requires elected officials to disclose their personal loans but not loans made to their corporate interests. Tucker Martin, a spokesman for the governor, declined to comment on the payments other than to say that McDonnell has been diligent in filling out legally mandated disclosures. “The rules that I’m following have been rules that have been in place for decades,” McDonnell said Tuesday on a Norfolk radio show. “These have been the disclosure rules of Virginia. I’m following those. To, after the fact, impose some new requirements on an official when you haven’t kept record of other gifts given to family members or things like that obviously wouldn’t be fair.” State law requires the disclosure of any gift valued at more than 50, but gifts to family members are exempt. Jerry Kilgore, an attorney for Williams, declined to comment on the payments. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney investigating the payments also declined to comment. On state-mandated disclosure forms, McDonnell indicated that a member of his immediate family owed money to an unnamed individual creditor in 2011 and 2012. In one year, he described the creditor as someone in “medical services.” In the other year, the governor said the creditor was in “health care.” Star Scientific makes nutritional supplements. The form did not specify the exact amount owed; the governor checked a box saying it was between 10,001 and 50,000. The people familiar with the payments, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of state and federal investigations of the governor, differed on whether any kind of payment plan had been established to reimburse Williams. They agreed that none of the money to the corporation or Maureen McDonnell has been repaid. Revelations of the additional payments came as a federal grand jury was scheduled to hear testimony in the case this week. Separately, state prosecutors in Richmond are looking into whether the governor has complied with all disclosure laws. McDonnell has said that Star Scientific received no special benefits from his administration and that any actions he or his wife took to boost the company were standard for any administration promoting state-based enterprises. The 145,000 in payments from Williams came in addition to other undisclosed gifts that Williams gave to the governor’s family, including 15,000 in luxury clothing he bought for Maureen McDonnell and a 6,500 Rolex watch she asked him to purchase so she could give it to her husband. McDonnell has disclosed receiving 9,650 in gifts from Williams, including private plane trips and the use of a summer lake-house vacation. Wedding catering Williams’s first payment to the McDonnell family came in a 50,000 check made out to Maureen McDonnell from his trust on May 23, 2011, the people familiar with the transactions said. That was the same day Williams wrote a separate check for the catering at Cailin McDonnell’s wedding. Then, in March 2012, Williams wrote a 50,000 check from his trust to MoBo, which was followed by an additional 20,000 payment to the corporation that spring, the people said. In annual financial-disclosure forms, McDonnell has indicated that he owns a stake in MoBo, which he reported was associated with two Virginia Beach rental properties he purchased in 2005 and 2006 with his wife and his sister, who is also named Maureen. The name of MoBo, formed in 2005, apparently comes from the combination of the names “Maureen” and “Bob” and is the entity that makes mortgage payments on the homes and pays for the properties’ renovations and upkeep. Virginia law allows elected officials to accept gifts of any size, including money, provided they annually disclose those worth at least 50. The law does not require the disclosure of gifts given to members of an elected official’s immediate family, nor gifts provided by relatives or “personal friends.” McDonnell has said he considers Williams, whom he met shortly before his 2009 campaign for governor, to be a “family friend.” He has said the catering at the 2011 wedding was a gift to his daughter and did not need to be disclosed. State law requires officials to disclose loans made to them and members of their immediate family. But it does not require elected officials to spell out their business liabilities. One person familiar with MoBo’s finances indicated that corporate records show the governor and his sister agreed to a low-interest loan with Williams. Terms of the loan dictated that they would make no payments for three years but return the 70,000 by 2015. That person indicated that MoBo had trouble keeping up with expenses after the collapse of the real estate market and had accepted three previous loans, two from McDonnell’s family in 2007 and 2008 and another from a family friend in 2010. He indicated that the loan to the family friend has been satisfied and the loans from the family member have been partially repaid. The payments came as Maureen McDonnell told friends that the first couple was facing financial stress, two people said, in part because of difficulty renting the beach houses. The governor, his wife and sister purchased one of the homes for 1.15 million in 2005 and the other for 850,000 in 2006. According to assessments, the beach properties have declined in value since the McDonnells purchased them during a red-hot real estate market. In his annual financial disclosures, the governor has also indicated an ownership stake in another rental property: at the Wintergreen mountain resort in central Virginia, purchased for 1 million in 2007. Also, the first couple bought a 835,000 house in the Richmond suburbs in 2006, where they were living until they moved to the state’s 200-year-old Executive Mansion when McDonnell became governor in 2010. Consulting payment alleged As governor, McDonnell is paid 175,000 a year. His wife is not paid by the state for her volunteer work as first lady. However, the chief executive of a coal company recently said he paid her 36,000 last year to attend two or three meetings and act as a consultant to his company and family’s charitable efforts. The governor has said Star Scientific received no government contracts, economic incentives or grants. However, the company was allowed to use the governor’s mansion to hold a luncheon to mark the launch of a new product in August 2011. A few weeks before, Maureen McDonnell arranged and attended a meeting between Williams and a top state official during which the executive presented new research about the potential health benefits of the supplement, Anatabloc, and proposed that Virginia consider examining whether its use could reduce health-care costs in the state. And Virginia Secretary of Health Bill Hazel said for the first time last week that he also met one-on-one with Williams in 2010 so the chief executive could pitch Star Scientific. Hazel said the meeting came at the urging of someone in the governor’s or first lady’s office, but he could not remember which. He said such meetings are not unusual. He concluded that Williams’s product was “not ready for prime time” and said he was confident that Williams received no benefit from the meeting.

Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include particularly fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right. - Triticale ( × Triticosecale ) , / trtkeli / is a hybrid of wheat ( Triticum ) and rye ( Secale ) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century in Scotland and Sweden . Commercially available triticale is almost always a second - generation hybrid , i.e. , a cross between two kinds of primary ( first - cross ) triticales . As a rule , triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance ( including soil conditions ) of rye . Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop . Depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents . It is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale - based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals . When crossing wheat and rye , wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent ( pollen donor ) . The resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself . The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia . In 2009 , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world . The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid , which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species . In other words , triticale is an allotetraploid . In earlier years , most work was done on octoploid triticale . Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time . The tetraploids showed little promise , but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application . The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries . Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products , such as cookies , pasta , pizza dough and breakfast cereals . The protein content is... - A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals. - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - Hay is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut, dried, and stored for use as animal fodder, particularly for grazing animals such as cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. Hay is also fed to smaller animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. Pigs may be fed hay, but they do not digest it as efficiently as more fully herbivorous animals. - Rice is the seed of the grass species \\"Oryza sativa\\" (Asian rice) or \\"Oryza glaberrima\\" (African rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture. Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,20013,500 years ago in the Pearl River valley region of Ancient China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China. - Silage is fermented, high-moisture stored fodder which can be fed to cattle, sheep and other such ruminants (cud-chewing animals) or used as a biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digesters. It is fermented and stored in a process called \\"ensilage\\", \\"ensiling\\" or \\"silaging\\", and is usually made from grass crops, including maize, sorghum or other cereals, using the entire green plant (not just the grain). Silage can be made from many field crops, and special terms may be used depending on type (\\"oatlage\\" for oats, \\"haylage\\" for alfalfa but see below for the different British use of the term \\"haylage\\"). - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Rye (\\"Secale cereale\\") is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop. It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) and is closely related to barley (genus \\"Hordeum\\") and wheat (\\"Triticum\\"). Rye grain is used for flour, rye bread, rye beer, crisp bread, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder. It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats. - Barley (\\"Hordeum vulgare\\" L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 13,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The tribe Triticeae within the subfamily Pooideae of grasses includes genera with many domesticated species. Major crop genera found in this tribe include wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye; crops in other genera include some for human consumption and others used for animal feed or rangeland protection. Among the world's cultivated species, this tribe has some of the most complex genetic histories. An example is bread wheat, which contains the genomes of three species, only one of them originally a wheat \\"Triticum\\" species. Seed storage proteins in the Triticeae are implicated in various food allergies and intolerances. - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals. - GRAIN (initially the International Coalition for Development Action or ICDA) is a small international non-profit organisation that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems. - The chicken (\\"Gallus gallus domesticus\\") is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs. - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. - Frankfurt am Main is a metropolis and the largest city in the German state of Hesse and the fifth-largest city in Germany, with a 2015 population of 731,095 within its administrative boundaries, and 2.3 million in its urban area. The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5.8 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr. Since the enlargement of the European Union in 2013, the geographic centre of the EU is about to the east of Frankfurt's CBD, the Bankenviertel. Frankfurt is culturally and ethnically diverse, with around half of the population, and a majority of young people, having a migration background. A quarter of the population are foreign nationals, including many expatriates. - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals. - Fodder, a type of animal feed, is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. \\"Fodder\\" refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder is also called provender and includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin. - There are two types of agricultural crop residues. Field residues are materials left in an agricultural field or orchard after the crop has been harvested. These residues include stalks and stubble (stems), leaves, and seed pods. The residue can be ploughed directly into the ground, or burned first. Good management of field residues can increase efficiency of irrigation and control of erosion. Process residues are materials left after the crop is processed into a usable resource. These residues include husks, seeds, bagasse, molasses and roots. They can be used as animal fodder and soil amendment, fertilizers and in manufacturing. - Stuttgart ( Swabian: \\"Schduagert\\"), often nicknamed the \\"\\"Schwabenmetropole\\"\\" in reference to its location in the center of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by some natives, is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley locally known as the \\"Stuttgarter Kessel\\" an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Stuttgart's name comes from the Old High German word \\"\\"Stuogarten\\",\\" or \\"stud farm\\" a reference to the city's founding in 950 AD as a stud farm. Stuttgarts urban area has a population of 623,738, and a further making it the sixth largest city in Germany, 2.7 million people live in the citys administrative region, and another 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\". - A farmer (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish). - Wheat (\\"Triticum\\" spp., most commonly \\"T. aestivum\\") is a cereal grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), originally from the Levant region but now cultivated worldwide. In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (1.03 billion tonnes), with more than rice (499 million tonnes). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st Century. - Animal feed is food given to domestic animals in the course of animal husbandry. There are two basic types, \\"fodder\\" and \\"forage\\". Used alone, the word \\"feed\\" more often refers to fodder. - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa. - Biodiversity, a contraction of \\"biological diversity,\\" generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future. What is the relationship between 'triticale' and 'pooideae'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Triticale (x Triticosecale) is a hybrid of wheat (Triticum) and rye (Secale), both of which belong to the tribe Triticeae within the subfamily Pooideae of grasses. So, the relationship between triticale and Pooideae is that triticale is a hybrid crop originating from two plant species within the Pooideae subfamily."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

What was All Negro Comics? The answer to this question is:","output":"All Negro Comics was a groundbreaking comic book series published in the United States that was specifically designed to feature black characters and represent African American culture. The series was created in 1947 by Orrin Cromwell Evans, an African American journalist and comic book writer. It was the first known comic book series that was solely produced by African Americans and aimed at the African American audience. This remarkable achievement was revolutionary for its time, as it broke from the cultural norms and racial stereotypes that were prevalent in the comic book industry in the 1940s. Orrin C. Evans was a pioneer in the world of comic books and is considered one of the key figures in the history of African American comic book creators. Born in 1902 in Pennsylvania, Evans was not only a journalist but also an activist who worked tirelessly for the advancement of the African American community. His experiences in journalism exposed him to the world of comics through his work at newspapers, where he became acutely aware of the biased and stereotypical depiction of African Americans present in most comics of that era. Determined to create a more positive representation of African Americans in the comic book world, Evans enlisted a team of other African American talent, including artists and writers, to bring All Negro Comics to life. Issue number 1 had a cover date of June 1947 and featured a variety of comic stories that were written and illustrated by African American creators. These comics showcased a range of genres, including adventure, humor, and crime, all of which starred black characters. Some notable characters that appeared in this single issue of All Negro Comics were: 1. Ace Harlem: A detective who fought against crime in Harlem, New York. 2. Lion Man: A college-educated African American superhero who fought evil and protected a hidden city of gold located in Africa. 3. Sugarfoot: A comical series featuring a lazy but lovable character who worked as a musician onboard a riverboat. 4. Little \\"Eggie\\" Egbert: A humorous depiction of a young boy, providing comic relief through his exploits. Unfortunately, like many other independent comic book publications during that era, All Negro Comics faced immense challenges in distribution and sales. Despite the initial enthusiasm and a plan for a second issue, the series was short-lived due to the various constraints caused by racial segregation, a lack of resources, and industry gatekeeping. After releasing only one issue, All Negro Comics ceased publication. Though it was short-lived, All Negro Comics remains an essential part of comic book history because of its significant role in challenging racial stereotypes and pushing for a more accurate representation of African Americans in the comic book industry. It paved the way for future African American comic book creators and inspired other minorities to create characters that represented their own perspectives and experiences. Today, All Negro Comics is considered not only a testament to the determination and creativity of African American artists and writers but also a valuable artifact that serves as a reminder of the importance of representation and diversity within the world of comic books."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

When we watch birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars . But how do we make a bird nest? A good bird nest must be very fine, strong, thick and comfortable. If you want to make one, please follow these: a) Each nest must have six boards for its cover and floor, for its left and right sides, and for its front and back sides. Don't make the boards too slippery . b) Dig a small hole in the front of the nest as a \\"door\\". The \\"door\\" is big enough so birds can fly in or out easily. c) Make sure the rainwater can't go into the nest. d) One piece of the board should be easy to open. e) Don't forget to colour the nest. Question: When we're watching birds, we have to _ . Options: A: look after the birds more often B: use the binoculars to catch the birds C: hide ourselves to make the birds do everything as usual D: catch the birds at last Answer:","output":"C: hide ourselves to make the birds do everything as usual"},{"instruction":"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jurors began deliberations Thursday in the Michael Jackson wrongful-death trial, potentially bringing the contentious case to a close after five months of testimony and three days of closing arguments. The 12 jurors spent two hours in the jury room Thursday afternoon before ending their day; they will return Friday morning for more deliberations. Katherine Jackson's lawyer delivered his final arguments in the AEG Live trial Thursday morning, delivering his rebuttal to defense closing arguments. AEG Live's Marvin Putnam had asked jurors to find Michael Jackson responsible for his death, not the company that promoted and produced his comeback concerts in 2009. \\"The sad truth is Mr. Jackson's death was caused by his choices and it would have happened no matter what -- with or without","output":"AEG Live,\\" Putnam said. \\"The evidence is overwhelming that he never would have agreed to the brief treatment urged by his family (and AEG Live), and everybody in this courtroom knows it.\\" Katherine Jackson's lawyer, Brian Panish, vehemently disagreed with Putnam's assertion. Panish claimed AEG Live played a significant role in Michael Jackson's death and should be held accountable. Panish reminded the jurors of the company's alleged negligence in hiring and supervising Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician responsible for administering the fatal dose of the powerful anesthetic propofol to Michael Jackson. \\"You don't think someone should accept responsibility, and that's the problem,\\" Panish said, addressing Putnam's argument. \\"This case is about shared responsibility, and AEG is trying to escape that.\\" Panish accused AEG Live of prioritizing money and profit over the well-being of Michael Jackson, putting pressure on the star which led to his eventual demise. Moreover, he argued that AEG failed to conduct a proper background check when hiring Dr. Murray, ignoring his financial troubles, and subsequently offering him a contract with a lucrative 150,000 salary. This large sum, Panish claimed, created a conflict of interest for Dr. Murray, incentivizing him to do whatever Michael Jackson asked to keep his job, including administering the lethal dose of propofol. The wrongful-death lawsuit was filed on behalf of Michael Jackson's mother and three children after the singer's death in 2009. The plaintiffs are seeking billions of dollars in damages from AEG Live, alleging that the company's negligence in hiring and supervising Dr. Conrad Murray contributed directly to Michael Jackson's death. The defense's closing arguments focused on shifting the responsibility of Jackson's death onto the singer himself, highlighting his addiction to prescription drugs. Putnam pointed out that Michael Jackson had a long history of drug abuse, and AEG Live had no way of knowing that Dr. Murray would act negligently and irresponsibly when the company hired him. The defense also argued that Katherine Jackson's claims that AEG Live failed to properly hire and supervise Dr. Murray were unfounded, as Michael Jackson insisted on Murray being his personal doctor, and AEG Live did not have the authority to overrule his wishes. As the jurors began their deliberations, the entire world watched anxiously, waiting for the verdict that would determine whether AEG Live would be considered partially or fully responsible for Michael Jackson's death. The outcome of the case would have far-reaching implications on not just the Jackson family, but also on the entertainment industry, by potentially setting a precedent for holding concert promoters and producers accountable for the well-being of the artists they work with. Regardless of the verdict, the Michael Jackson wrongful-death trial has brought attention to the darker side of the entertainment industry. It has illuminated how the pressures of fame, profit, and productivity can lead to tragic consequences, pushing those involved to their breaking points. This trial could serve as a cautionary tale for the industry, prompting a reevaluation of priorities, where artists' health and wellbeing are not sacrificed for profit and productivity."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

How to address a senator Use \\" the honorable \\" on the envelope. \\" the honorable \\" is a title typically given to elected officials. When writing to a senator, start with the title and then type the senator's first and last name.","output":"Addressing a senator is an important aspect of maintaining proper etiquette and showing respect to the individual holding this prestigious position. It is crucial to understand that addressing a senator is more than just knowing how to put their name on the envelope. It also includes how to address them in various situations such as in written correspondence, in person, or even during an introduction. First, let's discuss the correct way to address a senator in writing. 1. Letter Writing In written correspondence, utilizing \\"The Honorable\\" is definitely the appropriate way to address a senator. The complete format for a senator's address on the envelope should be: The Honorable [Full Name] United States Senate Office Address Inside the letter, the salutation should be: Dear Senator [Last Name]: This format should be used when writing any letter to a senator, whether it is a request for help, an invitation, or simply for expressing your opinion on a specific issue. 2. Email Correspondence For email correspondence, using the same formal address may not be necessary since emails are generally less formal. Instead, start the email with a professional greeting like: Dear Senator [Last Name], Remember to follow formal writing etiquette, keep a formal tone, and use professional language throughout the email. 3. In person When addressing a senator in person or introducing them to others, use the term \\"Senator\\" followed by their last name. For example, \\"It is a pleasure to meet you, Senator Smith.\\" When introducing a senator to someone else, you could say, \\"I would like to introduce you to Senator Smith.\\" However, if the senator is also a medical doctor or has another title, you should address them with the highest-ranking title they possess (Doctor, Professor, etc.). 4. Public Speaking Addressing a senator while giving a public speech should follow a formal approach: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Senator [Full Name] from [State].\\" This shows proper respect to the senator and the audience. In conclusion, it is essential to follow the proper etiquette when addressing a senator, whether in writing, in person, or during an introduction. By using the appropriate titles, you demonstrate respect for their position as this official represents the interests of their constituents in the United States Senate. Adhering to these guidelines will not only maintain civility, but also help establish a professional tone in your interactions with the senators."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following: \\" If the dog continues to behave aggressively, and ignoring or pacifying him is no longer working, face him and sternly command him to leave. Use a strong, deep, and confident commanding voice. Continue to avoid making eye contact. The dog may become discouraged or intimidated and leave. If the dog starts biting you, you've got to defend yourself. Hit or kick the dog in the throat, nose, and the back of the head. This will stun the dog and give you time to get away. It's okay to raise your voice at this point. Yell for help as you're fighting back. Hopefully others will hear and come to your aid. However, avoid screaming as this may lead the dog to strengthen his attack. If you have a stick or another weapon, you can (and should) use it to hit the dog. Don't hit him over the top of the head, though; most dogs have very thick skulls, so this will only serve to make the dog angrier. If available, mace or pepper spray also work as a good defense against an attacking dog. Fight as though your life depends on it, because it does. Dog attacks can be fatal. While you certainly don't want to hurt a dog unnecessarily, you should use force as necessary if you are being seriously attacked. Bring your entire body weight to bear on the animal, specifically pushing down with the hard points of your knees or elbows. Dogs are vicious biters but cannot wrestle, so try to get an advantageous position and break their bones fairly quickly. Get on top of the animal and concentrate force on areas such as the throat or ribs while minding to keep your face out of clawing/biting range. If you are looking for a more humane solution and can manage it, straddle the back of the dog with your partial body weight and apply forward pressure to the back of the neck to immobilize the dog until help comes. If you fall to the ground during the attack, not only is it more difficult to fight off the angry dog, but vital areas on your torso, head, and neck become more vulnerable to attack. These are the most important spots on your body to protect because bites in these places will inflict the most damage and will have the greatest chance of killing you. Protect your vitals by rolling onto your stomach, tucking your knees in, and bringing your hands (balled in fists) up to your ears. Resist the urge to scream or roll away, as these actions may further encourage the dog. Once the dog loses interest in you, leave the scene of the attack slowly by backing away without sudden movements.Staying calm and stationary can be a real test of your nerves in such a stressful situation, but it's the best thing to do as long as the dog isn't actually biting you. Summary:","output":"In the event of an aggressive dog that does not respond to pacification, face the dog and confidently command it to leave, avoiding eye contact. If the dog starts attacking, defend yourself by hitting or kicking its throat, nose, or the back of its head. Yell for help but avoid screaming, as it may encourage the dog to attack more aggressively.

Chinese netizens always have different opinions. Over South Korean TV dramas, but there is no doubt that programs from the neighboring country are now enjoying a new round of popularity in China, And a big part of the credit for that goes to You Who Came From The Star, the South Korean TV series which is on the air now. You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs have been subjects of hot online discussions throughout Asia. Besides, the book, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, read by the hero You Who Came From The Star was a hard-to-get item on Amazon for a while. The two TV programs have several common elements :a tall, handsome, and rich hero who loves the heroine blindly and always protects her, and an equally handsome man madly in love with the same woman. Both programs describe the purity of love, which is expressed through a kiss or a warm hug. Perhaps that's the secret of their success; perhaps people still like Cinderella-type stories. The widening wealth gap is a matter of social concern both in South Korea and China, and the challenges that young people face in their hope for a better life might have caused many ordinary girls to dream of marrying rich, caring men. This is precisely what the popular South Korean TV drams describe. _ Many netizens even said at an earlier time that South Korean TV dramas had become popular because of their stereotyped themes: traffic accidents, cancer and other incurable diseases.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: Well, to determine whether it is possible to predict the exact number of leaves on a large, mature oak tree just by looking at it, we would need to consider several factors such as the size of the tree, its age, and the density of leaves. First, let's think about the size of the tree. Large oak trees can have many branches that can potentially hold hundreds or even thousands of leaves, making it difficult to count them visually. Additionally, the leaves might be layered and overlapping, making it hard to see every single one just by looking at the tree from a distance. Now, let's consider the tree's age. A mature oak tree can live for hundreds of years and over the course of its life, it is constantly growing and changing. As a result, the number of leaves on the tree could vary from season to season, depending on factors such as weather and the tree's overall health. Without taking the time to conduct a careful study of the tree's growth and potential leaf production, we wouldn't be able to predict the exact number of leaves with any certainty. Finally, let's think about the density of leaves on the tree. Leaf density can be influenced by factors such as sunlight exposure and available nutrients. It is possible that some branches of the tree might have more leaves than others due to these factors. So, even if we could estimate the number of leaves on one branch, it would not necessarily mean that we could predict the total number of leaves on the entire tree. In conclusion, due to the numerous variables and the complex nature of a large, mature oak tree, it is not possible to tell the exact number of leaves just by looking at it."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: How many stories is the tower block? 200 The answer is:","output":"Title: \\"The 200th Story\\" Genre: Action/Thriller Plot: In a futuristic metropolis, a towering 200-story building known as \\"The Apex\\" stands as the pinnacle of human achievement.

One consumer group has called for banks to be fined over the complexity of charges. However, an inquiry has given the sector a relatively clean bill of health. Many banks are engaged in financial charm offensive with potential customers, offering upfront cash incentives with new accounts which are more generous than the annual interest paid on many savings accounts. Consumers appear to be giving them the cold-shoulder in return and sticking with \\"free\\" accounts. A switching rate of less than 2% last year was even lower than the previous 12 months. So why are customers unwilling to move their money and what is the benefit for the banks? How can customers understand and make the most of their banking services? Will new technology offer banking at better value for money? Ahead of the UK competition authority's final plan to fix frailties in the market, the BBC News website is examining the personal current account sector in a series of articles to be published over the next few days. 97% of UK adults hold one Less than 2% switched in 2015 £177: banks' annual revenue per customer £???: banks' cost per customer unknown There are 68 million current accounts which are active in the UK. They are being used by 97% of adults in the country - a bigger proportion, for example, than have a gas supply. Of these, three-quarters have a so-called \\"free-if-in-credit\\" account. Customers pay no monthly or annual fee, but they forgo a chunk of interest payments and may face a host of charges ranging from fees for going overdrawn to making purchases in foreign currency. Current accounts are \\"essential for modern life\\", according to John Ashton, professor of banking at Bangor University Business School, but the effect of this \\"free\\" model is that those with the lowest and highest amounts in accounts subsidise those in the middle. The poorest \\"bore the burden of overdraft costs\\". Middle income customers occasionally went into the red, but also tended to hold larger deposits in current accounts, for which they were missing out on interest payments they could have won elsewhere, he said. Overdraft fees have been overhauled by banks since this research - in which Prof Ashton analysed 17 years of current account data to 2011 with Professor Robert Hudson, of the University of Hull. Yet, the fundamental issue was unchanged, Prof Ashton told the BBC. \\"Over the long-term [free-if-in-credit] has not been a cheap way of getting banking services,\\" he said. \\"As a marketing ploy, it is brilliant.\\" Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the influential Treasury select committee of MPs, went further - describing free banking as \\"not just misleading, it is a con-trick\\". \\"There is no such thing as free banking. The consumer, in my view, should have an opportunity to find out how much they are paying, as they expect to do with any other good and service,\\" he told the BBC News website. A recent report into the retail banking market by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) revealed that the banks' average revenue from each current account customer was £177 in a year. To the obvious frustration of the Treasury committee, the CMA failed to unearth the average cost per customer of providing these current accounts. \\"They [the banks] think about the value of customers over their lifetime, rather than the profitability of individual customers,\\" Alasdair Smith, chairman of the CMA, told the committee at a recent hearing. Mr Tyrie and his committee told the CMA that they should have delved deeper during their investigation. \\"If banks do not know who they are making money from, this only serves to reinforce the fact that there is not enough competition in the market,\\" Mr Tyrie told the BBC. \\"In other industries, businesses which do not know where they are making money do not last very long.

An account's value for money - if this is possible to calculate - depends on which services a customer uses and how much he or she is charged for those services. For example, a list of current account fees provided to the BBC by financial information service Moneyfacts reveals the type of charges often ignored by customers choosing an account. For example, the Clearing House Automated Payment System (Chaps) is used for high-value payments made within a day. The fee for making a £100 payment through this system ranges from £12 to £40 with different accounts. James Daley, managing director of consumer website Fairer Finance, said the most common charges for going into the red were almost impossible to compare. \\"One of the main problems for bank customers today is that every bank has a different way of charging for overdrafts. Some have daily fees, some charge interest rates, some have buffers - and so it goes on,\\" he said. \\"If you are unlucky enough to go beyond your overdraft limit, things can be worse still. Some banks have 'returned item fees', some have 'unplanned borrowing charges', some have 'unpaid transaction fees'. Most of this means nothing to the average customer. \\"Outside of overdrafts, jargon is at its worst. There are 'load' fees and 'non-sterling transaction charges' for using your card abroad, as well as fees for Chaps, Swift, Target and Sepa payments. \\"Banks seem to revel in blinding their customers with complex language and jargon. Given that the FCA's rulebook already stipulates that customer communications need to be 'clear, fair and not misleading', we think most banks are in breach of the regulations. \\"It is time for the regulator to start making an example of the worst offenders and even fining them.\\" The British Bankers' Association (BBA), which represents the UK's major High Street banks, said: \\"The industry has clear guidelines that covers the need for banks to communicate in a way which is clear, fair and not misleading. \\"The banking industry is very much in favour of competition and actively encourages customers to shop around to get the best deals. Over the past five years, banks have introduced a number of different services to help customers keep on top of their money and compare offers so they can make informed choices and switch if appropriate. \\"To give just a few examples of this commitment, customers can now see itemised charges on bank statements, over 1.3 million text alerts from banks are sent to customers each week. Customers are also provided with annual summaries and breakdowns of charges taken to help comparisons.\\" Thursday: How to get the most from your current account Summary:","output":"Many people are using \\"free\\" current accounts, which are often the most expensive banking option, due to the complexity of charges and a lack of understanding of the banking system."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: who was president during the bay of pigs invasion?","output":"John Fitzgerald Kennedy, commonly known as JFK, was the president of the United States during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. JFK was the 35th president, serving from January 20, 1961, until his assassination on November 22, 1963. He was a member of the Democratic Party and was the youngest president ever elected to office at the age of 43. The Bay of Pigs Invasion, also known as \\"La Batalla de Giron\\" in Cuba or \\"Operación Pluto\\" in the United States, took place between April 17th and April 19th, 1961. This unsuccessful military intervention in Cuba was a covert operation initiated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during JFK's administration, with the objective of overthrowing the communist government of Fidel Castro. While Kennedy was not the architect of the invasion plan, it proceeded under his watch, and he shouldered the blame for its failure. The roots of this invasion plan can be traced back to the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The United States had grown increasingly concerned with Castro's close ties to the Soviet Union and the spread of communism in the Western Hemisphere, prompting Eisenhower to approve a plan in March 1960 to train Cuban exiles for an armed invasion of Cuba. When Kennedy assumed presidency, he allowed the plan to go forward, albeit with some modifications. The operation involved the CIA training and equipping a group of approximately 1,400 Cuban exiles (known as Brigade 2506) in Guatemala. These exiles were trained in various aspects of unconventional warfare. Their mission was to create initial beachheads in the southern coast of Cuba, specifically at the Bay of Pigs area in the Zapata Swamp region. From there, they were supposed to capture key targets, rally anti-Castro forces, and form a provisional government that would take control of the island. The invasion was a disaster from the outset. The operation faced a series of logistical and intelligence failures. Cuban forces had been alerted to the impending attack, and JFK's administration had scaled back air support, allowing the Cuban Air Force to maintain air superiority. Additionally, the amphibious landing site chosen for the invasion proved to be poorly suited, as it was surrounded by swampy terrain, providing no easy escape routes for the invading forces. As a result, the invading forces faced fierce resistance from Cuban troops, who easily repelled the invasion. Within three days, the members of Brigade 2506 were either killed or captured, with over 100 killed and over 1,000 taken as prisoners. The failed invasion led to further deterioration of US-Cuban relations and heightened tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. President Kennedy accepted responsibility for the failure, stating in a press conference that \\"victory has a hundred fathers, but defeat is an orphan.\\" The Bay of Pigs Invasion had a significant impact on Kennedy's domestic and foreign policy. It led to increased distrust towards the CIA, and Kennedy reevaluated the role of military advisors in his administration. Despite the failure at the Bay of Pigs, JFK remained committed to containing the spread of communism, and it resulted in decisions like supporting the Cuban Missile Crisis blockade and increasing involvement in the Vietnam War."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What happened between Ron and Veronica? Movie plot title: Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy Movie plot: In the mid 1970's, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is the famous and successful anchorman for San Diego's KVWN-TV Channel 4 Evening News. He works alongside his friends on the news team: fashion-oriented lead field reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sportscaster Champion \\"Champ\\" Kind (David Koechner), and a \\"legally retarded\\" chief meteorologist Brick Tamland (Steve Carell). The team is notified by their boss, Ed Harken (Fred Willard), that their station has maintained its long-held status as the highest-rated news program in San Diego, leading them to throw a wild party. Ron sees an attractive blond woman and immediately tries to hit on her. After an awkward, failed pick-up attempt, the woman leaves.The next day, Ed informs the team that he has been forced by the network to hire Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), a female news reporter from Asheville, North Carolina and the same woman Ron had tried to pick up the night before. The news team attempts to seduce Veronica using various inept, arrogant and sexist methods, all of which backfire. Ron ends up asking her out under the guise of helping out a new co-worker, which she accepts. During their date, Ron woos Veronica by playing jazz flute in his friend Tino's (Fred Armisen) club. Veronica goes against her policy of not dating co-workers and sleeps with Ron. The next day, despite agreeing with Veronica to keep the relationship discreet, Ron tells the entire news room that he and Veronica are in a sexual relationship (and later announces it on the air).The next day when Ron is on his way to the station, he throws a burrito out his car window, accidentally hitting a motorcyclist (Jack Black) in the head, causing him to crash. In a fit of rage, the biker retaliates by punting Ron's dog, Baxter, off a bridge. A distressed and incoherent Ron calls Brian from a pay phone and tells him what happened. Since Ron is now late, Brian frantically tells him to come to the station because Veronica is about to take his place. Despite Ron's efforts to arrive on time,... Answer:","output":"Between Ron and Veronica, initially, there was an awkward encounter during a party when Ron unsuccessfully attempted to hit on Veronica. Later, they met again in the workplace when Veronica was hired as a female news reporter for the same news program where Ron worked. Despite the rest of the news team using sexist tactics to seduce Veronica and Ron's initial reluctance to get involved with a coworker, he asked her out under the guise of helping her settle in. On their date, Ron played jazz flute at his friend Tino's club, which led to Veronica breaking her policy of not dating coworkers, and she ended up sleeping with Ron. The next day, although they agreed to keep their relationship discreet, Ron boasted about their sexual relationship both to the newsroom and on the air. Thus, at the beginning of their work relationship, the two shared an unsuccessful first impression, developed a romantic relationship after their first date, and faced the challenge of maintaining discretion as coworkers. As time went on, Ron's egocentric behavior and inability to respect the relationship resulted in a strain between them. Additionally, Ron's tardiness in reaching the news station resulted in Veronica having to fill in for him during a live broadcast. This led to her gaining increased recognition amongst the viewers and further challenging the dynamic between the two, as Ron was not used to sharing the limelight with Veronica. In summary, the relationship between Ron and Veronica began with an unsuccessful first impression, developed into a romantic relationship, and was eventually challenged by Ron's egotism and the changing power dynamics at their work."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to evict a tenant without rental agreement Confirm that you have no written lease.

(Photo: Courtesy/FDR Presidential Library) First lady. Icon of liberalism. Gun owner? Yes, Eleanor Roosevelt, known for traveling the country to highlight the plight of the poor and marginalized, also was packing heat. The mother of five had a .22 caliber Smith & Wesson pistol with a 6-inch barrel, front sight and a round top frame with an adjustable rear sight. Her application for a pistol permit in Dutchess County was added in June to the extensive materials on Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park. Bob Clark, acting director of the library and museum, said the pistol permit application is extremely important from a historical perspective. “This is an example of a record that is out there — it was intended for an administrative purpose, but it has long-term, historical implications,” Clark said. “It’s very important that it has a permanent home here at the library.” With debate raging in New York and around the nation about gun control and Second Amendment rights, the fact that one of the greats of the Democratic Party not only owned a gun, but carried it for protection, may seem hard to believe, but it was a different time, some say. Eleanor Roosevelt received death threats and her husband, Franklin Roosevelt, had survived an assassination attempt in Miami while awaiting his first presidential inauguration. The Roosevelts had been in the political spotlight for years. For example, FDR was governor of New York from 1928-32. But the spotlight would only get brighter. Franklin Roosevelt had won his first presidential election in 1932 and he would win three more terms as president. That assassination attempt in February 1933 prompted FDR to suggest to his wife that she let the Secret Service protect her. She declined. According to Clark, Eleanor Roosevelt did not like to have a large entourage and preferred to travel alone. But in October 1933, Eleanor Roosevelt received a gift or her 49th birthday from her bodyguard, Earl Miller. “Her bodyguard, Earl Miller, wanted to teach her how to shoot a gun so she would have that skill, if necessary,” Clark said. “He worked with her to show her the proper way to shoot a pistol and that was really the beginning of Mrs. Roosevelt’s interest with handguns.” According to James D. Julia Auctioneers in Maine, Eleanor Roosevelt’s pistol was sold at auction in October 2014 to a private collector for 50,600. “I think it's fascinating,” said Jeremy Levenbach, 33, of Brooklyn, who on Friday visited the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park. Political divide Eleanor Roosevelt is considered a 20th century icon of the Democratic Party and someone whose liberal politics established an enduring benchmark that continues to shape politics today. The fact that she owned a gun offers yet another dimension to the historic legacy of a president and first lady who were based in Dutchess County but shaped national and global events. Viewed from the perspective of 21st century politics, where Republicans and Democrats largely have lined up on opposing sides of the gun control debate, Eleanor Roosevelt’s pistol offers a fresh take on the ongoing debate over the rights of gun owners, the Democrats who want to curtail them and the Republicans who want to expand them. “I think that having an icon in the political arena and, truly, someone who was a world leader, having a true understanding of what your Second Amendment rights are, as an American, is just incredibly enlightening,” said Mike McCormack, chairman of the Dutchess County Republican Committee. “She got it.” Dutchess County Democratic Committee Chairwoman Elisa Sumner had a very different opinion. “I don’t think you can compare what she did in 1957 with 2015,” Sumner said. “At the time, you weren’t having mass shootings. You didn’t have Sandy Hook (elementary school shootings). You didn’t have people walking around with semi-automatic weapons, Uzis and Kalishnikovs. I don’t think there is a comparison at all. You’re talking about two different time periods. “She needed protection because of her liberal, civil rights circumstances. She needed protection,” Sumner said. Levenbach shared Sumner’s opinion. “I think it was such a different time,” he said. Eleanor's travels In 1937, Eleanor Roosevelt traveled to New Orleans and was provided with security, Clark said. She didn’t feel the security was necessary when she traveled in New York or Washington, because people knew who she was. “She made a comment at that event,” Clark said. “She made an off-handed comment that she sometimes did carry a gun when she traveled and she knew how to use it. She also made the comment, ‘I hate guns.’” Eleanor Roosevelt carried the unloaded gun in the locked glove compartment of her car. Clark said the story picks up again in 1957. That’s the year Eleanor Roosevelt applied for and received a pistol permit in Dutchess County. She was 72. The permit was among the items in Eleanor Roosevelt’s wallet when she died on Nov. 7, 1962. The date on the pistol permit was Aug. 5, 1957. Her address on the permit is listed as “ValKill Cottage, Hyde Park.” Her occupation is listed as “Writer & Lecturer.” She wrote that she was employed by “Self.” The permit is on display at the library. Dutchess County Clerk Brad Kendall, 51 years after the permit was issued, was attending the annual meeting of the New York State Association of County Clerks. As was customary, a representative of the state police addressed those gathered. In 2008, the discussion turned to pistol permits and how the deaths of permit holders can make the the accuracy of the state’s database difficult to maintain. The speaker, as an example, cited how Eleanor Roosevelt’s pistol permit, in 2008, remained active. Kendall returned home and found the application. “Sure enough, we had it,” he said. “It had never been noted she was deceased. Technically, it was still active.” Eleanor Roosevelt’s pistol application indicated that she had previously been granted a pistol license in 1933. No further information was available. But along with the application Kendall found was a document with Eleanor Roosevelt’s fingerprints. Eleanor Roosevelt's fingerprints, from her 1957 pistol application. (Photo: Courtesy/FDR Presidential Library) The application had been processed by the Dutchess County Sheriff’s Office and signed by then-Sheriff C. Fred Close. It included a photo of Eleanor Roosevelt wearing a hat, fur stole and double strand of pearls. The reason for the pistol, according to Eleanor Roosevelt’s application, was “protection.” Clark said the timing of the pistol permit coincided with Eleanor Roosevelt’s travels throughout the South — by herself — in advocacy of civil rights. Those trips prompted death threats. The photograph of Eleanor Roosevelt that accompanied her 1957 pistol permit application. (Photo: Courtesy photo/FDR Presidential Library) After the application was discovered at the county clerk’s office, it was returned to long-term storage, Kendall said. Earlier this year, older pistol permits were purged and, after consulting with the county historian and New York State Archives, Kendall turned the application over to the FDR Library. The formal transfer took place in June during a naturalization ceremony that Kendall conducted at the FDR Library’s Henry A. Wallace Visitor and Education Center. The pistol permit application is not on display, but available for review by researchers. John W.

Now the portrait photographer who lives in Boca Raton wants to see that photo on the 10 bill. Her picture is in the archives of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library in Hyde Park, N.Y., and Roosevelt is on the short list of contenders for a woman on the note. \\"It would be a wonderful tribute to a wonderful woman,\\" Kapp wrote in her April 15 letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew with a package documenting her request. No answer yet, but Congresswoman Lois Frankel carried her wishes to Washington, her staff confirmed. But there's more to the story. The often-photographed Roosevelt liked the picture so much she asked for more copies that Kapp delivered herself. At that auspicious visit, Roosevelt offered to pay for the prints, but for Kapp it was an unexpected payback. \\"I could never in my wildest dreams have thought this would happen to me,\\" she wrote. \\"I was on the last children's transport from Danzig, Germany [to England] in May, 1939,\\" narrowly escaping Hitler's Holocaust. \\"One day we were all given new shoes…and when I opened mine, the paper read: With all good wishes, Eleanor Roosevelt, American Rescue Committee. \\"I was able to reciprocate in a small way,\\" she said, recalling that \\"Roosevelt was absolutely astounded....\\" Once she was older but still living in England to wait out the war, Kapp apprenticed with \\"one of the best photo studios.\\" She was reunited years later with her brother and parents who escaped on a ship and ended up in a British internment camp. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum put all the letters between them and photographs in two huge binders that Kapp keeps to document the family's survival. By the time the Roosevelt photo came up it was 20 years later. She had married William S. Kapp in 1949 and kept working in her studio and shot portraits, mostly children and including baseball great Jackie Robinson and his family. In a Nov. 10, 1959 letter, Roosevelt thanked Kapp for the photo taken on Oct. 25 during a Democratic campaign stop for Adlai Stevenson, who wasn't there, at Livingston High School. Roosevelt offered to autograph the photo and invited Kapp to pick it up at her Val-Kill Cottage in Hyde Park. \\"She called me from Hyde Park and I was in my dark room,\\" Kapp remembers. That was quickly followed by two more letters asking for more copies, and extending an invitation to her East Side Manhattan apartment on 74th Street. Kapp decided to go and bring her mother-in-law, the artist Paula Kapp. \\"I couldn't believe it myself,\\" she said. Afterward, she got a handwritten thank-you note from Roosevelt dated Jan. 21, 1960. \\"If I ever need a photographer, I will certainly get in touch with you,\\" she wrote. There's no date set for deciding on which woman will replace Alexander Hamilton on the 10 bill, if in fact he is replaced. \\"Treasury will engage the public during the summer to hear from the American people and engage in a public dialogue about currency designs that best represent the value of democracy,\\" according to the department. \\"After reviewing this input, the Secretary will announce his decision for the portrait; however no date has been set. The only criterion for a portrait selected for currency is that the person must be deceased.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The news article presents a historically significant aspect of the life of Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It reveals that she owned a .22 caliber Smith & Wesson pistol and had a permit for it in Dutchess County. Her pistol permit application has been added to the materials on Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park. The article highlights the historical implications of this piece of information since Eleanor is known as a pioneering liberal icon and the Democratic Party's torchbearer. The fact that she owned a gun and carried it for protection provides a fresh perspective on the ongoing debate over gun control and Second Amendment rights in the United States. It shows that the discourse surrounding gun control should be viewed in the broader context of personal safety and historical circumstances rather than being confined to mere political alignments and beliefs. Eleanor Roosevelt received death threats during her time, and Franklin Roosevelt had survived an assassination attempt prior to his first presidential inauguration. She refused Secret Service protection, choosing instead to learn how to shoot a gun for self-defense purposes. Her pistol was eventually sold to a private collector at an auction in 2014. The article emphasizes that Eleanor Roosevelt's possession of a gun is a reflection of the unique challenges she faced during her time, rather than an endorsement of either side in the contemporary gun control debate."},{"instruction":"Q:Combine facts and answer this: Wonder Woman and Killer Bean Forever, are both 2009 films of which genre?

Sanjay was passionate about music and community service, so he decided to use his talents and co-organize a charity concert at his college. He mobilized his classmates and friends, secured the necessary permissions, and started promoting the event. As the preparations for the concert were well underway, Geetha, a beautiful and kind-hearted girl at the college, decided to attend. She admired Sanjay's zeal for helping others and secretly harbored feelings for him. For months, she had been captivated by his charming personality, but never had the courage to disclose her feelings for fear of rejection or embarrassment. During the charity concert, Sanjay and his friends gave spectacular performances, and the event was a roaring success. The entire college was abuzz, and several funds were raised for a noble cause. Thrilled by the outcome, Geetha grew more and more attracted to Sanjay, and she couldn't contain her emotions any longer. After one of Sanjay's enchanting songs at the concert, Geetha found the perfect opportunity to confess her love for him. She approached him backstage and, mustering all her courage, poured her heart out. Much to Geetha's delight, Sanjay reciprocated her feelings, saying he had noticed her from afar and was touched by her kind and selfless nature. Moving forward in their relationship, Sanjay uncovered a dark secret that was being kept from Geetha. He discovered that Geetha had a rare form of blood cancer, but she and her father were completely unaware of her condition. Sanjay was devastated by the news but determined to support and stand by Geetha through thick and thin. Sanjay mustered all his courage and approached Geetha's mother, deciding to inform her about her daughter's illness. Together, they discussed the possible implications, and after much contemplation, they decided to reveal the truth to Geetha and her father. It was an extremely difficult conversation, but they knew that the sooner they sought treatment, the better Geetha's chances of survival were. As the treatment process began, the illness started taking a toll on Geetha's eyes. Her vision began to deteriorate, and as days went by, it became harder and harder for her to see. Despite the physical challenges, Geetha remained strong and hopeful, with Sanjay by her side providing unwavering love and support. Sanjay continued organizing charity concerts and dedicated each one to Geetha, drawing inspiration from her strength and resilience. With every progressive event, funds were raised and donated to research for blood cancer treatment advancements. Though the road was long and difficult, Geetha gradually recovered, and her condition stabilized. In the process, she and Sanjay only grew closer, realizing the immeasurable strength of their bond. This tale of love, courage, and selflessness became a legend in the town. People spoke of how two young individuals faced adversity and showed everyone that even in the darkest of times, love and hope could prevail.

The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"President Ronald Reagan disagreed with Lyndon B. Johnson on affirmative action. During his administration in the 1980s, Reagan opposed the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246 that were put into place by Johnson. This executive order prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts, and was later amended to include sex in 1967. The Reagan administration considered making changes to affirmative action policies, but these proposed changes faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress and were not implemented."},{"instruction":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: Cheapest properties in Mataro","output":"Here's the sentence with the spaces removed: CheapestPropertiesInMataro"},{"instruction":"Q:Here's a question: If a person want a changing society, what is a likely motive?

Choose a coat hanger: Pick a coat hanger made of metal wire, because it's easy to bend with your hands. Avoid plastic coat hangers, as they can break when you try to bend them. 2. Think about the shape: Imagine the shape you want to create with the coat hanger. It can be a simple shape like a circle or a heart or something more complicated like an animal or a word. 3. Start bending: Hold the coat hanger with both hands, and start slowly bending it into the shape you have in mind. Use your fingers and hands to apply gentle pressure at different points along the wire to create curves and angles. 4. Take your time: Bending the coat hanger might take some effort and patience. If it's not perfect the first time, that's okay! Keep adjusting and bending until you're happy with the shape. 5. Use tools if needed: If you're having trouble bending the coat hanger with just your hands or if you want to create sharper angles, you can use pliers to help you. Be careful not to pinch your fingers, though! 6. Finishing touches: Once you've made the desired shape, you can smooth out any rough edges with a piece of sandpaper or file. This will make sure your new creation is safe to touch and use. And there you have it! You've successfully bent a coat hanger into a desired shape.

Answer:","output":"The language based on the Boko alphabet is primarily used in the West African region, specifically in the countries of Nigeria and Niger. Before diving into the details, let's first understand the Boko alphabet and its origin. The Boko script, also known as the Hausa boko or the Hausa ajami script, is an indigenous writing system that has been adopted by the Hausa people, who are one of the largest ethnic groups in West Africa. The Hausa language is a Chadic language, a branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, and it is spoken by more than 40 million people across the region. The main areas where the Hausa language is spoken include Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon, Sudan, and Ghana, among others. However, the use of the Boko alphabet is mostly concentrated in Nigeria and Niger. The Boko alphabet has its origins in the early 20th century, born out of modifications to the Arabic script. The modifications were made to accommodate distinct Hausa phonemes that weren't present in Arabic. The term \\"boko\\" is likely derived from the English word \\"book,\\" as the script was primarily employed in secular literature and educational materials, in contrast with the Ajami script that was predominantly used for religious texts. In Nigeria, the Boko script was adopted as a means of communication among Hausa-speaking communities, particularly in the northern parts of the country. The colonial administration of Nigeria, under the British rule, played a significant role in popularizing the script by promoting the standardized Boko alphabet for official communication, education, and publishing. Similarly, in Niger, the use of the Boko script was mainly centered in the Hausa-speaking regions, particularly in the southern parts of the country, where the Hausa community has a strong presence. The script was used in various written materials such as government documents, educational textbooks, and literary works. Nowadays, the Boko alphabet has been largely replaced by the Latin script, especially in the educational system and official communications. However, the use of the Boko script still remains significant, particularly within religious and cultural contexts. Overall, the language based on the Boko alphabet continues to hold importance in preserving the heritage and traditions of the Hausa communities in Nigeria and Niger."},{"instruction":"Davide!

The key difference is the inclusion of \\"before making their move\\" in the hypothesis, which adds an action after checking for traffic. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The addition of \\"before making their move\\" in the hypothesis implies an action taken after checking for traffic. However, the premise does not explicitly state that the person takes any action afterward.

Loosely based on Coffinman, a memoir by Shinmon Aoki, the film follows a young man who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nokanshi--a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his wife, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he earns their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work. Japanese funerals are highly ritualized affairs which are generally--though not always--conducted in accordance with Buddhist rites. In preparation for the funeral, the body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze. The encoffining ritual (called nokan), as depicted in Departures, is rarely performed, and even then only in rural areas. This ceremony is not standardized, but generally involves professional morticians (Na Guan Shi , nokanshi) ritually preparing the body, dressing the dead in white, and sometimes applying make-up. The body is then put on dry ice in a casket, along with personal possessions and items necessary for the trip to the afterlife. Despite the importance of death rituals, in traditional Japanese culture the subject is considered unclean as everything related to death is thought to be a source of kegare (defilement). After coming into contact with the dead, individuals must cleanse themselves through purifying rituals. People who work closely with the dead, such as morticians, are thus considered unclean, and during the feudal era those whose work was related to death became burakumin (untouchables), forced to live in their own hamlets and discriminated against by wider society. Despite a cultural shift since the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the stigma of death still has considerable force within Japanese society, and discrimination against the untouchables has continued. Until 1972, most deaths were dealt with by families, funeral homes, or nokanshi. As of 2014, about 80% of deaths occur in hospitals, and preparation of the bodies is frequently done by hospital staff; in such cases, the family often does not see the body until the funeral. A 1998 survey found that 29.5% of the Japanese population believed in an afterlife, and a further 40% wanted to believe; belief was highest among the young. Belief in the existence of a soul (54%) and a connection between the worlds of the living and the dead (64.9%) was likewise common.

She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog.

It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things.

Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\".

He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed.

Stream of consciousness:","output":"To find the average speed for the entire journey, we need to determine the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time of travel. In the first 2 hours, Steve traveled at a speed of 40 mph. So, we can multiply the speed with the time taken to find the distance he covered: Distance1 = Speed1 × Time1 Distance1 = 40 mph × 2 hours = 80 miles. In the last 2 hours, he traveled at a speed of 80 mph. Again, we can multiply the speed with the time taken to find the distance covered: Distance2 = Speed2 × Time2 Distance2 = 80 mph × 2 hours = 160 miles. Now, we can find the total distance Steve traveled by adding the distances from the first and second parts of his journey: Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 Total Distance = 80 miles + 160 miles = 240 miles. The total time taken for the entire journey can be found by adding the time from each part of the journey: Total Time = Time1 + Time2 Total Time = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours. Finally, we can compute Steve's average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance by the total time: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time Average Speed = 240 miles / 4 hours Average Speed = 60 mph. Thus, his average speed for the entire journey is 60 mph, and the correct answer is option (C)."},{"instruction":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Sugar enters the body (through consumption of food). 2. The sugar enters the bloodstream. 3. The pancreas detects the increase in blood sugar levels. 4. The pancreas releases insulin to lower blood sugar levels. 5. Blood sugar levels return to normal. Now, let's consider the situation where the person has insulin problems: - In the case of insulin resistance, the body does not respond well to insulin, and the pancreas has to produce more insulin to achieve the same effect. This could lead to the pancreas working harder to release more insulin in an attempt to regulate blood sugar. - In the case of insufficient insulin production, the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin to properly regulate blood sugar levels, causing them to remain higher than normal. In both situations, MORE regulation of blood sugar levels would be needed (either through higher insulin production, external insulin administration, or other means, such as dietary changes or medication).

According to Shawn Crahan, Corey wanted number eight, because it symbolizes infinity. Feeling he could expand more inside Slipknot than in Stone Sour, Taylor temporarily quit Stone Sour, even though they were recording an album with Sean McMahon. Taylor's first gig with Slipknot was on August 22, 1997, which according to band members did not go well. During his first gig, Taylor did not perform wearing a mask; however, for his second show nearly a month later, Corey wore a mask that resembles his debut album mask. Taylor's current mask was described by MTV's Chris Harris as looking \\"as though it were made of dried, human flesh--like Leatherface, if only he used moisturizer.\\" Taylor has recorded with Slipknot since the release of their second demo album, a self-titled demo used to promote the band to prospective labels and producers. As permanent vocalist, he recorded with Slipknot at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, California and released Slipknot, the band's debut album that peaked number one on the Top Heatseekers chart, went double platinum in the United States, and was included in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Taylor was accused of copyright infringement, regarding the lyrics of the song \\"Purity\\", but no action was taken. Taylor began recording for their second studio album, Iowa, in 2001 at Sound City and Sound Image in Van Nuys, Los Angeles. It was released August 28, 2001 and peaked number one on the UK Albums Chart, as well as number three on the Billboard 200. While writing Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses), Taylor decided to write lyrics that would not warrant an explicit label. It peaked number two on the Billboard 200. All Hope Is Gone was the first Slipknot album to peak number one on the Billboard 200. Question: did he tour with them? Answer:","output":"Yes, Corey Taylor did tour with both Slipknot and Stone Sour. After recording albums with the bands, he went on tours to perform the music live for fans. Tours are like big concerts where musicians travel from place to place and share their music with people all around the world."},{"instruction":"Přenáší se kapénkovou cestou? - Ano, pravděpodobně. Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Is it transmitted by droplet spread? - Yes, likely. The phrase \\"Přenáší se kapénkovou cestou?\\" translates into English as \\"Is it transmitted by droplet spread?\\". This question asks whether a disease or virus, though unspecified in your question, can be spread via microscopic particles expelled from an infected person, typically through sneezes, coughs, or even talking. These droplets can be inhaled by another person, thus spreading the disease or virus. The response, \\"Ano, pravděpodobně\\" translates into English as \\"Yes, likely\\". This means that there is a high probability or strong chance that the disease or virus can indeed be spread through droplet transmission. It is a common mode of transmission for numerous respiratory diseases, including the common cold, flu, and COVID-19. It's important to note, when managing diseases or viruses that spread via droplets, that precautions such as wearing masks, regular hand washing, and social distancing can reduce the chance of transmission. Modifying behaviors, like avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness, can also help prevent the spread."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who finds the basket set adrift on the Nile by Yoshebel? Movie plot title: The Ten Commandments Movie plot: Despite its epic scale, the Moses story takes up only about the first third of the film. After that, the story changes to a modern setting involving living by the lessons of the commandments. Two brothers make opposite decisions, one, John, to follow his mother's teaching of the Ten Commandments and become a poor carpenter, and the other, Danny, to break every one of them and rise to the top. The film shows his unchecked immorality to be momentarily gainful, but ultimately disastrous. A thoughtful contrast is made between the carpenter brother and his mother. The mother reads the story of Moses and emphasizes strict obedience and fear of God. The carpenter, however, reads from the New Testament story of Jesus's healing of lepers. His emphasis is on a loving and forgiving God. The film also shows the mother's strict lawful morality to be flawed in comparison to her son's version. Danny becomes a corrupt contractor who builds a church with shoddy concrete, pocketing the money saved and becoming very rich. One day, his mother comes to visit him at his work site, but the walls are becoming unstable due to the shaking of heavy trucks on nearby roads. One of the walls collapses on top of the mother, killing her. In her dying breath, she tells Danny that it is her fault for teaching him to fear God, when she should have taught him love. This sends Danny on a downward spiral as he attempts to right his wrongs and clear his conscience, but he only gets into more trouble. To make money, he steals pearls from his mistress, and when she fights back, he kills her. He attempts to flee to Mexico on a motorboat, but rough weather sends him off course and he crashes into a rocky island, where he is presumably killed. Throughout the film, the visual motif of the tablets of the commandments appears in the sets, with a particular commandment appearing on them when it is relevant to the story.

We have the equation: 5 * g = 48 * g - 127 - 647 First, let's simplify the equation by combining the two numbers on the right side: 5 * g = 48 * g - 774 (because 127 + 647 = 774) Now, we want to get all the \\"g\\" terms on one side, so we will subtract the 48 * g from both sides of the equation: 5 * g - 48 * g = -774 Now, combine the \\"g\\" terms: -43 * g = -774 (because 5-48 = -43) To find the value of \\"g\\", we will divide both sides of the equation by -43: g = -774 / -43 When we divide, we get: g = 18 So, the solution to the problem is g = 18.

The poem is a unique and powerful fusion of Christian and Anglo-Saxon heroic tropes, in which the rood itself is personified and serves as the narrator, recounting the story of Christ's crucifixion and the rood's own role in it. In the poem, the dreamer witnesses a vision of a magnificent tree (the rood) that is alternately adorned with gold and gems and covered in blood. The rood goes on to recount its own history, from being cut down in a forest and assembled as a crucifix to the arrival of Christ, the \\"young hero\\" who willingly ascends the cross in order to save humanity from its sins. The rood then describes the harrowing scene of the crucifixion and is eventually drenched in Christ's blood. This blood, symbolic of Christ's sacrifice, sanctifies the rood and transforms it into a holy relic. The poem emphasizes the physical pain and suffering that both Christ and the rood endure, casting them both as heroes who bear the weight of their respective roles with courage and fortitude. Once Christ has died and is taken down from the cross, the rood is also later taken down and buried in a deep pit. However, the rood does not remain buried forever; it is later discovered, adorned with gold and gems, and venerated as a sacred object. This resurrection of the rood mirrors the resurrection of Christ, reinforcing the connection between the two. The poem concludes with the dreamer reflecting upon the message of the rood, with a newfound understanding of the deep significance of Christ's sacrifice and the importance of redemption and salvation. The rood, by bearing witness to Christ's crucifixion and being drenched in his holy blood, serves as a powerful symbol of the merging of the divine and human worlds. In summary, in \\"The Dream of the Rood,\\" the rood is eventually drenched in the blood of Jesus Christ as it shares in the sacrifice and suffering of the crucifixion. This transformative event links the rood and Christ together as heroic figures, each bearing a crucial role in the salvation of humanity."},{"instruction":"Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms.

In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently...

Calculate the sum of all seven numbers. 2. Calculate the sum of the first three and the last three numbers. 3. Subtract the sum of the first three and the last three numbers from the sum of all seven numbers to find the middle number. 4. Check the middle number against the given options. Step 1: The average of all seven numbers is 18. Therefore, the total sum of all seven numbers is: 18 * 7 = 126 Step 2: The average of the first three numbers is 14, so their total sum is: 14 * 3 = 42 The average of the last three numbers is 16, so their total sum is: 16 * 3 = 48 Step 3: Now, subtract the sum of the first three and the last three numbers from the sum of all seven numbers to find the middle number: Middle number = Total sum of all numbers - (sum of first three numbers + sum of last three numbers) Middle number = 126 - (42 + 48) Middle number = 126 - 90 Middle number = 36 Step 4: Check the middle number against the given options: (A) 27 (B) 29 (C) 36 (D) 34 (E) 35 The middle number is 36, which corresponds to option (C)."},{"instruction":"Process: - A large rocky area is formed - The rocky area has a higher elevation than the surrounding areas - Water from precipitation falls in the area - The water forms a stream - The stream flows towards lower elevation - The stream becomes a river - The river continues to flow along the same path for a long time - The river erodes the rocky area that it touches - The eroded area cuts deeply into the rock. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less water is absorbed by the plant happens, how will it affect MORE/LARGER valleys being formed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If less water is absorbed by plants in the given process, it can potentially lead to the formation of more or larger valleys in the area. This perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the overall process. Here's how it could happen: 1. Direct effect: With less water being absorbed by plants, more water will be available for runoff on the surface, leading to a greater amount of water flow in the stream. This increased flow can cause a higher rate of erosion on the rocky area and result in the formation of more or larger valleys over time, as the river cuts more deeply into the rock. 2. Indirect effect: If less water is absorbed by the plants, it might potentially affect the surrounding ecosystem in various ways. For example, the decreased water absorption might lead to changes in soil composition and moisture levels, affecting erosion rates and sediment distribution around the area. This, in turn, can have an impact on valley formation, as it might modify the way rocks are eroded over time. Additionally, the decreased water usage by plants could also alter the local vegetation patterns, which might affect the overall environment and indirectly impact the creation and size of valleys. For example, areas with denser vegetation might see slower erosion rates as roots can help stabilize the soil, while areas with sparser plant distribution might experience faster erosion. To sum up, the perturbation of less water being absorbed by plants can have both direct and indirect effects on the formation of more or larger valleys. The direct impact comes from the increased water flow and erosion caused by the higher availability of surface water. The indirect effects result from the potential changes in the ecosystem, such as alterations in soil composition, sediment distribution, and vegetation patterns, which can also contribute to variations in erosion rates and, ultimately, the size and number of valleys formed."},{"instruction":"Translate the following.

Translate to English","output":"I believe that these ideas with strategic depth and a multifaceted approach also entail many dangers. The concept of strategic depth refers to gaining a position of strength in political, military, and economic dimensions within a particular field or subject, which we can easily assume by the context given in the statement. The multi-faceted approach, on the other hand, implies that various strategies, areas of focus, and perspectives are being considered in dealing with certain issues or situations. Having ideas with strategic depth and a multifaceted approach is generally viewed positively, as it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the environment, better allocation of resources, and increased adaptability to possible changes. It allows entities to be well-prepared for different scenarios and develop resilience in the face of adversity. However, as mentioned, there are possible dangers associated with such approaches, which we can detail in the following paragraphs. 1. Resource allocation: While strategic depth can lead to more efficient use of resources, its pursuit might involve significant investment in various areas simultaneously. This can strain organizations' financial, human, and time resources if not managed correctly, potentially leading to a detrimental effect on overall performance. 2. Complexity: A multifaceted approach can involve complicated decision-making processes, as it requires consideration of multiple factors, perspectives, and possible outcomes. This complexity may result in slow decision-making, bureaucracy, and difficulties in finding consensus among stakeholders. 3. Focus: With a multifaceted approach, there is a risk of losing focus on primary objectives, as the strategy entails examining various factors and perspectives. It might be challenging to stay on track with primary goals when trying to address different dimensions of the problem or situation concurrently. 4. Uncertainty: Ideas with strategic depth often involve venturing into unknown territories or facing new challenges. Consequently, there is an inherent level of uncertainty and potential threats that might arise from these new situations, increasing the risks associated with pursuing such ideas. 5. Overconfidence: A sense of strategic depth and preparedness might lead to overconfidence and a false sense of security. This may result in complacency or an underestimation of potential threats, which could ultimately bring about negative consequences. In conclusion, while ideas with strategic depth and a multifaceted approach offer opportunities to navigate complex situations and achieve favorable outcomes, they also entail some inherent dangers. It is important to recognize and mitigate these dangers to ensure that the pursuit of such ideas does not lead to unintended adverse consequences."},{"instruction":"south korean president lee myung-bak wednesday called for dialogue with the democratic people 's republic of korea -lrb- dprk -rrb- , apparently softening his hard-line stance on the country .

Answer:","output":"The provided information does not indicate a specific individual's name given that it is a set of general data points about a professional tennis player, such as career records, personal statistics, and background information. However, contextual analysis allows us to deduce some general details about the person. The player resides in Santa Bárbara D'Oeste, Brazil, and was also born there. This likely indicates Brazilian nationality. Their birth date is January 4, 1985, and they turned pro in 2003, suggesting they began their professional career at the age of 18. This player is right-handed, has a height of 1.88 meters, and their game appears to have a focus on singles matches, as inferred by the singles record of 1-0 and a singles ranking much higher than the doubles ranking. The highest singles ranking achieved is No. 214 on September 24, 2012, and the current singles ranking (as of the last update on July 9, 2013) is No. 275, suggesting a drop in performance or possible injuries. The player's doubles record is 0-0 with the highest doubles ranking at No. 554 on July 9, 2012, and the current doubles ranking is No. 298 as of the last update on August 15, 2011. This might suggest that doubles matches are not the player's main focus or strongest area. Despite the player's active profession, they have not won any titles in either singles or doubles, as indicated by the record of 0 for singles and doubles titles. This could suggest that the player might be struggling at the top levels of the sport, or might have lower-tier wins not listed here. The career prize money is not specified in the data, making it impossible to infer their financial success within the sport. Additionally, the player's performance stats appear to have been last updated on February 7, 2011. In summary, the player in question is a Brazilian professional tennis player, primarily focused on singles matches, and started their career at a young age. However, the success within their career appears to be modest, with no major title victories and a gradual drop in singles ranking.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. What does the author think about constantly pushing yourself? - not enough information - it is good until you get a promotion and then you should scale back - it is okay as long as you can handle it - it does more harm then good","output":"The author thinks that constantly pushing yourself does more harm than good."},{"instruction":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .","output":"The sentiment of the given sentence, \\"'s a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns,\\" can be interpreted as negative. Let's break the sentence down to understand the reasoning behind this conclusion. 1. Road-trip drama: In this context, the mention of \\"road-trip drama\\" gives us an idea of the genre, tone, and theme of the story. Road-trip dramas often involve journeys, adventures, relationships, or internal conflicts among the characters. However, the mention of the genre itself does not evoke a positive or negative sentiment in this sentence. 2. Too many wrong turns: The latter part of the sentence discusses \\"too many wrong turns.\\" The phrase \\"wrong turns\\" is used metaphorically to describe decisions, events, or aspects in the story that may have been inappropriate, flawed, misleading, or detrimental to the overall experience. The use of the word \\"too many\\" indicates that the number of these issues is significant enough to warrant concern. The phrase \\"too many wrong turns\\" is key to understanding the sentiment of the sentence. It suggests that the mistakes, inconsistencies, or issues within the road-trip drama's narrative or execution affect the overall quality of the story. This phrasing signifies dissatisfaction or disappointment in the story's overall direction, implying that the experience might be confusing, disjointed, or aimless. Taking these observations into account, we can conclude that the sentiment of the sentence is negative, as it highlights the negative aspects of the road-trip drama and does not mention any positive or enjoyable features. The author of the sentence seems to express their dissatisfaction and disappointment with the road-trip drama's excessive issues or inconsistencies."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = The Rice Boat, food = Indian, priceRange = less than £20, customer rating = low, area = riverside, familyFriendly = no, near = Express by Holiday Inn","output":"\\"Located near Express by Holiday Inn at the riverside, The Rice Boat is an Indian restaurant with a menu priced less than £20, however, as it is not family-friendly and has a low customer rating, it may not be the prime choice for a family outing.\\" In my sentence construction, I followed these steps: 1.

Options: - yes - no Chain-of-thought:","output":"It is not possible to definitively verify the claim that the subject matter in Philosophy and Economics has decreased since the 1980s using only human common sense and without a web search. However, it is reasonable to argue that this claim may be inaccurate based on the following chain of thought: 1. The progress of human knowledge: Human knowledge and understanding typically expand with time, as new information, theories, and ideas are discovered and developed. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the subject matter in Philosophy and Economics would decrease over time, as new ideas, perspectives, and research are continuously added to these fields. 2. The growth of academic institutions and researchers: Since the 1980s, the number of academic institutions and researchers in various fields, including Philosophy and Economics, has increased. With more people engaging in research and scholarship, it is reasonable to assume that the body of knowledge in these fields would expand rather than decrease. 3. Interdisciplinary studies and research: Since the 1980s, there has been a growing emphasis on interdisciplinary research, which involves the collaboration of researchers from different fields to develop new insights and perspectives that cross traditional boundaries. This interdisciplinary approach has led to the development of new theories and ideas in various areas, including Philosophy and Economics, which would likely result in an increase in subject matter rather than a decrease. 4. The impact of the internet and digital technology: The rise of the internet and advances in digital technology have facilitated greater access to information and resources, making it easier for researchers to collaborate, share ideas, and expand on existing knowledge. This increased access to information could contribute to the growth of subject matter in Philosophy and Economics, rather than a decrease. In conclusion, while it is not possible to definitively verify the claim without a web search, it seems more reasonable to believe that the subject matter in Philosophy and Economics has expanded or evolved since the 1980s, rather than decreased."},{"instruction":"Generate a 3-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package de.onyxbits.textfiction.

The interface is also minimalist and easy to navigate, something that I personally appreciate in an app. Step 2: Address the limitations However, there were a few limitations that held me back from giving this app a higher rating. For one, I noticed an occasional lag while using the app, which mildly disrupted my overall experience. Additionally, the selection of available titles, though decent in number, seemed to lack variety and mostly consisted of older works. Step 3: Offer constructive feedback To improve the user experience, it would be helpful if the developers could update the app to fix the lagging issues and expand the range of content available. The inclusion of newer and more diverse interactive fiction works would greatly enhance the app's appeal.

Most of these forces were on Mount Independence, with only 100 each at Fort Ticonderoga and a blockhouse they were constructing on top of Mount Defiance. George Washington sent General Benjamin Lincoln into Vermont to \\"divide and distract the enemy\\". Aware that the British were housing American prisoners in the area, Lincoln decided to test the British defenses. On September 13, he sent 500 men to Skenesboro, which they found the British had abandoned, and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga. Colonel John Brown led the troops on the west side, with instructions to release prisoners if possible, and attack the fort if it seemed feasible. Early on September 18, Brown's troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing, while a detachment of his troops sneaked up Mount Defiance, and captured most of the sleeping construction crew. Brown and his men then moved down the portage trail toward the fort, surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way. The fort's occupants were unaware of the action until Brown's men and British troops occupying the old French lines skirmished. At this point Brown's men dragged two captured six-pound guns up to the lines, and began firing on the fort. The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve-pounder from that site. The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed, and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began. Their musket fire, as well as grapeshot fired from ships anchored nearby, intimidated the Americans sufficiently that they never launched an assault on the defensive positions on Mount Independence.

Answer: Excluding the rochet — which is always white — the scarlet garments include the cassock, mozzetta, and biretta (over the usual scarlet zucchetto). Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: The item of clothing worn by cardinals that is always white is the rochet. The rochet is a white, vest-like garment made of linen or lace that is worn over the cassock by high-ranking clergy members, such as bishops, archbishops, and cardinals in the Roman Catholic Church. The rochet is distinctive for its wide sleeves that are typically gathered at the wrist, and it is often adorned with lace or intricate embroidery. As part of the cardinal's vesture, the rochet is significant because it symbolizes purity and the commitment to serve the Church with dedication and humility. It is worn beneath the choir dress ensemble, which consists of additional items such as the cassock, mozzetta, and biretta. While the cassock, mozzetta, and biretta are typically made in scarlet to signify the status and rank of the cardinals, the rochet remains white to represent their spiritual connection and devotion.

A pub owner has riled gun enthusiasts by putting up a sign in his window banning firearms from the establishment and calling those who carry them 'losers'. The owner of the Backstreets Pub and Deli in Clemson, South Carolina, put up his potentially provocative handmade sign around St Patrick's Day. The full notice read: 'No concealed weapons allowed. 'If you are such a loser that you feel a need to carry a gun with you when you go out, I do not want your business. D****bag.' A South Carolina bar owner put this sign up in his bar - causing outrage among gun advocates. The sign was photographed by one upset drinker who uploaded it online - and it subsequently went viral. Previously, the bar and restaurant averaged three out of five stars on Yelp. It also had mainly positive reviews on its Facebook page. But after the sign was spotted by gun advocates online, that rating has nosedived. Now the bar has over 300 reviews - it previously only had three - by people who allegedly found the pub had 'bad service' and was 'overpriced'. One of the users even posted on the pub's Facebook page claiming she: 'Threw my guts up for three days straight after eating the wings.' Another user, Bill Mallett, said: 'Not very good food... very bad service.. the kind of place you see on those restaurant fix it shows. Would not recommend.

The council replaced the Fifa executive committee in the aftermath of a corruption scandal at the organisation. Committees had been \\"deprived of their independence\\", said Scala. Fifa said the Swiss \\"has made unfounded claims which are baseless\\". Scala says he is \\"consternated\\" by a decision that makes it possible for the council to \\"impede\\" investigations by either dismissing committee members or \\"through the threat of a dismissal\\". This, he added, \\"undermines a central pillar of the good governance of Fifa and destroys a substantial achievement of the reforms\\". \\"[This is] a wake-up call to those persons who genuinely advocated for implementing reforms,\\" he said. Fifa, which accepted Scala's resignation and installed his deputy Sindi Mabaso Koyana as acting chairman, insists the Swiss has \\"misinterpreted the purpose of the decision taken\\" by its congress. It added in a statement: \\"The decision was made to permit the council to appoint members on an interim basis. \\"In addition, the measure allows for the swift removal of members who have breached their obligations. \\"The council fully respects the independence of the audit and compliance and the ethics committees, and any suggestions to the contrary are without merit.\\" Scala has played a key role in pushing through reforms after the scandals that prompted the departures of former Fifa president Sepp Blatter and Uefa counterpart Michel Platini. Blatter, who had led Fifa since 1998, stood down last year and was later suspended from football for six years for breaching ethics guidelines. Platini announced earlier this week he would be stepping down after failing to have a six-year ban from football overturned by a Court of Arbitration for Sport panel. The first Fifa congress led by new president Gianni Infantino, who succeeded Blatter in February, took place in Mexico City on Thursday and Friday. During the congress, Fifa elected its first female secretary general with the appointment of Senegal's Fatma Samba Diouf Samoura. She succeeds Jerome Valcke, who in February was banned from football-related activity for 12 years. BBC sports editor Dan Roan \\"This is the last thing Gianni Infantino needed less than three months into his presidency. \\"Domenico Scala has established himself as the architect of Fifa's crucial reform programme and his decision to quit is a severe blow to the new leadership's attempts to show the organisation has learned from the corruption crisis that led to Infantino's election, and is finally serious about improving its governance. \\"Scala is furious a surprise vote on Friday at the Fifa congress in Mexico City means he and other key corruption watchdogs who chair independent committees are now able to be sacked by the new-look Fifa council. \\"This body was meant to be a less powerful version of the infamous executive committee it replaced, but the measure has actually given it even more clout than before. \\"Some observers were already surprised at the way Infantino drove through the appointment of a new secretary general with little consultation.

Meanwhile, supporters of President Maduro marched in the capital Caracas. They called for an end to months of opposition protests and unrest. More than 100 people have died in the protests against the failing economy and what the opposition sees as the government's illegal attempts to cling to power. The hacked sites included the Venezuelan government, the National Electoral Council and the Venezuelan navy. A message on the main government site made reference to \\"Operation David\\", which Venezuelan media had reported was the codename of the attack in Valencia. \\"This dictatorship has its days numbered,\\" it added. The government said it had repelled the attack in Valencia, which was carried out by a group of armed civilians led by a military deserter. A search was under way for 10 men who escaped with weapons after the attack, Mr Maduro said. The assault in the north-western city of Valencia was carried out by 20 people, the president said. Two were killed, one was injured and seven were arrested. Earlier, a video posted on social media showed uniformed men saying they were rising against a \\"murderous tyranny\\". On state television, Mr Maduro congratulated the army for its \\"immediate reaction\\" in putting down the attack in the early hours of Sunday, saying they had earned his \\"admiration.\\" He called the incident a \\"terrorist attack\\" carried out by \\"mercenaries\\", and said the security forces were actively searching for those who had escaped. \\"We'll get them,\\" he vowed. The government said that those arrested included a first lieutenant who had deserted. It said the others were civilians wearing uniforms. Mr Maduro said the group had been backed by anti-government leaders based in the US and Colombia.

Instead, they want to know things like “How do I keep my mother from falling?” or “What should I do? My grandfather’s been falling.” After all, falls are a scary thing. Most people know that falls are dangerous for older adults. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that one in five falls causes a serious injury such as a broken bone or head injury. Fear of falling can also seriously affect an aging adult’s quality of life and sadly, can keep a person from being active and thriving. So, many seniors and family caregivers are interested in fall prevention because the risks are so great. And the good news is that although it’s not possible to prevent all falls, it almost always IS possible to take actions that will reduce the chance of a bad fall. If you want to learn more, you’re in the right place. In this post, I’ll cover: * How understanding why aging adults fall can help you keep an older parent — or yourself — safer, * Why personalized fall prevention plans work better than relying on general fall prevention tips, * The four-step process I use to help older adults prevent falls, * A practical example showing you how to use these steps to avoid falls yourself. First, understand why older people fall There are many reasons that aging adults fall. Most older people will be falling due to their own unique combination of reasons. So how, exactly, should YOU go about reducing fall risk? Now, you can — and should — try to implement the general tips that are often listed in most fall prevention resources: exercise, medication review with the doctor, vision checks, and home safety reviews. But if you really want to help an older loved one avoid falls, I recommend you learn to better understand why he or she, in particular, might fall. Who reported that one in five falls causes a serious injury? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. the CDC (the Center for Disease Control) B. the American Cancer Society C. the American Heart Association D. not enough information Answer:","output":"A. the CDC (the Center for Disease Control)"},{"instruction":"Given the question: I can use this background: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: Now, I have a new situation: Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth.

Associated Press. A Washington state grandmother could lose an eye after she bravely rescued her grandson who was being viciously attacked by an otter as he swam in a river on Thursday. Roxane Leilani Grove's grandmotherly instinct kicked in as soon as she heard the screams of her 8-year-old grandson, Bryce Moser, and then saw the horrible sight of an otter biting him aggressively in a swimming hole in the Pilchuck River - about 30 miles northeast of Seattle. 'I could see that it was biting into his head and it had its claws around him,' Grove told KOMO News. Scroll down for video. Attacked: Roxane Leilani Grove and her grandson Bryce Moser, left, with their injuries from an otter attack at Pilchuck River, Washington. 'I just. swam out there and I grabbed the claws to pull it off of him. 'I just remember trying to hold it as tight as I can and yelling \\"Get. him out of the water!

'It just started biting on me and biting on me and it felt like little knives just going in,' Grove told the TV station. The. pair were taken to a hospital where Grove reportedly received hundreds. of stitches to her face and head as well as the eye injury and Bryce. received nine staples in his head. State. and federal wildlife agents in Washington are trying to trap the otter. and it will likely be killed unless it is a female with pups, because it. has pounced on people, said Capt. Alan Myers of the Washington. Department of Fish and Wildlife. 'We're doing everything possible to capture than animal as soon as possible,' Myers said Friday. 'This is an extremely rare incident. Otters are not known to be aggressive toward people.' The boy's mother, Tabitha Moser, saw the four-foot otter attack her son and her mother saved him. A state worker was unable to find the otter, so expert trappers were called in from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services, Myers said. They'll try to trap it with a foot snare or tranquilize it. 'We're not sure if it's a hyper-aggressive male protecting territory or a female protecting its young,' Myers said. An eight-year-old boy and his grandmother were attacked by an otter in Washington's Pilchuck River. 'There's a lot of liability in trying to relocate an animal that's been hyper-aggressive, and it would likely be euthanized. If it's a female with pups, there's another possible outcome if we can find a good location.' But the otter would have to be killed in any case so its brain could be tested for rabies, if that's a concern for doctors treating the boy and his grandmother, he said. 'There are no known cases of otter rabies in Washington,; he said. 'That's an extremely remote possibility.' The grandmother was treated at Harborview. Medical Center in Seattle and the boy at Providence Medical Center in. Everett, the boy's mother, Tabitha Moser told KING.

He was just bobbing up and down in the water and as he came up there was something all the way on top of his head,' she told KING. The otter continued to attack as they left the water. 'Even after it got into the river and out of our way it stood on its hind legs looking at us like, 'Don't do it again; don't come in here,'' she told KING.

To make matters worse for Michael, Murdock, portrayed as the stereotyped insensitive corporate boss, threatens to terminate his employment if the exploration does not produce results. The next day, Michael returns to his office, where he is met by Santa Claus's chief elf Ed. Ed informs Baldwin that their dynamiting is causing damage to North Pole City, the home of Santa Claus and his elves.

Pick your answer from: a). no; b). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: The northeast part of India is called Seven Sisters because there are seven states in that region. They are like sisters because they all share some things in common, like their mountains, rivers, and forests, but each state also has its own unique features, like different tribes and languages. Imagine it this way: seven sisters are members of the same family, but each of them is special in her own way. Question 2: There are many tribes in Northeast India, more than 200! These tribes have their own languages, cultures, and traditions. Just like a big family gathering where everyone wears their special clothes and shares their favorite foods, the tribes in Northeast India also have their very own ways to express and celebrate their uniqueness. To answer your last question, the answer to these two questions is not the same because the questions are about different things. The first question is about why the region is called Seven Sisters, and the second question is about how many tribes are in Northeast India.

France and Cameroon suspect the Nigerian militant group Boko Haram. The kidnapping raises fears of retaliation for French military action in Mali.","output":"Title: French Esclates Probe into Alleged Kidnapping; Boko Haram Suspected On emerging news from France, it has been reported that French gendarmes have been urgently dispatched to an identified abduction site. The action comes subsequent to the recent kidnapping incident which has sent shockwaves both locally and internationally. This piece of information, as per exclusive reports from a CNN affiliate, showcases the gravity of the situation. To address this alarming security issue, the French authorities have mobilized their forces without any delay. This swift response is essential in the pursuit of the kidnappers and the safe retrieval of the victims, and it implies the country's commitment to the safety and security of its inhabitants. Furthermore, the involvement of the gendarmes, a military component with civilian duties, highlights the overlap of military and civilian operations in fighting crime, suggesting the serious implications of the situation. Simultaneously, initial suspicion regarding the identity of the perpetrators has fallen on the infamous Nigerian militant group, Boko Haram. Both France and Cameroon, where the kidnapping reportedly took place, are involved in the investigation of this notorious group. The reasoning behind these suspicions has not been explicitly shared but it may have connections to the group's history of grievous terror activities spread over a significant part of West Africa. The recent kidnapping incident has incited profound concerns among the international community, but there are fears that this could potentially escalate into a wave of retaliatory attacks, triggered by the French military involvement in Mali. The French intervention in Mali, a West African country grappling with an Islamist threat, has indubitably created severe geopolitical tensions in the region. It is feared that this public kidnapping could be a backlash against the French military’s anti-terrorist interventions, reflecting the militant group's notorious modus operandi. In conclusion, this rapidly evolving situation in France underscores the intricate web of international security concerns at play. As French gendarmes intensify their effort to rescue the victims and thwart any further incidents under the shadow of suspicion cast upon Boko Haram, the world watches apprehensively. The profound implications of this incident underpin the wider fear of retaliations against French military actions in Mali and present an urgent demand for unified, international responses against acts of terrorism. This article encapsulates the most recent elements of the situation as it stands. As the French gendarmes delve deeper into the investigation, with the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram standing as the prime suspect, the international community awaits developments, ever mindful of the rising fear of retaliatory consequences stemming from the French military's actions in Mali."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Epigenetic alterations in human cancers include global DNA hypomethylation,gene hypomethylation and promoter hypermethylation, and loss of imprinting (LOI) of the insulin-like growth factor-II gene (IGF2). A mechanism for LOI described previously is hypermethylation of a differentially methylated region (DMR) upstream of the H19 gene, allowing activation of the normally silent maternal allele of IGF2. Here we show that this mechanism does not apply to colorectal cancers, which show hypomethylation of the H19 DMR as well as a DMR upstream of exon 3 of IGF2. This hypomethylation is found in both colorectal cancers and normal mucosa from the same patients, and in cell lines with somatic cell knockout of DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B. These data suggest that hypomethylation is a mechanism for LOI, that the popular IGF2-H19 enhancer competition model for IGF2 imprinting does not apply to the human colon, and that an alternative model for LOI would involve a transcriptional repressor acting on the normally silent maternal allele of IGF2.","output":"\\"Exploring Epigenetic Alterations: Hypomethylation Mechanism for LOI and its Role in Colorectal Cancers\\""},{"instruction":"Can we conclude from \\"In the foreground of a busy street scene filled with people wearing aqua colored shirts.\\" that \\"An asian man wearing a black ball cap plays guitar in front of a microphone while an asian woman wearing a gray floppy hat stands next to him and in front of her own microphone while holding a guitar.\\"?

Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person David encouraged to write more songs for the band?, what is it ?

He served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Sedgefield for over 24 years, from 1983 until 2007. Anthony Charles Lynton Blair, more commonly known as Tony Blair, was first elected MP for Sedgefield for the Labour Party in the 1983 general election. This event marked the beginning of Blair's political career in the British parliament. Sedgefield is a mainly rural constituency located in the northeast of England. Prior to becoming the leader of the Labour Party and eventually the Prime Minister, Blair held a few other political positions during his career. For example, he served as the Shadow Home Secretary from 1992 to 1994. In 1994, following the sudden death of the then Labour leader John Smith, Blair was elected as the Leader of the Labour Party. During his leadership, Blair moved the Labour Party towards the centre of British politics, in what came to be known as \\"New Labour\\". His party won the 1997 general election in a landslide victory, and Tony Blair, at 43, became the youngest Prime Minister since 1812. He went on to be re-elected in both 2001 and 2005, making him the Labour Party’s longest-serving prime minister. Throughout his term as an MP and his time as Prime Minister, Blair represented the interests of the people of Sedgefield in the House of Commons. After leading the Labour Party to three successive election victories, Blair resigned as the Prime Minister and as the MP for Sedgefield in June 2007. After Blair's resignation, a by-election was held to fill the MP seat for Sedgefield. This was won by Phil Wilson, another member of the Labour Party. Despite Blair's representation of Sedgefield ending in 2007, his influence on both his constituency and the broader political landscape in the United Kingdom has been lasting and significant."},{"instruction":"When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

They even said they'd love to come back, so they must've liked it a lot! A) negative is not the right answer because there isn't anything in the review that shows the person didn't like the place.

Experts say Yemen is going to be the first country in the world to run out of water.The capital, Sanaa, will run out of drinking water as early as 2025,says a report by the World Bank. Hannan, an 18yearold from Lahej, said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply.\\"In a good week we'll have a water supply all week but then the following week there will be water only for a day or two, \\" she said. She and her husband, a factory worker, pay 3,000 riyals (99yuan) for a week's supply of water from a touring water truck when the taps run dry.With an income of only 20,000 riyals (660yuan) a month,this means the family often spend half their money on water. \\"There are a lot of people who can't afford it and they have to rely on their neighbors to help,\\" she said. The average person in Yemen survives on onefifth of what the World Health Organization considers to be enough water. In Taiz, in the south,tap water is available only once every 45 days.In the mountainous Malhan district in the north,women and children climb a 1,500m mountain to collect water from a spring, often in the small hours to avoid long queues. Yemen is located in Southwest Asia,bordering the Arabian and Red Sea.Yemeni people have lived on scarce water supplies for thousands of years but that problem has been made serious by conflict in the area,the fastgrowing population and the use of water to grow a drug called qat.With one of the world's highest rates of population growth--3.46 percent, Yemen is the poorest Arab country. The government is considering desalinating seawater,but this would be expensive and it may now be too late.The only other solution is to cut down on farming, but that means importing even more food. When Hannan said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply,she meant that _ . A) rich people drank more water than the poor B) rich people could buy water from the water trucks if there was a water supply cut C) she had a rich neighbor who often helped her during water supply cuts D) the rich were not affected by water supply cuts Answer:","output":"When Hannan said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply, she meant that B) rich people could buy water from the water trucks if there was a water supply cut. This is because those with more financial resources can afford to purchase water at a higher cost, and are able to ensure they have access to water even when supplies are scarce. In contrast, people with lesser means struggle to afford water during such times and may have to rely on the help of their neighbors or other forms of assistance."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: - Coal is mined out of the ground - Coal is pulverized into fine powder - The coal is mixed with hot air - The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler - The coal and hot air burn over a fire - Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler - The water turns into steam - The steam presses against turbines - The turbines spin The answer is:","output":"The final step of the given process is the generation and transmission of electricity from the spinning turbines. To elaborate, when the steam presses against the turbines in the process, it causes the turbines to spin at high speeds. These spinning turbines are connected to a generator, which is essentially a large electromagnet. As the turbines rotate, they cause the generator to rotate as well, creating mechanical energy. This mechanical energy is then converted into electrical energy inside the generator. The generator's primary component is a rotor that consists of large electro-magnets that move within a stationary coil of wires, also known as the stator. This motion creates a magnetic field, which in turn induces an electric current in the stator's wire coils. The electrical energy generated is then stepped up in voltage using transformers to reduce energy loss during transmission. After the transformation, the electricity is sent through power lines to substations, where the voltage is adjusted according to the requirements of different areas, such as residential or industrial zones. Finally, the electric power is distributed to consumers through local power grids, providing them with the energy needed to power various appliances and systems in homes, businesses, and infrastructure. In summary, the final step of the given process involves converting the mechanical energy generated by the spinning turbines into electrical energy, transforming and transmitting that energy through power lines, and distributing it to consumers and other end-users."},{"instruction":"Děti, večeře bude za půl hoďky. Which language is this?","output":"The language used in this sentence is Czech. Czech is a West Slavic language spoken mainly in the Czech Republic but can also be found in Slovak communities and other countries with a significant Czech populace. It is closely related to the Slovak language and bears some similarities with Polish and Sorbian languages. The sentence \\"Děti, večeře bude za půl hoďky.\\" translates to \\"Children, dinner will be ready in half an hour.\\" in English. The structure and vocabulary of the Czech language may be quite different from English, but it has a rich history and cultural significance. The Czech language uses the Latin alphabet with several additional diacritical marks or accents, such as the háček (ˇ) and the kroužek (˚), which denote variations in pronunciation. The Czech language also has its own unique set of phonemes and grammar rules. Czech originated from the Proto-Slavic language and began to emerge as a distinct language in the 9th and 10th centuries, during the early stages of the Great Moravian Empire. At that time, the Old Church Slavonic was also becoming widely used and had a strong influence on the development of the Old Czech. The modern Czech language has been heavily influenced by several historical periods, such as the Hussite Movement in the early 15th century, which led to efforts to standardize the Czech language. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Czech National Revival movement significantly influenced the language and literary culture, leading to the standardization of Modern Czech. Today, the Czech language is taught and spoken by millions worldwide. It is recognized as an official language not only in the Czech Republic but also in the European Union."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence based on this summary: who criticizes amnesty report into nkorea health","output":"In response to the recent Amnesty report investigating North Korea's healthcare system, the North Korean government vehemently criticizes the findings and accuses Amnesty of biased and unfounded allegations.

Ned got infected with HIV because they re-used a needle. His friend Nate was not infected. Which colleague didn't have a virus that is transmitted by contact with infected breast milk? Hint: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/ . A:","output":"Based on the provided information, it is evident that Nate is the colleague who didn't have a virus that is transmitted by contact with infected breast milk. In this scenario, both Ned and Nate gave blood for an emergency. Unfortunately, Ned got infected with HIV due to the re-use of a needle. On the other hand, Nate remained uninfected. As mentioned, HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is transmitted via contact with infected bodily fluids such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. Considering that Nate was not infected with HIV, it can be concluded that he didn't have the virus that could be transmitted through contact with infected breast milk. The HIV pandemic has had a significant impact on global public health, with millions of people affected worldwide. Raising awareness about the virus, its transmission methods, and preventive measures is crucial to curbing its spread. This includes promoting safe practices such as using sterile needles during medical procedures, encouraging protected sex, and ensuring proper screening of blood products. To recap, in response to the question, Nate is the colleague who didn't have a virus that is transmitted by contact with infected breast milk, as he did not contract HIV during the blood donation incident. For more information on HIV/AIDS, resources from health organizations such as the CDC can provide valuable insights and up-to-date information."},{"instruction":"Translate to Turkish: On 10 April, NATO Secretary General George Robertson said that a common command and control were \\"absolute prerequisites\\" for BiH to join the Partnership for Peace programme.

State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people. - A business (also known as an enterprise, a company or a firm) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers. Businesses as a form of economic activity are prevalent in capitalist economies, where most of them are privately owned and provide goods and services to customers in exchange for other goods, services, or money. Businesses may also be social non-profit enterprises or state-owned public enterprises charged by governments with specific social and economic objectives. A business owned by multiple individuals may form as an incorporated company or jointly organise as a partnership. Countries have different laws that may ascribe different rights to the various business entities. - Forbes is an American business magazine. Published bi-weekly, it features original articles on finance, industry, investing, and marketing topics. \\"Forbes\\" also reports on related subjects such as technology, communications, science, and law. Its headquarters is located in Jersey City, New Jersey. Primary competitors in the national business magazine category include \\"Fortune\\" and \\"Bloomberg Businessweek\\". The magazine is well known for its lists and rankings, including its lists of the richest Americans (the Forbes 400) and rankings of world's top companies (the Forbes Global 2000). Another well-known list by the magazine is the The World's Billionaires list. - The following is a Forbes list of Chinese billionaires ( converted into USD ) is based on an annual assessment of wealth and assets compiled and published by Forbes magazine on March 2 , 2015 . In 2015 China has over 200 billionaires which puts the country second in the world , after the United States . - Industry is the production of goods or related services within an economy. The major source of revenue of a group or company is the indicator of its relevant industry. When a large group has multiple sources of revenue generation, it is considered to be working in different industries. Manufacturing industry became a key sector of production and labour in European and North American countries during the Industrial Revolution, upsetting previous mercantile and feudal economies. This came through many successive rapid advances in technology, such as the production of steel and coal. - Finance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance. - The Forbes 400 or 400 Richest Americans (first published in 1982) is a list published by \\"Forbes\\" magazine of the wealthiest 400 Americans, ranked by net worth. The list is published annually in September, and 2011 marked the 30th issue. The 400 was started by Malcolm Forbes in 1982. Peter W. Bernstein and Annalyn Swan describe the Forbes 400 as capturing \\"a period of extraordinary individual and entrepreneurial energy, a time unlike the extended postwar years, from 1945 to 1982, when American society emphasized the power of corporations.\\" Bernstein and Swan also describe it as representing \\"a powerful argument and sometimes a dream about the social value of wealth in contemporary America.\\" - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores. - Bloomberg Businessweek is an American weekly business magazine published by Bloomberg L.P. \\"Businessweek\\" was founded in 1929, the magazine was created to provide information and interpretation about what was happening in the business world. It is headquartered in New York City. Megan Murphy was appointed editor of the magazine in November 2016. - A billionaire, in countries that use the short scale number naming system, is a person with a net worth of at least one billion (1,000,000,000; a thousand million) units of a given currency, usually major currencies such as the United States dollar, the euro, or the pound sterling. The American business magazine \\"Forbes\\" produces a complete global list of known U.S. dollar billionaires every year, and updates an Internet version of this list in real time. The American oil magnate John D.

The rationale for choosing \\"nature preserve\\" as the answer lies in its purpose, management techniques, and conservation goals. 1. Purpose: Nature preserves are designated areas specifically aimed at protecting and preserving wildlife, including various species of animals, plants, and ecosystems. They serve as safe havens for vulnerable or threatened species like the bald eagle, ensuring their survival and well-being. 2. Management Techniques: Nature preserves are managed through a combination of habitat conservation, strict regulations, monitoring, and public education. Activities like hunting, land development, and resource exploitation are typically restricted or regulated to ensure the least disturbance to resident wildlife populations. This creates a stable environment for the conservation of species like the bald eagle. 3. Conservation Goals: Nature preserves have a primary goal of preserving biodiversity and maintaining ecological integrity. By focusing on these goals, they contribute significantly to the conservation of species like the bald eagle. On the other hand, farms, soups, and mountainous areas are not specifically designed for wildlife protection, and their primary purposes do not necessarily align with conserving endangered species. Additionally, while Canada does have protected areas for wildlife, it is a country and not a specific place dedicated to animal protection like a nature preserve would be."},{"instruction":"Q: Is the following sentence factually correct? \\"The musical group Cicadas is touring next spring.\\" Options: - yes - no Chain-of-thought:","output":"1.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less trees around happens, how will it affect more rising trees provide shelter. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"A decrease in the number of trees within an ecosystem can affect the natural process of forest formation, as well as the overall health of the ecosystem, through direct and indirect effects. A: Direct effects of the perturbation: 1. Less Organic Matter: With fewer trees, there is less dead material available to decay and release vital nutrients for the growth of new trees. This can slow down the regeneration process and hinder the establishment of a healthy forest. 2. Reduced Shelter: The presence of fewer trees means that there is less shelter provided for various organisms, which can lower species diversity and population densities, negatively impacting the overall health of the ecosystem. 3. Altered Microclimate: Trees play a critical role in maintaining a suitable microclimate for other organisms by providing shade, temperature regulation, and moisture retention. With fewer trees, these conditions can become less favorable, making it harder for some species to survive and potentially preventing the forest from recovering. B: Indirect effects of the perturbation: 1. Soil Erosion and Loss of Nutrients: With less vegetation, there is a higher likelihood of soil erosion due to wind and rain, which can lead to nutrient loss in the soil, making it less fertile for the establishment of new trees. 2. Invasion by Weedy Species: The decline in tree density can create open niches for opportunistic species to establish themselves. These species can compete with or hinder the growth of native trees and affect overall ecosystem dynamics. 3. Disruption of Ecological Relationships: The reduced number of trees can affect the ecosystem's complex network of interactions among living organisms, such as plant-animal pollination and seed dispersal mechanisms. This disruption can impede forest succession and change the overall community composition. 4. Changes in Hydrological Cycles: Trees significantly contribute to the hydrological cycle by intercepting rainfall, reducing evaporation, and increasing infiltration. A lack of trees can affect the water cycle in the area, potentially leading to changes in water availability for the local environment. In summary, the perturbation of having fewer trees around can directly and indirectly impact the process of forest formation and the ecosystem's health. Lower tree density can lead to reduced organic matter input, inadequate shelter, altered microclimate, soil erosion, invasion by weedy species, disruption of ecological interactions, and changes in the hydrological cycle, potentially slowing down or impairing the development of a healthy and diverse forest ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Solve 30*w = 29*w + 101*w + 1500 for w..

Article: The death of languages is not a new phenomenon. Languages usually have a relatively short life span as well as a very high death rate. Only a few, including Egyptian, Chinese, Greek, Latin, have lasted more than 2,000 years. What is new, however, is the speed at which they are dying out. Europe's colonial conquests caused a sharp decline in linguistic diversity, eliminating at least 15 percent of all languages spoken at the time. Over the last 300 years, Europe has lost a dozen, and Australia has only 20 left of the 250 spoken at the end of the 18th century. The rise of nation-states has also been decisive in selecting and consolidating national languages and sidelining others. By making great efforts to establish an official language in education, the media and the civil service, national governments have deliberately tried to eliminate minority languages. This process of linguistic standardization has been boosted by industrialization and scientific progress, which have imposed new methods of communication that are swift, straightforward and practical. Language diversity came to be seen as an obstacle to trade and the spread of knowledge. Monolingualism became an ideal. More recently, the internationalization of financial markets, the spread of information by electronic media and other aspects of globalization have intensified the threat to \\"small\\" languages. A language not on the Internet is a language that \\"no longer exists\\" in the modern world. It is out of the game. The serious effects of the death of languages are evident. First of all, it is possible that if we all ended up speaking the same language, our brains would lose some of their natural capacity for linguistic inventiveness. We would never be able to figure out the origins of human language or resolve the mystery of \\"the first language\\". As each language dies, a chapter of human history closes. Multilingualism is the most accurate reflection of multiculturalism. The destruction of the first will inevitably lead to the loss of the second.... Question: The serious effects of the death of languages include all except that _ . Answer: Answer:","output":"The serious effects of the death of languages include all except that monolingualism becomes an ideal. In fact, monolingualism is one of the factors contributing to the death of languages. The article mentions that language diversity came to be seen as an obstacle to trade and the spread of knowledge, which led to the preference for monolingualism. This focus on a single language has contributed to the decline of minority languages and the overall loss of linguistic diversity. The serious effects of the death of languages highlighted in the article mainly focus on the loss of natural capacity for linguistic inventiveness, challenges in figuring out the origins of human language, and the loss of multiculturalism as a result of the decline of multilingualism."},{"instruction":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What are the human organs that are unneccesary to insects?\\" is in \\"Insect respiration is accomplished without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart.

Connect the basket: The basket is the part where people will stand during the ride. We attach it to the bottom of the envelope using strong ropes. 5. Use a powerful fan: This fan blows lots of air into the envelope as it's still on the ground. This is just like when you blow up a balloon with your mouth, but it's much bigger! 6. Fill the balloon with hot air: Now, we use a special fire machine called a \\"burner\\" to heat the air inside the balloon. The burner makes a big flame that heats the air and makes it lighter than the air outside. And when air is hot and lighter, it makes the hot air balloon rise! 7. Double-check everything: Before we get into the basket, we make sure everything is safe and ready for us to fly. 8. Hop in the basket and fly: Once everything's ready, we step into the basket and our hot air balloon starts to float up in the sky! 9. Enjoy the ride: We can see beautiful views from high up in the sky, and when it's time to come down, the person controlling the hot air balloon gently lets out some hot air, making us float back to the ground. 10. Safely land and pack up: After our wonderful ride, we pack up the balloon and go back home with a big smile on our faces!"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Two days after the events of the first film, a traumatized and blood-covered Sarah escapes the cave with no memory of the events. She is taken to a hospital, where it is found that some of the blood on her belongs to Juno Kaplan. Sheriff Vaines takes his deputy Elen Rios, Sarah, and three spelunking specialists – Dan, Greg, and Cath – to the cave to find the missing women. The team members are sent down via an old mine shaft operated by the old, mysterious Ed Oswald. The group discovers Rebecca's mutilated body, causing Sarah to have flashbacks of the crawlers and causing Vaines to believe Sarah may be responsible for the girls' disappearance. While crawling through a tunnel, she attacks Vaines and the others, causing the others to split up. Vaines runs to search for Sarah, and in the process is surprised by a crawler, and fires his gun in a panic, causing a minor collapse in the cavern which traps Cath, separating her from Rios, Dan, and Greg. The three decide to find an alternate way around in order to try to free Cath and arrive in a room full of bones, where they find Holly's video camera. They watch it and realize the women were attacked by the crawlers. The three are then themselves attacked by crawlers and separated. Rios starts calling for help, alerting the crawlers to her location, but is rescued by Sarah. The two then watch as a crawler kills Dan and drags his body away, prompting Sarah to inform Rios that the crawlers are blind and hunt via sound. After escaping from and killing a crawler, Cath finds Greg before the two escape from another crawler and find Sam's body. They decide to try to use her to swing across a chasm, but are attacked again. Greg sacrifices himself to buy time for Cath, but she ultimately does not survive. Guess a valid title for it!

This was due to Pick your answer from: (A). Logan needing transportation to the city. (B). Derrick needing transportation to the city.","output":"This was due to Logan needing transportation to the city. Unlike Derrick, Logan had a great interest in cars and spent a considerable amount of time learning about different makes and models, as well as their performance capabilities. For him, there was a certain beauty in the engineering and design of vehicles, and he found the thrill of driving exhilarating. The fact that he required transportation to the city only fueled his passion for cars further. Whether it was the practicality of commuting to work, visiting friends, or attending events in the bustling urban environment, Logan's need for reliable and efficient transportation was a significant driving factor in his enthusiasm for automobiles. He would spend time researching vehicle specifications, ensuring that his car met his requirements for performance, fuel efficiency, and style. On the other hand, Derrick couldn't care less about cars and their specifications. Whether it was due to a lack of interest, environmental concerns, or simply having different priorities in life, the world of automobiles didn't spark excitement in him. For Derrick, there were other means of transportation to the city such as public transit, cycling, or even walking that met his personal preferences and needs. Perhaps Derrick found the city itself, with its vibrant culture and diverse opportunities, far more fascinating than the vehicles that transported people to and from it. He may have prioritized other aspects of his life, such as developing close relationships, pursuing an engaging career or hobby, or seeking out new experiences in novel places. Alternatively, Derrick may have been more drawn to environmentally friendly modes of transportation like biking, walking, or carpooling, reflecting his commitment to sustainability. Ultimately, Logan and Derrick's contrasting attitudes towards cars illustrate the spectrum of human interests and lifestyles. Logan's passion for cars emerged from a combination of personal preference and practical necessity, whereas Derrick's lack of interest reflected a different set of values and priorities in his life. These contrasting perspectives showcase the diverse range of human values, experiences, and motivations that contribute to a rich and multifaceted world."},{"instruction":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Portuguese.

George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. Now, I have a new situation: Mike was visiting the African Savannah. One animal that interested him most was the African Buffalo. He noticed that the buffaloes would usually live in a large herd, often exceeding few hundreds. He noted that as case A. But sometimes the buffaloes would live in a small herd. He noted that as case B. Interestingly, there are incidents when an aggressive male buffalo would live by itself. He noted that as case C. Answer this question please: In which case the group would get less benefit as a whole, case A or case B? A:","output":"In order to answer this question, let's consider the dilution effect and its impact on the risk faced by the African Buffaloes in case A and case B. Case A (Large Herd): In a large herd, the buffaloes will \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, as each individual is just one out of many. The large group size will reduce the probability of any individual buffalo being targeted, hence, providing a greater benefit to each individual member. However, the group as a whole may become more conspicuous and attract more attention from predators. Case B (Small Herd): In a small herd, the dilution effect will be weaker, as the risk of attack won't be distributed among as many members. The group would be less conspicuous, but an individual buffalo's chance of being targeted by predators would be relatively higher in comparison to a larger herd. Based on the dilution effect, less benefit to a group as a whole is observed in case B (Small Herd) compared to case A (Large Herd). The reason for this is that a larger herd (case A) provides greater protection to its individual members through risk dilution, while a smaller herd (case B) offers less protection to the individual members due to the weaker dilution effect."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: This article: After a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here. Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as \\"falling within a difficult period\\" and Waters found them \\"tortuous\\". Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: \\"Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.\\"While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio. Thorgerson recalled that he \\"sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there\\". He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth. Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the band member who was upset when a past band member visited the studio and no one initially recognized him?, what is it ?

Some composers, like Dvořák and Smetana, have used folk themes to impart a nationalist flavor to their work, while others like Bartók have used specific themes lifted whole from their folk-music origins. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Folk musicians are not commonly what?","output":"Folk musicians are not commonly classically trained. This aspect of folk musicians plays a significant role in the characteristics and development of folk music itself, as well as its influence on classical music composers. Folk music arises mainly from oral traditions and is deeply rooted in the cultural and ethnic identity of a particular region or community. The music usually reflects the experiences, emotions, and historical stories of the people belonging to that region. Given its nature, folk music often evolves through generations as it is passed down, acquiring new elements, and reflecting the changing circumstances of the community. Folk musicians typically learn their craft through informal settings such as family gatherings, community events, and informal mentoring. They often play traditional instruments that are native to their culture and use them to perform music which may include elements such as improvisation and variations on existing themes. The lack of formal training in folk musicians presents a stark contrast to the structured education and technical prowess found in classically trained musicians. The classical music tradition stems from a written notation system, with well-established rules and a rich history of development. Composers who are classically trained generally have profound knowledge of music theory, orchestration, and structure, allowing them to use this foundation to create intricate and nuanced works. Despite the differences between folk and classical music, several composers throughout history have recognized the value of integrating folk elements into classical compositions. Such composers not only pay homage to the cultural roots of their respective nations but also enhance their artistic works with unique textures and melodies. A few examples of these composers include: 1. Antonín Dvořák: A Czech composer known for incorporating folk influences into his compositions, Dvořák's works evoke a strong sense of national pride and identity. Notable examples are his Symphony No. 9 \\"From the New World,\\" which was inspired by African-American spirituals and Native American music, and his Slavonic Dances, which draw upon influences from Slavic folk dances. 2. Bedřich Smetana: Another Czech composer, Smetana used folk themes and dances to infuse his compositions with a sense of national identity. His most famous work, \\"Má vlast,\\" is a cycle of six symphonic poems, each representing an aspect of Czech culture, history, or landscape. 3. Béla Bartók: A Hungarian composer and pianist, Bartók was an avid collector and researcher of his country's folk music. He incorporated these folk influences into numerous compositions, merging them with classical forms to create a unique sound. His Mikrokosmos, a collection of piano exercises, and his series of string quartets are notable examples of this fusion. These composers, among others, demonstrate how the distinctive qualities of folk music, despite its musicians not commonly being classically trained, can be woven into classical compositions, enriching both genres and broadening the scope of musical expression."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following movie reviews: 1.

A romanticised but still truthful look at how difficult it is to cut the ties to the hometown of your childhood and actually strike out on your own... 4. The plot ambles and Gervais and Merchant can't resist neatly tying up every loose end in a manner which strains credibility. Their dramatic crescendo is a mother pouring a cup of tea. 5. Where Cemetery Junction's strength lies is in its depiction of the relationship between three friends. 6. While Remi Adefarasin's cinematography gives the picture a superficially cinematic sheen, this is essentially small-minded fare, unimaginative in its ambitions and clumsy in its execution. 7.

Coming from the Gervais/Merchant stable though, it's a frustrating let-down after past successes. 10. Good looks, cool characters, great music. Gervais and Merchant's film is the most confident British debut since Shallow Grave. Summary:","output":"The collection of movie reviews outlines a variety of perspectives on the film, with indications about its strengths and weaknesses. The film is lauded by some reviewers for its adept writing, solid acting, and appealing depiction of character relationships, particularly the bond between three friends. These strengths suggest that director Gervais, in collaboration with Merchant, has a promising future in filmmaking. The film is also praised for its insightful examination of the challenge of leaving one's hometown to forge an independent path, a theme which is romanticized yet depicted truthfully. Additionally, the cinematography is noted to imbue the film with a desirable cinematic quality. Some reviewers found the film to be good-looking, containing cool characters, and complemented by great music, making it one of the most confident British debuts in their view. However, there are criticisms as well. Some reviewers acknowledge that the film is entertaining but feel it does not hit the heights of comedy or drama it potentially could. They believe the film falls short of its ambition and is unimaginative and clumsy in places. Certain viewers consider the storyline tends to wrap up all loose ends too neatly, affecting believability, with one critic pointing out the dramatic climax involving a character making tea. Critics also take issue with the film's execution, referring to it as small-minded fare and suggesting that it feels less impactful when compared to other films of a similar genre, such as 'An Education'. From the expectations of the Gervais/Merchant collaboration, some find the film a letdown, though it is still seen as passable and mildly diverting. Overall, this summary depicts a film with some promising elements but also areas where the reviewers felt it underperformed or lacked focus."},{"instruction":"Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Adult mushrooms produce spores - Release them into the air by process of sporulation - Spores are carried by the wind - Land in a hospitable growing environment - The spores germinate into the soil - The mushroom starts growing A:","output":"The final step of this process would be: - The development of a mature mushroom cap, allowing it to spread its spores and complete the life cycle.

You can draw the ends of the twine up and match them to be sure the twine is centered. Grasp the twine on each side a couple of inches from the bird and slide it up under both wings until it is snug in the armpits. Be sure the neck flap is covering the hole at the top of the turkey. Draw the twine together across the neck flap, holding it in place. Cross the strings one on top of the other and pull tightly. Pull both sides along the outside of the turkey breast, staying on the inside of the wings and legs. Cross the strings under the bottom of the rib cage and pull the ends tight. Maneuver the twine under the top portion of the turkey legs, or drumsticks. Wrap the twine around back of the leg, then back over the top at the leg joint. Cross the twine, then pull the ends back under the turkey legs. Pull the ends outward to tighten the twine and elevate the legs. This style of trussing will hold the legs straight out from the body of the turkey. This allows the heat to flow around the legs, cooking them more evenly than traditional trussing. The traditional style presses the legs against the body of the bird, cutting off the source of heat to the inside of the leg. Flip the bird on its stomach. Pull the skin flap at the bottom of the bird over the cavity. Wrap the twine around the tail and tie it off in a knot. Trim any excess kitchen twine using kitchen sheers. Cook the turkey on its back with the legs elevated off the pan. The indentations of the twine are helpful guides for carving the cooked turkey.

Trussing helps the turkey cook more evenly by keeping the legs straight and away from the body. The article explains the steps to truss a turkey, like putting the twine under the turkey, wrapping it around the legs and wings, and tying it off. This helps the heat reach all parts of the turkey better, and makes it easier to carve when it's cooked."},{"instruction":"Given the below context: Although Watts's plans for the memorial had envisaged names inscribed on the wall, in the event the memorial was designed to hold panels of hand-painted and glazed ceramic tiles. Watts was an acquaintance of William De Morgan, at that time one of the world's leading tile designers, and consequently found them easier and cheaper to obtain than engraved stone. The four initial memorial tablets, installed for the unveiling, each consisted of two large custom-made tiles, with each tablet costing £3 5s (about £360 as of 2019) to produce. Only four tablets were installed by the time of the unveiling ceremony, and Watts already had concerns about the potential costs of installing the 120 tablets envisaged in the memorial's design.Costs were allayed by using standard 6-inch (15 cm) tiles for the next set of tablets, reducing the costs to a more manageable £2 per tablet. In 1902, nine further tablets were installed, intermittently spaced along the central of the five rows, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had lobbied. The subjects of the 13 initial tiles had been personally selected by Watts, who had for many years maintained a list of newspaper reports of heroic actions potentially worthy of recognition. However, by this time he was in his eighties and in increasingly poor health, and in January 1904 the vicar and churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate formed the Humble Heroes Memorial Committee to oversee the completion of the project, agreeing to defer to Watts regarding additions to the memorial. Watts strenuously objected to the name, as \\"not being applicable to anything as splendid as heroic self-sacrifice\\", and the committee was renamed the \\"Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee\\".On 1 July 1904 George Frederic Watts died at New Little Holland House, aged 87. He was hailed \\"The last great Victorian\\", and a memorial service was held in St Paul's Cathedral, 300 yards (270 m) south of Postman's Park, on 7 July 1904.On 11 July 1904 Mary Watts wrote to the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial...

What is it like to be scammed into being a drug mule, one who unwittingly transports drugs internationally? Do you have any personal anecdotes of yourself or someone you know? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"These two questions are not inquiring about the same information, as they address two distinct topics – exotic hunting trophy shipments and unwitting drug mules. I'll provide detailed answers for each question separately below. 1. Exotic Hunting Trophy Shipments: As an AI assistant, I don't have the capability to introduce regulations or penalties for any topic. However, I can provide information on existing regulations and potential future developments. The transport of exotic hunting trophies into the United States is a controversial issue, with ongoing discussions about the ethics of trophy hunting and its impact on conservation. Regulations have been implemented to control the import of such trophies. The United States currently has laws and regulations in place to govern the import of exotic hunting trophies. Some of these include: - The Endangered Species Act (ESA): This law prohibits the import, export, or interstate sale of listed endangered and threatened species, including their parts, products, and derivatives. - The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES): This international treaty regulates the global trade of animal and plant species that are at risk due to trade, thereby adhering to a strict permit system for the import, export, and re-export of listed species. - The Lacey Act: This law regulates the transport of certain wildlife, plants, and fish across state and international borders. It also prohibits the trade of animals that have been illegally taken, possessed, transported, or sold. Penalties for violating these regulations can include substantial fines, confiscation of the specimens, and even imprisonment. There are ongoing discussions about the potential for stricter regulations and increased penalties for the trade of exotic hunting trophies. Although I cannot predict or create such regulations, it is possible that governments and organizations may implement further measures to limit the import of exotic hunting trophies or increase penalties for those found in violation of the existing legislation. 2. Being Scammed into being a Drug Mule: Being scammed into becoming a drug mule is a harrowing and deeply distressing experience, involving the unwitting transport of illegal drugs across international borders. Individuals who find themselves in this predicament are often exploited by criminal networks through manipulation, deception, or coercion, and they may be exposed to significant legal and personal risks. The experience itself usually involves being lured in by a seemingly innocent job offer, a romantic relationship, or a sob story from a stranger or acquaintance. The victims are typically unaware of the true nature of their task when they agree to transport a package or luggage item. Upon discovering their involvement in drug trafficking – often during a search by customs officials – drug mules typically feel shock, fear, and despair. Detection can lead to severe criminal penalties, including imprisonment or even the death penalty in some jurisdictions. Additionally, there is the potential for physical harm or violence, as criminals can brutally enforce their demands and discourage cooperation with law enforcement. As an AI, I don't have personal experiences or anecdotes. However, there is a well-known example of an Australian woman named Schapelle Corby who was convicted of drug trafficking in Indonesia in 2005. Corby claimed that she was the victim of a drug trafficking scam, with marijuana placed in her unlocked luggage without her knowledge. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison but was granted parole and released in 2014. This case illustrates the very real risks and consequences of being caught up in a drug trafficking scam. In conclusion, these two questions address different subjects – one focuses on the potential changes in regulation regarding exotic hunting trophy shipments, while the other deals with the experience of being scammed into becoming a drug mule. Both issues illustrate the complexities and challenges surrounding international trade and law enforcement, but they are not inquiries about the same information."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"A young man is looking for a ride on a country road.\\" can we conclude that \\"Sitting on a grassy field with a large tree and mansion in the background.\\"?

Äänestys means voting or election, toimitetaan means conducted, huomenna means tomorrow, klo means at, and 12.00 refers to the time in 24-hour format (12:00 PM in 12-hour format). 3.

The homeless man who decided to arm himself with a trolley and stand with police against a terrorist (7News) Trolly man : Michael Rogers has been the silent hero since the Melbourne attack (7News) 2:04 A bystander dubbed “the trolley man” for taking on an armed terrorist with a shopping cart during the deadly terror attack in Melbourne says he is “no hero” as his story comes to light. Michael Rogers, 46, attempted to help police officers stop Hassan Khalif Shire Ali during Friday’s Bourke Street terror attack. One person had already been stabbed to death and another two were injured. Mr Rogers, who is homeless with few possessions, began ramming a shopping trolley into the terrorist in a bid to help. “I threw the trolley straight at him, and I got him. I didn’t quite get him down, though. I’m no hero,” Mr Rogers told Seven News’ Robert Ovadia from the scene of the attack. Mr Ovadia later told the program, “people think he deserves some sort of award for being a hero. He doesn’t see himself necessarily as a hero but believes he did help save lives and defend his city as well.” Subscribe to news.com.au’s From The Newsroom podcast A GoFundMe has since been set up for Mr Rogers, raising 105,130 at time of publication. The fundraiser was created by Melbourne Homeless Collective, a registered charity that supports people experiencing homelessness. “All funds donated to this campaign will go directly to Mr Rogers to help get him back on his feet,” the page reads. “He’s a hero in our eyes and he can do what he feels best with any funds he receives. He risked his own life that day for nothing in return and you can’t put a price on that.” The charity had originally set a goal of 5000 but has since said it will no longer set a target due to the overwhelming amount of support. “We’re absolutely blown away by everyone’s generosity and spirit in helping our hero ‘Trolleyman’ get back on his feet,” the charity said. “We don’t actually have a set target to reach but due to the incredible generosity we’ve seen so far we’ll keep increasing the total accordingly. “We’ve far surpassed our original goal. Let’s aim for the sky. Our hero absolutely deserves it.” The Sunday Herald Sun tracked down Mr Rogers on a park bench, amid a nationwide bid to find the humble hero, just 24 hours after he risked his life to save others. The newspaper reported that Mr Rogers is homeless, but wasn’t concerned when his phone was smashed during the fight, despite not having the means to replace it. Mr Rogers was one of two bystanders who stepped in as the killer tried to claim more victims in the city. Witness footage of the incident uploaded to social media showed Mr Rogers running to one side of the street to get the trolley before pushing it towards Ali who was wielding a knife and lunging at police. A man with a shopping trolley twice tried to ram the man to stop him. Another was wielding a chair. Incredible bravery @theheraldsun pic.twitter.com/w473DKA4wr — Josh Fagan (@faganjosh) November 9, 2018 The trolley appeared to startle Ali before the man who pushed it tripped and fell to the ground. The terrorist then ran across the road, followed by police, as Mr Rogers got up and gave chase, pushing his cart towards the attacker a second time. His actions gained him widespread praise on social media by users who dubbed him “trolley man” and called for him to receive a medal or be made Prime Minister of Australia. Mr Rogers was reportedly unaware of the attention being heaped on him for his actions. One witness said she spoke to Mr Rogers at the scene and he told her his actions were “just instinctive to help the police protect the safety of others”, the Herald Sun reports. Mr Rogers told 7 News that he believes he did help save lives. “I’ve seen the trolley to the side so I’ve picked it up and I ran, threw the trolley straight at him, got him, but didn’t get him down,” he said. “I did that motion quite a number of times but it just wasn’t getting him down.” ⚡️ Melbourne: “I threw the trolley straight at him, and I got him. I didn't quite get him down, though.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Somali-born attacker, from Melbourne’s northwestern suburbs, had violated the nation’s trust. “The greatest threat of religious extremism in this country is the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam,” he said. Mr Morrison said Ali was one of about 400 people on a national ASIO terror watch list. “Here in Australia we would be kidding ourselves if we did not call out the fact that the greatest threat of religious extremism in this country is the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam,” Mr Morrison said. “There is a special responsibility on religious leaders to protect their religious communities and to ensure dangerous teachings and ideologies do not take root here.” In a press conference on Saturday, Victoria Police confirmed Ali had been known to intelligence agencies for years, but he was not being actively monitored prior to the attack. They said his passport was cancelled in 2015 after ASIO determined he was planning to travel to Syria. ||||| Uodate 17/11/2018 We’ve reached our goal!

Their creation of a provisional government based on the 1824 constitution established the General Council as a legislative body with each municipality allotted one representative. Henry Smith was elected governor without any clearly defined powers of the position. Sam Houston was in attendance as the elected representative from Nacogdoches, and also served as commander of the Nacogdoches militia. Edward Burleson replaced Austin as commander of the volunteer army on December 1. On December 10, the General Council called new elections to choose delegates to determine the fate of the region. The Consultation approved the creation of the Provisional Army of Texas, a paid force of 2,500 troops. Houston was named commander-in-chief of the new army and issued a recruitment Proclamation on December 12. The volunteer army under Burleson disbanded on December 20.Harrisburg was designated the seat of a deeply divided provisional government on December 30. Most of the General Council wanted to remain part of Mexico, but with the restoration of the 1824 constitution. Governor Smith supported the opposing faction who advocated for complete independence. Smith dissolved the General Council on January 10, 1836, but it was unclear if he had the power to do that. He was impeached on January 11. The power struggle effectively shut down the government.The Convention of 1836 met at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1.

Choices: - systems - additions - Changes - adaptations A: A:","output":"Adaptations are the characteristics of an organism that help it survive in its environment. Adaptations, in the context of biology and evolution, can be defined as inherited traits or behaviors that increase an organism's chances of survival and reproduction in a specific environment. These adaptations may be structural, physiological, or behavioral. 1. Structural adaptations: These are physical features that have evolved in an organism to enable it to perform specific functions necessary for survival. Examples of structural adaptations include: - Camouflage: Some animals like the chameleon have developed the ability to change their color and blend in with their environment, making it difficult for predators to detect them. - Body shape: Organisms have different body shapes according to their habitat, enabling them to move easily and efficiently. For example, fish have streamlined bodies that allow them to swim effortlessly in water. - Specialized appendages: Many animals have developed specialized appendages that allow them to perform specific tasks, such as grasping, swimming, or digging. For example, birds have beaks that are suited for their specific diet – predators like eagles have sharp, hooked beaks for tearing flesh, while hummingbirds have long, slender beaks for reaching nectar within flowers. 2. Physiological adaptations: These adaptations are related to the internal functioning of an organism and involve changes in its biochemistry, metabolism, or cell structure. Examples of physiological adaptations include: - Thermoregulation: Certain animals, such as endotherms (warm-blooded animals), have developed the ability to maintain a stable internal body temperature, even in fluctuating external temperatures. This enables them to live in a wider range of environments compared to ectotherms (cold-blooded animals), whose body temperatures depend on the environment. - Water conservation: Desert animals, like the camel and kangaroo rat, show remarkable water conservation adaptations to survive in arid conditions. These include specialized kidneys that produce concentrated urine and a unique metabolic system that minimizes water loss. - Poison resistance: Some organisms have developed resistance to specific toxins, allowing them to survive in environments where other species cannot. For example, some snake species possess immunity to their venom, enabling them to prey on venomous snakes without suffering the lethal effects of their toxins. 3. Behavioral adaptations: These adaptations involve changes in an organism's behavior to increase the chances of survival and reproduction. Examples of behavioral adaptations include: - Foraging strategies: Many animals have adapted their foraging strategies to find food efficiently. For example, some predators hunt cooperatively in groups, allowing them to corner and catch prey more effectively. - Mating techniques: Organisms have evolved various mating techniques to maximize their reproductive success. For example, male peacocks show off their bright plumage and perform elaborate dances to attract females. - Migration: Some animals, such as birds and whales, undergo long migrations to find suitable habitats for breeding or to exploit seasonal food sources, increasing their chances of survival. In summary, adaptations are essential characteristics of organisms that help them survive by allowing them to effectively respond to the challenges posed by their environment. These adaptations may be structural, physiological, or behavioral and have been shaped by the process of natural selection over time."},{"instruction":"Tweet: @siriuslyheather glad you're back lady! whisky and war memories don't go well together either.

The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages.

James Barton Longacre was born on a farm in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, on August 11, 1794. His mother Sarah (Barton) Longacre died early in his life; his father, Peter Longacre, was the descendant of early Swedish settlers of North America. When Peter Longacre remarried, his son found the home life intolerable, and James Longacre left home at the age of 12, seeking work in the nearby city of Philadelphia. He apprenticed himself at a bookstore; the owner, John E. Watson, took the boy into his family. Over the following years, Longacre worked in the bookstore, but Watson realized that the boy's skill was in portraiture. Watson granted Longacre a release from his apprenticeship in 1813 so that he could follow an artistic muse, but the two remained close, and Watson would often sell Longacre's works.Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray, principal in the engraving firm Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia. This business derived from the firm established by the Philadelphia Mint's first chief engraver, Robert Scot. Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819; his major work there was portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hancock which were placed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence by publisher John Binns; the work cost Binns a total of 9,000 (equal to 147,307 today). Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 was the man who would be Longacre's predecessor as chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht. Longacre's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists' paintings as a printed engraving, and in 1819, he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia.Longacre's first important commission were plates for S.F.

Brown was born in Mineola, a small segregated town in east Texas marked by racial tensions, to Minnie Collins Boyd and Lewis Brown. Brown was the fourth of five children. During Brown's childhood, mob violence periodically erupted in Mineola, keeping African- Americans from voting. His first job was a shoeshine boy in a whites-only barber shop. In 1995, Brown ran for Mayor of San Francisco. In his announcement speech, Brown said San Francisco needed a \\"resurrection\\" and that he would bring the \\"risk-taking leadership\\" the city needed. Brown placed first in the first round of voting, but because no candidate received 50 percent of the vote, he ran against incumbent Frank Jordan in the December runoff. Brown gained the support of Supervisor Roberta Achtenberg who had placed third in the first round of voting. Brown campaigned on working to address poverty and problems with Muni. He called Jordan the \\"inept bumbler\\" and criticized his leadership. Jordan criticized Brown for his relations with special interests during his time in the State Assembly. Brown easily defeated Jordan in the runoff. Brown's inaugural celebration included an open invitation party with 10,000 attendees and local restaurants providing 10,000 meals to the homeless. President Bill Clinton called Brown to congratulate him, and the congratulations were broadcast to the crowd. He delivered his inaugural address without notes and led the orchestra in \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\". He arrived at the event in a horse-drawn carriage. According to the New York Times, Brown was one of the nation's few liberal big city mayors when he was elected in 1996. In 1996, more than two thirds of San Franciscans approved of Brown's job performance. As mayor, Brown made several appearances on national talk shows. Brown called for expansions to the San Francisco budget to provide for new employees and programs. In 1999, Brown proposed hiring 1,392 new city workers and proposed a second straight budget with a US100 million surplus. He helped to oversee the settling of a two-day garbage strike in April 1997. During Brown's tenure, San Francisco's budget increased to US5.2 billion and the city added 4,000 new employees. Brown tried to develop a plan for universal health care, but there wasn't enough in the budget to do so. Brown put in long days as mayor, scheduling days of solid meetings and, at times, conducting two meetings at the same time. Brown opened City Hall on Saturdays to answer questions. He would later claim of his mayorship that he helped restore the city's spirit and pride. Brown's opponents in his 1999 mayoral reelection campaign were former Mayor Frank Jordan and Clint Reilly. They criticized Brown for spending the city's US1 billion in budget growth without addressing the city's major problems and creating an environment in city hall of corruption and patronage. Tom Ammiano was a late write-in candidate and he faced Brown in the runoff election. Brown won reelection by a 20 percent margin. He was supported by most major developers and business interests. Ammiano campaigned on a promise that he would raise the minimum wage to US11 per hour and scrutinize corporate business taxes. Brown repeatedly claimed that Ammiano would raise taxes. President Clinton recorded a telephone message on Brown's behalf. Brown's campaign spent US3.1 million to Ammiano's US300,000.

This is an unusual form of transportation, because it is a tunnel that trains travel through and not an actual form of transportation. The Chunnel is actually the English nickname for the Channel Tunnel. In French, it is called le tunnel sous la Manche. It is a rail tunnel beneath the English Channel at the Straits of Dover. It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race whi1e they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about 21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel. The two outside ones are the passenger trains. The small inner one is a guidance train. The guidance train is not used for transportation. Each track is exactly parallel to each other. There are four different train systems in the Chunnel. The Eurostar is a high speed passenger service that connects London, Paris, Brussels, and Lille. The Eurotunnel shuttle is a rail ferry service. These shuttles carry cars. These are railcars that allow drivers to drive their vehicles on and off. There are also two Eurotunnel goods service trains. Now you know more about the Chunnel.

Alsatians played an active role in the French Revolution. On 21 July 1789, after receiving news of the Storming of the Bastille in Paris, a crowd of people stormed the Strasbourg city hall, forcing the city administrators to flee and putting symbolically an end to the feudal system in Alsace. In 1792, Rouget de Lisle composed in Strasbourg the Revolutionary marching song \\"La Marseillaise\\" (as Marching song for the Army of the Rhine), which later became the anthem of France. \\"La Marseillaise\\" was played for the first time in April of that year in front of the mayor of Strasbourg Philippe-Frédéric de Dietrich. Some of the most famous generals of the French Revolution also came from Alsace, notably Kellermann, the victor of Valmy, Kléber, who led the armies of the French Republic in Vendée and Westermann, who also fought in the Vendée.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Sure, based on the passage you've quoted, one key thing that the French adopted post-revolution, which was created during the revolution was the anthem \\"La Marseillaise\\". Composed by Rouget de Lisle in Strasbourg in 1792, it became a revolutionary marching song and later was adopted as the national anthem of France. Another significant adoption that I noticed from the text is the first division of Alsace into the départements of Haut- and Bas-Rhin. This administrative division appears to be a product of the French Revolution and was continued post-revolution. Furthermore, the end of the feudal system is highlighted. It's indicated that the French Revolution put a symbolic end to feudalism in Alsace, a change that presumably stuck post-revolution. So, in summary, \\"La Marseillaise\\" anthem, the administrative division of Alsace, and the end of the feudal system are things that the French adopted post-Revolution, which were initiated during the Revolution."},{"instruction":"How is \\"I'il see you later, I hope.\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the phrase \\"I'll see you later, I hope.\\" can be translated as \\"Uvidíme se později, doufám.\\" Here's a more detailed breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"I'll see you\\" - In Czech, this part of the sentence can be translated as \\"uvidíme se,\\" which is the future tense form of the verb \\"vidět\\" (to see) combined with the reflexive pronoun \\"se.\\" The verb \\"uvidíme\\" consists of the prefix \\"u-\\" and the verb \\"vidět\\" in its future tense 1st person plural form - \\"vidíme.\\" It implies that the action is a mutual experience, i.e., both parties will see each other. 2. \\"Later\\" - In Czech, the word for \\"later\\" is \\"později.\\" This adverb is derived from the adjective \\"pozdější,\\" which refers to something occurring at a later time. 3. \\"I hope\\" - The phrase \\"I hope\\" can be translated into Czech as \\"doufám.\\" It is derived from the verb \\"doufat\\" (to hope) in its 1st person singular, present tense form. The verb \\"doufat\\" expresses a desire or expectation that something will happen or turn out the way one wishes. So, putting all these components together, you get \\"Uvidíme se později, doufám,\\" which is a direct translation of \\"I'll see you later, I hope\\" in Czech.

It is considered as mixed or neutral, so let me provide a detailed breakdown of both the positive and negative aspects mentioned in the review. Positive aspects: 1. The Henderson location is described as \\"ok,\\" which implies that the reviewer found it to be generally acceptable. 2. The reviewer mentions that there are \\"a lot of tv's,\\" which suggests that the sports bar offers ample entertainment options for guests who enjoy watching various games or events. 3. The reviewer compliments the bartenders as \\"nice,\\" suggesting friendly and welcoming staff members. Negative aspects: 1. The reviewer finds the sports bar to be like any other (\\"just another sports bar\\"), which implies that they consider the establishment to be somewhat generic and lacking distinctive qualities that would make it stand out. 2. The term \\"boring\\" is used to describe the bartenders, which suggests that the reviewer did not find their interactions or conversations with the staff to be particularly engaging or stimulating. 3. The reviewer's analogy comparing the bartenders to employees at a fast-food franchise (\\"I guess Burger King just promoted them\\") may be perceived as a somewhat negative comment. This could be interpreted as either a slight against the skill set of the bartenders or a critique of their performance in their current role.

With no further score after 30 more minutes of play, the hosts scored all five of their spot-kicks. Liam Henderson struck the decisive penalty, keeping Gary Locke's side in Scottish League Two. The home side came flying out of the traps and duly took the lead after just three minutes. There was excellent build-up play down the left involving Robbie Buchannan and Dale Carrick, before Henderson laid the ball off for Mullen. The former Hearts and Hibernian defender drilled a low shot beyond Matthew McGinley in the visiting goal to break the deadlock. The Blue Brazil keep their foot on the gas, and only a magnificent stop by McGinley denied Carrick from doubling the lead. The striker also crashed a header off the crossbar before Kris Renton's deflected volley flew inches wide. East Kilbride slowly eased their way into the game and Joao Victoria, then Sean Winter, came close to a leveller. The Lowland League champions began the second half on the front foot and had claims for a penalty turned down by referee Craig Charleston after the ball appeared to strike the arm of David Syme. The Lanarkshire side's pressure did pay off, though, when the home defence failed to clear their lines, allowing Gibbons to drill the ball along the slippery surface from 25 yards out and find the bottom corner. Neither side were able to strike a knockout blow before normal time expired, and the game East Kilbride's Adam Strachan fired in a deflected 20-yard effort that struck the crossbar on its way over. Both teams looked weary as the rain-soaked pitch began to take its toll. but Cowdenbeath almost snatched a late winner through Craig Johnston, whose effort was tipped over by McGinley. With Mullen, Johnston, Renton and Syme netting spot-kicks for Cowdenbeath, and Strachan, Russell McLean and Victoria replying, it was Jamie Sneddon's save from Paul Woods that proved crucial. The stop gave Henderson the opportunity to seal victory for the Blue Brazil, and the defender duly converted his penalty, preserving Cowden's SPFL status, and consigning East Kilbride to another season of junior football. Cowdenbeath manager Gary Locke: \\"I don't think it's really anything to celebrate. The chairman is a flamboyant character, and when I came to the club, he said, we're in the play-offs, just win them for us. \\"Credit to the players, they've battled really hard over the two games.

This phase includes the sight, smell, thought, or taste of food, which triggers the salivary glands to produce saliva. The saliva contains digestive enzymes, such as salivary amylase, that breaks down complex carbohydrates into simple sugars. As a result, the cephalic phase prepares the mouth and digestive system for the upcoming process of digestion. Once the food enters the mouth, the first step of the physical digestion process begins with mastication or chewing. Chewing is crucial because it breaks down the food into smaller pieces, increases the surface area of the food, and makes it easier for digestive enzymes to act upon it. As mentioned earlier, the tongue plays an essential role in this process by pushing the food around, helping in mixing the food with saliva, and forming a cohesive bolus. Besides lubrication, saliva also helps in the initial breakdown of complex carbohydrates, softening food, and making it easier to swallow. After the food is properly chewed and mixed with saliva, the bolus is pushed towards the back of the throat by the tongue, initiating the process of swallowing. This act of swallowing is facilitated by a coordinated muscle movement involving the tongue, soft palate, pharynx, and the esophagus. During swallowing, the epiglottis, a small flap of cartilage, covers the entrance to the trachea (windpipe) to prevent food from entering the lungs. The combined action of peristalsis, which is the coordinated contraction and relaxation of the esophagus muscles, propels the bolus of food down the esophagus and into the stomach. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) plays a significant role in preventing the backflow of stomach contents into the esophagus. Once the food reaches the stomach, it undergoes further mechanical and chemical digestion. In the stomach, the strong muscular contractions, known as churning, along with gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and pepsin, an enzyme that breaks down proteins, work together to further break down the food. The highly acidic environment in the stomach denatures proteins, kills bacteria, and helps in activating other digestive enzymes. Finally, the partially digested food, now called chyme, moves from the stomach into the small intestine, where most of the nutrients are absorbed. The small intestine is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum, each playing a specific role in the process of digestion and absorption. In summary, the first step of the digestion process begins with the cephalic phase, preparing the mouth and the digestive system for the upcoming food, followed by the physical act of chewing and breaking down food into smaller pieces, and eventually, the process of swallowing."},{"instruction":"Alvis Speed 25, manufacturer, Alvis Car and Engineering Company; Alvis Car and Engineering Company, foundationPlace, Coventry What is sentence that verbalizes this data?","output":"The Alvis Speed 25, a remarkable automobile, was meticulously crafted by the renowned Alvis Car and Engineering Company, which was originally founded in the industrious city of Coventry."},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their blankets and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien inhabitant of the Moon, named after one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded.

This isn't to say that Rachel didn't have her share of adventurousness, but Natalie’s spirit seemed to always be driven by the compelling desire to explore the unknown, to delve into cultures vastly different from her own, and to embrace the spontaneous, untamed nature of travel. There was a spark in her eye when tales of far-off lands, unique cultures, mysterious traditions, and unfamiliar cuisines were shared, a spark that didn't ignite into a flame in Rachel's eyes with the same intensity. Rachel, unlike Natalie, who was drawn to the mysteries hidden in the crannies of the world, preferred the comforts of familiar environments. Her adventures were more homely, more rooted in exploring depths within the known rather than seeking alien experiences in the unknown. She was an explorer too, but more of familiar spaces and places. An unveiled backyard mystery or a newly discovered hiking route near her town thrilled Rachel. Her adventurous spirit was more attuned to deepening connections with well-known territories, rather than establishing new ones in unexplored regions. On the other hand, Natalie was a true globetrotter at heart. Her sense of adventure thrived on the thrills of stepping into a new land, soaking in its heritage, welcoming its cultural flavors, and navigating through its labyrinthine streets. Every travel anecdote enriched her soul and fueled her craving for more such experiences. She was constantly looking at maps, tracing a finger along invisible routes, dreaming about future voyages. The world, in her eyes, was an open book she intended to read cover to cover. Foreign languages fascinated her, and exotic food stimulated her palate. In contrast, Rachel relished the feeling of being surrounded by the familiar chatter of her own language and savored traditional dishes cooked in her home's kitchen more than the finest overseas cuisines. Her spirit of adventure was not limited, it was just of a different kind, more intricate and deeply rooted in home ground. Rachel admired Natalie's passion for exploring foreign lands, and Natalie respected Rachel's devotion to finding beauty in the familiar. Their unique adventurous spirits took them down different paths, one toward the vastness of the globe, and the other delving deeper into a localized terrain. But, despite their contrasting preferences, their paths were entwined as they both sought to experience the world in their own ways, identifying the profound common thread between them – the joy of discovery and the expansion of their life's experiences. Yet, it was Natalie, with her boldly ambitious spirit for global exploration, who was more likely to leave her footprints on foreign shores. Her adventurous spirit became the compass, pointing her towards new horizons and uncharted territories. Therefore, when the question of traveling to a foreign country came up, everyone knew that it would be Natalie who would pack her bags first, ready to meet the world in its diversity and grandeur."},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: In September 2010, Brian May announced in a BBC interview that Sacha Baron Cohen was to play Mercury in a film of the same name.

The scope of Botany is vast as it covers diverse aspects starting from the microscopic level (like the study of cells or physiology), to a larger scope like plant ecology that examines the role of plants in the environment. It also touches upon areas like the study of plant diseases, the role and functioning of different plant structures, plant genetic studies, and plant taxonomy, amongst many others. Now considering all these different aspects within this discipline, an encompassing question could be: \\"How does climate change impact the physiology, distribution, and diversity of plant species across differing ecosystems and what subsequent effects could these changes have on the overall ecosystem balance?\\" Answering this question would involve delving into several important aspects of Botany. First, we would need to consider plant physiology and the inherent adaptiveness of differing species to environmental change. This would involve exploring how individual plant species react to changes in temperature, sunlight, precipitation, and concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Next, understanding the distribution and diversity of plant species across differing ecosystems in the light of climate change would need a deeper look into plant geography and ecology. Some plant species may respond to climate changes by altering their geographic ranges while others might not be able to adapt or migrate, leading to changes in local vegetation and a potential loss of biodiversity. Finally, assessing the effects of these changes on the overall ecosystem balance would require an understanding of the crucial role plants play in their respective ecosystems. For example, many animals rely heavily on specific plant species for food and shelter. Hence, any significant changes in plant distributions could lead to changes in animal distributions and behavior. Changes in plant communities may also affect other parts of the ecosystem such as soil quality, water availability, and even climate regulation.

It is named after the Danish island of Bornholm where early cases occurred . - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity. - Myocarditis, also known as inflammatory cardiomyopathy, is inflammation of the heart muscle. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, chest pain, decreased ability to exercise, and an irregular heartbeat. The duration of problems can vary from hours to months. Complications may include heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrest. Myocarditis is most often due to a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections, certain medications, toxins, and autoimmune disorders. A diagnosis may be supported by an electrocardiogram (ECG), increased troponin, heart MRI, and occasionally a heart biopsy. An ultrasound of the heart is important to rule out other potential causes such as heart valve problems. Treatment depends on both the severity and the cause. Medications such as ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and diuretics are often used. A period of no exercise is typically recommended during recovery. Corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be useful in certain cases. In severe cases an implantable cardiac defibrillator or heart transplant may be recommended. In 2013, about 1.5 million cases of acute myocarditis occurred. While people of all ages are affected, the young are most often affected. It is slightly more common in males than females. Most cases are mild. In 2015 cardiomyopathy, including myocarditis, resulted in 354,000 deaths up from 294,000 in 1990. The initial descriptions of the condition are from the mid-1800s. - Pathology (from the Greek roots of \\"pathos\\", meaning \\"experience\\" or \\"suffering\\", and \\"-logia\\", \\"study of\\") is a significant component of the causal study of disease and a major field in modern medicine and diagnosis. - Immunodeficiency (or immune deficiency) is a state in which the immune system's ability to fight infectious disease and cancer is compromised or entirely absent. Most cases of immunodeficiency are acquired (\\"secondary\\") due to extrinsic factors that affect the patient's immune system. Examples of these extrinsic factors include HIV infection, extremes of age, and environmental factors, such as nutrition. In the clinical setting, the immunosuppression by some drugs, such as steroids, can be either an adverse effect or the intended purpose of the treatment. Examples of such use is in organ transplant surgery as an anti-rejection measure and in patients suffering from an overactive immune system, as in autoimmune diseases. Some people are born with intrinsic defects in their immune system, or primary immunodeficiency. A person who has an immunodeficiency of any kind is said to be immunocompromised. An immunocompromised person may be particularly vulnerable to opportunistic infections, in addition to normal infections that could affect everyone. Immunodeficiency also decreases cancer immunosurveillance, in which the immune system scans the body's cells and kills neoplastic ones. - Coxsackie B is a group of six serotypes of Coxsackievirus, a pathogenic enterovirus, that trigger illness ranging from mild gastrointestinal distress to full-fledged pericarditis and myocarditis (Coxsackievirus-induced cardiomyopathy). - Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium (the fibrous sac surrounding the heart). Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp chest pain. The pain may also be felt in the shoulders, neck, or back. It is typically better sitting up and worse with lying down or breathing deep. Other symptoms may include fever, weakness, palpitations, and shortness of breath. Occasionally onset of symptoms is gradual. The cause of pericarditis is believed to be most often due to a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, uremic pericarditis, following a heart attack, cancer, autoimmune disorders, and chest trauma. The cause often remains unknown. Diagnosis is based on the chest pain, a pericardial rub, specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and fluid around the heart. Other conditions that may produce similar symptoms include a heart attack. Treatment in most cases is with NSAIDs and possibly colchicine. Steroids may be used if those are not appropriate. Typically symptoms improve in a few days to weeks but can occasionally last months. Complications can include cardiac tamponade, myocarditis, and constrictive pericarditis. It is a less common cause of chest pain. About 3 per 10,000 people are affected per year. Those most commonly affected are males between the ages of 20 and 50. Up to 30% of those affected have more than one episode. Signs and symptoms. Substernal or left precordial pleuritic chest pain with radiation to the trapezius ridge (the bottom portion of scapula on the back), which is relieved by sitting up and bending forward and worsened by lying down (recumbent or supine position) or inspiration (taking a breath in), is the characteristic pain of pericarditis. The pain may resemble the pain of angina pectoris or heart attack, but differs in that pain changes with body position, as opposed to heart attack pain that is pressure-like, and constant with radiation to the left arm and/or the jaw. Other symptoms of pericarditis may include dry cough, fever, fatigue,...

You and I are as little alike as a horse and a cow.","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"You and I are as little alike as a horse and a cow\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Starting with syntax, it follows the correct structure or order of words and phrases in a sentence to make the sentence meaningful. In English, the typical sentence follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure, which the sentence adheres to. In this case, \\"You and I\\" is the subject, \\"are\\" is the verb, and \\"as little alike as a horse and a cow\\" is the object. In terms of verb agreement, the plural form \\"are\\" correctly matches with the plural compound subject \\"You and I.\\" Furthermore, the usage of the comparative construction \\"as...as\\" is accurate. The \\"as...as\\" construction is used to compare two entities in terms of a specific property or quality - in this case, the quality being \\"alikeness\\" or similarity. Moving on to semantic acceptability, the sentence is also semantically correct, meaning the sentence makes sense in terms of its meaning in the context of standard English. Here, the speaker is comparing the level of dissimilarity between \\"you and I\\" to the level of dissimilarity between \\"a horse and a cow.\\" Although horses and cows are both mammals and have similarities, they are also quite different in many ways (differences in physical structure, behavior, etc.), so this comparison implies a high level of dissimilarity. So, the sentence \\"You and I are as little alike as a horse and a cow,\\" effectively communicates this intended message and does so in a way that is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. Therefore, it can be considered both syntactically and semantically acceptable."},{"instruction":"\\"Akbar the Great could not read, and relied on his advisors to read documents and pass edicts for him.\\" Is the above claim true? Options: - yes - no Let's think first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"Yes, the statement that Akbar the Great could not read is true. Step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Akbar the Great (1542-1605) was the third Mughal Emperor in India and one of the most successful rulers of the Mughal dynasty. 2. Akbar was illiterate, having never received a formal education or learned to read and write. It is widely believed that he had dyslexia, a learning disorder, which would have made reading and writing difficult for him. 3. Despite his illiteracy, Akbar was an intelligent and wise ruler. He had a keen interest in learning and would listen attentively to scholars and advisors who read to him from various books and documents. 4. Akbar's illiteracy did not hinder his ability to govern effectively. He relied on his trusted advisors and administrators to read and comprehend documents, allowing him to make informed decisions and rule a vast and diverse empire. 5. Akbar was known for his support of education, cultural development, and religious tolerance. He established a library for scholars and started a translation department to translate Persian, Sanskrit, Greek, and other languages' works into his own language. He also initiated numerous administrative and legal reforms, promoted religious tolerance, and encouraged the arts. In conclusion, the claim that Akbar the Great could not read and relied on his advisors to read documents and pass edicts for him is accurate. Despite his illiteracy, Akbar was a wise and effective ruler who was dedicated to promoting education, religion, and culture among his subjects."},{"instruction":"(1) Ashley was born on 1 November 1986 and is a contemporary dancer from Los Angeles who originally grew up in Arizona .

Both sentences state that Ashley was born on November 1, 1986, and that she is a contemporary dancer. However, the way her geographical background is portrayed differs. In Sentence 1, the sentence implies that Ashley is presently a contemporary dancer from Los Angeles but originally grew up in Arizona. This interpretation suggests that Ashley may have spent her formative years in Arizona before moving to Los Angeles to pursue her dancing career or for other reasons. In Sentence 2, the sentence structures Ashley's life story differently. Here, it is stated that Ashley is a contemporary dancer from Arizona who was originally raised in Los Angeles. This leads readers to infer that Ashley spent her early years in Los Angeles and later moved to Arizona for unexplained reasons. She may have either started her dance career in Los Angeles and continued in Arizona or began her dancing journey in Arizona itself. Despite these differences in geographical context, both sentences still provide the same crucial elements of information: Ashley's birthdate and her profession as a contemporary dancer.

He is especially focused on learning about lithium, which is at the top of the group, and cesium, which is at the bottom of the alkali metals group. But I can use this background: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nucl What is an answer for this question: In which element is the shielding effect larger? A:","output":"The shielding effect is larger in cesium. The reason is that as you move down the alkali metals group, the atomic size increases, and the valence electron is further from the nucleus. With an increase in distance and shielding effect, the attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group.

He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose work fell from favor during his later years?, what is it ?

In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.

In den letzten Jahren haben sich die Beziehungen zwischen Zentralasien und der Europäischen Union verstärkt. Diese Entwicklung spiegelt das wachsende Bewusstsein von beiden Seiten über die Bedeutung einer engen Zusammenarbeit wider, insbesondere angesichts der globalen Herausforderungen, denen sie gegenüberstehen. Die strategische Partnerschaft zwischen Zentralasien und der EU sollte auf einer Reihe von Schlüsselbereichen aufgebaut werden, um die langfristige Stabilität und Prosperität in beiden Regionen zu gewährleisten. Zunächst sollte sich die EU darauf konzentrieren, die wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit mit Zentralasien zu vertiefen. Durch die Schaffung eines gemeinsamen Marktes, die Förderung von Investitionen und Handel und die Zusammenarbeit in Bereichen wie Energie, Verkehr und Umweltschutz können beide Seiten voneinander profitieren. Die EU kann Zentralasien auch dabei unterstützen, in wichtigen Wirtschaftssektoren wie Landwirtschaft, Industrie und digitaler Technologie moderner und wettbewerbsfähiger zu werden. Ein weiterer wichtiger Aspekt der Partnerschaft zwischen Zentralasien und der EU ist die Zusammenarbeit im Bereich der Sicherheit. Die Region Zentralasien ist von verschiedenen Sicherheitsherausforderungen betroffen, darunter Terrorismus, Drogenhandel, grenzüberschreitende Kriminalität und die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf die Sicherheit. Durch die Zusammenarbeit bei der Bekämpfung dieser Bedrohungen kann die EU dazu beitragen, die Stabilität in Zentralasien zu stärken und gleichzeitig ihre eigenen strategischen Interessen zu schützen. Die Stärkung der Zusammenarbeit im Bildungs- und Forschungsbereich sollte ebenfalls eine Priorität für die Partnerschaft zwischen der EU und Zentralasien sein. Durch den Austausch von Studierenden, die Förderung von gemeinsamen Forschungsprojekten und die Schaffung von Möglichkeiten für den Wissenstransfer können beide Seiten voneinander lernen und voneinander profitieren. Bildung und Forschung sind entscheidend für die Schaffung einer nachhaltigen und inklusiven Gesellschaft, und eine solche Zusammenarbeit kann dazu beitragen, die Entwicklung von Fachkompetenzen und Innovationen in Zentralasien zu fördern. Schließlich sollte die Partnerschaft zwischen Zentralasien und der EU den Schwerpunkt auf die Förderung von Demokratie, Menschenrechten und Rechtsstaatlichkeit legen. Die EU kann ihre Erfahrungen in diesen Bereichen teilen und den Ländern der Region helfen, Reformen durchzuführen und ihre politischen Systeme transparenter und verantwortlicher zu gestalten. Eine stärkere Verpflichtung zu gemeinsamen Werten und Prinzipien kann dazu beitragen, das Vertrauen zwischen den Partnern zu stärken und eine stabilere und erfolgreichere Zusammenarbeit zu ermöglichen. Zusammenfassend ist es wichtig, dass sich die EU und Zentralasien auf eine strategische Partnerschaft konzentrieren, die auf gegenseitigen Vorteilen und gemeinsamen Werten und Interessen beruht. Durch die Zusammenarbeit in Bereichen wie Wirtschaft, Sicherheit, Bildung und Forschung, Demokratie und Menschenrechte können beide Seiten ihre Potenziale optimal nutzen und gemeinsam eine stabilere und prosperierende Zukunft gestalten.

Many people even call themselves diaosi. It's not the first time a term has gone popular on the Internet in China. However, why is the word so viral that is has become a cultural phenomenon? Here, we tell you something you want to know about it. Where it began The word originated in Baidu. Com's Tieba (a top Chinese bulletin board system) of soccer player Li Yi. There, fans of Li, who are called yisi in Chinese, not only talk about soccer but complain about their lives, work and relationships. Yisi, who are known for their rude and dirty language, were given the name diaosi by others who have seen their posts. What a \\"diaosi\\" is like The word diaosi was coined first by single, young men who feel they have dead-end lives. Generally, men in this category don't earn enough, are not good-looking, and have difficulty winning promotion . Unlike their upper-class contemporaries , they lack influential families, useful social networks for their careers, and most importantly, suitable women to marry. \\"I'm just a diaosi, poor and plain-looking.

Gibson was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. Can we draw the following conclusion? At least 10 people were in the movie ransom","output":"Yes, based on the information provided and the list of main actors/actresses, we can draw the conclusion that there were at least 10 people in the movie Ransom (1996). Here, I will provide more details on the Ransom's storyline, the cast members, and accolades received by the film. The plot of \\"Ransom\\" revolves around a wealthy airline owner, Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson), who faces the kidnapping of his son, Sean Mullen (Brawley Nolte). The kidnappers, led by Detective Jimmy Shaker (Gary Sinise), demand a 2 million ransom for Sean's safe return. Tom's wife, Kate Mullen (Rene Russo), is distraught by the abduction, and the couple initially cooperates with the FBI task force, led by Agent Lonnie Hawkins (Delroy Lindo). However, Tom decides to take a bold move and turns the tables on the kidnappers by offering the ransom money as a bounty on their heads. This high-stake gamble ignites a dangerous game of cat and mouse between Tom and the criminals. As mentioned earlier, the main cast of \\"Ransom\\" includes well-known actors and actresses, such as: 1. Mel Gibson as Tom Mullen 2. Rene Russo as Kate Mullen 3. Gary Sinise as Detective Jimmy Shaker 4. Brawley Nolte as Sean Mullen 5. Delroy Lindo as Agent Lonnie Hawkins 6. Liev Schreiber as Clark Barnes 7. Evan Handler as Miles Roberts 8. Donnie Wahlberg as Cubby Barnes 9. Lili Taylor as Maris Conner Note that this list only includes nine names. However, there are undoubtedly supporting characters, lesser-known actors, and extras who appeared in various scenes throughout the film, which can easily bring the total number of people involved in \\"Ransom\\" to well over 10. Furthermore, \\"Ransom\\" was a commercial success, grossing over 300 million against a 70 million production budget. In addition to Mel Gibson's Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor, the film received other nominations and accolades, including a BMI Film Music Award for James Horner's score and a Satellite Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Gary Sinise). In summary, we can conclude that there were at least 10 people in the movie \\"Ransom.\\" The film featured a main cast of nine well-known actors and actresses, and it is reasonable to assume that there were other supporting actors and extras involved in the making of the film.

A: Answer:","output":"The posterior pituitary, also known as the neurohypophysis, is actually an extension of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a small but crucial part of the brain. It plays an important role in many vital functions, such as releasing hormones and regulating body temperature, thirst, hunger, sleep, mood, sex drive, and the secretion of other hormones. It's located at the base of the brain, just above the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus is considered the control center for the pituitary gland. It sends signals to the pituitary to release or inhibit the release of hormones into the bloodstream. In essence, the hypothalamus is what directs the pituitary gland to do its job. The hypothalamus communicates with the anterior pituitary through blood vessels, sending it releasing and inhibiting hormones to control its activity. Now, the pituitary gland itself is divided into two parts: the larger anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) and the smaller posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis). Despite being part of the same gland, these two sections function slightly differently and have different origins during fetal development. The posterior pituitary doesn't generate any hormones of its own. Instead, it serves as a storage and release site for hormones made in the hypothalamus, specifically oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (also known as vasopressin). These hormones are transported down axons that run from the hypothalamus directly into the posterior pituitary, through long fibers in the hypothalamic-hypophyseal tract. So, when the posterior pituitary releases a hormone, it's actually distributing hormones that were created in the hypothalamus. In other words, it is an extension of the hypothalamus. It's sort of like a 'messenger' or 'mailbox' that delivers the 'messages' or 'mail' created in the hypothalamus to the rest of the body. This intimate connection between the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary thus allows for seamless communication and coordination in the body's response to various stimuli."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: We're out of our jurisdiction.","output":"My jsme mimo naši jurisdikci."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"La vida es un viaje impredecible lleno de experiencias hermosas y valiosas lecciones que nos ayudan a mejorar como personas.

The character is loosely based on comedian Kenny Kramer, Larry David's ex-neighbor across the hall. Kramer is the friend and neighbor of main character Jerry, residing in Apartment 5B, and is friends with George and Elaine. Of the series' four central characters, only Kramer has no visible means of support; what few jobs he holds seem to be nothing more than larks. The character of Kramer was originally based on the real-life Kenny Kramer, a neighbor of co-creator Larry David from New York. However, Michael Richards did not in any way base his performance on the real Kramer, to the point of refusing to meet him. This was later parodied in \\"The Pilot\\" when the actor that is cast to play him in Jerry and George's sitcom refuses to base the character on the real Cosmo Kramer. At the time of the shooting of the original Seinfeld pilot, \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles,\\" Kenny Kramer had not yet given consent to use his name, and so Kramer's character was originally known as \\"Kessler.\\" Larry David was hesitant to use Kenny Kramer's real name because he suspected that Kramer would take advantage of this. David's suspicion turned out to be correct; Kenny Kramer created the \\"Kramer Reality Tour\\", a New York City bus tour that points out actual locations of events or places featured in Seinfeld. The \\"Kramer Reality Tour\\" is itself spoofed on Seinfeld in \\"The Muffin Tops.\\" In the episode, when Kramer's real-life stories are used by Elaine to pad the biography of J. Peterman she was ghostwriting, he develops a reality bus tour called \\"The Peterman Reality Tour\\" and touts himself as \\"The Real J. Peterman,\\" even though, as Jerry notes, reality is the last thing Kramer is qualified to give a tour on. Richards' physicality can be seen in his early 1980s appearances on The Tonight Show, the early 1980s ABC sketch comedy show \\"Fridays\\", and his appearance in the film \\"Young Doctors in Love\\" where he plays a hit man; a nod to this appears in the \\"Air Conditioner\\" episode.

The gathering takes place as Trump finalizes plans to send the military to the U.S. border with Mexico and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In addition, Trump's recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked criticism from many of the attendees at the summit, though some countries have received temporary exemptions. Despite all the turbulence, White House officials outlined a fairly traditional agenda for the summit. \\"A win for this president at this summit will be a strong speech focused on regional governance, leadership on Venezuela and promoting reciprocal trade,\\" a senior administration official said. The official would not say whether Trump will continue to \\"speak his mind\\" during the summit on sensitive issues such as immigration.

Marquee Moon was released on February 8, 1977, in the United States and on March 4 in the United Kingdom, where it was an unexpected success and reached number 28 on the country's albums chart. The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said that Television were \\"so competitive\\" and unaccommodating on the tour, and that they did not treat it like a joint effort. He recalled one show where \\"all our equipment was shoved up at the [Glasgow] Apollo and we had like three feet of room so that [Verlaine] could stand still in this vast space.\\"By the time of Television's return to the US, Elektra had given up on promoting Marquee Moon, which they dismissed as a commercial failure.

Would you use a personal chef or a robot chef? Would you use a robot chef to save time cooking?","output":"First, let's break down the two questions to better examine their meanings: Question 1: \\"Would you use a personal chef or a robot chef?\\" This question is asking the respondent to choose between two options: a personal chef (presumably a human) and a robot chef. The question's focus is on the preference of the person being asked. Question 2: \\"Would you use a robot chef to save time cooking?\\" This question is asking if the respondent would consider using a robot chef specifically for the purpose of saving time while cooking. The focus is on the potential time-saving benefit of using a robot chef. Now, let's analyze the meanings to determine if the questions have the same meaning: While both questions involve the use of a robot chef, they are not exactly the same. Question 1 is about choosing between a human chef and a robot chef, whereas Question 2 is about using a robot chef specifically for its time-saving benefits. So, these questions do not have the same meaning, as they focus on different aspects of using a robot chef.

Options: - complete job - learn from each other - kill animals - wear hats - talk to each other Step-by-step reasoning process below:","output":"At work, people generally aim to complete their jobs, learn from each other, and communicate with their colleagues. The primary focus of any workplace is to fulfill the job responsibilities, meet performance standards, and accomplish professional objectives. Here is the step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Complete job: The first and foremost goal of working is to complete tasks, projects, or assignments assigned by the employer or supervisor. Completing the job is essential as it contributes to the success of the organization and helps individuals achieve their career goals. It also helps to maintain a stable source of income and job security. 2. Learn from each other: Apart from completing tasks, people at work also aim to learn from one another. They can gather new information, share skills and expertise, and improve their professional competence by interacting with their colleagues or supervisors. Learning from each other helps individuals grow professionally and adapt to the ever-evolving work environment. 3. Talk to each other: Communication is vital in a workplace, as it ensures that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same objectives. By talking to each other, employees can express their ideas, share their thoughts, and address any concerns they may have. Effective communication also helps build trust and camaraderie in the workplace, ultimately enhancing team performance and overall work satisfaction. The other options mentioned are not typically primary objectives at work: - Kill animals: This option is not a common goal in most workplaces, unless it is specifically related to their job, such as pest control or certain types of agriculture. Even then, it must be carried out responsibly and within legal and ethical guidelines. - Wear hats: While wearing hats can occur in some workplaces for various reasons, such as uniform requirements, protection, or promotional purposes, it is generally not a primary objective or goal of working. Wearing hats might be necessary for some industries (e.g., construction or food service), but it is not a key aim for employees."},{"instruction":"Process: - Sediment becomes loose from the rest of the soil - The sediment rolls down hill towards a river - The heavy items sink to the bottom - The lighter items float on the top and in convection cycles - As the river flows the sediment is moved - The sediment gets dumped through tributaries into lakes and the ocean - The sediment keeps moving around the world in convection currents.

Let us take a closer look at his achievements during that year to understand why 2008 was a good year for Charmin. 1. American Kennel Club (AKC) National Championship in 2007: Although this event took place at the end of 2007, it is reasonable to assume that the prestige and accolades obtained from winning Best in Show at the AKC National Championship had a positive impact on Charmin's performance and reputation heading into 2008. 2. Terrier Group at Westminster Kennel Club dog show in 2008: Westminster Kennel Club dog show is one of the most prestigious and respected canine competitions in the United States. By winning the Terrier Group at this event, Charmin showcased his exceptional skills and characteristics, further solidifying his status as a top-notch competitor. This win also served as a strong stepping stone for his future successes. 3. World Dog Show in 2008: Charmin's success did not stop at the national level, as he went on to win Best in Show at the World Dog Show in 2008. The World Dog Show is considered an important international competition, demonstrating Charmin's capability to compete and succeed on a global stage. Winning this significant event undoubtedly contributed to making 2008 a remarkable year for Charmin. 4. Building on previous successes: Charmin's victories in 2008 were not isolated events.

This accumulation of accomplishments demonstrates Charmin's consistent performance and dedication to excellence. 5. Recognition and exposure: Being the winner in renowned competitions, Charmin was able to garner significant media attention and public interest in 2008.

Movie title: Transformers: Dark of the Moon Context: During the final days of the war that devastated the planet Cybertron, a spacecraft known as The Ark attempted to escape. Piloted by the great Autobot leader named Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy), the ship was said to contain special items that could help the Autobots win the war over the Decepticons. However, the ship was hit by enemy missiles, and the ship and its crew were lost into the far reaches of space.In 1961, the crash of the Ark on the moon is detected by NASA. Fearing that the Russians may beat them to finding out what this unidentified object is, President John F Kennedy pushes for NASA to land men on the moon to investigate. 8 years later, in 1969, Apollo 11 lands on the moon, and astronauts Neil Armstrong (Don Jeanes) and Buzz Aldrin (Cory Tucker) secretly explore the craft. They return with samples and pictures, and future moon missions bring back more information, before the manned moon missions are cancelled.In the present day, The Autobots are still working with the NEST Team to track down Decepticons loose on the planet, as well as anything unusual. While the Autobots Bumblebee, Sideswipe, Enzo, and Que attempt to take out an illegal Middle-Eastern nuclear plant, Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel) is informed by a Ukranian official, Alexi Vokshod, about something strange going on around the Chernobyl disaster site. Lennox leads a team along with Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and Ratchet (Robert Foxworth) into the radioactive site. Inside the plant, Prime discovers a fuel cell from the Ark, and something even more shocking: the Decepticon Shockwave (Frank Welker) and a giant drilling robot at his command. After a short fight, Shockwave and the driller retreat. During the battle, a Decepticon assassin, Laserbeak (Keith Szarabajka), ambushes Vokshod kills him.Eventually, Prime and the other Autobots return to NEST's headquarters.

Answer:","output":"In Transformers: Dark of the Moon, the second-in-command to the Decepticon leader Megatron (Hugo Weaving) is the cunning and ruthless Starscream (Charlie Adler). Starscream is a skilled fighter and tactician, often taking on leadership roles within the Decepticon ranks when Megatron is absent or incapacitated. However, his ambition and desire for power often lead him to undermine Megatron's authority, plotting to overthrow him and take his place as the Decepticon leader. Throughout the film, Starscream works alongside Megatron and other notable Decepticons such as Shockwave, Laserbeak, and Soundwave (Frank Welker) in their efforts to defeat the Autobots and claim victory for the Decepticons. Starscream's abilities as a fighter and his unyielding loyalty to the Decepticon cause make him an invaluable asset to Megatron's plans and a constant source of tension within the ranks of the Autobots. As the events of Transformers: Dark of the Moon unfold, Starscream continues to support Megatron in their quest to outmaneuver and defeat the Autobots, engaging in various battles and pursuing the powerful artifacts from The Ark. Ultimately, Starscream meets his demise at the hands of the human protagonist, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), who uses a powerful grappling device to attach an explosive to Starscream's body, causing him to explode and perish. In conclusion, Megatron's second-in-command in Transformers: Dark of the Moon is Starscream, who plays a pivotal role in the Decepticons' plans and continuously proves to be a formidable adversary to the Autobots. His cunning tactics and fierce ambition make him a powerful force in the ongoing battle between these two factions and a key figure within the Decepticon hierarchy."},{"instruction":"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: You will need tissue paper, your gift, a gift bag, any embellishments, your card and gift tag.

Let's examine the other options: - Jail: A jail is a place for holding individuals who have been arrested, are awaiting trial, or have been sentenced to serve a short-term sentence. It is not a suitable location for manufacturing stool legs. - Internet Cafe: An internet cafe is a place where customers can use computers with internet access, often for a fee.

Rationale: The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary in the U.S. states of Maryland and Virginia. Chesapeake bay is famous for its crab. The question and answer:","output":"Question: What factors contribute to the abundance of crab in the Chesapeake Bay, and how does it impact the regional ecosystem and economy? Answer: The abundance of crabs in the Chesapeake Bay can be attributed to several factors, including the unique geographical features, water quality, and biodiversity of the estuary. The Chesapeake Bay provides an extensive network of rivers, shallow waters, and wetlands, offering an ideal habitat for various fish and shellfish species, including the famous blue crab. Crabs thrive within the Bay's estuarine environment, as the mixture of fresh and salty waters creates a vast brackish ecosystem perfect for aquatic life. Additionally, the Bay's underwater grasses and oyster reefs offer essential shelter and protection for juvenile crabs, contributing to their high survival rate. The remarkable abundance of crabs in the Chesapeake Bay significantly impacts both the regional ecosystem and economy. Ecologically, crabs are an essential link in the food chain, serving as both a predator and prey for various marine species. Their role as natural scavengers helps maintain a healthy balance within the estuarine environment by consuming dead or decaying matter. Economically, crabbing is a vital industry for the states of Maryland and Virginia. The Chesapeake Bay's blue crab fishery not only provides a source of income for thousands of watermen and their families but also supports related businesses such as restaurants, seafood distributors, and tourism. However, the sustainability of the crab population has been threatened in the past by pollution, overfishing, and habitat loss. Therefore, proper conservation and management practices are essential to preserve the Bay's ecosystem and ensure the continued success of the regional crab industry."},{"instruction":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Jail for the following movie plot: Nathan Hayes (Ken Bevel) is at a gas station in Albany, Georgia, trying to clean his windshield when his truck is stolen.

Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. Question: What effect does the author probably believe that decluttering the house will have on it's market value? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"The author probably believes that decluttering the house will increase its market value."},{"instruction":"the president of the u.n. general assembly announced monday that he is appointing a high-level task force to recommend reform of the global financial system , including greater clout for developing countries .

Part #2: Understand that diseases are disorders of structure or function. Usage: Tay-Sachs disease affects the nervous system, specifically it results from the absence or insufficient levels of the enzyme Hex A. The disease meets this criterion because it affects the function of the nervous system, which is a specific location within the human body. Part #3: Be aware that there might be multiple correct answers. Usage: (Alternative answer) Hexosaminidase A deficiency. This could be considered another correct answer since the sample input discusses the enzyme Hex A (alphabeta). Hexosaminidase A deficiency is the primary cause of Tay-Sachs disease.

Movie title: The Grey Zone Movie plot: The film opens in October 1944, in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. A small group of Sonderkommandos, prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an insurrection that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four crematoria and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured, but they don't reveal the plot. Meanwhile, a Hungarian-Jewish doctor, MiklÃ³s Nyiszli (Allan Corduner), who works for the Nazi scientist Josef Mengele in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele himself to visit his wife and daughter in the womenâs labor camp. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengeleâs orders will keep them from the gas chambers. A new trainload of Hungarian Jewish prisoners arrives, and all are immediately sent to the gas chambers. As the group is given instructions about \\"delousing\\", a fearful, angry man in the group begins shouting questions at one of the Sonderkommandos, Hoffman (Arquette), who has been issuing the instructions. Hoffman beats him to death in an outburst of frustration, in an attempt to make the man stop talking. After the gassing of this same group, a badly shaken Hoffman finds a young girl alive beneath a pile of bodies. He removes her from the chamber, and, after informing the leader of the insurgency, Schlermer (Daniel Benzali), takes her to a storage room and summons Nyiszli, who revives her. The group decides to hide her in the childrenâs camp. While the prisoners hide her in a dressing room, SS-OberscharfÃ¼hrer Eric Muhsfeldt (Keitel) suddenly walks in. Noticing that one of the prisoners present, Abramowics (Buscemi), is there illegally, he shoots him, prompting the girl...

While this is normally true, it is more important that children learn to take responsibility for what they need to do. As a child who strives to be your best, you need to accept that there are things you have to do, for the benefit of yourself and others. The goal of being a good child isn’t really about giving your parents a little less grief (although they will welcome that). Good children learn qualities that will help them become happy, successful, “good” adults. For example, you need to take responsibility for doing your homework and completing your chores, without constant reminders or resistance. This will help you to become more self-motivated, self-sufficient, and successful in work and life as an adult. Every one of us (including adults) sometimes gets angry, frustrated, whiny, or stressed out. There is no way to deny or avoid these emotions, and it would be unhealthy to do so anyway. However, you can work on recognizing and managing your emotions more effectively. Learning to control anger is one of the most important lessons for children. When you feel anger welling up, simple steps like taking deep breaths, in the nose and out the mouth, and counting to five can help you calm and contain it. Then, you can think more clearly about what caused the anger and what you can do differently next time to manage it. Uncontrolled anger isn't always the cause of bad behavior, though. Sometimes kids act out when they are upset, sad, confused, or lonely. You might experience these emotions if you've been bullied in school, left out of a group activity, or rejected by a friend. When you feel down, talk to an adult you trust. If you can talk to your parents about your emotions, it can improve your relationship with them. There is no shame in seeking help from a counselor or other expert if you need it, though. “Good boys and girls tell the truth.” You may have heard this said to you, and it is usually true. But the bigger picture is that honesty is a key part of building relationships based on trust. This will benefit you as a child and as an adult. Healthy relationships require trust, and trust is built on honesty. You may want to lie to your parents in order to avoid punishment or avoid hurting their feelings. This usually doesn't work, though, and it will get in the way of developing a more mature relationship with them. No matter how upset parents may become when hearing the truth — you failed a test because you didn’t study, stole a candy bar from the store, made fun of a vulnerable classmate, etc. — they will also feel some pride in your choice to be honest. It is an important sign of growth and trust. Even the best kids make plenty of mistakes. It is part of growing up, and simply of being human. The important thing is what you do with your imperfections. Learning from mistakes is a sign of maturity and is sure to be appreciated by your parents. If you did poorly on a big test because of a lack of preparation, are you ready to accept the importance of studying? If you were grounded for talking back to your mother in public, do you now understand the importance of showing respect? When a thoughtful, maturing child makes such mistakes, she learns from them and moves forward better off for it. Even the most demanding parents will accept some mistakes from their children, especially if they are not repeated mistakes. All parents love seeing evidence of growth and maturity in their children. Learning from a mistake instead of repeating it is always a positive sign. Children who are seen as \\"bad\\" because of bad behavior often have trouble dealing with their problems in the proper way. Confusion and frustration often lead to bad decisions. But being able to recognize and solve problems puts you on a path toward self-reliance and confidence. Remember how proud your parents were when you put a puzzle together by yourself, or wrote your own name? Even when you learned to unlatch the kitchen cabinet and made a giant mess everywhere, there was probably some pride mixed in, because parents know the importance of self-reliance and problem solving skills in the adult world. For kids, problems often result from a conflict with another kid. For a kid-friendly guide to conflict resolution, consider visiting http://www.cyh.com/HealthTopics/HealthTopicDetailsKids.aspx?p=335&np=287&id=1521. Its problem-solving steps include: Understand. Let each person involved clearly express the problem as they see it. Avoid making things worse. Don't scream, insult, or take physical action against the other kid(s), no matter how upset you are. Stay calm and work through the problem. Work together. Explain how you feel about the conflict by saying something like \\"I feel angry when ...\\" or \\"I need to feel ...\\". Then listen carefully while the other children involved speak. Find the solution. Brainstorm different possible solutions together, and choose the one that best meets the needs of everyone involved. As we just discussed, learning to recognize and solve problems yourself is an important skill for kids (and adults). But, just as important is being able to recognize and accept when you need help dealing with a problem. It doesn't help you to \\"quit\\" on your math homework without trying to figure it out yourself. But it is also not useful to refuse to ask for help when you need it because you insist on doing everything yourself. No child (or adult) can solve every problem herself. Your parents want to give you assistance when you need it, and will see your willingness to ask as a positive sign. Don’t expect them to solve every problem for you, though — that is a sign of immaturity. How do you know when to keep trying to solve a problem yourself, and when to ask for help? There is no secret formula; you have to trust yourself to make the decision. Have you given the problem your best effort? Are you out of ideas for how to deal with it? If so, then it is probably time to ask for assistance. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of children learning to take responsibility for their actions and developing qualities that will help them become happy, successful, and good adults. It highlights the significance of self-motivation, self-sufficiency, emotion management, honesty, learning from mistakes, problem-solving skills, and knowing when to ask for help. By cultivating these skills and traits, children can grow into responsible and well-adjusted adults, building strong relationships based on trust, and coping with challenging situations effectively."},{"instruction":"Test for natural language inference.

Article: Have you ever felt annoyed when left talking to yourself after your mobile phone battery runs out in the middle of a call? If yes, then here comes some good news. Scientists are now perfecting a way to recharge electrical equipment while on the move. Researchers from theprefix = st1 /Netherlands,FranceandPortugalannounced last week that they have developed very thin solar panels that can be put on clothes. They can also be added to furniture and rooftops. They change light from the sun into electricity. In about three years, you'll be able to wear a jacket that will recharge your phone as you walk. For camping fans, the development could lead to a tent which charges batteries all day so you can have light or music at night. The basic technology of wearable solar panels is the same as that used for traditional solar panels. Pairs of sheets of semi-conducting silicon are linked together to form the panel. But scientists made them much thinner by using different silicon. At one micrometre, they are of the same thickness as photographic film. \\"This technology will make it easier for people to use clean energy sources,\\" said a physicist in theNetherlandswho led the team of scientists. But the thin panels are not as efficient as the thicker ones. While some solar panels now operate at an efficiency of about 20 per cent, the new flexible panels are only 7 per cent efficient. But the thinner panel is cheaper. An A4 sized panel put onto the back of a jacket cost less than US13. It could charge a cellphone during a summer walk in the countryside.

Make this lower case","output":"Biodegradable products are anticipated to gain significant popularity, particularly in the fast-food sector. This can be attributed to the increasing global awareness regarding the environmental impact of waste generated by the industry and the growing demand for sustainable alternatives to conventional single-use products. The fast-food sector has been notorious for producing substantial amounts of waste, primarily consisting of packaging materials such as plastic bags, cups, and straws. These single-use items, made from non-biodegradable materials, can take hundreds of years to break down completely. As a result, they contribute to the ever-growing landfills and pose a threat to wildlife, marine life, and the ecosystem as a whole. Considering these adverse environmental impacts, the need for alternatives has never been more critical. Biodegradable products offer a more sustainable solution as they are designed to break down into natural elements within a much shorter period. This significantly reduces their ecological footprint and helps slow down the depletion of natural resources. Some commonly used biodegradable materials in the fast-food industry include paper, cardboard, and increasingly, bioplastics. Bioplastics, such as PLA (polylactic acid), are derived from renewable sources like corn starch, making them a more sustainable option than traditional petroleum-based plastics. Apart from these materials, companies are also exploring the use of other eco-friendly options like bamboo, sugarcane, and palm leaf for packaging purposes. As biodegradable products continue to gain popularity, fast food chains are expected to witness a shift in consumer preferences and industry practices. Many fast-food brands are already taking steps towards sustainability and adopting eco-friendly initiatives such as: 1. Transitioning to biodegradable packaging: Businesses in the fast-food sector have started to phase out conventional plastic materials in favor of biodegradable alternatives. For instance, McDonald's has committed to using 100% renewable or recycled packaging by 2025. 2. Reducing plastic waste: Companies are eliminating non-biodegradable items like plastic straws and cutlery from their outlets. Starbucks, for example, has pledged to phase out single-use plastic straws in all its stores worldwide. 3. Encouraging reusable containers: Fast-food chains are also promoting the use of reusable cups and containers to reduce the overall consumption of disposable packaging. Many businesses now offer incentives, such as discounts, for customers who bring their reusable cups. 4. Educating consumers: To encourage a more responsible approach towards waste management, fast-food establishments have started to incorporate waste segregation and recycling practices within their premises, guiding customers on how to dispose of their waste correctly. These changes are expected to augment both customer satisfaction and brand loyalty while also reducing waste generation and contributing to environmental conservation. However, it is equally critical for the industry to develop more innovative biodegradable products and eco-friendly materials to continue on this path of sustainability. Lastly, it is crucial for the fast-food sector, governments, and consumers to work together to ensure that this trend towards biodegradable products becomes the new norm. By developing robust policies and regulations, raising public awareness, and promoting sustainable practices throughout the industry, the fast-food sector can significantly reduce its environmental impact, thereby contributing to a greener and more environmentally responsible future."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"Dublin is a compact city, and many of its important sites are within easy walking distance of one another.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Dublin is so spread out one must always charter a horse to reach an important site.\\" is true?","output":"To determine whether or not the hypothesis is true, let's consider the given premise and examine the information step by step: Step 1: Identify the premise The premise states that \\"Dublin is a compact city, and many of its important sites are within easy walking distance of one another.\\" Step 2: Analyze the premise The premise suggests that Dublin is a compact city, which means it has a relatively small area and the important sites are closely located so that one can walk from one site to another without much difficulty. Step 3: Compare the premise to the hypothesis The hypothesis states that \\"Dublin is so spread out one must always charter a horse to reach an important site.\\" This suggests that the city is spread out, the important sites are far apart, and one needs a mode of transportation (in this case, a horse) to travel between them. Step 4: Evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis The premise suggests that the important sites in Dublin are within easy walking distance, while the hypothesis suggests the important sites are far enough apart that a horse is required for transportation. Step 5: Make a conclusion Based on the comparison, we can conclude that the hypothesis contradicts the premise, and therefore, the hypothesis \\"Dublin is so spread out one must always charter a horse to reach an important site\\" is not true."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which city was named after the Union Army colonel and the president of the Cape Fear Building Company?

He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan. His father is of mostly Irish descent; one of Newsom's maternal great-grandfathers, Scotsman Thomas Addis, was a pioneer scientist in the field of nephrology and a professor of medicine at Stanford University. Newsom is the second cousin, twice removed, of musician Joanna Newsom. On May 14, 1991, Newsom and his investors created the company PlumpJack Associates L.P. In 1992, the group started the PlumpJack Winery with the financial help of his family friend Gordon Getty. PlumpJack was the name of an opera written by Getty, who invested in 10 of Newsom's 11 businesses. Getty told the San Francisco Chronicle that he treated Newsom like a son and invested in his first business venture because of that relationship. According to Getty, later business investments were because of \\"the success of the first.\\" One of Newsom's early interactions with government occurred when Newsom resisted the San Francisco Health Department requirement to install a sink at his PlumpJack wine store. The Health Department argued that wine was a food. The department required the store to install a 27,000 sink in the carpeted wine shop on the grounds that the shop needed the sink for a mop. When Newsom was later appointed supervisor, he told the San Francisco Examiner: \\"That's the kind of bureaucratic malaise I'm going to be working through.\\" The business grew to an enterprise with more than 700 employees. The PlumpJack Cafe Partners L.P. opened the PlumpJack Cafe, also on Fillmore Street, in 1993. Between 1993 and 2000, Newsom and his investors opened several other businesses that included the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn with a PlumpJack Cafe (1994), the Napa Valley winery (1995), the Balboa Cafe Bar and Grill (1995), the PlumpJack Development Fund L.P. (1996), the MatrixFillmore Bar (1998), PlumpJack Wines shop Noe Valley branch (1999), PlumpJackSport retail clothing (2000), and a second Balboa Cafe at Squaw Valley (2000). Newsom's investments included five restaurants and two retail clothing stores. Newsom's annual income was greater than 429,000 from 1996 to 2001. In 2002, his business holdings were valued at more than 6.9 million. Newsom gave a monthly 50 gift certificate to PlumpJack employees whose business ideas failed, because in his view, \\"There can be no success without failure.\\" Newsom sold his share of his San Francisco businesses when he became mayor in 2004. He maintained his ownership in the PlumpJack companies outside San Francisco that included the PlumpJack Winery in Oakville, California, new PlumpJack-owned Cade Winery in Angwin, California, and the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn. He is currently the president in absentia of Airelle Wines Inc., which is connected to the PlumpJack Winery in Napa County. Newsom earned between 141,000 and 251,000 in 2007 from his business interests. In February 2006, he paid 2,350,000 for his residence in the Russian Hill neighborhood, which he put on the market in April 2009, for 2,995,000. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Please name one of those?","output":"Sure thing, little buddy!

With 38 songs in the Top 10 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary charts, Diamond has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Neil Diamond has been touring around the world consecutively for 50 years. Neil Diamond 50 - 50th Anniversary Collection Diamond was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011. Diamond was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family descended from Russian and Polish immigrants. His parents were Rose (nee Rapaport) and Akeeba \\"Kieve\\" Diamond, a dry-goods merchant. He grew up in several homes in Brooklyn, having also spent four years in Cheyenne, Wyoming, where his father was stationed in the army. In Brooklyn he attended Erasmus Hall High School and was a member of the Freshman Chorus and Choral Club, along with classmate Barbra Streisand. They were not close friends at the time, Diamond recalls: \\"We were two poor kids in Brooklyn. We hung out in the front of Erasmus High and smoked cigarettes.\\" After his family moved he then attended Abraham Lincoln High School, and was a member of the fencing team. Also on the team was his best friend, future Olympic fencer Herb Cohen. For his 16th birthday, he received his first guitar. When he was 16, and still in high school, Diamond spent a number of weeks at Surprise Lake Camp, a camp for Jewish children in upstate New York, when folk singer Pete Seeger performed a small concert. Seeing the widely recognized singer perform, and watching other children singing songs for Seeger that they wrote themselves, had an immediate effect on Diamond, who then became aware of the possibility of writing his own songs. \\"And the next thing, I got a guitar when we got back to Brooklyn, started to take lessons and almost immediately began to write songs,\\" he said. He adds that his attraction to songwriting was the \\"first real interest\\" he had growing up, besides helping him release his youthful \\"frustrations\\". Diamond also used his newly developing skill to write poetry. By writing poems for girls he was attracted to in school, he soon learned it often won their hearts. His male classmates took note and began asking him to write poems for them which they would sing and use with equal success. He spent the summer following his graduation as a waiter in the Catskills resort area. There he first met Jaye Posner, who would years later become his wife. Diamond next attended New York University as a pre-med major on a fencing scholarship, again on the fencing team with Herb Cohen. He was a member of the 1960 NCAA men's championship fencing team. Often bored in class, he found writing song lyrics more to his liking. He began cutting classes and taking the train up to Tin Pan Alley, where he tried to get some of his songs heard by local music publishers. In his senior year, when he was just 10 units short of graduation, Sunbeam Music Publishing offered him a 16-week job writing songs for 50 a week (equivalent to about US405 per week, in 2017 dollars), and he dropped out of college to accept it. Where did he attend school?","output":"Neil Diamond attended multiple schools during his educational journey. In Brooklyn, he attended Erasmus Hall High School, where he was a member of the Freshman Chorus and Choral Club alongside his classmate Barbra Streisand. After his family moved, he went on to attend Abraham Lincoln High School, where he was a member of the fencing team.

Answer:","output":"The capital of Texas is Austin. Located in Central Texas along the Eastern edge of the American Southwest, Austin is the 11th most populous city in the United States and the 4th most populous city in Texas. It also ranks as one of the most populous state capitals, only coming in second to Phoenix, Arizona. Named after Stephen F. Austin, who is known as the \\"Father of Texas\\" and the republic's first secretary of state, Austin was created in 1839 and replaced Houston as the capital of Texas. It is also the southernmost state capital in the contiguous United States. Austin is known for its vibrant live music scene that boasts more music venues per capita than any other U.S. city. The city's music revolves around the many nightclubs on 6th Street and an annual film/music/interactive festival known as South by Southwest (SXSW). The city also has a prominent ballet, world-class museums, one-of-a-kind shopping and beautiful outdoor spaces, including the Austin City Limits Music Festival that takes place in Zilker Park. The city is also known for being a major center for high tech. Thousands of graduates each year from the engineering and computer science programs at the University of Texas at Austin provide a steady source of employees that help to fuel Austin's technology and defense industry sectors. The presence of companies such as Dell, IBM, Silicon Labs, National Instruments, 3M, Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, and Indeed in the city has led to significant growth and a strong economy. Austin was also selected as the site for the development of the new Texas State Capitol, completed in 1888, which is one of the most significant landmarks in the city. The building is made from red granite and stands as one of the symbols of Texas pride. From a geographical perspective, Austin is located near the Balcones Fault, which runs roughly from Dallas to San Antonio, making the eastern part of the city flat, whereas the western part and western suburbs include rolling hills on the edge of the Texas Hill Country. Because the hills to the west are primarily limestone rock with a thin covering of topsoil, parts of the city are frequently subjected to flash floods from the runoff caused by thunderstorms. Austin is also the cultural and economic center of the Greater Austin Metropolitan area, which is home to over two million people, making it the 30th largest metropolitan area in the United States. Austin's official slogan promotes the city as \\"The Live Music Capital of the World\\", a reference to not only its numerous musicians and music venues but also the long-running PBS TV concert series Austin City Limits. Thus, Austin, Texas is a city that is as diverse as it is historically significant, being rich in tech industries, musical culture, education, and a broad array of cuisines, making it a thriving hub of activity in the heart of Texas. It showcases a unique mix of old-world charm and modern sophistication."},{"instruction":"Given the following passage \\"The New York City Charter School Center assists the setup of new charter schools.

Here, I'll break down the significance of each important word in the context of the sentence. 1. Salad: The word \\"salad\\" is important because it describes the main subject of the sentence and refers to a specific type of food. A salad is a dish made of a mixture of small pieces of food, usually featuring vegetables, and often accompanied by a dressing. This word helps us understand that the focus of the sentence is on a particular type of dish. 2. Broccoli: \\"Broccoli\\" is an essential word since it specifies one of the main ingredients of the salad mentioned in the sentence. Broccoli is a green, cruciferous vegetable that adds nutritional value and texture to the dish. 3. Lettuce: Another key ingredient in this salad is \\"lettuce.\\" The presence of lettuce in the salad often implies the base ingredient, creating a bed for other toppings. Lettuce is a leafy green vegetable that is a common element in salads due to its mild flavor and crunchy texture. 4. Nuts: \\"Nuts\\" also play a vital role, as they introduce another component to the salad dish. Nuts serve as toppings that provide additional flavor, crunch, and nutritional value. They contribute protein and healthy fats to the dish, while also adding taste variety. 5. Serving tray: The phrase \\"serving tray\\" is crucial since it denotes the location or presentation of the salad dish. It implies that the salad is prepared and presented on a tray, perhaps as part of a larger meal or to be shared among multiple guests. This detail could give clues about the context in which the salad is being enjoyed, such as a party or buffet. To summarize, the most important words in the sentence are \\"salad,\\" \\"broccoli,\\" \\"lettuce,\\" \\"nuts,\\" and \\"serving tray.\\" Each of these words contributes to our understanding of the dish's composition, taste, and presentation."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Alright, imagine we are in a park, where there are lots of trees, people, and animals like squirrels and birds.

Hypothesis: A woman sells bread at the Peruvian market. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Given the premise, we cannot confidently conclude the hypothesis mentioned for a few reasons. Let's analyze the differences and similarities between the elements in both the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: A woman in Peru is selling crafts to customers. This statement provides us with the following information: 1. The seller is a woman. 2. The location is Peru. 3. The items being sold are crafts. 4. There are customers involved in the sales process. Hypothesis: A woman sells bread at the Peruvian market. This statement provides us with the following information: 1. The seller is a woman. 2. The location is Peru. 3. The item being sold is bread. 4. The market setting is specified, which implies the presence of customers. Analyzing the two statements, we can observe the following: 1. Both statements confirm that the seller is a woman, establishing a similarity. 2. Both statements locate the sales in Peru, creating another point of similarity. 3. The items being sold differ. In the premise, the woman is selling crafts, while in the hypothesis, the woman is selling bread. This difference distinguishes the nature of the products being offered. 4. The presence of customers is implied in both statements, although the hypothesis specifically mentions the context of a Peruvian market. In conclusion, while there are similarities between the premise and the hypothesis, such as the gender of the seller and the location of sales, the item being sold is substantially different. Consequently, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is accurate based on the premise provided. The premise clearly states that the woman is selling crafts, and the hypothesis suggests that she is selling bread, which creates a contradiction in the information."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following article and select the best answer.

He looked at two different states of the patient's diaphragm, state A and state B. In state A the the diaphragm contracted, but in state B the diaphragm relaxed. He now needs to figure out other phenomena related to this. Would the air pressure inside lungs increase or decrease in state A? Hint: Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure below ). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon. A:","output":"Based on the hint provided, we can determine whether the air pressure inside the lungs will increase or decrease in state A by following these steps: Step 1: Identify the state of the diaphragm. In state A, the diaphragm is contracted. Step 2: Determine the effect of diaphragm contraction on the chest cavity volume. When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume. Step 3: Determine the effect of larger chest volume on air pressure inside the lungs. A larger chest volume leads to a decrease in air pressure inside the lungs. Step 4: State the result for the given state. In state A, when the diaphragm contracts, the air pressure inside the lungs will decrease."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given the following passage \\"European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination. No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.\\", answer the following question.

Article: Many people rely on a cup of coffee or two to wake them up in the morning or refresh them during the working day, but now a chemist has come up with a speedy alternative to drinking coffee. U.S. biochemist Ben Yu has created 'Sprayable Energy', which claims to be the world's first caffeine - based topical energy spray. He said tired workers can spray a 'shot' of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong noise, taking in unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee. The tasteless caffeine spray is absorbed through the skin and spread through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that lasts longer than drinking a cup of coffee. The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which is very similar to nicotine in structure. Each spray 'Sprayable Energy' contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup. The website said: \\"The reason for this is our product isn't entirely metabolized by the liver before entering your system and becoming available to your body.\\" Sprayable Energy's website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume, such as wrists, the neck or behind the ears, but warns users not to exceed 20 times a day. It claims that after spraying the product on the skin, users will feel awake and focus without being over-excited, which is common with coffee and energy drinks.

[-] No. Answer:","output":"Answer: No. Jordan's behavior cannot simply be described as \\"happy\\" based on the information provided about the situation. The word \\"happy\\" is an emotional state, and it does not directly relate to the act of stealing something from the store and not getting caught. Furthermore, we don't have enough information about Jordan's emotional state during or after the incident to categorize it as \\"happy.\\" To describe Jordan's behavior accurately, we should focus on the actions and the morality of the situation rather than the emotions. In this case, Jordan's behavior can be described as dishonest, unethical, or wrong. Stealing is a morally unacceptable act, and it violates the rights of the store owner and other customers who pay for their items. Even though Jordan did not get caught, it does not justify or validate the negative behavior. Several factors could contribute to why Jordan stole from the store, such as personal beliefs, social influences, financial struggles, or emotional distress. These factors could help in understanding the context behind Jordan's actions, but they still do not make the behavior acceptable or easily describable as \\"happy.\\" In summary, \\"happy\\" is not a valid answer to describe Jordan's behavior because it does not appropriately address the morality or the action involved in stealing from the store and not getting caught. Instead, a more accurate description would focus on the dishonesty, unethics, or wrongdoing of the behavior."},{"instruction":"1. Now to find the indifference bid price solve for formula _ 31 2.

Travel documents usually assure other governments that the bearer may return to the issuing country, and are often issued in booklet form to allow other governments to place visas as well as entry and exit stamps into them. The most common travel document is a passport, which usually gives the bearer more privileges like visa-free access to certain countries. However, the term is sometimes used only for those documents which do not bear proof of nationality, such as a refugee travel document. What's the best answer to this question: is a travel document the same as a passport?","output":"No, a travel document is not the same as a passport, but a passport is a type of travel document. Travel documents encompass a broader category of identity documents issued by governments or international treaty organizations to facilitate international travel, whereas a passport is a specific type of travel document that certifies the identity and nationality of its holder for the purpose of international travel. Passports are usually issued to citizens of a country and include information such as the holder's name, photo, date and place of birth, and a unique identification number. Passport holders often enjoy additional benefits, such as visa-free access to certain countries, based on agreements between nations. Passports are widely accepted as proof of both identity and citizenship. On the other hand, travel documents can include various forms of identification that do not necessarily provide proof of nationality, such as refugee travel documents or stateless person documents. These documents are often issued to individuals who cannot obtain a passport due to their citizenship status or for those who require legal recognition of their right to travel internationally. Travel documents can also include temporary or emergency passports, issued in specific situations or when a standard passport is not readily available. In summary, while a passport is a type of travel document, not all travel documents are passports. Travel documents serve a broader purpose in facilitating international travel, whereas passports specifically certify the identity and nationality of their bearers, often allowing additional privileges like visa-free access to other countries."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Guy reminds her he \\"dragged her out of the gutter to make her a star\\". He's furious that she left him, outraged over her \\"silly Reno divorce\\" and indignant that she is playing around with young men, in particular a struggling writer staying near them at their retreat on the English coast. They argue vehemently until a furious Christine slaps her husband's face four times. He keeps calm except for his eyes, which twitch uncontrollably, and departs.A day or two later, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney), a local writer, happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore and he sees her body on the beach. He runs to get help or call the police and is seen by two young female swimmers who think that he is the escaping murderer.Police arrive and arrest Tisdall on the testimony of the two witnesses. Also, he is known to own a raincoat matching the murder weapon, a belt coiled in the form of a large question mark that lay near the corpse. Robert claims innocence, but in the crowd that has gathered, none believe him.

Options: - street - playground - loud - gymnasium - bowling alley Reasoning process:","output":"1. First, let us eliminate the options that don't make sense in the context of kids throwing a ball around. - \\"Loud\\" is an adjective and doesn't refer to a location, so we can rule this out. 2. Next, let's consider the four remaining options, which are all potential places where children can play with a ball: - Street: Kids might throw a ball around in the street in a casual, unstructured environment. However, this may not be the safest option with cars and traffic. - Playground: A playground is a common outdoor area designed for children to play, making it a sensible location for children to throw a ball around, as it is generally free from hazards. - Gymnasium: A gymnasium is an indoor space that can notably be used for sports and physical education classes, making it another appropriate location for children to throw a ball around. - Bowling alley: While balls are used in bowling, the particular activity of \\"throwing a ball around\\" isn't really practiced at a bowling alley. Bowling alleys are more specialized, where balls are rolled to knock down pins and not thrown randomly. 3. By process of elimination and considering safety factors, we can narrow our options down to \\"playground\\" and \\"gymnasium.\\" Based on the reasoning above, we can conclude that children might throw a ball around at either the playground or the gymnasium.

Options: - exasperation - change of heart - scrutinizing - boredom - read Reasoning process:","output":"When a savvy consumer is presented with proof for the effectiveness of a product that seems too good to be true, it is essential for them to evaluate the authenticity and reliability of this proof. This evaluation process requires careful examination and critical analysis of the evidence provided in order to reach the best conclusion. Taking into consideration the different options listed, using the following steps of reasoning will assist in identifying the best course of action. 1. Eliminate irrelevant options: In this instance, exasperation and boredom don't seem to be relevant to the process of evaluating the proof provided. Both emotions would likely not lead to a better understanding of the product's effectiveness. Thus, they can be eliminated from the list of options. 2. Assess the remaining options: The remaining options include change of heart, scrutinizing, and read. Each of these options represents a different type of response or action. - Change of heart would imply that the consumer is swayed by the seemingly remarkable proof and decides to believe in the product's effectiveness without further examination. However, this is not a characteristic of a savvy consumer, who would typically be more cautious and analytical in their decision-making process. - Scrutinizing, on the other hand, means conducting a close and critical examination of the proof provided. Savvy consumers typically have a healthy skepticism when presented with claims that seem too good to be true, and they would likely investigate the validity of such proof by looking for credible sources, checking for logical fallacies, and considering alternative explanations. - Lastly, read implies that the consumer would look through the provided material but does not necessarily indicate a critical examination of the content. While reading is a necessary step within the scrutiny process, it is not enough to simply read without critically analyzing the proof. 3. Choose the best option: Based on the reasoning process above, it becomes clear that the most appropriate response for a savvy consumer when presented with proof for the effectiveness of a product that seems too good to be true is to scrutinize the evidence. This approach embodies the critical thinking skills that characterize savvy consumers while ensuring they make informed decisions about the products they choose to invest in or support."},{"instruction":"Q:Title: Off the charts funny!

Campbell, Jr. writes a memoir about his career in Nazi Germany. During the buildup to World War II, Campbell, an American playwright of German language stage productions, is approached by War Department operative Frank Wirtanen. Wirtanen asks Campbell to work as a spy for the U.S. in the approaching war, though he promises no reward or recognition. Campbell rejects the offer, but Wirtanen adds that he wants Campbell to take some time to consider, telling him that Campbell's answer will come in the form of how he acts and what positions he assumes once the war begins. In the initial stages of the war, Campbell works his way up through Joseph Goebbels' propaganda organization, eventually becoming the \\"voice\\" of English language anti-Semitic pro-Nazi racist broadcasts aimed at U.S. citizens. Unknown to the Nazis, all of the idiosyncrasies of his speech â deliberate pauses, coughing, etc. â form a secret code that covertly transmits information to Allied forces. Late in the war, after his wife, Helga, is reported killed on the Eastern Front, Campbell visits her family in early 1945 outside Berlin, just before the Red Army arrives, and Helga's younger sister, Resi, confesses that she is in love with him. Eventually, Campbell is captured when a U.S. infantryman recognizes his voice. Before he can be executed, Wirtanen arranges for Campbell's discreet release and helps his relocation to New York City. There, Campbell lives a lonely existence for 15 years, sustained only by memories of Helga and an indifferent curiosity about his eventual fate. Mrs. Epstein, a Holocaust survivor living in Campbell's building, is the only person who suspects his true identity; he seems to avoid her suspicions by feigning ignorance of German.

Many years ago, most workplaces were made with wood floors, which have some cushioning even though they may seem pretty hard to walk on. However, in modern times, most businesses tend to have floors made from concrete, ceramic tile or marble, which have essentially no cushioning, shock absorbency or insulative properties. Consequently, stand in an area that's covered in more springy material such as wood. If that's not possible, then change positions just for the exercise, which will promote blood circulation and may ease the tension in your feet and leg muscles. Concrete and ceramic tile will easily transfer cold to your feet which is not good for blood circulation, so stand in warmer areas without cool drafts. If you work outside, find some grass to stand on while plying your trade or waiting for the next task. Anti-fatigue mats are designed to decrease the stress on your feet and legs by providing a cushioned surface to stand on over prolonged periods of time. These mats are typically made of thick rubber, but some are also made of foam, leather, vinyl or even wood. In many cases, your employer will readily supply you with an anti-fatigue mat if you ask because they are proven to reduce the incidence of feet and lower leg problems. Thick anti-fatigue mats can be a minor hazard at the workplace if people trip over them, so always be aware of where your mat and those of your co-workers are located. Take a look around your workplace and see if there's any carpet you can stand on and still be able to do your job properly. Carpet (even the thin, cheap stuff) provides much more cushion than concrete and will help your feet and legs survive the long shifts at work. If there is no installed carpet at your workplace, ask your boss if you can bring a piece from home. Some businesses that sell carpet will give you a decent sized sample (big enough to stand on) for free. Make sure the underneath side of the carpet doesn't slide too readily on the floor, or else you're at high risk to slip and fall.","output":"This article discusses the negative effects of standing on hard floors in workplaces and provides various solutions, such as using anti-fatigue mats and finding alternative cushioned surfaces, to promote better blood circulation and reduce the stress on feet and leg muscles."},{"instruction":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Alimentum food Italian; Alimentum priceRange high; Alimentum customer rating average; Alimentum area riverside; Alimentum near Yippee Noodle Bar","output":"Alimentum is a fancy Italian food place where people eat yummy pasta and pizza near a beautiful riverside, close to another restaurant called Yippee Noodle Bar, but it costs a lot of money to eat there and people say it is just okay, like getting a smiley face sticker instead of a gold star."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Arabic.

What is the biological term for T H Huxley's theory that all living cells and organisms orginate from pre-existing living matter, not as the result of spontaneous generation?","output":"The biological term for T.H. Huxley's theory that all living cells and organisms originate from pre-existing living matter, rather than as the result of spontaneous generation, is biogenesis. This term is derived from the combination of two Greek words: 'bios,' which means life, and 'genesis,' which means origin or generation. Biogenesis is a fundamental concept in biology that refutes the concept of spontaneous generation, which postulated that living organisms could arise spontaneously from nonliving matter under certain conditions. Biogenesis can be traced back to the 19th century when scientists, such as Louis Pasteur and Thomas Henry Huxley, conducted experiments and gathered evidence supporting the idea that life could only come from pre-existing living matter. This concept was first put forth by the Belgian scientist Jean-Baptiste Van Helmont in the 17th century, who performed experiments implying the presence of a \\"vital force\\" within living organisms. However, it was not until Pasteur's groundbreaking experiments in the mid-19th century that biogenesis began to be widely accepted among the scientific community. Louis Pasteur's experiments, including his famous swan-neck flask experiment, showed that microorganisms did not arise spontaneously from nonliving matter. Instead, he demonstrated that microorganisms were present in the air and could be prevented from contaminating a sterilized growth medium by using a curved flask. This effectively disproved the idea of spontaneous generation and laid the groundwork for the germ theory of disease. Thomas Henry Huxley, a prominent biologist and comparative anatomist, also played a crucial role in supporting the theory of biogenesis. Huxley was a staunch advocate of the cell theory, which states that all living organisms are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from pre-existing cells. Huxley's investigations into embryology and the microscopic anatomy of various organisms helped to provide further evidence that new cells and organisms could only arise from pre-existing living matter, thereby reinforcing the concept of biogenesis. In conclusion, the biological term for T.H. Huxley's theory that all living cells and organisms originate from pre-existing living matter is biogenesis. This theory, which rejects the concept of spontaneous generation, is a fundamental principle of biology with significant implications for our understanding of the origins and development of life. Over time, as experimental evidence has continued to mount, biogenesis has become a widely accepted theory that serves as the foundation for our modern understanding of cell theory, germ theory, and the processes of reproduction and growth in living organisms."},{"instruction":"Answer based on context: The Texans began their 2007 campaign at home against the Kansas City Chiefs.

Báthory decided to enter into the election; in the meantime he had to defeat another attempt by Bekes to challenge his authority in Transylvania, which he did by defeating Bekes at the Battle of Sinpaul. On 12 December 1575, after an interregnum of roughly one and a half years, primate of Poland Jakub Uchański, representing a pro-Habsburg faction, declared Emperor Maximilian II as the new monarch. However, chancellor Jan Zamoyski and other opponents of Habsburgs persuaded many of the lesser nobility to demand a Piast king, a Polish king.

Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Irish War of Independence or Anglo-Irish War or the Tan War was a guerrilla war fought from 1919 to 1921 between the Irish Republican Army (IRA, the army of the Irish Republic) and the British security forces in Ireland. It was an escalation of the Irish revolutionary period into armed conflict. - The Home Rule League (18731882), sometimes called the Home Rule Party or the Home Rule Confederation, was a political party which campaigned for home rule for Ireland within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, when it was replaced by the Irish Parliamentary Party. - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\". - The Irish Free State (; 6 December 192229 December 1937) was an independent state established in 1922 under the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921. That treaty ended the three-year Irish War of Independence between the forces of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), and British Crown forces. - The Acts of Union 1800 (sometimes erroneously referred to as a single Act of Union 1801) united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with effect from 1 January 1801. Both Acts, though since amended, still remain in force in the United Kingdom, but have been repealed in the Republic of Ireland. - The Irish Republic (or ) was a revolutionary state that declared its independence from Britain in January 1919. In theory the Republic covered the whole island of Ireland, but by 1920 its functional control was limited to only 21 of Ireland's 32 counties, and British state forces maintained presence across much of the north-east, as well as Cork, Dublin and other major towns.

You can predict the angle of the reflected light. Imagine a ball bouncing off a surface. Light can do the same thing. That is, assuming the surface is shiny. So how do you know where light will go after it strikes a shiny surface? It depends on how the light initially strikes the shiny object. Light does not always go straight toward a surface. Therefore, not all light bounces straight back. Sometimes, light can hit a surface at an angle. The angle at which it strikes the surface tells us how it will bounce off. While light is different to a ball, they react in a similar manner. Many sports rely on knowledge of reflection. Pool players know a lot about reflection. They take great care when they strike the pool ball. They need it to go to a certain place. They know the angle it will hit the side of the pool table.

Formed in 1995, the band was a major player in the mid-1990s emo scene, otherwise known as the \\"second wave\\" of emo music. As they gained prominence, they began touring with bands such as Green Day and Weezer before becoming headliners themselves, eventually embarking on international tours of Japan and Europe. They founded Heroes & Villains Records, an imprint of the successful indie rock label Vagrant Records. After signing to Doghouse, the band drove to Chicago to record their debut full-length album with producer Bob Weston of Shellac. The album was recorded in only two days, with the band leaving on Friday after Ryan Pope got out of school and finishing in the early hours of Sunday morning. Two months after recording the album, the band embarked on their first national tour with Braid and Ethel Meserve with the first date of the tour taking place the day after Ryan's high school graduation. It was on that tour that the band met James Dewees, the new drummer for Coalesce while the bands were playing together in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. After the show, the members of the two bands became close friends, eventually leading them to record a split 7-inch produced by Ed Rose entitled \\"The Get Up Kids / Coalesce\\". For the split, each band covered one of the other's songs in their own style. Coalesce did a post-hardcore cover of \\"Second Place\\", and The Get Up Kids recorded a power-pop rendition of \\"Harvest of Maturity\\". A few months later, the band released their debut full-length record Four Minute Mile, bringing a great deal of attention from critics, fans and labels alike. The band was invited to join Braid on their 1998 tour of Europe and the band rapidly created an overseas fanbase. While the band was receiving rapidly increasing national and international attention, they became unhappy with Doghouse Records' ability to keep up with the increasing popularity of the band. The Get Up Kids' announcement to leave Doghouse Records brought interest from prominent record labels including Sub Pop, Geffen and Mojo Records. The band made a decision to sign to Mojo, but before the contracts were signed, they began to have second thoughts. The main issue was over the label's insistence on owning merchandising rights, a large source of the band's income. Moreover, the band was insulted the label requested they re-record \\"Don't Hate Me\\" from Four Minute Mile for their next record, feeling that the label believed it was \\"the best that [they could] write\\". Before the deal with Mojo was official, the band met Rich Egan, founder of Los Angeles-based Vagrant Records.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction.

Dionay Smith, 24, was found fatally shot at around 8 p.m. Sunday in his home in the 1400 block of Argyle Ave. in the Upton neighborhood, Baltimore Police Lt. Jeremy Silbert said. He was the 173rd person to be killed in Baltimore this year. His older brother went public with his own grief in a Facebook post and in an interview with a Sun reporter. \\"I'm a public person, and this brings everything that I've been talking about full circle,\\" T.J. Smith said in the interview. \\"My brother was a good kid.

No one else's family should ever have to get this phone call.\\" In the 48 hours after Dionay's death, there were at least three more homicides in Baltimore: Malcolm Parker, 47; Charlie Stevenson, 54; and Ronnie Banks, 56, bringing the total of deaths in 2017 to 176. As part of Smith's job, he is notified of every homicide in the city. In the interview, he described his shocked disbelief when he recognized his brother's name. \\"One of the names I heard was way too familiar,\\" he said. \\"My brother is the only person I've ever known with the name Dionay.

I immediately contacted investigators to learn more about the Dionay who was found deceased from a gunshot wound. I also called his cellphone several times. Of course, there was no answer.\\" There have been no arrests, Silbert said. But police released surveillance video of two men entering the building where Dionay Smith lived.

Smith said that his brother, the father of three toddlers, worked two jobs to support his family and volunteered his time in the Kids Safe Zone, which provides a safe setting in which children can play. Dionay Smith's children — two boys and a girl, all 2 years old — had spent the day at their father's home, but left a short time before he was shot, T.J. Smith said. \\"He was really good-hearted,\\" T.J. Smith said. \\"He had defied a number of odds, and he was doing every single thing he could to do the right thing.\\" Despite a significant age difference, the brothers were close, T.J. Smith said.

I had the plant for two months, and every day I looked at it, but there weren't any flowers or pleasant smell. I was not happy, so I gave the plant to my friend Linda. One day, another friend Mary called and invited me to her office. When I walked in, her jasmine flowers surprised me. I reached out to touch the flowers. Mary cut some and gave them to me. I couldn't help smelling them. Surrounded by the sweet smell of only a handful of these flowers, I suddenly understood something. Mary bought her plant the same time I did.

She was 19 yrs older than me and had been living in Colorado since I was young. I was born and raised in N.J. I did not see her she did not come to see us. I was grown, married, had children and was living in FL. when she showed up at my door with her husband. I was shocked since we never heard from her and I did not know she even knew where I lived. She stayed all of about 20 minutes, just long enough to very unpleasantly state that “my father is NOT your father and I am NOT your sister!” I always wondered why my mom hated me SO much, I found out that both my mom and “dad\\" were having affairs while married and both had children by someone else. I have never met my birth father (to my knowledge) only know his name, but understand that he was the father of my supposed half-brother (which would make him my only whole sibling out of seven siblings.)

On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica.

In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. Therefore, a protectorate remains an autonomous part of a sovereign state. They are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of. However, a state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - The Mascarene Islands (or Mascarenhas Archipelago) is a group of islands in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar consisting of Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues. The collective title is derived from the Portuguese navigator Pedro Mascarenhas, who first visited them in the early sixteenth century. The islands share a common geologic origin in the volcanism of the Réunion hotspot beneath the Mascarene Plateau and form a distinct ecoregion with a unique flora and fauna. - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states.

It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories. - Colonies in antiquity were city-states founded from a mother-city (its \\"metropolis\\"), not from a territory-at-large. Bonds between a colony and its metropolis remained often close, and took specific forms. However, unlike in the period of European colonialism during the early and late modern era, ancient colonies were usually sovereign and self-governing from their inception. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent.

From 1849 to 1923 , half a million Indian indentured labourers passed through the Immigration Depot , to be transported to plantations throughout the British Empire . The large - scale migration of the laborers left an indelible mark on the societies of many former British colonies , with Indians constituting a substantial proportion of their national populations . In Mauritius alone , 68 percent of the current total population is of Indian ancestry . The Immigration Depot has thus become an important reference point in the history and cultural identity of Mauritius . Unchecked infrastructural development in the mid- 20th century means that only the partial remains of three stone buildings from the entire complex have survived . These are now protected as a national monument , under the Mauritian national heritage legislation . The Immigration Depot 's role in social history was recognized by UNESCO when it was declared a World Heritage Site in 2006 . The site is under the management of the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund . Conservation efforts are underway to restore the fragile buildings back to their 1860s state . - In politics and history, a colony is a territory under the immediate political control of a state, distinct from the home territory of the sovereign. For colonies in antiquity, city-states would often found their own colonies.

Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called \\"Illyric\\", \\"Slavic\\", \\"Slavonian\\", \\"Bosnian\\", \\"Dalmatian\\", \\"Serbian\\" or \\"Croatian\\". As such, the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language \\"Serbian\\" or \\"Croatian\\", respectively, without implying a distinction between the two, and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \\"Bosnian\\", \\"Croatian\\", and \\"Serbian\\" were considered to be three names of a single official language. Croatian linguist Dalibor Brozović advocated the term Serbo-Croatian as late as 1988, claiming that in an analogy with Indo-European, Serbo-Croatian does not only name the two components of the same language, but simply charts the limits of the region in which it is spoken and includes everything between the limits (‘Bosnian’ and ‘Montenegrin’). Today, use of the term \\"Serbo-Croatian\\" is controversial due to the prejudice that nation and language must match. It is still used for lack of a succinct alternative, though alternative names have been used, such as Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (BCS), which is often seen in political contexts such as the Hague War Crimes tribunal.

Unele dintre aceste țări au experimentat abuzuri sistematice și încălcări grave ale drepturilor omului, inclusiv tortură, execuții extrajudiciare și detenție ilegală. De asemenea, mulți cetățeni din aceste țări se confruntă cu restricții severe asupra libertății de exprimare, libertății de întrunire și de asociere, iar liderii guvernamentali sunt adesea vinovați de corupție și nepotism. Este esențial ca Uniunea Europeană să promoveze și să susțină protecția și respectarea drepturilor omului în întreaga lume. Acest lucru înseamnă nu numai să critice și să denunțe cazurile de încălcare a drepturilor omului, ci și să ofere asistență țărilor care își doresc să își îmbunătățească situația drepturilor omului și să își respecte angajamentele internaționale în acest domeniu. Prin urmare, ar trebui să încurajăm statele membre ale UE să coopereze strâns cu mecanismele consolidate ale ONU pentru drepturile omului, cum ar fi Raportorii Speciali, Grupurile de Lucru și Comisiile de Anchetă. De asemenea, statele membre ar trebui să continue să susțină angajamentul activ al Uniunii Europene cu Consiliul pentru Drepturile Omului al ONU și să faciliteze dialogul și colaborarea cu organizațiile societății civile în toate țările. În plus, ar trebui să solicităm ca dezbaterile despre încălcările drepturilor omului să fie tratate în mod echitabil și fără discriminare în sieul Consiliului pentru Drepturile Omului al ONU. Aceasta ar asigura că toate țările, indiferent de statutul lor politic sau economic, sunt responsabile pentru respectarea drepturilor omului, în conformitate cu angajamentele internaționale și acordurile la care au aderat. În concluzie, este vital ca statele membre ale UE să denunțe încălcările drepturilor omului în întreaga lume, fără a se limita doar la situațiile menționate în rezoluție.

Harry, who is now back at school, described what happened to him. \\"When I began to hiccup, I drank a glass of water but that didn't do any good. That evening I had hiccups every four seconds. We tried everything to stop them. I held my breath and drank cold drinks. My father even tried to give me a shock but that didn't work either.\\" After a week of sleepless nights, he went to hospital. The doctors took an X-ray of his chest but they couldn't find anything wrong. \\"They gave me some medicine and my hiccups slowed down, but it was another week before the medicine worked completely and my hiccups stopped.\\" Harry was very lucky.

A) drank a glass of water B) went to hospital C) ate an Indian meal D) finished his homework Answer:","output":"The answer to the question is not explicitly mentioned in the passage provided. However, based on the information about Harry Mendes and Charles Osborne, we can make an educated guess. In the passage, it is mentioned that Harry Mendes tried various methods like drinking water and holding his breath, but none of them worked. The doctors also couldn't find anything wrong with him upon examination. Charles Osborne, the world record holder, hiccupped for sixty-eight years and it stopped in 1990 without any known reason. These descriptions lead us to think that the cause of hiccups for both individuals is not clear and might not be related to any specific actions or events such as eating a particular meal or finishing homework. Considering this, and since the passage does not provide any context or information about Charles Osborne drinking a glass of water or going to hospital before his hiccups started, we can deduce that options A and B are not correct. Similarly, there is no mention of an Indian meal or homework completion related to Charles Osborne’s hiccups, so options C and D can also be ruled out. In conclusion, as per the details provided in the passage, we cannot definitively answer when Charles Osborne's hiccups started. However, the key takeaway from the passage is that the origins and causes of persistent hiccups can be unclear and challenging to determine - as demonstrated by both Harry Mendes and Charles Osborne's experiences. Without additional information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact moment or reason behind the start of Charles Osborne's hiccups."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"An older man is doing a karate pose.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A man sleeping on a couch.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

He reveals his villainous intentions – to assume control of multiple military outposts around the world and secure his position as a new world power. Act 2: Stark learns about Stane's treachery and races against time to prevent his former friend from executing his twisted goals. Along the way, Stark grapples with the moral implications of weaponizing his Iron Man suits and the potential collateral damage. As Stane's first target, he seizes control of a cutting-edge, strategic military outpost in an undisclosed location. This outpost controls a network of advanced missile defense systems and intelligence monitoring capabilities that could shift the balance of power in his favor.

What follows is a list of some of these untruths and some tips to help you do your best at your next interview. Myth 1: The aim of interviewing is to obtain (means \\"get\\") a job offer. Only half true. The real aim of an interview is to obtain the job you want. That often means rejecting job offers you don't want! So before you please an employer, be sure you want the job. Myth 2: Always please the interviewer Not true. Try to please yourself. Of course, don't be hostile--nobody wants to hire someone disagreeable. But there is plainly a muddle ground between being too ingratiating and being hostile. Myth 3: Try to control the interview Nobody \\"controls\\" an interview. When someone tries to control us, we resent it. When we try to control others, they resent us. Remember you can't control what an employer thinks of you, just as he can't control what you think of him. So he is ready to give and take when being interviewed; never control the interview. Myth 4: Never interrupt the interviewer Study the style of the effective conversationalists: they interrupt and are interrupted! An exciting conversation always makes us feel free--free to interrupt, to disagree, to agree enthusiastically. Just _ Try being yourself for a change. Employers will either like or dislike you, but at least you'll have made an impression. Leaving an employer indifferent is the worst impression you can make.

The moment you wake up, keep your eyes closed and try to remember as much of the night's dreams as possible. Record everything you can remember. Avoid creating a plot in your dream if there isn’t one. Don’t try to interpret the dream while you’re recording it. Title each dream.\\"","output":"Title: Unlock Your Subconscious: Embracing Dream Journals for Personal Growth Introduction Many of us surely have experienced the fascinating, sometimes bizarre and puzzling world of dreams. These nightly narratives stir up a cacophony of emotions, ranging from joy to fear and everything in between. Interestingly enough, our dreams have the potential to open doors to our subconscious and offer insights into our inner selves. One effective way to harness this wellspring of information is by keeping a dream journal. In this article, we will discuss why and how to keep a dream journal, as well as the benefits it offers for your personal growth. Step-by-Step Approach to Keeping a Dream Journal 1. Place your dream journal next to your bed: To ensure you remember as much of your dreams as possible, keep a dedicated journal and a pen on your bedside table, within easy reach. This setup encourages you to record your dreams right away, maximizing the chances of retaining crucial details while they are still fresh in your mind. 2. Upon waking, keep your eyes closed: As you wake up, fight the urge to open your eyes and move about. Instead, keep your eyes closed and remain as still as possible to retain your connection to your dreams. 3. Remember and record: Try to recall your dreams, replaying them in your head and focusing on any images, emotions, or sensations that stand out. Once you have a vivid recollection, open your eyes and begin recording what you remember, jotting down even the most minor details. Write in the present tense to help maintain the immediacy of the dream. 4. Avoid creating a plot: Dreams can often be disjointed and enigmatic. When recording your dream, refrain from constructing a linear plot or cohesive storyline if none is apparent. Simply describe the events, emotions, and impressions as they occurred, and resist the temptation to make assumptions or fill in gaps. 5. Don't interpret the dream while recording: During the initial documentation process, focus solely on capturing your dream in its purest form. Avoid assigning meaning or interpreting the events at this stage. This practice preserves the sanctity of the dream, allowing for a more genuine and accurate reflection when you revisit it later. 6. Title each dream: Properly categorizing and organizing your dream entries will aid you in identifying patterns, themes, and recurring symbols. Assigning an evocative and descriptive title to each dream can help you remember its unique elements and navigate your entries more efficiently. Benefits of Keeping a Dream Journal 1. Enhanced self-awareness: By regularly recording and revisiting your dreams, you are diving into the realm of your subconscious. This practice can lead to a deeper understanding of your emotions, desires, fears, and motivations, subsequently fostering personal growth and emotional resilience. 2. Improved problem-solving skills: Dreams can often present unique and imaginative solutions to real-life issues. Analyzing your dreams can provide fresh perspectives and possibilities, encouraging creative thinking and enhanced problem-solving abilities. 3. Strengthened memory and cognitive skills: The act of recalling and recording dreams can improve both your short-term and long-term memory. This habit demands mental and cognitive rigor, which ultimately helps in sharpening memory retention and concentration. 4. Increased emotional well-being: Confronting the emotions within your dreams promotes self-exploration and emotional healing. By addressing underlying feelings and unresolved issues, you can cultivate emotional well-being and a more balanced state of mind. Conclusion Embarking on a dream journaling journey can be an exciting and revelatory endeavor. Taking advantage of these nocturnal narratives offers a unique window into the depths of your subconscious and ultimately leads to self-discovery, personal growth, and heightened cognitive function. So, why wait? Place a journal next to your bed tonight and embark on this enlightening adventure of self-reflection."},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve -78125 + 76149 = 104*j for j.

The subject of the paper is abiotic stress. For his paper, he is analyzing two different forests of differing stress levels and writing about the differences seen in the environments. For the area with a low level of stress Henry chose the Narshe Forest, located near the mountains of Harkal. The area of high stress that Henry will be looking at is the Midgar forest. After choosing the two areas, Henry feels he deserves a break from his paper and goes to watch a baseball game. But I can use this background: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. What is an answer for this question: Will the animal population be higher or lower in the Midgar forest? A:","output":"Given the background information on how abiotic stress affects biodiversity, it can be expected that the animal population will be lower in the Midgar forest compared to the Narshe forest. This is because the Midgar forest is described as having a high level of abiotic stress, which typically leads to reduced biodiversity and consequently lower animal populations. In contrast, the Narshe Forest has a low level of stress, resulting in higher biodiversity and animal populations. It is important to note that the relationship between abiotic stress and endangered species suggests that species in the Midgar forest are more likely to be population threatened, endangered, or even extinct due to the harsher abiotic stress conditions."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: Isn't Fidel an individual?","output":"Step 1: Identify the words and phrases in the sentence. - Isn't: contraction of \\"is not\\" - Fidel: a proper noun (a name) - an individual: a single person, unique Step 2: Translate each part of the sentence to Czech. - Isn't (is not): není - Fidel: Fidel (the name stays the same) - an individual: jedinec Step 3: Construct the Czech sentence with the translated parts. - Není Fidel jedinec?

Regardless of the plantâs age or hardiness, nearly every variety is affected.â So began a 2003 article in the Montreal Gazette on the state of symphonic affairs in North America. At the time, some 47 ensembles were in dire financial straits. Many well-regarded smaller orchestras in the U.S. were on the brink of closing (including the San Antonio and Tulsa symphonies) and even the most venerable and formerly rich ensembles (including two of the so-called âBig Fiveâ orchestras, the New York Philharmonic and the Cleveland Symphony) had to retrench. North of the border, the once-robust Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra had run up a debilitating 3-million deficit and the Toronto Symphony was reeling from a three-fold humiliation: in a cluster of events around the turn of the millennium, the ensemble nearly went bankrupt, the players walked out, as did the conductor, Jukka-Pekka Saraste; for a time, no suitable candidate could be found to take up the baton. In 2003, the experts agreed that an orchestral ice age was in the offing. They were wrong. âThree years ago, all around there were these sob stories — orchestras were complaining that everything was on the wane and dying,â says Bramwell Tovey, music director and conductor for the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. âWeâve turned a corner, though.â After more than a half-century of resolutely resisting change in the name of purism, our symphonies, with nothing to lose, began experimenting, and have largely succeeded in bulking up their audiences and making a start at balancing their books. Insiders remain edgy, worried about the future. They voice concerns about the efficacy of subscriptions (younger people tend not to book in advance) and the increasing scarcity of patrons willing to donate money and time to orchestras. But overall, the mood has become markedly more bullish in the orchestral world. Some have belatedly turned to technology, using live video during concerts and setting up internet chat rooms for their often amusingly rabid fans. Others are expanding their playlists to include, for example, the various Star Wars themes written by Canadian-based film composer John Williams, or putting on concerts with pop artists (as the VSO did in recent gigs with Jann Arden and Spirit of the West). Theyâre also offering pre- and post-concert discussions with audiences to make the experience less daunting to the uninitiated. In this time, even maestros with credentials from the oldest of old schools have given themselves makeovers, learning to downplay the hauteur that was their traditional stock in trade and transforming themselves into amiable hosts of an evening out. The change began quietly, almost a decade ago â before the crisis really erupted â at one of the nationâs oldest orchestras, the Regina Symphony. Their conductor and music director, Victor Sawa, started introducing the pieces to be played, sharing with concertgoers gossip about the composers, discussing the artistic movements that gave rise to the compositions in question and commenting on the music to follow (ânote especially the shift in mood when the cellos come inâ). This may not seem so revolutionary, but traditionally, the maestroâs job was simply to pace majestically onto the stage and conduct the pieces, not to coddle the audience with impromptu music appreciation lessons. âWeâve done a great job of selling a certain idea of classical in the last 100 years,â says Rob Gold, senior marketing manager at Ottawaâs National Arts Centre Orchestra. âThe vision is one with a dark and stormy maestro, grand soloists with flying capes and long white hair, and in the audience, furs and tuxedos.â The crowd of upper-crust habituÃ©s also knew what was required of them: that they worship politely, clap at the right moments (never between movements), donate generously (so as to see their names in the program) and dress snappily (to show their respect for the privilege conferred on them). The fastest baton in the east: Peter Oundjian conducts the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Courtesy TSO. No longer. At a spring concert by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, its new music director and conductor â Canadian-born, English-bred Peter Oundjian â introduced an evening of Viennese music by speculating idly on why the Austrian capital became the classical powerhouse it did in the 18th and 19th centuries. The crowd was noticeably younger than in days gone by, many taking advantage of the symphonyâs cheap-tickets-for-under-30s program. âPerhaps if Mozartâs father hadnât been so difficult, he wouldnât have left Salzburg for Vienna,â began Oundjian in his slightly English accent, an accent that still bestows cultural authority on its user. âIf Beethoven hadnât become so disillusioned with Napoleon,â he continued, âmaybe the composer would have left Vienna for France.â Little thought-provokers; nothing too heavy. Of the most challenging pieces on his program, he declared, âItâs not easy, not a quickly appreciated piece, but the orchestra just loves it.â With that intro, weâre left puzzling as we listen, trying to figure out what, precisely, these seasoned musicians admire about the piece. Oundjian is a man with the most blue-chip of classical educations (from Juilliard and Londonâs Royal College of Music); a former violinist with the world-renowned Tokyo Quartet, heâs trying to entice us, without condescension, into his world. Still, the indoctrination isnât always so painless. When asked what sorts of questions he has to field in post-show meetings with audiences, Tovey snorts, âItâs stuff like, why do all the violinists turn the page at the same time, what does the conductor really do, why are viola players playing bigger instruments than the violinists?â When I point my finger, that means a tympani solo: Conductor Bramwell Tovey. Courtesy Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. More revolutionary still than the pre- and post-concert talks (at least, in this traditionally reactionary sphere) are the technological experiments essayed by Tovey at the VSO. In an effort to bolster dipping attendance, two years ago the Vancouver ensemble (with the help of local film schools) introduced live video at several of their concerts. âThere were some glitches at first,â Tovey admits, on a break from a summer tour conducting the Luxembourg Symphony and the prestigious New York Philharmonic. âEarly on, we had a camera that inadvertently focused for a long time on my shoes.â But the glitches were soon corrected, and audience numbers for the video concerts have taken off. The screens show close-ups of performers during the performance and, for new compositions, often feature interviews with the composers beforehand. A former conductor of Londonâs Saddlers Wells orchestra and the Winnipeg Symphony, Tovey remembers a particularly effective use of the screens. âWhen the violinist Vadim Gluzman came to Vancouver in the fall of last year, he played the Tchaikovsky Concerto,â Tovey recalls. âThe [Stradivarius] that he plays used to belong to Leopold Auer, who was the violinist who played most of Tchaikovskyâs material but told Tchaikovsky that the concerto was unplayable. Everyone in the building wanted to look at the violin — the instrument so connected to the music — which they could, over the screens.â Conductor-violinist Pinchas Zukerman, one of the leading figures in the international classical music establishment, has also been an unlikely convert to the technology, using video screens for Ottawaâs National Arts Centre Orchestraâs habitually sold-out childrenâs concerts. Not everyone is a fan, however — the TSOâs Oundjian finds the live video, with its several seconds of delay, distracting for the players. As yet, no ensemble in Canada has gone as far as the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which recently played a program of video-game music, displaying graphics above the troupe and speeches between sets by leading game creators. Let's do it for the kids: Conductor Pinchas Zukerman with the National Arts Centre Orchestra. Courtesy National Arts Centre. Concerts for children, like those offered at the NAC, have also become commonplace across the country. Some troupes are considering going further along the get-them-while-theyâre-young road. Englandâs London Symphony Orchestra recently pioneered a set of hands-on workshops for babies and toddlers, and several Canadian ensembles are considering trying them out after seeing them in action at a conference held by the umbrella group, Orchestras Canada, in the other London â London, Ontario. âWhen I first heard that I needed to recruit 10 babies between six and 12 months of age for a hands-on workshop to be delivered by the visiting members of the London Symphony,â says Katherine Carleton, executive director of Orchestras Canada, âI thought, âGood God, what mayhem will break out.ââ But the babies behaved, shaking their rattles in time, learning about loud and soft, and moving to the music. âI have to believe theyâll grow up enjoying the music more,â Carleton says. âMost people who enjoy classical have that door opened sometime in their youth.â Again, this trend is getting its legs first out west — a high-rise developer near the VSOâs home, the Orpheum, has reserved two lower floors for a state-of-the-art education centre. But for all the positives, thereâs still some naysaying in the orchestral community. Some groups arenât yet out of the woods — this spring, the players with the Orchestre symphonique de MontrÃ©al walked out, leaving one of the nationâs top two groups (the OSM and the TSO share bragging rights) in limbo, at least until incoming music director Kent Nagano arrives next year. And Carleton is particularly concerned with whether the younger portion of the symphony audience will continue to support the symphonies beyond buying tickets. âThe new audiences,â she says, âtend to think of orchestras more as providers of entertainment than as charities. They donât see why they would give donations to the Toronto Blue Jays or to the Mirvishes or the Rolling Stones, so why give to symphonies.â Sheâs also worried about the change in listening habits. âHow do we deal with moving away from mass culture, with people looking for an increasingly personalized iPod-shuffle kind of approach?â she asks rhetorically. âI know some sophisticated music listeners who include classical music in their diet of songs going through their earphones on a regular basis, but in the context of an incredibly diverse array of music: electronica, world music, jazz. A lot of that music is just fantastic.â Still, in an unguarded moment, Carleton admits happier days are, for the present at least, here again for the orchestras. âThereâs this superstition in the orchestral community â if things are going really well, you never admit it.â Write a title for it.","output":"Reviving the Symphony: How North American Orchestras Adapted and Thrived in the Face of Crisis"},{"instruction":"taking aim at both the royal family who stripped her of a title and the media that hounded her , princess diana 's brother saturday hailed her a \`\` very british girl who transcended nationalities .

Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Who will cause more carbon dioxide to be used in the ponds near their farm? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","output":"Bobby will cause more carbon dioxide to be used in the ponds near their farm. This is because he has dramatically increased his use of fertilizer due to the large order of potatoes. The rain dissolves the fertilizer in the soil, and runoff carries it to the nearby ponds.

I sat down and the girl immediately got to work. She started the sanding down of the nail and applied the white tips...and this is when it started to go down hill. The girl was distracted and said she had to do something in the back, but would be back in a moment. So I said okay...no biggie. I can wait a minute. The guy sitting next to her said he would finish for her (which is a good thing, because she didn't come back for about 20 minutes). So I moved over and he started his work. Everything was going as normal...until he started to apply the \\"gel.\\" The \\"gel\\" came in powder form. Hmmm...gel...in powder form? How does that even make sense? OH, yeah...that would be because it isn't gel. It's acrylic and they use a gel topcoat/nail polish on top. Yet, they charge you more. It's a total scam. Regardless, I was leaving town the next day and just let them do their thing. After I paid and left I really started looking at my nails...and they were CROOKED! Not only was the filing off (completely lopsided on a few nails - luckily that can be remedied with a nail file), but so were a couple of the tips! When she put them on, she didn't even check to make sure they were straight! To make matters worse, these nails yellowed! That can happen when a cheap acrylic is used and is exposed to any type of UV light, aka tanning beds...or if you spend an excessive amount of time outside. I thought maybe it was just the surface that yellowed, but when I got them taken off today (in favor of REAL gel nails at another salon) I noticed they were yellowed all the way through! IF it's yellow all the way through, it's most likely that you have cheap or even toxic MMA Acrylic on your nails!! Needless to say, while their pedicures are nice...I will not be frequenting this place again...ESPECIALLY for nails.","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mixed, with predominantly negative feelings towards the experience. The reviewer initially expresses satisfaction and delight with their first visit to the establishment, particularly in regard to the cleanliness and quality of the pedicure service provided. The positive sentiment also comes through when the reviewer commends the calf and foot massage, as well as the prompt (initial) service for the gel nails. However, the review takes a significant turn for the worse as the reviewer recounts the series of events associated with their gel nail service. The negative sentiment becomes more evident as the author describes issues with the staff's attention and focus, the type of product used, and the overall quality and appearance of the final result. The reviewer feels misled by the salon's claim to use gel, rather than acrylic nail products, and expresses disappointment in the crooked and discolored nature of the resulting nail job. The fact that the discolored nails could be an indication of cheap or potentially toxic acrylic materials further exacerbates the negative sentiment and leads the reviewer to assert that they will not be returning, especially for nail services, despite the satisfaction they felt with the pedicure."},{"instruction":"Read the below conversation.

With a neat ginger beard and a rifle slung over his shoulder, he addresses fellow Muslims back in Germany from his new home in northern Syria. In a 9-minute video released by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), he explains that he took his name from Osama bin Laden, because \\"he hit the head of injustice, and he is the one who terrorized [the West] as they terrorized us. Since they did not stop doing this, we will treat them in kind.\\" He asks his audience: \\"Are you happy with your life in Germany?

This assumption is mainly due to Abu Usama's direct address to the German Muslim population, insinuating that Germany may be a prime target for ISIS's actions. By mentioning life in Germany, as well as his new home in northern Syria, he is drawing connections between the two locations, suggesting that Germany may be chosen as an immediate target for extremist groups such as ISIS. The fact that Abu Usama took his name from Osama bin Laden, the notorious al-Qaeda leader responsible for the 9/11 attacks on the United States, further highlights the connection to terrorist activities targeting Western interests. By openly expressing admiration for bin Laden's actions, he is sending a clear message to other extremist groups and potential supporters that the goal is to disrupt and attack Western countries, such as Germany, that he perceives as being unjust to Muslims. Moreover, targeting Germany's interests overseas rather than within the country itself can be viewed as a strategic move by the extremist groups or ISIS. By doing so, they are able to instill fear and tension with a lesser risk of immediate retaliation from the German authorities or military. Furthermore, attacking German interests overseas may potentially catch Germany off-guard and less prepared in comparison to encountering such attacks on their homeland. Additional reasons for focusing on Germany's interests overseas may be due to the country's involvement in the Global Coalition Against Daesh, which aims to defeat ISIS through military actions, blocking financial resources, and countering the group's propaganda. This coalition's efforts directly impact ISIS operations, making Germany's involvement a possible motive for retaliation from the extremist group. In conclusion, considering the connections drawn between Germany and Abu Usama's message within the 9-minute video, along with the country's involvement in counter-terrorism efforts, it is likely that analysts would focus on potential retaliation against Germany's interests overseas. By choosing this strategy, extremist groups can project their power and influence while instilling fear and uncertainty within the Western society, all while minimizing the risk of direct confrontation."},{"instruction":"Here are two sentences: Bremer will focus on the politics , Garner said , adding that he expects Bremer to arrive in Iraq by next week .

That would be the actual numbers or yards of the field goal Stephen Gostkowski made and of the touchdown (TD) pass to Martellus Bennett. These numbers are not provided in the question, and they can vary from game to game. Keep in mind that a field goal in football is when the ball is kicked through the big tall 'Y' or 'U' shaped posts at the end of the field. This can be from varying distances, but typically, they are kicked from anywhere between 20 to 50 yards out. On the other hand, a TD pass is when a player throws the ball to another player who catches it in the endzone. This can also vary in distance, but is usually made from closer range, within the 20-yard line. To show you how to find the difference, here's a little example. Let's say, in this imaginary game, Gostkowski made a field goal from 45 yards out and Bennett caught a TD pass 15 yards away. The difference between the two would be calculated by subtracting the smaller number (Bennett's 15 yards) from the bigger number (Gostkowski's 45 yards). So the answer would be 45 - 15 = 30. So, in our pretend game, there would be a 30 yard difference between Gostkowski's field goal and Bennett's TD pass. Remember, we just used made up numbers for this example. The real numbers may be different depending on the game.

One day, they cross paths with the renowned and reclusive composer Armand Spinet who is in desperate need of their unique skills. Together, they uncover a secret society plotting to control the world through the power of music, and embark on a daring quest to save the world, all while discovering more about themselves along the way. Act I: Bernard Labiche and Gustave Didont are a duo of quirky burglars with a shared passion for classical music. They plan heists around the musical compositions that inspire them and have gained some notoriety and a criminal following. One night, as they drunkenly celebrate their latest successful robbery, they receive a mysterious message asking for their skills in an unexpected heist. Intrigued, they set up a meeting with the mysterious composer Armand Spinet, a genius musician who has disappeared from public life for a decade due to personal tragedy. Act II: At the meeting, Spinet reveals his true intentions: he has recently discovered a secret society called the Symphony, which uses rare and mystical musical instruments to manipulate the world's political and social events. The organization is led by a mysterious figure known only as the Maestro. Spinet admits that he was once a member of the Symphony but has become disillusioned with their intentions. He now seeks to dismantle their power by stealing these instruments, which are guarded in the Maestro's secret vault. Nevertheless, stealing the instruments is not an easy task. They must first decode a complex musical cipher, leading them through various obstacles and trials inspired by famous musical compositions. Along the way, they are pursued by the Maestro's enforcer, a skilled assassin named Timpani, who has a personal grudge against Labiche from a past heist gone wrong. Act III: As Labiche and Didont manage to decode the cipher and navigate the perilous obstacles, they eventually infiltrate the Symphony's secret fortress, only to find that the instruments are guarded by a small orchestra of brainwashed musicians playing a deadly melody that can manipulate minds. Didont, a gifted musician himself, manages to counter the melody using his own violin, breaking the spell over the guards and allowing them to confront the Maestro. In the climactic final battle, the Maestro uses his mastery of the mystical instruments to unleash powerful sound waves that threaten our heroes. With their combined expertise, Labiche, Didont, and Spinet destroy the instruments and defeat the Maestro, saving the world from the tyranny of the Symphony. In the aftermath, Labiche and Didont have a newfound appreciation for music, choosing to use their talents for good instead of crime. As for Spinet, his time with the thieves has helped him find renewed purpose and inspiration, and he returns to the world of music with a powerful new composition that incorporates elements from their shared adventure."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: It's time you started eating sensibly. Experts at the first Chinese Students Nutrition and Health Festival in Kunming last week listed eight bad eating habits. *Watching television while having meals or snacks. Doing this means you don't pay attention to your food, forget how full you are, and so overeat. It can also cause digestion diseases. One way to avoid this is only to eat in certain areas of your home. * Replacing meals with snacks. Many students think that eating small snacks can help them diet. But it often results in overeating and health problems related to a lack of vegetables, carbohydrates ,proteins and vitamins. Snacking only works if it is well planned and includes healthy foods such as nuts, vegetables, fruit and yogurt. *Having drinks rather than water. Fizzy drinks and fruit juice are usually high in calories and sugar, which can cause weight problems. Water is important in making your brain cells and every organ in your body work properly. For your body to burn fat, it needs at least eight glasses of pure water a day. Liquids like soda and coffee actually take water away from your body. *Refusing to drink milk. Milk is the best natural food--it provides you with protein, which makes your bones strong and teeth healthy. * Choosing meat and certain vegetables over others. Different foods provide different kinds of nutrition. If you don't have a balanced diet, this can result in malnutrition and a weaker body. *Eating in front of the computer and staying there after meals. Take a walk after eating and it helps your stomach digest the meal. *Buying from roadside snack bars. If you shop at these places, be careful--many are not clean enough. * Eating throat tablets as if they were sweets. If you eat throat tablets when you have no throat disease, they may affect the bacteria in your mouth and cause real throat problems. Question: _ can possibly cause digestion problem.

According to official records, he was born on 21 January [O.S. 9 January] 1869, and christened the following day. He was named for St. Gregory of Nyssa, whose feast was celebrated on January 10. There are few records of Rasputin's parents. Word of Rasputin's activity and charisma began to spread in Siberia during the early 1900s. Sometime between 1902 and 1904, he travelled to the city of Kazan on the Volga river, where he acquired a reputation as a wise and perceptive starets, or holy man, who could help people resolve their spiritual crises and anxieties. Despite rumors that Rasputin was having sex with some of his female followers, he won over the father superior of the Seven Lakes Monastery outside Kazan, as well as a local church officials Archimandrite Andrei and Bishop Chrysthanos, who gave him a letter of recommendation to Bishop Sergei, the rector of the St. Petersburg Theological Seminary at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, and arranged for him to travel to St. Petersburg, either in 1903 or in the winter of 1904-1905. Upon meeting Sergei at the Nevsky Monastery, Rasputin was introduced to a number of different church leaders, including Archimandrite Feofan, who was the inspector of the theological seminary, was well-connected in St. Petersburg society, and later served as confessor to the Tsar and his wife. Feofan was so impressed with Rasputin that he invited him to stay in his home, and became one of Rasputin's most important and influential friends in St. Petersburg. According to Joseph T. Fuhrmann, Rasputin stayed in St. Petersburg for only a few months on his first visit, and returned to Prokovskoye in the fall of 1903. Historian Douglas Smith, however, argues that it is impossible to know whether Rasputin stayed in St. Petersburg or returned to Prokovskoye at some point between his first arrival there and 1905. Regardless, by 1905 Rasputin had formed friendships with several members of the aristocracy, including the \\"Black Princesses,\\" Militsa and Anatasia of Montenegro, who had married the Tsar's cousins (Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich and Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich), and were instrumental in introducing Rasputin to the Tsar and his family. Rasputin first met the Tsar on November 1, 1905, at the Peterhof Palace. The tsar recorded the event in his diary, writing that he and Alexandra had \\"made the acquaintance of a man of God - Grigory, from Tobolsk province.\\" Rasputin would not meet the Tsar and his wife again for some months: he returned to Prokovskoye shortly after their first meeting, and did not return to St. Petersburg until July 1906. On his return, Rasputin sent Nicholas a telegram asking to present the tsar with an icon of Simeon of Verkhoturye. He met with Nicholas and Alexandra on July 18, and again in October, when he first met Nicholas and Alexandra's children. Joseph Fuhrmann has speculated that it was in October that Rasputin was first asked to pray for the health of Alexei. By December 1906, Rasputin had become close enough to the royal family to ask a special favor of the Tsar - that he be permitted to change his surname to Rasputin-Novyi (Rasputin-New). Nicholas granted the request and the name change was speedily processed, suggesting that the Tsar viewed - and treated - Rasputin favorably at that time.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Why were there rumors about him","output":"Rasputin was a man who gained a reputation as a wise and holy person, but there were rumors about him having relationships with his female followers.

Though she did not again win the Sulman, she was successful in having works hung in that competition on many occasions, including the 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1950 shows. Bellette continued to paint classical scenes, and around 1950 produced the work Chorus without Iphigenia. Purchased by the National Gallery of Australia in 1976, this oil painting shows five figures, \\"posed like statues in a tableau vivant, [and who] possess a kind of erotic energy\\". Anne Gray, the National Gallery's curator, interpreted the scene chosen by Bellette: Although nothing is happening in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title.

The outbreak began with just a handful of cases in Guinea in March. Since then, that number has grown to 909 confirmed cases and another 414 probable or suspected in that country, Sierra Leone and Liberia and Nigeria, according to the World Health Organization. Some 729 people of the 1,323 total confirmed and possible infections have died, reports WHO as of July 27. The WHO says \\"drastic action is needed\\" to contain Ebola, warning that previously undetected chains of transmission are boosting the numbers of sick and increasing the chances that the disease spreads from Africa. \\"This epidemic is without precedent,\\" said Bart Janssens, director of operations for Médecins Sans Frontières, also known as Doctors Without Borders. \\"It's absolutely not under control, and the situation keeps worsening. ... There are many places where people are infected but we don't know about it.\\" What's the latest? The Ebola outbreak has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, where authorities have been working to contain the virus. In Liberia, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf announced Wednesday that, \\"without exceptions, all schools are ordered closed pending further directive from the Ministry of Education.\\" She also declared Friday a nonworking day \\"to be used for the disinfection and chlorination of all public facilities.\\" On the same day, the Peace Corps said it was temporarily removing its 340 volunteers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea due to the outbreak. The announcement comes as two Peace Corps volunteers were isolated after coming in contact with someone who ended up dying of Ebola, a spokeswoman for the group said. She said these two Americans \\"are not symptomatic,\\" and the Peace Corps will work to return them to the United States once they get medical clearance to travel. Concerns about Ebola aren't confined to those three countries. Last week, a Liberian government official who had contracted the virus died in isolation at a hospital in Lagos, Nigeria. Patrick Sawyer, a naturalized American citizen who worked in Liberia, flew to Nigeria intending to attend a conference. After exhibiting symptoms upon arrival July 20, he was hospitalized and died on July 25. He's the first American to die in the outbreak, though two other U.S. aid workers in Liberia have contracted Ebola and are being treated. Sawyer's was the only known case in Nigeria, WHO said. And the British government convened an emergency meeting to discuss the threat of Ebola to the UK, even though no case has been reported there. Officials discussed what measures could be taken if UK nationals in West Africa should become infected, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said. Why was someone infected with Ebola allowed on a plane? It is unknown whether Sawyer was displaying symptoms before he flew from Monrovia, Liberia's capital, to Ghana and then to Togo to switch planes to fly to Lagos. His Minnesota-based widow, Decontee Sawyer, told CNN that he had cared for his ill sister in Liberia, though she said he didn't know at the time that his sister had Ebola. When he arrived in Nigeria, he told officials that he had no direct contact with anyone who had the disease. Because it takes between two and 21 days before Ebola symptoms to show, there's little health officials can do to stop an asymptomatic person from flying to another country, said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta. So, serious viruses such as Ebola may be just \\"a plane ride away\\" from reaching the developed world, according to Marty Cetron of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Mindful of this, Nigeria-based airline companies ASKY and Arik Air suspended operations at the end of July into Monrovia and Freetown, the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively. ASKY said passengers departing from Conakry, Guinea, would be screened for signs of the virus. Cetron says it is unlikely the virus would spread on an airplane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick person's bodily fluids. Stressing the key role that those working at airports play in keeping Ebola in check, the CDC spokesman said: \\"Being educated, knowing the symptoms, recognizing what to do, having a response to protocol, knowing who to call -- those are really, really important parts of the global containment strategies to deal with threats like this.\\" What else is being done to stop the spread of the disease? Ebola patients are being isolated by health officials in West Africa, and those who have come into contact with them are being told to monitor their temperatures. President Sirleaf has closed most of Liberia's borders with neighboring countries, and the few points of entry that are still open will have Ebola testing centers. The President also placed restrictions on public gatherings and ordered hotels, restaurants and other entertainment venues to play a five-minute video on Ebola safety. The CDC has issued an alert to health workers in the United States to watch out for any patients who may have recently traveled to West Africa and could have contracted the virus. Why does Ebola generate such fear? Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) describes Ebola as \\"one of the world's most deadly diseases.\\" \\"It is a highly infectious virus that can kill up to 90% of the people who catch it, causing terror among infected communities,\\" it says. The death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 55% because of early treatment. There is also no vaccination against it. Of Ebola's five subtypes, the Zaire strain -- the first to be identified -- is considered the most deadly. The WHO said preliminary tests on the Ebola virus in Guinea in March suggested that the outbreak there was this strain, though that has not been confirmed. What is Ebola, and what are its symptoms? The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding. The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), where one of the first outbreaks occurred in 1976. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. These symptoms can appear two to 21 days after infection. The WHO says these nonspecific early symptoms can be mistaken for signs of diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, meningitis or even the plague. MSF says some patients may also develop a rash, red eyes, hiccups, chest pains and difficulty breathing and swallowing. The early symptoms progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function and sometimes internal and external bleeding. Ebola can only be definitively confirmed by five different laboratory tests. How is it treated? There are no specific treatments for Ebola. MSF says patients are isolated and then supported by health care workers. \\"This consists of hydrating the patient, maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure and treating them for any complicating infections,\\" it says. There have been cases of healthcare workers contracting the virus from patients, and the WHO has issued guidance for dealing with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus. Carers are advised to wear impermeable gowns and gloves and to wear facial protection such as goggles or a medical mask to prevent splashes to the nose, mouth and eyes. MSF says it contained a 2012 outbreak in Uganda by placing a control area around its treatment center. An outbreak is considered over once 42 days -- double the incubation period of the disease -- have passed without any new cases. How does it spread? The WHO says it is believed that fruit bats may be the natural host of the Ebola virus in Africa, passing on the virus to other animals. Humans contract Ebola through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans. MSF says that while the virus is believed to be able to survive for some days in liquid outside an infected organism, chlorine disinfection, heat, direct sunlight, soaps and detergents can kill it. MSF epidemiologist Kamiliny Kalahne said outbreaks usually spread in areas where hospitals have poor infection control and limited access to resources such as running water. \\"People who become sick with it almost always know how they got sick: because they looked after someone in their family who was very sick -- who had diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding -- or because they were health staff who had a lot of contact with a sick patient,\\" she said. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 was the deadliest on record, sparking fears that it could spread to other regions and continents. The outbreak began in Guinea and quickly spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Nigeria, with 909 confirmed cases and another 414 probable or suspected cases reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). Of the 1,323 total confirmed and possible infections, 729 people died. The situation was deemed to be \\"absolutely not under control\\" by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). In an attempt to contain the virus, authorities in West Africa took various measures such as closing schools and public facilities. The Peace Corps removed its 340 volunteers from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, with other countries also taking measures to protect their citizens in the affected nations. There were concerns about the virus spreading via air travel, as one infected official had traveled from Liberia to Nigeria. Health officials faced challenges because Ebola symptoms can take between two and 21 days to appear, making it difficult to identify and prevent infected individuals from boarding planes. Airlines in Nigeria suspended flights to the affected countries and began screening passengers for signs of the virus. To stop the spread of the disease, Ebola patients were isolated, and those who had come into contact with them were monitored. The CDC also issued alerts to U.S. health workers to watch for patients who may have recently traveled to West Africa. Ebola is a highly infectious virus that can kill up to 90% of those infected, causing fever, weakness, muscle pain, and other symptoms that progress to vomiting, diarrhea, and internal and external bleeding. No specific treatment exists, and there is no vaccination against it. The virus is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids of infected animals or humans, though basic hygiene measures can usually kill it outside of infected organisms."},{"instruction":"Q:Title: Horrible!

That's left room for smaller brands like LaCroix to enjoy huge success with sparkling water. LaCroix sales have jumped 45% since last year to an estimated 175 million, reports Bloomberg. Sales of other fizzy waters like Perrier and San Pellegrino have also spiked recently, while Sparkling Ice sales jumped from 27 million in 2010 to 550 million last year, the Washington Post reported. But big brands like Coke and Pepsi aren't having as much success. Whereas the market share for LaCroix maker, National Beverage—the fourth-largest soda maker in North America—rose 67% from 2010 to 2014, Coke and Pepsi's market shares fell 4% and 5.5%, respectively. Why are people attracted to a neon can that looks like it came straight out of the 1980s? A major advantage is that it avoids corporate associations, notes Bloomberg. Then there are the flavors—12 in total including lemon, lime, apricot, and pamplemousse (grapefruit), per Grist—which have attracted a kind of indie cult following. National Beverage says the flavors are based on a secret brew of \\"natural essence.\\" But for one young consumer, who used LaCroix to help kick his energy drink and soda habit, \\"it's less about the taste\\" and \\"more about how it's an interesting fizzy thing and it can replace soda.\\" LaCroix—which got a \\"letter of recommendation\\" in the New York Times Magazine in March—is certainly marketing itself as a soda alternative. It's latest flavor: cola. Article:","output":"The Changing Face of Beverages: How LaCroix Found Success by Embracing the Sparkling Water Trend In a world where consumers have become increasingly health-conscious, traditional soda giants like Coke and Pepsi are facing a decline in sales, prompting them to expand their product offerings. Tapping into the energy drink sector, milk, or even exploring the world of craft sodas, these behemoths are working to recover lost sales and maintain their market share. However, amidst this shift, smaller independent brands like LaCroix are thriving in the race for consumer affection, particularly in the sparkling water market. A glance at the sales figures is enough to illustrate the remarkable growth LaCroix has achieved: in 2015, sales shot up by 45% to an extraordinary 175 million, as reported by Bloomberg. Other sparkling water brands, such as Perrier and San Pellegrino, have also seen a spike in sales recently. A prime example is Sparkling Ice, which experienced skyrocketing sales growth, going from 27 million in 2010 to a staggering 550 million in 2015, as highlighted by The Washington Post. In contrast, big brands like Coke and Pepsi have not been as successful with their sparkling water offerings. An analysis of 2010 to 2014 data revealed that both companies suffered a reduction in market share, 4% for Coke and 5.5% for Pepsi. In stark contrast, the market share for LaCroix's parent company, National Beverage - the fourth-largest soda maker in North America - rose an impressive 67% during the same period. So, what gives LaCroix its glowing edge in the world of sparkling water? For starters, its unique design: a neon-lit can that screams Eighties nostalgia yet manages to feel modern. One critical contributing factor to its success is clever marketing that detaches itself from established corporate associations. Furthermore, LaCroix offers a wide range of flavors that target a variety of customer segments, totaling 12 flavors, each displaying unique taste profiles. The flavors, including lemon, lime, apricot, and pamplemousse (grapefruit), boast a \\"natural essence\\" derived from a secret recipe that has piqued consumer curiosity and cultivated a devoted following. National Beverage's artful approach has resulted in LaCroix establishing itself as an alternative to traditional soda, a shining example being its latest flavor offering - cola. For many consumers, the fizzy sensation of LaCroix products carries tremendous appeal, emphasizing the ability to \\"replace soda\\" rather than directly competing with it. One young consumer, who relied on LaCroix to help him overcome his energy drink habit, says \\"it's less about the taste\\" and \\"more about how it's an interesting fizzy thing,\\" highlighting the niche that LaCroix has successfully filled in the market. Evidently, LaCroix's prosperity can be attributed to its unique branding, offering various flavors, and positioning itself as a fresh alternative to conventional sodas. Its meteoric rise among health-conscious customers demonstrates the industry-wide shift towards healthier, fizzy beverages. As LaCroix continues to bask in success and accolades - including a recent \\"letter of recommendation\\" in the New York Times Magazine - it remains to be seen if this will serve as a wake-up call for the soda industry giants to pivot and bring more originality to the table."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given the fact that: If blood volume in the body decreases, blood pressure decreases.

(Lelystad and Terschelling both technically have more \\"total\\" area, but in both cases it is mostly \\"water\\" area.) - Vollenhove is a city in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Steenwijkerland, southwest of Steenwijk. Until the Noordoostpolder was drained, it was located on the coast of the Zuiderzee. - The Zuiderzee (old spelling \\"Zuyderzee\\") was a shallow bay of the North Sea in the northwest of the Netherlands, extending about 100 km (60 miles) inland and at most 50 km (30 miles) wide, with an overall depth of about 4 to 5 metres (1316 feet) and a coastline of about 300 km (200 miles). It covered . Its name means \\"southern sea\\" in Dutch, indicating that the name originates in Friesland, to the north of the Zuiderzee (cf. North Sea). In the 20th century the majority of the Zuiderzee was closed off from the North Sea (leaving the mouth of the inlet to become part of the Wadden Sea) and the salt water inlet changed into a fresh water lake called the IJsselmeer (IJssel Lake) after the river that drains into it, and by means of drainage and polders, an area of some was reclaimed as land. This land eventually became the province of Flevoland, with a population of nearly 400,000 (2011). - The River IJssel, sometimes called Gelderse IJssel (\\"Gueldern IJssel\\") to avoid confusion with the Hollandse IJssel, is the branch of the Rhine in the Dutch provinces of Gelderland and Overijssel. The Romans knew the river as Isala. The IJssel flows from Westervoort, east of the city of Arnhem, until it discharges into the IJsselmeer (\\"Lake IJssel\\", known prior to the 1932 completion of the Afsluitdijk as the Zuiderzee, a North Sea inlet). The River IJssel is one of the three major distributary branches (along with the rivers Nederrijn and Waal) into which the Rhine divides shortly after crossing the German-Dutch border. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament.

Brandt was recognized primarily for his efforts to improve relations between East and West Germany, as well as his work in fostering better diplomatic ties with the Eastern Bloc countries during the Cold War era. Willy Brandt was born Herbert Frahm on December 18, 1913, in Lübeck, Germany. He adopted the name \\"Willy Brandt\\" during the 1930s while living in exile from Nazi Germany. Brandt's political career was an impressive one, as he played pivotal roles in German and global politics for much of the mid-20th century. He started his political journey with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), eventually rising through the ranks to become the party's leader. During his tenure as the Chancellor of West Germany from 1969 to 1974, Brandt set in motion a series of diplomatic overtures that came to be known as \\"Ostpolitik.\\" This policy aimed to create a détente with the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies, as Brandt sought to ease tensions and create a foundation for a unified German nation. Some of the key components of Ostpolitik included the recognition of East Germany as a separate, sovereign nation, the establishment of diplomatic relations with other Eastern Bloc countries, and the signing of treaties aimed at enhancing cooperation and communication. One of the most significant outcomes of Brandt's efforts was the signing of the \\"Treaty of Moscow\\" in 1970 and the \\"Treaty of Warsaw\\" in 1971. Both agreements provided groundwork for mutual recognition, non-aggression, and the inviolability of borders in Europe. These treaties were a major factor in the eventual easing of Cold War tensions, leading toward improved international relations throughout the continent. The culmination of these efforts came in 1971 when Willy Brandt was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his tireless work in promoting European stability and unity. His leadership and diplomatic prowess made him an ideal choice as Time's \\"Person of the Year\\" in 1970, as the magazine sought to honor him for bringing the world significantly closer to peace and understanding during one of the most challenging periods in human history."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Title: Best Translation Thus far Review: This Louise Varese version of Rimbaud's \\"A Season in Hell\\", in my opinion, is the best translation to appear in English, with the French on each opposing page, for Varese has nothing to hide.

It was at some time after Eirkr left for England, and on the death of Svein while retreating to Sweden, maybe intent on returning to Norway with reinforcements, that Erikr's son Hakon went to join his father and support Cnut in England, too. Cnut's brother Harald may have been at Cnut's coronation, in 1016, returning to Denmark as its king, with part of the fleet, at some point thereafter. It is only certain, though, that there was an entry of his name, alongside Cnut's, in confraternity with Christ Church, Canterbury, in 1018. This is not conclusive, though, for the entry may have been made in Harald's absence, perhaps by the hand of Cnut himself, which means that, while it is usually thought that Harald died in 1018, it is unsure whether he was still alive at this point. Entry of his brother's name in the Canterbury codex may have been Cnut's attempt to make his vengeance for Harald's murder good with the Church. This may have been just a gesture for a soul to be under the protection of God. There is evidence Cnut was in battle with pirates in 1018, with his destruction of the crews of thirty ships, although it is unknown if this was off the English or Danish shores. He himself mentions troubles in his 1019 letter , written as the King of England and Denmark. These events can be seen, with plausibility, to be in connection with the death of Harald.

United States commanders say that the practice, however unconventional, of paying the guerrillas has saved the lives of hundreds of American soldiers. “If it is not handled properly, we could have a security issue,” said Brig. Gen. David Perkins, the senior military spokesman in Iraq. “You don’t want to give anybody a reason to turn back to Al Qaeda.” Many Sunni insurgents had previously been allied with Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and other extremist groups. Even before the new pressure from the government, many Awakening members were growing frustrated — and at an especially delicate time. United States and Iraqi negotiators have just completed a draft security agreement that next year, Iraqi officials say, would substantially pull American forces back from cities and towns to be replaced by Iraqi security forces. Awakening members complain, with rising bitterness, that the government has been slow to make good on its promises to recruit tens of thousands of its members into those security forces. General Perkins said only 5,200 members had been recruited in a force of about 100,000. “Some people from the government encouraged us to fight against Al Qaeda, but it seems that now that Al Qaeda is finished they don’t want us anymore,” said Abu Marouf, who, according to American officials, was a powerful guerrilla leader in the 1920s Revolutionary Brigade west of Baghdad. “So how can you say I am not betrayed?” After he said he discovered his name on lists of 650 names that an Iraqi Army brigade was using to arrest Awakening members west of Baghdad, Abu Marouf fled south of Falluja. His men, he said, “sacrificed and fought against Al Qaeda, and now the government wants to catch them and arrest them.” The Shiite-dominated government has never been pleased with the continuing American plan to finance and organize Sunni insurgents into militia guards, charging that they will stop fighting only as long as it serves their interests. “These people are like cancer, and we must remove them,” said Brig. Gen. Nassir al-Hiti, commander of the Iraqi Army’s 5,000-strong Muthanna Brigade, which patrols west of Baghdad, said of the Awakening leaders on his list for arrest. The Awakening began in western Anbar Province in 2006 as the violence in Iraq peaked and Sunni tribal leaders began feeling pressure from all sides, and then spread around the country as a means of Sunni self-preservation. The United States military focused its operations on Sunni insurgent groups, cooperating meantime with the Shiite-led government. The bodies of dozens of Sunnis surfaced on streets every morning, the victims of Shiite death squads. And many Sunnis themselves grew disgusted with the large number of civilian casualties in near-daily suicide bombings. The American military began paying many members of the Awakening movement as the program expanded, even including Shiite members who make up about one-fifth of the program. Now they are paid roughly 300 a month by the United States to guard checkpoints and buildings and — for those who used to be insurgents — to no longer blow up American convoys and shoot American troops. Although the “surge” is often described as the turning point that led to lower violence, a number of American officers contend the Awakening that began well before the surge in 2006 in Anbar Province and continued in Baghdad last year was the most significant reason for the decline. In some places, American casualties plunged within weeks of the Sunnis joining with American forces. Col. Kurt Pinkerton, the former American battalion commander who oversaw the Awakening program established west of Abu Ghraib last year, said it was critical to quelling violence. “I don’t think that area would have been calmed without those guys,” he said, giving credit to three of the most important members, including Abu Marouf, who are now being tracked down by General Nassir. General Nassir says he has orders to arrest Abu Marouf, whose older brother, Col. Faisal Ismail Hussein, was also a guerrilla leader before he became the Falluja police chief. General Nassir also says he has orders to arrest Abu Azzam and Abu Zachariyah, brothers who were leaders of the Islamic Army of Iraq but who were publicly hailed by Colonel Pinkerton and other American commanders last year for bringing relative peace to an insurgent stronghold west of Baghdad. The general says his orders come from the military’s Baghdad Operations Center, which he said is taking orders from Iraqi judicial authorities. He acknowledged some disenchanted fighters may take up arms again “like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again.” But he says that reconciliation is impossible and that he would quit before he ever worked with former insurgents with blood on their hands. “They committed crimes and attacked the Iraqi Army and the American Army, and there is no way to rehabilitate them,” he said. Despite the government’s new aggressiveness against the Awakening, the program is far from finished. While going after hundreds of leaders and people the government considers dangerous, relations remain largely good with Sunni tribal sheiks in Anbar, where the Awakening was born. General Perkins also noted that American and Iraqi officials had tentatively agreed to a plan to hopefully transfer 58,000 American-paid militia guards this year onto Iraqi government payrolls under the command of the Baghdad Operation Center, which reports to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. But he said the transfer will not happen until crucial issues are resolved, such as how militiamen are vetted and what sort of jobs or training programs they will eventually go into. And while American officials are insistent that the program to pay militia guards continue to operate, General Perkins said it was not yet clear what recourse the military would have to prevent the Iraqi government from ending the program once it took control. “We don’t want this to be a dead-end, kick them to the curb kind of thing,” he said. Despite the threat of arrest by General Nassir’s troops if he returns to his home village west Baghdad, Abu Azzam, who had been an Awakening leader between Abu Ghraib and Falluja, said he has been able to travel to Baghdad to meet with aides to Mr. Maliki to discuss how the Shiite-dominated government and former Sunni guerrillas might be able to reconcile. “Our men worked hard and deserve appreciation and not punishment from the government,” he said. He described the discussions as “not going well,” though he said some Maliki aides preferred a more conciliatory tack. “For now, everything is stopped,” he said. He also said he feared the pullout of American troops, whom he saw as restraining the Shiite government from taken even harsher action against the Awakening. “America is the only one asking us not to fight the Maliki government.” As part of the Awakening’s efforts to transform itself into a political movement, Abu Azzam has organized a political slate for the coming provincial elections and says he has renounced violence for good. He is optimistic that some former fighters will not return to armed conflict if the government refuses them jobs, he said. But he acknowledged, “Part of them will fight the government if they are not recruited into the security forces.” An article on Aug. 22 about efforts by the Shiite-dominated government in Iraq to drive out many leaders of the Awakening movement, the organization of largely Sunni militias credited with helping reduce violence, referred incompletely to an assertion about militia disarmament by Sheik Jalaladeen al-Sagheer, a leading Shiite member of Parliament. While the sheik said in an interview that the government could not accept the existence of the Awakening and that its “days are numbered,” as the article reported, he was talking about all militias, including the Shiite-led Mahdi Army. His complete quotation was, “When the government attacked the Mahdi Army, it sent the message to all the militias including the Awakening that their days are numbered.” This correction was delayed because the sheik only recently contacted The Times about it, and his original quotation had to be rechecked with the Iraqi reporter who had interviewed him. Reporting was contributed by Mohammed Husain from Baghdad and Ibrahim Bin Ali, Iraq; Riyadh Mohammed from Baghdad; Campbell Robertson from Diyala Province; Ranya Kadri from Amman, Jordan; and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Falluja, Ramadi and Diyala.

The land is so flat you can see for miles and miles. On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away. You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here. If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes. In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills. Why do you think this is? What could have caused these features? There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material. The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Where did glaciers go? Where can you see them today? Glaciers are masses of flowing ice. Do you have any questions?","output":"While standing amid the flat farmland in central Illinois, one can indeed wonder about the striking geographical contrast between the flatlands and the rolling hills in southern Illinois. To understand the origin of these landscapes, we must delve into the area's geological history, dating back around 12,000 years ago. During the last Ice Age, the Midwest United States was covered by an enormous ice sheet, part of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. As the temperatures dropped, the ice sheet extended southward, covering most of what is now central Illinois, including Springfield. The immense pressure caused by this mile-thick sheet of ice ground down hills and filled in valleys, leaving behind a flat and smooth surface upon melting. This process of glacial erosion flattened the landscape, creating the vast, flat expanses of central Illinois that we see today. As the ice retreated, it moved northward, carving out the rolling hills found in southern Illinois. These hills were formed due to complex interactions between the thinning and retreating ice and sediment deposition during the Melting Period. The result was a more diverse and undulating topography characterized by hills, valleys and other geomorphological features. While the ice sheet that covered central Illinois has long vanished, some remnants of that time still exist in the form of glaciers, which can be found in various locations across the world today. Glaciers are distinguished as moving masses of ice that form wherever snow accumulates, compresses, and survives the seasonal melting for consecutive years. The most prominent regions where glaciers are prevalent today include: 1. Polar regions - The Arctic and Antarctic regions harbor around 99% of Earth's glacial ice, including the colossal ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. 2. Mountain ranges - High mountain ranges feature glaciers, such as the Himalayas, Rocky Mountains, Andes, Alps, and Kilimanjaro. These alpine glaciers form under freezing temperatures, and their weight causes them to flow and carve the surrounding landscapes. The effects of climate change have resulted in some glaciers melting at an alarming rate, while others have disappeared altogether. Blame falls on increased greenhouse gases and global warming. Glaciers continue to serve as valuable windows into the Earth's past and as vital resources for understanding regional geology, climate patterns, and our planet's evolutionary trajectory."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question.

In his remarks to lawmakers, according to White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah, Trump \\"endorsed both House immigration bills that build the wall, close legal loopholes, cancel the visa lottery, curb so-called \\"chain migration,\\" and solve the border crisis and family separation issue by allowing for family detention and removal.\\" Republican Rep.

The gallery becomes a popular spot, attracting tourists and locals alike. Alice befriends Suzy, her quirky and charming neighbor, and they quickly bond over their shared love of art. As Alice's circle of friends expands, she meets Claire Edmonds, a lonely and wealthy woman in her mid-forties who spends most of her time in seclusion at her grand, old mansion situated atop the hill overlooking Willowspring.

During an art fair held in Willowspring, Alice is devastated when she finds one of her missing paintings with Claire's signature forged on it. While confronting Claire, an argument ensues, and Claire threatens to ruin Alice's reputation in Willowspring.

Claire is ultimately arrested and Alice's name is cleared. Act 6: The Resolution With the truth finally out, Alice decides to honor her late twin sister's memory and talent by creating a special exhibit dedicated to her, which becomes a huge hit in town.

Through hard work, strategic investments, and smart financial decisions, Steven was able to accumulate wealth that surpassed that of his friend, Kevin. While both individuals were successful in their respective careers, differences in their income sources, risk-taking abilities, and professional networks contributed to the disparity between their personal earnings. For instance, Steven may have held a higher position in his profession or started a lucrative business, generating increased revenue streams and garnering financial success. Additionally, his sound knowledge of market trends and investment opportunities could have yielded significant returns, further boosting his income and financial worth. Steven's professional network and connections likely played a crucial role in his financial success as well. By cultivating strong relationships with influential individuals within his industry, Steven gained access to unique opportunities for collaborative projects, consulting gigs, and exclusive deals. These connections undoubtedly contributed to his higher income compared to Kevin. On the other hand, Kevin's income, while substantial, did not match that of Steven due to various reasons. Kevin may have been more conservative in his approach to investments, opting for safer options that provided relatively lower returns. Furthermore, Kevin’s professional network might not be as extensive, suggesting that he did not have the same level of access to high-paying opportunities as Steven did. Lastly, differences in income could also be attributed to divergent personal financial goals and priorities. Steven may have been more focused on maximizing his earnings, building a considerable net worth, and achieving financial independence faster. In contrast, Kevin might have prioritized other aspects of life, such as work-life balance, personal fulfillment, and well-being. These choices directly impacted their respective incomes and consequently, the difference in the tax brackets they found themselves in. In conclusion, Steven filed at a much higher bracket than Kevin on his income tax because he earned a lot more money. A combination of factors such as professional positions, personal financial decisions, investment approaches, and prioritization of life goals contributed to the distinction between their financial standings, resulting in a substantial gap in their taxable incomes."},{"instruction":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming","output":"The sentiment of the given sentence, \\"keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking, but humming,\\" can be considered positive for several reasons.

Ms Carnevali, 20, died in her family’s arms in front of their Hoppers Crossing home. It was reported she was a “lifelong asthma sufferer” and had a “severe attack” during the storm. An ambulance did not arrive until 31 minutes later. media_camera Hope Carnevali, 20, from Werribee, died after a thunderstorm asthma outbreak in Melbourne. Picture: Supplied The law student’s uncle, John Carnevali, said Ambulance Victoria should let people know if there were going to be long delays. “So maybe we can take them straight to hospital where it can save a life, because I’ve lost my niece, maybe for that reason,” he said in tears. A second person is also believed to have died after a perfect storm triggered hundreds of thunderstorm asthma attacks and plunged Melbourne’s hospitals into their busiest night. Victoria ran out of ambulances as emergency calls jumped 450 per cent, while several hospitals enacted disaster management plans. WHAT IS THUNDERSTORM ASTHMA? media_camera The stormfront hits the city. Picture: Norm Oorloff The perfect storm of a high pollen count, northerly winds and humid conditions triggered the rare phenomenon of thunderstorm asthma from 7pm on Monday, with emergency services receiving ­triple 0 calls every four to five seconds and Ambulance Victoria deploying 60 extra crews. More than 1870 calls for ambulances were made between 6pm and 11pm. AV regional services general manager Mick Stephenson said he was aware two people had died while waiting for ambulances but it was not known if the asthma ­phen­omenon was responsible. Mr Carnevali described his niece as a beautiful woman who died too soon. “She was a very kind-hearted, beautiful gorgeous little girl. She’d do anything for anyone,” he said. “If somebody needed her, she’d be there. She was an angel. We’re going to miss her so much.” Friends also paid tribute on social media. Erin Carlile said: “A beautiful soul taken away too soon.” Ashleigh Zammit wrote: “Fly high beautiful girl. ­Heaven has gained another angel.” Premier’s sons suffered ‘significant asthma attacks’ Premier Daniel Andrews expressed his condolences for the families of the two people who died during the thunderstorm asthma disaster. He promised a full investigation into what went wrong. “Our thoughts and our prayers and our best wishes are with the families of those two Victorians who had everything in front of them, and for those families to have to deal with this tragedy is desperately sad,” Mr Andrews said. “Our commitment to those families is we will learn from what has gone on here, we will make the necessary improvements.” The Premier said his two sons had suffered “quite significant asthma attacks” during Monday’s storm. Health Minister Jill Hennessy said claims that two people died while waiting for ambulances would be the subject of a full investigation. “No doubt, there will be lessons to learn, there always are in these cases, but every part of our emergency management surge occurred correctly,” Ms Hennessy said. Extra staff were brought into hospitals, the MFB increased its cap­acity to work as first responders and police conducted welfare checks, while private hospitals opened their emergency departments for public patients. Royal Melbourne Hospital ran out of Ventolin and spacers while the Royal Children’s Hospital had almost 500 emergency presentations. State health commander Paul Holman said this was a first in his 40 years in the job, calling it a “state disaster”. But the man who discovered the phenomenon of thunderstorm asthma in 1992, Deakin University’s Assoc Prof Cenk Suphioglu, said it could have been predicted. He said resources were needed to set up an alert system. media_camera The storm front near Torquay yesterday afternoon amid high winds and hundreds of lightning strikes.

Picture: Norm Oorloff While his Deakin AIRwatch website predicted this weather combination would trigger an extreme event, Assoc Prof Suphioglu said more resources were needed to set up an alert system. “If it is well resourced we can give alerts — how seriously they (emergency authorities) take those alerts will be up to them,” Assoc Prof Suphioglu said. “This is a well know thing. Melbourne is dubbed as not only the allergy capital of the world, but also the thunderstorm capital of the world.” Royal Melbourne Hospital’s director of Emergency Professor George Braitberg said they had to borrow Ventalin from neighbouring centres after seeing a day’s worth of patients in 12 hours. “There really wasn’t any warning,” he said. “Most people I saw weren’t asthmatics or hadn’t had it for 25 years. It was an extraordinary situation; the worse I’ve experienced in 30 years in the job.” St Vincent’s Hospital had to enact it’s emergency management plan reserved for disasters and set up a second six-bed emergency department in its day unit when it became overwhelmed with 216 presentations — more than double what sees on a typical night. Out of The Royal Children’s Hospital’s 500 emergency presentations — two and a half times the normal number off sick children — resulted in about 50 cases being admitted. “Just the sheer number of patients. it is unprecedented in our history,” RCH director of general medicine Dr Tom Connell said. “There will certainly be lessons learnt about dealing with demands, but it is hard to predict these and I think we have all coped very well by pulling together in a true team spirit.” media_camera Stacee Krepis was forced to drive Nicholas to the Royal Children's Hospital. Picture: Jake Nowakowski Harrowing hospital dash as son struggled to breath A MUM has described the harrowing moment she was told to drive her son to the hospital while he struggled to breathe — because there weren’t enough ambulances to take him. Stacee Krepis called 000 at 4am on November 21 after her son Nicholas, 11, had chest pains, and had struggled to breathe from about 6pm the night before. But when the paramedic arrived to her Coburg home in a station wagon shortly after, he urged Ms Krepis she needed to take Nicholas straight to the Royal Children’s Hospital while suffering from “Thunderstorm asthma”. “I rang the ambulance, but a paramedic came on his own, and when he saw Nicholas, he said yes, I needed to take him to the Royal Children’s straight away,” Ms Krepis said. But after a dash to the hospital, Ms Krepis was confronted with dozens of children in the waiting room, coughing and wheezing. “Looking at some of those kids in there, they were really struggling; it was really scary, especially seeing your child unable to breathe,” Ms Krepis said. Ms Krepis said when she finally got to see a doctor, he told her the “line was out the door with children with similar symptoms” by midnight. media_camera Chris Wookey had his first asthma attack last night. Picture: David Caird Perfect storm a rare event “THUNDERSTORM asthma” is a rare Spring event, which occurs when a thunderstorm, sudden change in humidity, a northerly wind change and high pollen count are combined. This perfect storm causes pollen “packages” to be blown from the north. The humidity change bursts these capsules, which explode tiny pollens at concentrations million times higher than what is usually in the air which irritate airways. People with mild asthma, or who have never experienced an asthma attack, are often most affected because they aren’t actively taking treatment or have management plans. Melbourne is the “thunderstorm” capital of the world; with epidemics recorded in 1987, 1989, and November 2010. Royal Melbourne Hospital’s head of respiratory medicine, Associate Professor Lou Irving said the event was a reminder to mild asthmatics that their condition could suddenly become severe and they needed an action plan and current medication. therese.allaoui@news.com.au ||||| At least four people have died after the sudden outbreak of \\"thunderstorm asthma\\", prompting an investigation into the emergency response to the medical crisis that swept across Melbourne on Monday.

Photo: Jason South Noble Park father-of-two, Clarence Leo, and 35-year-old man, Apollo Papadopoulos, died after suffering asthma attacks that are believed to be due to the unprecedented weather event. As more information about the emergency response came to light on Wednesday - including details of after-hour clinics, doctors and pharmacies struggling to cope with a surge in patients - questions were raised about why a public warning was not sent out to asthma sufferers. Health Minister Jill Hennessy, who commissioned the Inspector-General for Emergency Management to review the emergency response, said the thunderstorm asthma event could not have been predicted, but that work was underway to create new models to anticipate the effect of extreme weather on health. \\"Unpredictable weather patterns and the impact on health I think is a new emerging frontier for public health risks,\\" she said.

Doctor Mark Hotusaid he arrived at 16-year-old Angelique's Altona home about 4am Tuesday after she had woken up \\"unable to breathe\\" and been turned away from hospital. He sent her back to hospital with a note for a doctor to see her immediately and she was finally admitted. On Wednesday morning, Ms Hennessy said there were two confirmed deaths - 20-year-old law student Hope Carnevali and Greenvale high-school student Omar Moujalled. But within hours, the grieving families and friends of two other men spoke of their loss after thunderstorm asthma struck. Mr Leo, a bouncer, was well known in Melbourne's nightclub scene. His business partner, Andrew Christodoulou, described him as a \\"gentle giant\\". Friend Danny Saddoo remembered Mr Leo as a doting father and husband and \\"a really lovely, kind-hearted man\\". He said he suffered a \\"massive\\" asthma attack at 4.30am on Tuesday and died before paramedics arrived. Mr Papadopoulos' sister, Bianca Becker, said her brother was \\"the best man you'll ever meet. We're devastated.\\" His mother, Emma Papadopoulos, said the \\"chaos\\" she witnessed at the hospital on Monday night was unlike anything she had ever seen. \\"I can't believe the amount of people there that were having problems breathing,\\" she told Channel 10. Charles Guest, chief health officer for the Department of Health and Human Services, would not comment on the number of fatalities, saying the department was aware of a \\"number of deaths\\" that may be associated with the event. He declined to comment further until a cause of death had been \\"attributed\\" for these cases. At least eight people were still in intensive care on Wednesday evening. It is understood one man is in a critical condition after suffering a cardiac arrest during the thunderstorm asthma. Hospitals were inundated with more than 1000 people seeking help on Monday night after the sudden change in weather triggered respiratory problems in people across the city. There were almost 2000 calls for ambulances in five hours and about 30 people were admitted into intensive care units. Sunshine Hospital was one of the worst hit, with 18 ambulances banked up in the early hours of Tuesday morning as crews frantically worked on patients. A Western Health spokeswoman said it was \\"unheard of\\" to have that many ambulances waiting outside the suburban emergency department at one time. After-hours clinics and pharmacies were also swamped with patients as they struggled to treat people with dwindling drug supplies. The Age spoke to 10 Melbourne late night pharmacies, six of them completely sold out of Ventolin on Monday night. Staff at 24-hour Mill Park Superclinic described the night thunderstorm asthma hit Melbourne as like \\"a bomb had gone off\\". Ambulance Employees Australia acting general secretary, Danny Hill, said ambulance crews were flat out during the emergency. \\"It's almost the equivalent of a major terrorist attack,\\" he said, adding that crews reported the system functioned well. \\"So while there would have been quite a lot of ramping across the city [paramedics] were pretty happy the crooker patients got dealt with quite quickly.\\" Asthma Foundation Victoria chief executive Robin Ould said he would write to Ms Hennessy calling for an action plan to deal with future asthma events.

Q: Problem: a set consists of 15 numbers , all are even or multiple of 5 . if 8 numbers are even and 10 numbers are multiple of 5 , how many numbers is multiple of 10 ? Options: a ) 0 , b ) 1 , c ) 2 , d ) 3 , e ) 5 A:","output":"To answer this question, we need to use the definition of multiples of given numbers, specifically even numbers, multiples of 5, and multiples of 10. We are given that the set has 15 numbers, out of which 8 are even and 10 are multiples of 5. Now, we need to find out the numbers that are multiples of 10, which is the intersection of the two given conditions (even and multiple of 5). A multiple of 10 is an even number since it has 2 as a factor, and it is also a multiple of 5 because it has 5 as a factor. Since there are 8 even numbers and 10 multiples of 5, we need to find the common numbers between these two sets. Let x be the number of elements that are multiples of 10. Thus, we have 8 even numbers + 10 multiples of 5 - x (multiples of 10) = 15 total numbers in the set. By solving for x, we arrive at the equation: 8 + 10 - x = 15. Subtracting 18 from both sides and changing the sign of x, we get x = 18 - 15, which leads to x = 3. Hence, there are 3 numbers in the set that are multiples of 10.

It is easy to see how a defeat for the president on Syria will effectively bring his presidency to a standstill. But, honestly, even getting his way on Syria will make liberals unhappy. A presidential loss on a resolution for the use of force would be extraordinary. The rebellion by Democrats that would result in such a defeat would complete the humiliation for President Obama and deprive him of the ability to flail at Republican straw men. After a loss on the resolution, Republicans and Democrats alike would readily conclude that they don’t have much reason to follow the president’s lead for the remainder of his term. Like the foreign policy he has propounded, Obama would be perceived as weak, unimpressive and easily ignored. If he can’t persuade the country and/or Congress on matters of war and peace, how is he going to sway them on the budget or other domestic matters? His lame-duck status would be a given. If the resolution fails, those Democrats who went out on a limb on Syria to support the use of force would find themselves vulnerable, while those on the left who rejected the use of force would realize the president’s political survival is at odds with the progressive agenda; the president, they soon would recognize, can be sacrificed for the sake of the left. The dream-boat presidency would be in tatters, with the most liberal elements of the party ready to put Obama behind them. But if Obama wins then Democrats face a different set of problems. The sequester cuts on defense would prove difficult to sustain. How would they pay for Syria? The Republican leadership that backs the president would have shown some muscle and could beat the rap that they are rejectionists. Having put country before politics, they would be newly confident in any future face-off against Obama. And progressives would be mightily disappointed, seeing their political idol mimic President George W. Bush once again (as he has on drones and the NSA). Moreover, in a country newly engaged in military action — with left and right railing at the president — there may be little appetite for the president’s domestic agenda. This truly is a lose-lose for Democrats. Voting with the president sacrifices their own political standing with the left for very little, giving up on their “nation building at home” mantra; they’ll be shifting the nation’s agenda to war and endorsing American unilateralism. Abandoning the president on Syria, however, virtually guarantees the president’s collapse. Either way this works, out you can expect a segment of Democrats to give up on him, sending his poll numbers into Bush territory. All of this said, the president’s personal plea not to humiliate him domestically and internationally may keep sufficient numbers of Democrats on his side to pass the resolution. Those who see the horrible ramifications in the United States’ failure to act should hope he does guilt Democrats into standing by him. As for Democrats, sooner or later they must decide the fate of their post-Obama party. Syria will only hasten that process and, in all likelihood, and give a boost to the most liberal elements in the party (they’ll either be the aggrieved losers or triumphant in derailing a war). That’s good for the far left and for Republicans (if they can seize the center once again); it’s really bad for Hillary Clinton, who once again will find herself out of step with her party. What was this article about?","output":"The article discusses the lose-lose situation for Democrats regarding President Obama's stance on Syria. If the president loses a resolution for the use of force, it will likely bring his presidency to a standstill and weaken his influence on foreign and domestic matters.

It is one of the few films, perhaps the only one, that actually gave me shivers: not even Pasolini´s Sálo, to which this film bears comparison, affected me like that. I saw echoes in the film from filmmakers like Pasolini, Fassbinder and others. I had to ask myself, what was it about the film that made me feel like I did? I think the answer would be that I was watching a horror film, but one that defies or even reverses the conventions of said genre. Typically, in a horror film, horrible and frightening things will happen, but on the margins of civilized society: abandoned houses, deserted hotels, castles, churchyards, morgues etc. This handling of the subject in horror is, I think, a sort of defence mechanism, a principle of darkness and opacity functioning as a sort of projective space for the desires and fears of the viewer. So, from this perspective, Hundstage is not a horror film; it takes place in a perfectly normal society, and so doesn´t dabble in the histrionics of the horror film. But what you see is the displacement of certain key thematics from the horror genre, especially concerning the body and its violation, the stages of fright and torture it can be put through. What Seidl does is to use the settings of an everyday, middle class society as a stage on which is relayed a repetitious play of sexual aggression, loneliness, lack and violation of intimacy and integrity: precisely the themes you would find in horror, but subjected to a principle of light and transparency from which there is no escape. It is precisely within this displacement that the power of Seidl´s film resides. Hundstage deals with these matters as a function of the everyday, displays them in quotidian repetition, rather than as sites of extremity and catharsis - a move you would encounter in said horror genre. One important point of reference here is Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Fassbinder also had a way of blending the political with the personal in his films, a tactics of the melodrama that allowed him to deal in a serious and even moral way with political issues like racism, domination, desire, questions concerning ownership, sexual property and control, fascism and capitalism etc. Seidl´s tactic of making the mechanisms of everyday society the subject of his film puts him in close proximity with Fassbinder; like this German ally, he has a sort of political vision of society that he feels it is his responsibility to put forward in his films. During a seminar at the Gothenburg Film Festival this year, at which Seidl was a guest, he was asked why he would have so many instances of violated, subjugated women in Hundstage, but no instances of a woman fighting back, liberating herself. Seidl replied that some may view it as immoral to show violence against women, but that he himself felt it would be immoral not to show it. An artistic statement as good as any, I think. Thank you.

Choose your answer from: I. negative II. positive","output":"This review seems more positive because the writer is discussing the powerful impact the film had on them and how it deals with important themes.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis? a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;","output":"b). it is not possible to tell; Before proceeding with an analysis on whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's first break down the given statements: 1. Premise: Maybe a man. This statement is suggesting that there is a possibility that the subject in question is a man, but it neither confirms nor denies that the subject is indeed a man. The term \\"maybe\\" indicates uncertainty and suggests other potential outcomes (i.e., the subject could also not be a man). 2. Hypothesis: Perhaps many things, a man included. The hypothesis puts forth the idea that the subject could be any number of things, with a man being one of the possibilities. Similar to the premise, the hypothesis does not commit to a specific assertion, as it also introduces the term \\"perhaps\\" which indicates uncertainty. Now, let's consider the concept of entailment: Entailment in logic refers to the relationship between statements where if one statement (the premise) is true, then another statement (the hypothesis) must also be true as a result of the first statement's truth. If the truth of the hypothesis is entirely dependent upon the truth of the premise, then the premise is said to entail the hypothesis. Given the definitions of the statements and entailment, it is not possible to tell if the premise entails the hypothesis in this case. The premise and hypothesis both express uncertainty, and neither statement claims the subject is definitively a man. In other words, there is no concrete information presented that would allow concluding that the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis or vice versa. However, there is a possible intuitive connection between the premise and the hypothesis: both are uncertain statements that consider the subject could be a man among other possibilities. Though not a logically structured entailment, the hypothesis can be seen as an elaboration or expansion of the premise."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence in English.","output":"Certainly, but I can not just write a sentence. Let me provide you with more detailed and extensive information. English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca. It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient Germanic peoples that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name, England. Both names derive from Anglia, a peninsula on the Baltic Sea. English is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon, with its vocabulary significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), and to a greater degree Latin and French. English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a group of West Germanic (Ingvaeonic) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are collectively called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England and was a period in which the language was influenced by French. Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London, the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift. Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States. Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science, navigation and law. As of today, English is the third most spoken native language in the world, after Mandarin Chinese and Spanish. It serves as a native language for some 379 million people globally, moreover, it is estimated that around 753 million people speak it as a second language. Essentially, it is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. Learning English has several advantages, as it paves the way for job opportunities, aids in cross-cultural communication, and is a requirement in many fields, enterprises, and organizations worldwide. It's the leading business language and has become almost a necessity for people to speak English if they are to enter a global workforce, research from all over the world shows that cross-border business communication is most often conducted in English. Also, English proficiency allows people to access a wealth of information, given that it's the language of the internet, science, diplomacy, and tourism. Many of the world's top films, books and music are also published and produced in English. Therefore, learning English gives you access to a broader range of information, experiences, and other cultures."},{"instruction":"Title: A good, portable dictionary for those with a good vocabulary Review: What I want in a (portable) dictionary is one that will have the words I look up.

Colpoys.\\" From this premise, we can infer that ITC Executive Director Lisa A. Colpoys is discussing content-management system (CMS) software in her statement. A content-management system is typically a software application that allows users to create, manage, and modify digital content efficiently. In the context of websites, a CMS is a popular solution that streamlines the process of managing and updating web content without the need for extensive technical knowledge or programming. Now, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"ITC Executive Director Lisa A. Colpoys said with a software with a system that works in toys for children.\\" This hypothesis is focused on describing a software system embedded within toys for children. From this statement, we can assume that the software or system mentioned is intended to provide some functionality or capability specifically for children's toys. The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is not direct, as the topics appear to be different. Yet, one potential connection could be that the content-management system discussed by Lisa A. Colpoys could be employed to manage content related to children's toys or within a website of an organization that deals with children's toys. However, based on the initial premise alone, we cannot conclusively determine that ITC Executive Director Lisa A. Colpoys is saying that there is a software or system embedded within toys for children. While both the premise and the hypothesis reference software systems, they describe different types and applications. The firm link between the premise and the hypothesis cannot be established solely based on the information provided in the premise. To conclude whether the hypothesis is entailed, we would require additional context to connect the content-management system software discussed by Lisa A. Colpoys to a system that operates within children's toys.
