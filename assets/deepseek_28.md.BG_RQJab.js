Clise, rescued as an emaciated kitten from a local park, grew up to be morbidly obese. His interests mainly involved eating food, begging for food, or going around the neighborhood scrounging for food. He could hear a can opener from a mile away. Monkey was a more active cat. He liked to chase the laser pointer and was the first to run to the door when someone arrived. But he could also be lazy, lounging in a sunbeam or stretched out on the couch. Both of them liked to watch TV. Soon after I moved in, I started having health issues which necessitated a lot of time lounging around myself. This was the era of reality TV, back when much of it was actually good. The cats, Monkey especially, watched with me. Monkey definitely had his preferences. His favorite shows were The Girls Next Door and Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making The Team. Notice a theme here? Playboy Playmates and professional cheerleaders. Monkey liked his T & A (tits and ass). If one of these shows was on, and I turned it to Project Runway or something, Monkey would march off. But as soon as I turned it back, and he could hear the high-pitched giggling, he’d come running back. Clise’s favorite shows were Top Chef, Iron Chef, and Rachael Ray. Food porn. If there was something he especially craved, like a shrimp stir-fry, he’d assume a begging pose, right in front of the TV, as if Rachael might take pity on him and throw him a scrap or two. I moved out about a year later. A few months previous, Monkey ended up catching some wasting disease and dying, but Clise, as far as I know, is still there, begging for scraps from anyone he can — in real life or televised.

Movie Review: Interstellar, Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction tour de force, combines mind-bending concepts with grand visuals and extraordinary storytelling to enthrall audiences with a galactic journey unlike any other. Anchored by exceptional performances from Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain, Interstellar navigates through the vast realms of space and time, taking us on a spectacular odyssey that explores the human spirit and our innate drive to survive. Set in a terrifyingly plausible near-future Earth, the film poses an existential question: what if our home becomes inhospitable? As resources dwindle and mankind stands on the edge of extinction, a group of astronauts, led by the intrepid Cooper (McConaughey), must embark on a perilous mission to search for a new home. They're aided by a team of scientists, including the fiercely determined Dr. Amelia Brand (Hathaway), and guided by the mysterious Professor Brand (Michael Caine). Nolan's skillful direction transports us to the far reaches of the cosmos, with jaw-dropping visual effects that make us feel as if we're journeying alongside the astronauts. From the candy-coloured clouds of a gas giant to the icy depths of a planet orbiting a black hole, Interstellar's distinct and vivid depictions of celestial landscapes are nothing short of breathtaking. The film also excels in its portrayal of the human experience. McConaughey delivers a powerful and emotionally charged performance as a father torn between his love for his family and the fate of humanity. It's his strength and vulnerability that make his character's decisions and sacrifices resonate so deeply with viewers. Similarly, Hathaway shines as the brilliant and resilient Dr. Brand, whose own burden of loss serves to highlight the film's recurring theme of love and how it transcends boundaries. Their onscreen chemistry, along with the rest of the ensemble cast, is undeniably potent, grounding the film in emotional depth and complexity. Interstellar's ambitious plot delves into some of the most intriguing and challenging concepts of theoretical physics. From time dilation to wormholes and black holes, Nolan makes these difficult ideas accessible without oversimplifying them, resulting in an intellectually stimulating and thought-provoking experience. Hans Zimmer's haunting and unforgettable score perfectly complements the film, accentuating its suspenseful and heartrending moments. However, the grandiose nature of Interstellar's storytelling occasionally falters, with a script that sometimes borders on being convoluted. The pacing, although necessary for such a layered narrative, might not be everyone's cup of tea, but despite these minor shortcomings, Nolan's ambitious vision is absolutely praiseworthy. In conclusion, Interstellar is a monumental achievement in filmmaking that offers a visceral and exhilarating exploration of themes such as love, sacrifice, and our place in the cosmos. With its transcendent visual effects, exceptional performances, and a heart-wrenching narrative that challenges our understanding of the universe, this film stands as a testament to Nolan's prodigious talent and cements its place as a modern science fiction classic.

Anthony Weiner (D-NY) was the victim of a “prank” or a “hack.” The following photograph, reminiscent of that posted by former Rep. Chris Lee (R-NY) on Craigslist earlier this year, was allegedly sent to the young woman on Friday, May 20, 2011 via a Yahoo! email address that she claims was an alternate alias for Rep. Weiner: The array of images behind the shirtless congressman include several apparently identifying portraits, including a photograph that appears to be of Rep. Weiner with former President Bill Clinton (at above right, behind the left shoulder). A Google search for the email address Rep. Weiner allegedly used on that occasion yields an invisible Yahoo! profile with images that appear to be a repository for some of Rep. Weiner’s personal photographs. The profile automatically provides what appear to be the last three uploaded photographs in thumbnail form. Below is a screen grab taken yesterday from that page: On Wednesday, May 18, 2011, Rep. Weiner sent an email to the young woman from that same Yahoo! email address that included the now-infamous grey underwear photograph (attached to the email as “package.JPG”): Later that same day, apparently after receiving several images from the young woman, Rep. Weiner allegedly sent another photograph to her from the same Yahoo! email address. That photograph (attached to the email as “ready.JPG”) is extremely graphic, and leaves nothing to the imagination. ||||| Earlier this morning, BigGovernment.com and BigJournalism.com revealed that a woman had come forward with what she claims are intimate photographs, chats, and emails that she allegedly exchanged with Rep.

Everyone wanted to know what would happen during this game. On the day of the game, the two teams met on the field, and they tried their best to win. Both teams played hard and showed good sportsmanship. Fans of both teams were excited and cheered for their favorite players. The players from England and the Republic of Ireland played for a long time, and when the game was over, the score was tied.

It has been on the market for some time with a current price tag of Â£199,999. Carmarthen Civic Society wants the building returned to its former glory and turned into accommodation, office space or residential care. The workhouse infirmary and boiler house were built on Penlan Road in response to the Poor Law Act 1834, which required each parish to look after its own poor residents. Paupers were housed in workhouses and worked several hours a day in return for clothes and food. On 19 June 1843, the workhouse was stormed by Rebecca Rioters. Mary Thorley, vice chairwoman of the civic society, explained there had been unrest in the area for years. \\"It was known throughout the area that on the 19th of June there was going to be a march on Carmarthen,\\" she said. \\"The idea had been to request lesser fines for some of their numbers who had been in court, but somehow, whether it was the Carmarthen mob or the rioters, they turned their attention to the workhouse.\\" \\"They stormed the building and told the paupers they were going to free them,\\" said Ms Thorley. Anticipating the protest, The 4th Light Dragoons had made their way from Cardiff and were seen coming up the road with their swords drawn. The rioters dispersed and some were arrested. The building continued to be used as a workhouse until the 1930s, and was more recently used as offices for the BBC and Carmarthenshire council. Linda Jones, chairwoman of the civic society, said it was \\"such a shame to see a lovely building going to rack and ruin\\". She said it could be turned into accommodation or residential care, for which she said there was a demand. There is a plaque to mark the workhouse attack, but Ms Thorley believes there should be more of a tribute, describing the Rebecca Riots as \\"one of the most important social events in Welsh history\\", similar to one in St Clears. \\"It was the 1840s and people were just beginning to realise that, actually, their lives were important. They had things to say and they had rights too,\\" added Ms Thorley. \\"It wasn't just about land owners and people in power.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"The Carmarthen workhouse, a historical building that played a significant role during the Rebecca Riots in 1843, has been on the market with a current price tag of £199,999.

The workhouse was constructed in response to the Poor Law Act 1834, in which paupers were housed and worked in exchange for basic necessities. During the Rebecca Riots, protesters stormed the building with the intention of freeing the paupers. The building continued serving as a workhouse until the 1930s and was later used as offices for the BBC and Carmarthenshire Council.

On the left side of the equation, -56*f and -38*f are like terms, so you can combine them: (-56 - 38) * f = -94 * f Thus, the equation becomes: -94*f = 22*f - 1160 Step 2: Get all terms with the variable f on one side of the equation. To achieve this, add 94*f to both sides of the equation: -94*f + 94*f = 22*f - 1160 + 94*f This simplifies to: 0 = 116*f - 1160 Step 3: Isolate the variable f. Now, we want to get f by itself. First, move the constant term (in this case, 1160) to the other side of the equation by adding 1160 to both sides: 116*f - 1160 + 1160 = 1160 116*f = 1160 Next, divide both sides of the equation by 116 to isolate f: (116*f) / 116 = 1160 / 116 This simplifies to: f = 10 So, the solution of the given equation is f = 10."},{"instruction":"How might one describe the sentiment of this review?

It's the story of the three little pigs and the big bad wolf that blew down a house made of straw and one made of sticks. The only house left standing was the one made of bricks. Now there is new evidence to suggest that houses built with bales of straw can be very strong. They are also very environmental. Pete Walker is a professor at the University of Bath in Britain. He and a team of researchers there have built a house made out of straw bales and hemp material. During the next twelve months the team will study the effectiveness of these materials in home building. Professor Walker says there are many good reasons for using straw. Professor Walker: \\"One of the benefits is it's a relatively inexpensive renewable material that's readily available.\\" He also agrees that straw takes in carbon dioxide as it grows and helps the environment in other ways. So it can be seen as having no harmful effects on the environment. Professor Walker: \\"The straw bale walls are relatively thick and so all that straw provides very good thermal insulation. So we make buildings that require very little heating in the winter or indeed very little cooling in the summer. So they require very little additional energy.\\" Professor Walker says this reduces home operating expenses. It also reduces the effect on the environment. He says the current interest in straw bale houses is a direct response to the problem of climate change. David Lanfear owns an eco-friendly home building service in the United States called Bale on Bale Construction. He says he laughed when some friends first told him about houses built of straw. But after doing his own research, he learned that building with straw bales made a lot of sense. He has now helped to build more than ten straw bale houses and says the building material is becoming more widely accepted. To build the houses, he fills a wood frame with tightly packed bales of straw. Next he coats the walls inside and out with layers of clay plaster. He says the common ideas... Question: What can we infer from the passage? - Using straw to build houses is dearer than using bricks. - The houses built with bales of straw are stronger than those built with bricks. - Straw which is convenient to get is much cheaper than thick bricks. - Houses made of bricks are no better than those made of straw. The answer is:","output":"Straw which is convenient to get is much cheaper than thick bricks."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"yeah he was a real wild one\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"He was a really rowdy one.\\" is true?","output":"To determine if the hypothesis \\"He was a really rowdy one\\" is true based on the premise \\"yeah he was a real wild one\\", let's go through the following steps: 1. Define the key terms - Wild and Rowdy Wild: Uncontrolled or unrestrained, especially in the pursuit of pleasure. It often involves unconventional and unexpected behavior. Rowdy: Being loud, disruptive, or potentially causing trouble. 2. Compare the meanings - We can observe that both \\"wild\\" and \\"rowdy\\" share some common traits, such as being unconventional, disruptive, or causing trouble. 3. Analyze the context - Based on the given premise: \\"yeah he was a real wild one\\", we know that the individual was uncontrolled or unrestrained, potentially partaking in unconventional or unexpected behaviors. 4. Determine if the hypothesis is true - Based on the comparison of the meanings of \\"wild\\" and \\"rowdy\\", we can reasonably assume that someone who is \\"wild\\" is likely to display \\"rowdy\\" behavior as well.

From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.\\"? The answer is:","output":"Question: Based on the passage, what were the significant contributions of Gregor Mendel to the understanding of genetic inheritance patterns in organisms, and how did his work serve as a foundation for later concepts in genetics? Answer: The passage explains that Gregor Mendel's work on studying inheritance patterns in 8,000 common edible pea plants laid the foundation for understanding several key concepts in genetics. Some of his significant contributions include: 1. Identifying and describing the existence of discrete inheritable units responsible for observable physical characteristics. These units would later be known as genes. 2. Establishing the concept of 2n combinations, where n represents the number of differing characteristics in the original peas, to explain the mathematical patterns of inheritance. 3. Pioneering the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of an organism), which became fundamental concepts in genetic studies. 4. Demonstrating independent assortment, which is the random distribution of genes from parents to offspring, irrespective of other gene pairings during gamete formation. 5. Distinguishing between dominant and recessive traits. Mendel showed how dominant traits can mask the presence of recessive traits in offspring. 6. Differentiating between heterozygotes (organisms with two different alleles for a specific gene) and homozygotes (organisms with two identical alleles for a particular gene). 7. Introducing the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance, which refers to the observation that some traits are determined by a single gene and are not influenced by other genes or the environment. Mendel's extensive work on genetic inheritance patterns helped lay the foundation for our understanding of modern genetics, as his findings have been crucial in shaping the field's development over time."},{"instruction":"Data: name = Zizzi, eatType = coffee shop, priceRange = less than £20, area = city centre, familyFriendly = yes.

Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Jesus Christ Superstar is a 1970 rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. The musical started as a rock opera concept album before its Broadway debut in 1971. The musical is sung-through, with no spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the Gospels' accounts of the last week of Jesus's life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. It highlights political and interpersonal struggles between Judas Iscariot and Jesus that are not present in the Bible narratives. - Slowhand is a 1977 album by Eric Clapton.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - \\"Lay Down Sally\\" is a song performed by Eric Clapton, and written by Clapton, Marcella Detroit (as Marcy Levy, the diminutive form of her birth name), and George Terry.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Marcella Detroit (born Marcella Levy, June 21, 1952) is an American soprano vocalist (perhaps best known for her backup singing on many Top 20 Billboard hits), guitarist, and songwriter.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Traffic problems are an everyday concern in many cities,including Washington,DC.A growing number of Washingtonians are turning to bicycles to get to and from work.In fact,the number of commuters who use bicycles has doubled in the city since 2007. Ralph Buehler teaches urban planning at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,popularly known as Virginia Tech.He has written a book about urban biking,called \\"City Cycling\\". He says there is a reason why urban bike tiding is now becoming more popular. \\"Over the last 60 to 70 years.cities in the U.S.have been adapted to the automobile.\\" \\"Most cities took advantage of the money coming for the interstate highway system,from the federal government,starting in 1956.There was a 90 percent federal match so the cities only had to put up 10%.It was very tempting.\\" In the years after World War Two,many Americans moved to suburban communities,just outside major cities,They decided to travel great distances to and from work in exchange for a home in the suburbs.Their cars became a symbol of freedom. But today,many people believe they can save money by living in the city. Greg Billing is with the Washington Area Bicyclist Association.\\"When a person makes a change from 04 using a car to using a bike,they are saving anywhere between 8 or9,000 a year.\\" Ralph Buehler says governments save money when people use bicycles.\\"Building bicycling facilities is much cheaper than building and maintaining road facilities or public transport.\\" Washington,DC has also taken steps to protect bike riders.It approved a safe passing law and created areas on the road between cars and bikes. The United States Census Bureau says 4%of the city's workers ride to work by bike.The only city on the East Coast with more bike commuters is New York. Question: What can we know from Ralph Buehler's statement? Answer: A:","output":"From Ralph Buehler's statement, we can understand that urban biking has become more popular in recent years because cities in the U.S. were primarily adapted to automobiles for the past 60 to 70 years. This adaptation occurred as cities took advantage of federal funding for the interstate highway system, which began in 1956. Additionally, Buehler highlights that governments can save money when people use bicycles, as building and maintaining bicycling facilities is cheaper than constructing and maintaining road facilities or public transport."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: When was the fight took place? in 2008 Answer:","output":"Title: The Battle of 2008 Genre: Action / Adventure / Drama Plot Summary: In 2008, a secret underground fight club is exposed and turns into an intense street battle when a rogue fighter seeks revenge on its leader.

Step 5: The fight takes place in 2008 Following the exposure, fights that were once underground now erupt in the streets as the fighters, including Jake, confront Victor and his loyal subordinates. The city becomes a battleground as two factions clash in a series of intense and dramatic fight sequences. Step 6: Explore the underlying theme As the film progresses, it becomes evident that the fighters are not merely victims of Victor's manipulation but are also seeking a sense of purpose amidst their chaotic lives. The fight club had given them a reason to hone their skills and personal power, ultimately uniting them as a close-knit group. Step 7: Climactic confrontation and resolution In the final battle, Jake faces off against Victor in a brutal fight. After a hard-won victory, Jake manages to dismantle the fight club's operations and expose Victor's criminal actions. The film concludes with the fighters, now united and armed with a deeper understanding of their strength, working together to create a legitimate martial arts school, turning the dark legacy of the fight club into a force for good in their community. Step 8: Reflection on the fight Looking back on the events of 2008, the fighters acknowledge the difficult path they've walked but take pride in their growth, their unity, and their newfound purpose.

The father of NSA whistleblower Eric Snowden publicly appealed for his son to come home and begged him to stop leaking classified government information. Lonnie Snowden, 52, said in an interview on Sunday that he was also against surveillance programs being carried out on U.S. citizens. However he pleaded with his 29-year-old son, a former NSA employee, to come home despite the fact that he may face a prison sentence. Snowden, 29, has been hiding out in Hong. Kong since the start of this month when he outed himself as the. person who leaked classified information about the NSA's surveillance. Scroll down for video. Plea to his son: Lonnie Snowden, the father of NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden, holds up a picture of his son as a young boy as he begged him to return to the U.S. Lonnie Snowden told Fox & Friends: 'I’m here because I’m really. concerned about the misinformation in the media. He. is a sensitive, caring young man... He just is a deep thinker.' Mr Snowden said that his son was not a high school drop-out as has been reported but had missed several months of teaching because he was ill during his sophomore year. He completed his high school equivalency at a community college. Lonnie Snowden has other children and is keen to protect their identities following the scandal, he said. Mr Snowden senior also said that he is against any government surveillance program that snooped on its citizens emails and text messages. He said: 'In my opinion, they have no right. Not even under the guise of, ''We need to keep you safe.'' … Don’t tread on us.' The. concerned father begged his son to return to the U.S. despite the. threat that he may face a prison sentence, telling him not to leak or. say anything more. Underground: Snowden, 29, is currently hiding out in Hong Kong having leaked secrets about the National Security Agency's PRISM program. Shortly after Edward Snowden made the revelations, federal agents visited the Pennsylvania home of his father and stepmother. The 29-year-old is currently hiding out in Hong Kong having leaked secrets about the National Security Agency's PRISM program, which monitors millions of American citizens, to the media. His decision to reveal the national secrets have also left his girlfriend Lindsay Mills, 28, completely devastated. Lindsay had previously written on her blog about how she was ‘adrift’ at losing Snowden who she described as her ‘mystery man’. Family members have said that Lindsay is currently with friends on the West Coast, though she could still be in Hawaii, where she and Snowden had been living together. He never told Mills about his plan - saying only that he needed to leave for a few weeks and offering a vague explanation. The shocking leak of classified surveillance programs has sent shock waves through the nation. Some have hailed Snowden as a hero. Several high-profile members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, are calling him a traitor, including former VP Dick Cheney. His whereabouts are currently unknown - though he is believed to still be in Hong Kong.

Use that information to determine whether they are young (too young for a job), a professional, a skilled worker, or are retired. Lines near the eyes, mouth or neck will tell you how old the person is likely to be. Age spots on hands can be a good indication of their decade as well. Some people who have had a lot of sun exposure or who have smoked, may display more wrinkles, while those living in cooler and moister climates may have smoother skin. Sometimes wealth or the desire to be wealthy is shown in the quality of garments, shoes and even a haircut. Look for a wristwatch, diamond earrings or designer bags. However, be wary - many educated people shun such articles, and wear more casual clothing. Some may even sport dishevelled hairdo's and have facial hair (beards or moustaches in men.) Alternatively, look for signs of thriftiness. Faded clothes, discount clothing labels or worn shoes might tell you if a person has less money, although many principled people shun the pressure dictated by fashion and make a point of wearing simple clothes made of natural fabrics which naturally fade faster. In addition certain very good shoe brands outlast cheaper brands by far, and although they may start to look worn with time, they are made to last for more than a decade, and therefore will cost many times over what a cheaper shoe in a similar style would cost. While these signals may tell you what economic decisions the person has made, they do not translate into behavior. If the person has their hair in place, their clothing pressed and an attention to style, they may be very detail oriented.

Anyway so I mean its clearly says that this facility is a waxing center, they don't offer any other services you would think that the staff would be pro's however I'm unsure if the red headed girl I had was new which I don't think she was because as soon as I was done she happily greeted another customer by name before the receptionist gave her the form.

He tried to purchase a lethal dose of the toxin online, but was caught by an undercover FBI agent posing as a seller, prosecutors said. Mr Ali denies a charge of attempting to possess a chemical weapon. In encrypted chats, Mr Ali and the US agent discussed the price of a lethal dose and repeat purchases, jurors were told. Sally Howes QC, prosecuting, said the agent arranged for a harmless powder hidden inside a toy car to be sent to Mr Ali's home. A police raid in February found a computer used to access the \\"dark web\\" and a mobile phone which had been used to search for \\"homemade poison\\" and \\"what poison is easily concealed?\\". Records also showed he had made a payment using online currency Bitcoin days before the delivery. In one exchange with the undercover agent, Bolton-born Mr Ali was told he could test the ricin on a rodent, the court heard. The phone found at Mr Ali's flat was also used for search for \\"Liverpool pet shop\\" and had a note saying \\"get pet to murder\\". Ms Howes QC told jurors Mr Ali admits contacting the undercover agent and ordering the \\"ricin\\". Ricin is a naturally-occurring substance found in the seeds of the castor oil plant. It was described in court as \\"the poisoner's perfect poison\\" because its symptoms are non-specific and it does not show up in a post-mortem examination. A 100 mg dose is enough to kill up to 280 people within three to five days if ingested or injected while 500 mg can kill between 700 and 1,400 people, said Ms Howes QC. In Mr Ali's defence, she said, he is likely to claim he wanted to experiment with and understand the workings of the \\"dark web\\" and to see if he could buy ricin out of curiosity. His claim that he wanted to posses the poison for \\"peaceful purposes\\", but the Crown say the duration and nature of his internet searches contradict this. The defence will also rely on an assessment that Mr Ali has personality traits associated with Asperger's Syndrome to explain his conduct, Ms Howes QC said. Police have found no evidence that Mr Ali, who denies attempting to possess a chemical weapon between 10 January and 12 February, has any association with terrorist activities or organisations. The trial, which is expected to last for two weeks, continues.

This definition was formalized in 2006 and led to the reclassification of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet. Makemake, mentioned in your statement, is indeed a dwarf planet, discovered in 2005. It is located in the outer solar system in a region known as the Kuiper Belt. However, Makemake, or any specific celestial body, doesn't essentially \\"make\\" a dwarf planet. The categorization of a celestial body as a dwarf planet depends on the mentioned characteristics decided by the IAU.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Phospholipids As its name suggests, a phospholipid is a bond between the glycerol component of a lipid and a phosphorous molecule. In fact, phospholipids are similar in structure to triglycerides. However, instead of having three fatty acids, a phospholipid is generated from a diglyceride, a glycerol with just two fatty acid chains (Figure 2.23). The third binding site on the glycerol is taken up by the phosphate group, which in turn is attached to a polar “head” region of the molecule. Recall that triglycerides are nonpolar and hydrophobic. This still holds for the fatty acid portion of a phospholipid compound. However, the head of a phospholipid contains charges on the phosphate groups, as well as on the nitrogen atom. These charges make the phospholipid head hydrophilic. Therefore, phospholipids are said to have hydrophobic tails, containing the neutral fatty acids, and hydrophilic heads, containing the charged phosphate groups and nitrogen atom.

Sega's financial troubles led to several major structural changes at the company in the early 2000s, with development division United Game Artists being absorbed by Sonic Team in 2003, and Sonic Team USA eventually becoming Sega Studios USA in 2004. - Sonic Crackers , also sometimes referred to as Sonic Stadium ( due to the ROM header containing the title Sonic Studium ( sic ) ) , is an early Sonic the Hedgehog prototype video game for the Sega Genesis . While it was never officially released in the form of a Sonic the Hedgehog game , the concepts , engine , and various other materials in the prototype were subsequently implemented in the Sega 32X game Knuckles ' Chaotix in 1995 , and the prototype itself is widely circulated on the internet . - A 16-bit register can store 2 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 (-1 × 2) through 32,767 (2 - 1); the unsigned range is 0 through 65,535 (2 - 1). Since 2 is 65,536, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64 KiB of byte-addressable memory. - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre. - The is a third-generation home video game console that was manufactured by Sega. It was originally released in 1985 as the Sega Mark III in Japan. After being redesigned prior to its North American launch, the console was renamed Master System and released in 1986 in North America, 1987 in Europe, and 1989 in Brazil. The redesigned Master System was also released in Japan in 1987. Both the Mark III and the original Master System models could play with both cartridges (or \\"Mega Cartridges\\", as they were officially called) and the credit card-sized Sega Cards, which retailed at lower prices than cartridges but had lower storage capacity; the Master System II and later models did not have the card slot. The Master System also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games. - Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica).

It is a spin-off to the \\"Sonic the Hedgehog\\" series, and the only one to be released for the system. It is also one of a few that does not feature Sonic himself. Instead, the game centers around Knuckles the Echidna, and the Chaotix team of characters as they try to stop Dr. Robotnik and Metal Sonic from their evil plans. Gameplay is similar to earlier \\"Sonic\\" titles, however, the game introduces a partner system in which the player's character is connected to another via a ring force bond with \\"rubber band\\" physics.

Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra, or fragmented rock, to form pyroclastic rock. Question: does magma consist only of rock forming minerals? Pick your answer from: 1). no. 2). yes.","output":"1). No. Magma does not consist only of rock forming minerals. While it is predominantly composed of molten or semi-molten rock and some rock-forming minerals, magma also contains a variety of other components that contribute to its composition and behavior. Below are several key components of magma aside from rock-forming minerals: 1. Volatiles: These are gaseous components in magma, such as water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Volatiles can have a significant impact on the viscosity of magma and play an important role in volcanic eruptions, influencing the explosivity and style of eruption. As magma rises towards the surface, decreasing pressure allows the dissolved gases to expand, which can cause the magma to froth and potentially lead to an explosive eruption. 2. Suspended Crystals: Magma can carry crystals that have formed from the cooling and solidification of minerals within the magma chamber. These crystals can vary in size and composition, with some being large enough to be easily observed while others are microscopic. The presence of suspended crystals can affect the overall viscosity of magma, as well as influence how it crystallizes and solidifies as it cools. 3. Dissolved Gases: Much like volatiles, dissolved gases are a critical aspect of magma's properties. Some examples of dissolved gases include hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and argon (Ar). These gases are dissolved within the magma and can be released during volcanic eruptions or diffuse through the surrounding rocks, significantly affecting the magma's overall composition and behavior. 4. Gas Bubbles: Magma may contain various gases, forming bubbles as it reaches the Earth's surface or when exposed to a decrease in pressure. These bubbles can impact the flow, viscosity, and explosiveness of the magma. Therefore, magma is not composed solely of rock-forming minerals, but of a complex mixture of molten rock, volatiles, suspended crystals, dissolved gases, and sometimes gas bubbles. These various components and their interactions shape the behavior and properties of magma, ultimately influencing the characteristics of the igneous rocks that form from it and the style of volcanic eruptions associated with it."},{"instruction":"Build a movie plot around this: Who abandoned Mukhsin and his elder brother when they were young? Their mother Answer:","output":"Step 1: Establishing the main characters and setting The main characters of the movie are Mukhsin, his elder brother Haris, and their mother, Yasmine. The story is set in a small, rural town where Mukhsin and Haris have grown up after being abandoned by Yasmine when they were young. Step 2: Creating a backstory Yasmine, a young and struggling mother, was unable to cope with the challenges of raising two children on her own. She made the difficult and heart-wrenching decision to leave Mukhsin and Haris at an orphanage for their own good, hoping they would have a better life there. Although she made this decision out of love, the trauma of abandonment deeply affected the brothers. Step 3: Introducing the main conflict and plot Years later, Mukhsin and Haris are now young adults who have led relatively normal lives despite their difficult childhoods. However, they have never forgotten their mother and are determined to find her and get answers to the questions that have haunted them throughout their lives. This quest becomes the main focus of their lives, taking precedence over everything else. Step 4: Developing supporting characters and subplots Throughout their journey, Mukhsin and Haris cross paths with various people who have been affected by Yasmine's actions. These include former friends, relatives, and even other children who had been abandoned like them. Each interaction provides new insights into Yasmine's life and the reasons behind her decision, adding more complexity to the story. Subplots include the personal struggles and growth of both Mukhsin and Haris, and how their quest for answers impacts their relationships with each other, their friends, and the community. Step 5: Reunion and resolution After an arduous search, Mukhsin and Haris finally locate Yasmine, who is now living a humble life in a distant city. Upon confronting her, they learn that she had been forced into a life of extreme poverty and abuse after leaving them, and was always too ashamed to face them or reach out. As Yasmine shares her story, the brothers begin to understand the difficult circumstances that led to her decision and start to feel empathy towards her. However, they must also grapple with their feelings of hurt and betrayal. Step 6: Emotional climax and character arcs The emotional climax of the movie takes place when Mukhsin and Haris must decide whether to forgive Yasmine and attempt to rebuild their relationship, or to walk away and put their past behind them. Each brother reaches a different conclusion, with Mukhsin forgiving Yasmine and Haris choosing to move on, highlighting the unique ways in which individuals cope with trauma and emotional struggles. Step 7: Finale and closing scenes The movie ends with Mukhsin and Yasmine slowly rebuilding their bond, while Haris embarks on a new chapter in his life, carrying the lessons learned from his past experiences. The closing scenes emphasize the importance of forgiveness and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"What is an example of a tweet?","output":"A tweet is a message that someone shares on a website called Twitter.

But then, Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David), the meanest nun in the orphanage gets their attention by telling them to go inside and do their work. The kids sing \\"Everybody is Special\\", but she tells them to shut up and go to work. Later, Moe, Larry and Curly are dumped on the doorstep of the orphanage as babies. Ever since, the trio have wreaked havoc in the place, leaving the nuns who run it utterly terrified, especially Sister Mary-Mengele who has always hated the trio. Ten years later, in 1987, out of desperation, when a prospective couple comes to adopt, the exasperated nuns bring out the trio as being the only three available, eventually adding a fourth when another boy, Teddy, enters the picture. The couple, the Harters (Stephen Collins and Carly Craig), decides to pick Moe, but when he requests Larry and Curly to join him, he is dropped back off at the orphanage, and they choose Teddy instead. 25 years later in 2012, the trio (Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes and Will Sasso) are adults and are still living at the orphanage and working as janitors.

Workers worldwide get an average of 20 vacation days. Workers in France get 30 days and use all of them.","output":"Title: American Vacation Habits: A Comparative Analysis with Global Trends It's evident that every worker looks forward to their vacation time, a precious period to unwind and disconnect from the pressures of professional life. However, a recent study suggests a peculiar trend among American workers illustrating a break from international patterns. Americans, the study states, are likely to leave approximately four vacation days unused annually. This emerging trend raises several questions, including a critical one: why do Americans abandon these hard-earned days of relaxation? This study prompts a thought-provoking discussion about the vacation habits of workers in the United States compared to their global counterparts. Worldwide, most workers are provided with approximately 20 vacation days annually, with this allowance seeming satisfactory for many. The allocation of these days typically allows employees enough time to recharge and return to their duties revitalized. In stark contrast to the American inclination to forgo vacation days, workers in many other countries exploit their vacation days to the fullest. Remarkably, French workers present an interesting case study. In France, a generous 30 vacation days are presented to workers per annum, and unlike their American counterparts, French workers utilize their entire vacation allocation without fail. Whether this is a reflection of cultural differences in work-life balance or a testament to French labor laws encourages further exploration. Why there is such a disparity between American and French vacation habits bears due consideration. The phenomenon in the United States where workers are unwilling or unable to use all their vacation days possibly offers insights into broader socio-economic issues. Factors such as work pressure, job security fears, or a deeply ingrained workaholic culture could contribute to this trend. In contrast, the French model showcases an excellent blend of productivity and leisure time equilibrium. The French case may serve as an inspiration for companies and governments worldwide to revaluate their vacation policies, keeping worker wellness and satisfaction at the forefront. In conclusion, this study brings into sharp focus distinct differences concerning vacation habits among workers across the globe and highlights the need for improved work-life balance, especially in contexts like that of the United States. It is crucial for policymakers and employers to delve deeper into these patterns to ensure a healthier, happier workforce in the longer run."},{"instruction":"They love to haggle so be sure to provide them with this opportunity believe me you will benefit from this not only in material terms Add punctuation.","output":"They love to haggle, so be sure to provide them with this opportunity.

Whales have evolved from land-living mammals. As such whales must breathe air regularly, although they can remain submerged under water for long periods of time. Some species such as the sperm whale are able to stay submerged for as much as 90 minutes. They have blowholes (modified nostrils) located on top of their heads, through which air is taken in and expelled. They are warm-blooded, and have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin. With streamlined fusiform bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers, whales can travel at up to 20 knots, though they are not as flexible or agile as seals. Whales produce a great variety of vocalizations, notably the extended songs of the humpback whale. Although whales are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. Species such as humpbacks and blue whales are capable of travelling thousands of miles without feeding. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for one to two years. Once relentlessly hunted for their products, whales are now protected by international law. The North Atlantic right whales nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and the North Pacific grey whale population is ranked Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales have been depicted in various cultures worldwide, notably by the Inuit and the coastal peoples of Vietnam and Ghana, who sometimes hold whale funerals.

He is described as one of the \\"Four Horsemen of atheism\\", with Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennett. Context: Harris considers Islam to be \\"especially belligerent and inimical to the norms of civil discourse,\\" relative to other world religions. He asserts that the \\"dogmatic commitment to using violence to defend one's faith, both from within and without\\" to varying degrees, is a central Islamic doctrine that is found in few other religions to the same degree, and that \\"this difference has consequences in the real world.\\" In 2006, after the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, Harris wrote, \\"The idea that Islam is a 'peaceful religion hijacked by extremists' is a dangerous fantasy--and it is now a particularly dangerous fantasy for Muslims to indulge.

It now appears to be a truism in foreign policy circles that real reform in the Muslim world cannot be imposed from the outside. But it is important to recognize why this is so--it is so because the Muslim world is utterly deranged by its religious tribalism. In confronting the religious literalism and ignorance of the Muslim world, we must appreciate how terrifyingly isolated Muslims have become in intellectual terms.\\" He states that his criticism of the religion is aimed not at Muslims as people, but at the doctrine of Islam. Harris wrote a response to controversy over his criticism of Islam, which also aired on a debate hosted by The Huffington Post on whether critics of Islam are unfairly labeled as bigots: Is it really true that the sins for which I hold Islam accountable are \\"committed at least to an equal extent by many other groups, especially [my] own\\"? ... The freedom to poke fun at Mormonism is guaranteed [not by the First Amendment but] by the fact that Mormons do not dispatch assassins to silence their critics or summon murderous hordes in response to satire. ... Can any reader of this page imagine the staging of a similar play [to The Book of Mormon] about Islam in the United States, or anywhere else, in the year 2013? ... At this moment in history, there is only one religion that systematically stifles free expression with credible threats of violence. The truth is, we have already lost our First Amendment rights with respect to Islam--and because they brand any observation of this fact a symptom of Islamophobia, Muslim apologists like Greenwald are largely to blame. Harris has criticized common usage of the term \\"Islamophobia\\". \\"My criticism of Islam is a criticism of beliefs and their consequences,\\" he wrote following a controversial clash with Ben Affleck in October 2014 on the show Real Time with Bill Maher, \\"but my fellow liberals reflexively view it as an expression of intolerance toward people.\\" During an email exchange with Glenn Greenwald, a critic of the New Atheists, Harris argued that \\"Islamophobia is a term of propaganda designed to protect Islam from the forces of secularism by conflating all criticism of it with racism and xenophobia. And it is doing its job, because people like you have been taken in by it.\\" Question: what are his feelings towards Islam?. Whats the answer?","output":"Sam Harris has critical feelings towards Islam. He believes that Islam is more likely to encourage violence in comparison to other religions. He also thinks that people saying Islam is a peaceful religion are not facing reality. Harris wants to make it clear that he is not against Muslim people, but rather the ideas and teachings of Islam. He also doesn't like the term \\"Islamophobia\\" because he feels it's used to protect the religion from criticism, even when it's about the ideas, not the people."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process: - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person does heavy exercise happens, how will it affect more glucagon is released. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of heavy exercise does indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process of glucagon release and blood sugar regulation. To understand how this affects the system, let's first break down the process and then examine the impact of heavy exercise on each stage. 1. Blood sugar drops in the body: Blood sugar levels, also known as glucose levels, can decline during heavy exercise because the body is using glucose as a primary energy source to fuel the cells in the muscles and other organs. 2. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon: To counteract the drop in blood sugar levels, specialized cells in the pancreas called alpha-cells release the hormone glucagon. The release of this hormone is in response to low blood glucose levels and works in opposition to insulin, another hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels by promoting glucose uptake into the cells. 3. The liver converts glucagon into glucose: This is one of the key roles of glucagon: to signal the liver to break down stored glycogen (a long-chain carbohydrate) into glucose, which is then released back into the bloodstream. This process is known as glycogenolysis. In addition, glucagon also promotes the formation of new glucose molecules through a process called gluconeogenesis. 4. The liver releases glucose into the bloodstream: As the stored glycogen is broken down and new glucose molecules are formed, they are released into the bloodstream to restore blood sugar levels and fuel the body during periods of high energy demand, such as during heavy exercise. 5. Blood sugar levels are restored: The increased presence of glucose in the bloodstream helps stabilize blood sugar levels, ensuring that the body has an appropriate energy supply throughout the period of heavy exercise. Now, let's examine the direct and indirect effects of heavy exercise on this process: Direct Effects: - Increase in glucose utilization: During heavy exercise, the body's energy needs increase, leading to the breakdown of glycogen stores and the utilization of glucose by the muscle and other cells. This triggers the subsequent steps in the blood sugar regulation process. - Increased sensitivity to glucagon: Exercise has been shown to increase the sensitivity of the liver to glucagon, thereby enabling it to produce and release glucose more efficiently during periods of high energy demand. Indirect Effects: - Hormonal changes: Heavy exercise can indirectly affect the blood sugar regulation process through its influence on various hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones can stimulate the release of glucagon and the breakdown of glycogen to glucose, further contributing to the maintenance of blood sugar levels. - Improved insulin sensitivity: Regular exercise has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, which means that the body can more efficiently take up glucose into the cells. This can help to maintain stable blood sugar levels during periods of rest and metabolism, lessening the need for glucagon release during exercise. In summary, heavy exercise can directly affect the release of glucagon by increasing the body's energy demands and glucose utilization, while also indirectly influencing glucagon production by affecting other hormonal systems and insulin sensitivity. These direct and indirect impacts of exercise on glucagon help to maintain sufficient blood sugar levels, ensuring a steady supply of energy for the body during periods of high physical activity."},{"instruction":"Student: Test for natural language inference.

Whether Sellers was fired or simply walked off is unclear. Given that he often went absent for days at a time and was involved in conflicts with Welles, either explanation is plausible. Regardless, Sellers was unavailable for the filming of an ending and of linking footage to explain the details, leaving the filmmakers to devise a way to make the existing footage work without him. The framing device of a beginning and ending with David Niven was invented to salvage the footage. Val Guest said that he was given the task of creating a narrative thread which would link all segments of the film. He chose to use the original Bond and Vesper as linking characters to tie the story together. In the originally released versions of the film, a cardboard cutout of Sellers in the background was used for the final scenes. In later versions, this cardboard cutout was replaced by footage of Sellers in highland dress, inserted by \\"trick photography\\". Signs of missing footage from the Sellers segments are evident at various points. Evelyn Tremble is not captured on camera; an outtake of Sellers entering a racing car was substituted. In this outtake, he calls for the car, a la Pink Panther, to chase down Vesper and her kidnappers; the next thing that is shown is Tremble being tortured. Out-takes of Sellers were also used for Tremble's dream sequence (pretending to play the piano on Ursula Andress' torso), in the finale - blowing out the candles whilst in highland dress - and at the end of the film when all the various \\"James Bond doubles\\" are together. In the kidnap sequence, Tremble's death is also very abruptly inserted; it consists of pre-existing footage of Tremble being rescued by Vesper, followed by a later-filmed shot of her abruptly deciding to shoot him, followed by a freeze-frame over some of the previous footage of her surrounded by bodies (noticeably a zoom-in on the previous shot). As well as this, an entire sequence involving Tremble going to the front for the underground James Bond training school (which turns out to be under Harrods, of which the training area was the lowest level) was never shot, thus creating an abrupt cut from Vesper announcing that Tremble will be James Bond to Tremble exiting the lift into the training school. So many sequences from the film were removed, that several well-known actors never appeared in the final cut, including Ian Hendry (as 006, the agent whose body is briefly seen being disposed of by Vesper), Mona Washbourne and Arthur Mullard.

As a child, he moved to Spokane, Washington, where he grew up in a Christian Science family on a farm. His father, Richard Bass, died when he was four years old and his mother subsequently went on to marry a Methodist minister, and the family took the surname Kennedy. Before Kennedy attended Mead High School (which he attended with football player Jason Hanson), he found musical inspiration from Led Zeppelin, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and John Sykes' Blue Murder band. Context: In 1995, Kennedy started teaching guitar in a store called Rock City Music. By August 1996, he became the lead vocalist and lead guitarist of The Mayfield Four, a rock band he formed with his childhood friends Zia Uddin, Marty Meisner, and Craig Johnson (also of Citizen Swing). They signed a contract with Epic Records thanks to a critically acclaimed demo called Thirty Two Point Five Hours that the band recorded in 1996, followed by a live extended play called Motion in 1997. The Mayfield Four's debut album, Fallout, was supported with a fifteen-month tour with bands such as Creed, Big Wreck, and Stabbing Westward. The album was praised by critics, but it failed to chart, and ultimately became the only album by the band to feature rhythm guitarist Craig Johnson, who was fired from the band due to undisclosed reasons. Following the Fallout tour, Kennedy made an appearance in the 2001 drama film Rock Star starring Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston. He said that he got a call from his manager telling him that the filmmakers needed someone who could sing high and that his name was suggested. On the set of the film, he met Wahlberg along with Zakk Wylde and Jason Bonham, who also appeared in the movie alongside several other notable musicians. Kennedy was the only actor in the movie whose actual singing voice was used. In the movie, directly paralleling a scene at the beginning of the film, Kennedy's character (Mike, also known as \\"Thor\\") is noticed by Wahlberg's character, Chris \\"Izzy\\" Cole, the lead singer of Thor's favorite band, Steel Dragon. Izzy pulls Thor onstage and sings the rest of the song with him, eventually telling him to finish the rest of the band's concert. The film was met with mostly mixed reviews, garnering a 52% \\"Rotten\\" score on Rotten Tomatoes. The Mayfield Four's second and final album, Second Skin, was released in June 2001. Kennedy has since said that it is one of the most personal records he has made. The album has been critically acclaimed and Kennedy has commented on how it and Fallout are much more popular now than when they were released. Though popular, The Mayfield Four never garnered enough exposure to break into the mainstream. In 2002, the future of the band began to look unlikely, and Kennedy began recording new music, which he described as \\"Daniel Lanois meets Massive Attack.\\" The band went on hiatus that year, and would ultimately disband. In an interview with Pulse Weekly in 2004, Kennedy said that it was because he was \\"burned out with the whole rock industry at that point.\\" However, three previously unreleased songs appeared on a fan-run Myspace page dedicated to and approved by The Mayfield Four in early 2010, causing rumors of a possible reunion to begin circulating. However, when asked about this during an interview, Kennedy replied that he does not see it happening. Question: did they produce any albums? Answer:","output":"Yes, The Mayfield Four produced two studio albums during their time together as a band. Their debut album, Fallout, was released in 1998. It received critical acclaim but failed to chart, and as mentioned earlier, it was the only album to feature rhythm guitarist Craig Johnson before his departure from the band. The band's second and final album, Second Skin, was released in June 2001. Kennedy considers it one of his most personal records, and though it received critical praise, it did not generate significant commercial success. Despite the lack of mainstream exposure, both albums have continued to gain appreciation and popularity after their release. In addition to the studio albums, The Mayfield Four also produced and released a demo called Thirty Two Point Five Hours in 1996 and a live extended play (EP) called Motion in 1997. Although the band went on hiatus and eventually disbanded in 2002, their music remains influential and appreciated by fans."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

In English-language sources it is usually referred to as the Imperial German Air Service, although that is not a literal translation of either name. German naval aviators serving with the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" remained an integral part of the Imperial German Navy \\"(Kaiserliche Marine)\\". Both military branches, the army and navy, operated conventional aircraft, observation balloons and Zeppelins. - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force. - A flying ace or fighter ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down several enemy aircraft during aerial combat. The actual number of aerial victories required to officially qualify as an \\"ace\\" has varied, but is usually considered to be five or more. The few aces among combat aviators have historically accounted for the majority of air-to-air victories in military history. - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted. - The Messerschmitt Bf 109, was a German World War II fighter aircraft that was the backbone of the Luftwaffe's fighter force. The Bf 109 first saw operational service during the Spanish Civil War (1939) and was still in service at the dawn of the jet age at the end of World War II (1945). It was one of the most advanced fighters of the era, including such features as all-metal monocoque construction, a closed canopy, and retractable landing gear. It was powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine. From the end of 1941, the Bf 109 was steadily being supplemented by the superior Focke-Wulf Fw 190. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - Squadron leader (Sqn Ldr in the RAF and PAF; SQNLDR in the RAAF and RNZAF; formerly sometimes S/L in all services) is a commissioned rank in the Royal Air Force and the air forces of many countries which have historical British influence. It is also sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure. - The Desert Air Force (DAF), also known chronologically as Air Headquarters Western Desert, Air Headquarters Libya, the Western Desert Air Force, and the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF), was an Allied tactical air force created from No. 204 Group under RAF Middle East Command in North Africa in 1941 to provide close air support to the British Eighth Army. Throughout World War II, the DAF was made up of squadrons from the Royal Air Force (RAF), the South African Air Force (SAAF), the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and other Allied air forces. - Hans-Joachim Marseille (13 December 1919 30 September 1942) was a \\"Luftwaffe\\" fighter pilot and flying ace during World War II. He is noted for his aerial battles during the North African Campaign and his Bohemian lifestyle. One of the most successful fighter pilots, he was nicknamed the \\"Star of Africa\\". Marseille claimed all but seven of his \\"official\\" 158 victories against the British Commonwealth's Desert Air Force over North Africa, flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter for his entire combat career. No other pilot claimed as many Western Allied aircraft as Marseille. - Squadron Leader Derek Harland Ward , DFC & Bar , was a New Zealand flying ace during the Second World War . He was credited with six kills , one shared destroyed , one probable and four damaged against the Luftwaffe . Ward was shot down and killed by the German ace Hans - Joachim Marseille on 17 June 1942 .

Available choices: * negative * positive","output":"The sentiment of the given tweet is *positive*. Let's analyze the components of the tweet to justify this classification. 1. The tweet starts with the username (@tampawinewoman) to direct the message to a specific user. Addressing a fellow Twitter user directly is a common practice and does not indicate a specific sentiment on its own. 2. The phrase \\"Thanks so much\\" immediately sets a positive tone for the message. The user is expressing gratitude and thanking the person they are tweeting to, which is a clear indication of positivity. 3. The next portion of the tweet \\"Oh, it's just a store label Malbec - but pretty good I have to say…\\" can be broken down further: a. \\"Oh, it's just a store label Malbec\\" provides context for the conversation. The user is talking about a specific type of wine (Malbec), and noting that it's a store label (likely meaning it is a more affordable alternative to higher-end wines). Referring to it as \\"just a store label\\" might carry a slight neutral or even mildly negative tone, as it downplays the wine's quality or value. However, this should not distract from the overall positive sentiment of the tweet. b. The key phrase that emphasizes the positive sentiment is \\"but pretty good, I have to say.\\" The user specifically mentions that they think the wine is \\"pretty good,\\" which is a clear endorsement of their positive experience with it. The use of \\"I have to say\\" also solidifies the user's confidence in their opinion and assertion that the wine is, in fact, good. Based on the analysis of the tweet components, it is clear that the sentiment is predominantly positive. The user thanks a fellow Twitter user, discusses a specific wine, and expresses a positive opinion about its quality.

The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

It is situated in the Vjosë (or Aoos) river valley and has a rich history. However, if you are referring to the language spoken in Delvinë, it is primarily Albanian. The Albanian language, or Shqip as called by its speakers, belongs to the Indo-European language family. It forms a unique branch, having no close relatives within the family. Albanian is mainly spoken in Albania and Kosovo, as well as some regions in Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. Additionally, Albanian-speaking communities exist in Greece, Italy, and among the diaspora across various countries. Albanian has two main dialects: Gheg (or Geg) and Tosk. Gheg is spoken in the north of Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia, while Tosk is spoken in the south, mainly in Albania and parts of Greece and Italy. The standard Albanian language is based on the Tosk dialect, as established in the 20th century. The Albanian language features a Latin alphabet comprising 36 letters, which was introduced in 1908 by the Congress of Manastir. The residents of Delvinë predominantly speak the Albanian language because it is geographically located in an area where the Tosk dialect is commonly spoken."},{"instruction":"How is \\"EU intervention should contribute to improving basic education systems, vocational training and higher education.\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the given statement \\"EU intervention should contribute to improving basic education systems, vocational training, and higher education.\\" can be translated as: \\"Zásahy EU by měly přispívat ke zlepšování základních vzdělávacích systémů, odborného vzdělávání a vysokoškolského vzdělávání.\\" This translation is a clear and proper representation of the original English phrase.

Here are possible answers to this question: - department store - desktop - school - space shuttle - library I believe the correct choice is \\"library\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"library,\\" and here's why: 1. Department store: While a department store might sell computers and computer accessories, it is not typically a place where someone can use a computer to search for a job. Although some larger department stores may have computer stations for browsing their inventory, these devices generally have limited and specific functions, and are not intended for job searches. 2. Desktop: A desktop refers to a type of personal computer, and although it might be used to search for a job, the term itself does not indicate a specific location where someone can access a computer for this purpose. 3. School: A school may have computers available for students to use, but this access could be restricted to students and staff members for school-related purposes. Additionally, the availability of computers for non-school purposes, such as job searching, might be limited. 4. Space shuttle: A space shuttle would certainly have computers onboard; however, these computers are used for the specific purposes of space travel and research, and are not accessible or intended for public use, especially for job searching. 5. Library: A library provides public access to computers and internet connection, making it an ideal place for someone to search for a job. Most libraries offer free access to their computer systems, which typically include popular job search websites and resources. Additionally, libraries often provide assistance with creating resumes, preparing for interviews, and locating other job search resources, making them an excellent choice for job seekers in need of computer access. In conclusion, a library is the most suitable option for someone looking for a job to find a computer, as it provides free public access to computers, an internet connection, and various job search resources."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

If the sum of their ages is 34, how old is Rachel? Let's be accurate as possible.","output":"Let's solve this problem step by step. 1. Let Rachel's age be R and Leah's age be L. 2. We know that Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, which can be represented as R = L + 4. 3. We also know that the sum of their ages is 34, which can be represented as R + L = 34. Now we have two equations: R = L + 4 R + L = 34 We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of R and L. 4. Replace R from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 4) + L = 34. 5. Simplify the equation: 2L + 4 = 34. 6. Subtract 4 from both sides: 2L = 30. 7. Divide both sides by 2: L = 15. Now we know that Leah's age is 15. We can use this to find Rachel's age. 8. Use the first equation: R = L + 4, and substitute the value of L: R = 15 + 4. 9. Calculate Rachel's age: R = 19.

Kenneth's approach to sharing news about his new car was rooted in his outgoing personality and the desire to share his joy and excitement with others. He often engaged in lively conversations with friends, family, and colleagues, proudly discussing the sleek design, powerful engine, and cutting-edge technology of his new car. People around him reacted differently to this news – some shared in his enthusiasm, congratulating him on this latest acquisition, while others exhibited signs of envy, wishing they could afford a similar luxury themselves. Randy, however, approached the situation in an entirely different manner. As an introverted and private individual, he tended to avoid the limelight and preferred to relish the satisfaction of purchasing his new car silently and without fanfare. He knew that by keeping his new car a secret, he could prevent potential feelings of envy and comparison from those around him. Instead of revealing his acquisition, Randy spent time familiarizing himself with every aspect of his new vehicle, reading the manual, and understanding its various features in great detail. He focused on honing his driving skills and ensuring the safety of not only himself but also his passengers and others on the road. Despite their differing approaches, both Kenneth and Randy experienced a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from their respective new car purchases. Kenneth's pride in sharing his excitement allowed him to feel validated and connected to his social circle, while Randy's secretive approach demonstrated his mindfulness of others' feelings and his dedication to the prudent enjoyment of his hard-earned reward. In the end, the different ways Kenneth and Randy chose to handle the news of their new cars reflected their individual personalities and values. Whether one feels it necessary to openly share about their accomplishments or keep them hidden from the public eye, the most important part ultimately lies in the fulfillment and joy that each person derives from their achievement."},{"instruction":"Sentence: name = Cotto, food = Chinese, near = Café Rouge Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","output":"Sure, to represent the content of the sentence in data form, I'll follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the key-value pairs in the sentence In the given sentence, we have three key-value pairs: - name: Cotto - food: Chinese - near: Café Rouge Step 2: Choose the appropriate data structure To store key-value pairs, the most suitable data structure is a dictionary (or a hash map, depending on the programming language).

The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, are among the most neurologically advanced of all invertebratesand either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total. The scientific study of molluscs is called malacology. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Malacology is the branch of invertebrate zoology that deals with the study of the Mollusca (mollusks or molluscs), the second-largest phylum of animals in terms of described species after the arthropods. Mollusks include snails and slugs, clams, octopus and squid, and numerous other kinds, many (but by no means all) of which have shells. One division of malacology, conchology, is devoted to the study of mollusk shells. Malacology derives from Greek , \\"malakos\\", \\"soft\\"; and , \\"-logia\\". - Cuttlefish are marine animals of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone. Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but molluscs. - The octopus (or ; plural: octopuses, octopodes or octopi; see below) is a cephalopod mollusc of the order Octopoda. It has two eyes and four pairs of arms and, like other cephalopods, it is bilaterally symmetric. It has a beak, with its mouth at the center point of the arms. It has no internal or external skeleton (although some species have a vestigial remnant of a shell inside their mantles), allowing it to squeeze through tight places. Octopuses are among the most intelligent and behaviorally diverse of all invertebrates. - The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name \\"Carboniferous\\" means \\"coal-bearing\\" and derives from the Latin words \\"carb\\" (\\"coal\\") and \\"fer\\" (\\"I bear, I carry\\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian. - The giant squid (genus Architeuthis) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size due to deep-sea gigantism: recent estimates put the maximum size at for females and for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated , one of the largest living organisms). The mantle is about long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles (but including head and arms) rarely exceeds . Claims of specimens measuring or more have not been scientifically documented. - Snail is a common name that is applied most often to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. However, the common name \\"snail\\" is also applied to most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into. When the word \\"snail\\" is used in this most general sense, it includes not just land snails but also thousands of species of sea snails and freshwater snails. Occasionally a few other molluscs that are not actually gastropods, such as the Monoplacophora, which superficially resemble small limpets, may also informally be referred to as \\"snails\\". - The colossal squid (\\"Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni\\", from Greek \\"mesos\\" (middle), \\"onycho\\" (claw, nail), and \\"teuthis\\" (squid)), sometimes called the Antarctic or giant cranch squid, is believed to be the largest squid species in terms of mass. It is the only known member of the genus \\"Mesonychoteuthis\\". It is known from only a few specimens, and current estimates put its maximum size at long and weighing possibly up to 750 kg (1,650 lb), based on analysis of smaller and immature specimens, making it the largest known invertebrate. - Nautiloids are a large and diverse group of marine cephalopods ( Mollusca ) belonging to the subclass Nautiloidea that began in the Late Cambrian and are represented today by the living Nautilus and Allonautilus . Nautiloids flourished during the early Paleozoic era , where they constituted the main predatory animals , and developed an extraordinary diversity of shell shapes and forms . Some 2,500 species of fossil nautiloids are known , but only a handful of species survive to the present day . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The Phanerozoic Eon (British English Phanærozoic) is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed. It covers million years to the present, and began with the Cambrian Period when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared. Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words (phanerós) and (z), meaning \\"visible life\\", since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon. The time before the Phanerozoic, called the \\"Precambrian\\" supereon, is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons. - The Ordovician is a geologic period and system, the second of six periods of the Paleozoic Era. The Ordovician spans 41.2 million years from the end of the Cambrian Period million years ago (Mya) to the start of the Silurian Period Mya. The Ordovician, named after the Celtic tribe of the Ordovices, was defined by Charles Lapworth in 1879 to resolve a dispute between followers of Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison, who were placing the same rock beds in northern Wales into the Cambrian and Silurian periods, respectively. Lapworth, recognized that the fossil fauna in the disputed strata were different from those of either the Cambrian or the Silurian periods, and placed them in a period of their own. It received international sanction in 1960, when it was adopted as an official period of the Paleozoic Era by the International Geological Congress. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms. - The Paleozoic (or Palaeozoic) Era (from the Greek \\"palaios\\" (), \\"old\\" and \\"zoe\\" (), \\"life\\", meaning \\"ancient life\\") is the earliest of three geologic eras of the Phanerozoic, from . It is the longest of the Phanerozoic eras, and is subdivided into six geologic periods (from oldest to youngest): the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian. The Paleozoic comes after the Neoproterozoic era of the Proterozoic and is followed by the Mesozoic. - The Nautilina is the last suborder of the Nautilida and the only nautiloids living since the end of the Triassic. The Nautilina, proposed by Shimanskiy, is basically the Nautilaceae of Kummel, 1964, defined by Furnish and Glenister, but differs in omitting two families, the Paracenoceratidae and Pseudonautilidae which instead are placed in the Liroceratina. - The Permian is a geologic period and system which spans 46.7 million years from the end of the Carboniferous Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Triassic Period 252.2 Mya. It is the last period of the Paleozoic Era; the following Triassic Period belongs to the Mesozoic Era. The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, who named it after the city of Perm. - The Proterozoic is a geological eon representing the time just before the proliferation of complex life on Earth. The name Proterozoic comes from Greek and means \\"earlier life\\", the Greek root protero-,means \\"former, earlier\\" and zoic-, means \\"animal, living being\\". The Proterozoic Eon extended from to (million years ago), and is the most recent part of the Precambrian Supereon. It is subdivided into three geologic eras (from oldest to youngest): the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic. The well-identified events of this eon were the transition to an oxygenated atmosphere during the Paleoproterozoic; several glaciations, which produced the hypothesized Snowball Earth during the Cryogenian Period in the late Neoproterozoic Era; and the Ediacaran Period (635 to 541 Ma) which is characterized by the evolution of abundant soft-bodied multicellular organisms and provides us with the first obvious fossil evidence of life on earth. - The nautilus (from the Latin form of the original Ancient Greek \\"\\", 'sailor') is a pelagic marine mollusc of the cephalopod family Nautilidae, the sole extant family of the superfamily Nautilaceae and of its smaller but near equal suborder, Nautilina. - The Cambrian Period (or ) was the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era, of the Phanerozoic Eon. The Cambrian lasted 55.6 million years from the end of the preceding Ediacaran Period 541 million years ago (mya) to the beginning of the Ordovician Period mya. Its subdivisions, and its base, are somewhat in flux. The period was established (as Cambrian series) by Adam Sedgwick, who named it after Cambria, the Latinised form of \\"Cymru\\", the Welsh name for Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed. The Cambrian is unique in its unusually high proportion of lagerstätte sedimentary deposits, sites of exceptional preservation where \\"soft\\" parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells. As a result, our understanding of the Cambrian biology surpasses that of some later periods. - The Devonian is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic, spanning 60 million years from the end of the Silurian, million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Carboniferous, Mya. It is named after Devon, England, where rocks from this period were first studied. The first significant adaptive radiation of life on dry land occurred during the Devonian. Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land, forming extensive forests which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the first seed-bearing plants appeared. Various terrestrial arthropods also became well-established. Fish reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to often be dubbed the \\"Age of Fish\\". The first ray-finned and lobe-finned bony fish appeared, while the placodermi began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population. - A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology. - The Nautilaceae form one of five superfamilies that make up the Nautilida according to Bernard Kummel (1964), and the only one that survived past the Triassic. The Nautilaceae comprise six families: Nautilidae, Paracenoceratidae, Pseudonautilidae, Cymatoceratidae, Hercoglossidae, and Aturiidae. Shimanskiy (1957) separated the Paracenoceratidae and Pseudonautilidae from his near equivalent Nautilina and added them to the Lyroceratina, expanding the equivalent Clydonautilaceae and bringing it into the Jurassic. The Nautilaceae are represented by \\"Nautilus\\" and \\"Allonautilus\\", genera included in the Nautilidae. - Slug, or land slug, is a common name for any apparently shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusc. The word \\"slug\\" is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, a very reduced shell, or only a small internal shell, particularly sea slugs and semislugs (this is in contrast to the common name \\"snail\\", which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can fully retract its soft parts into the shell).

Translate this to English?","output":"I believe that Russia should be supported by the European Union in its efforts to join the World Trade Organization, and this will improve trade and economic relations between the two partners and stimulate investments. In more detail, the premise argues that the European Union should actively support Russia in its efforts to become a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is an international organization that sets the rules for global trade and commerce and works towards improving trade relations among member states to ensure that trade is done in a fair, efficient, and predictable manner. By supporting Russia in its endeavor to join the WTO, the European Union would be actively promoting an environment in which trade and economic relations between the two entities are strengthened. As both the EU and Russia are significant players in the global economy, their cooperation in the sphere of trade would be mutually beneficial, fostering increased investment and economic growth on both sides. In the context of a globalized and interconnected world, further integration of Russia into international economic structures can have positive implications for not only the European Union and Russia but also for other countries and regions through onward trade linkages. In summary, promoting Russia's inclusion into the WTO will not only improve trade and economic relations between Russia and the European Union, but will potentially bring about a host of positive consequences such as increased investments, stronger ties among trading partners, and overall economic prosperity."},{"instruction":"Bundan kısa süre sonra da İsrail, Türkiye'yi devlet televizyonunda yayınlanan ve İsrailli askerleri gaddar çocuk katilleri olarak gösteren bir diziyle ilgili olarak eleştirdi.

Academy Award-winning star Margaret \\"Maggie\\" Elliot is a bankrupt actress of a certain age struggling to accept her new non-wealthy reality. She is in denial, and confident she can somehow build herself up again and re-launch her career to its earlier brilliance. After suffering another big disappointment while vainly striving to get that last one good role, she gets drunk, is arrested for DUI, and spends a night in jail. She is bailed out by Jim Johannsen, a younger former actor whom she had helped in the past. Jim, now comfortably settled as the owner of a boatyard, admits that he has loved her ever since those days and, helped by Margaret's daughter Gretchen, tries to help Margaret see that her big screen days as a famous actress are already over. She reluctantly tries to work as a saleswoman in an upscale department store, but overhearing some unkind gossip from two customers wounds her pride and she runs out. Her old agent manages to get her a screen test for a role in a film she'd always wanted to play. She is offered and takes a screen test for a supporting role, believing that if she plays that character as a sexy younger woman -- rather than the middle-aged frump she is seen as by the studio -- she might be able to win the more coveted lead role.

Naturally this could only be where the water was fairly shallow. The people would like to live in flats in the fifty-metre high outer wall. The flats would be all face inwards, and would be made of concrete and glass. The glass would be specially made and colored to control the heat and strong light from the sun. The planners called this man-made harbor would be calm. On it would be floating islands carrying more building: a hospital, two theaters, museum, an art exhibition hall and a church. On one of the islands would be a special factory to take the salt out of sea water and turn it into fresh water. People living in the city could move around on small boats driven by electricity, so there would be no air pollution from the burning of gas. There would be platforms outside the man wall for ships bringing supplies. People could also travel to the mainland by motorboat or water plane.

After sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the air, they rise into the high atmosphere and react with water and oxygen to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), respectively. These acids mix with rainwater, forming acid rain.

(WDRB) – The former assistant police chief of Prospect told a Louisville Metro Police recruit that, if he catches juveniles smoking marijuana, he should \\"shoot them” if they are black, according to documents released Friday. Todd Shaw, who resigned from the suburban Louisville department late last year, sent several “highly disturbing racist and threatening Facebook messages” to the recruit, Jefferson County Attorney Mike O’Connell wrote in a letter to Prospect Mayor John Evans on Aug. 31. Shaw had fought to keep the messages private after media outlets requested them under Kentucky’s open records law. Jefferson Circuit Court Judge Judith McDonald-Burkman ruled this week that the records must be released. Shaw was initially suspended with pay on Sept. 1. Prospect Police Chief Jeff Sherrard was not in the office Friday and could not be reached for comment. In an interview, Evans said that after receiving O'Connell's letter, \\"the human reaction would be to fire\\" Shaw, but the department needed to conduct its own investigation. After Sherrard \\"began his examination of the messages ... it soon became apparent to him\\" that Shaw had violated police standards, according to a press release sent out by Evans Friday afternoon. Shaw was suspended giving the department \\"additional time to review the matter.\\" The city said it followed the disciplinary protocol established by the city's \\"Police Officer Bill of Rights.\\" When Sherrard later presented the findings to Shaw on Nov. 20, Shaw resigned, Evans said. Evans said the messages were not sent on city computers or telephones and they find them \\"abhorrent, disgusting, and, reprehensible,\\" according to the press release. \\"The City of Prospect has zero tolerance for the type of content sent by Shaw,\\" Evans wrote. \\"... I want to make it crystal clear: neither the City of Prospect, not its citizens, condone, support or endorses the views expressed by Shaw in these postings/messages.\\" Shaw served with LMPD for more than 20 years before joining the Prospect department in 2012. In one of the Facebook messages, the LMPD recruit asked Shaw what to do in a scenario in which he catches three juveniles smoking marijuana. The question was part of a paper the recruit was writing about “the right thing to do,” according to O’Connell’s letter. “F--- the right thing,” Shaw allegedly responded. “If black shoot them.” And as for what to tell the parents of the juveniles, Shaw said: “… call their (pa)rents … if mom is hot then f--- her … if dad is hot then handcuff him and make him suck my d---,” according to O’Connell’s letter. Shaw continued, “Unless daddy is black. … Then shoot him.” Shaw declined to comment on Friday when reached through Facebook. His attorney, Mike Burns, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. O’Connell told Evans that prosecutors found the Facebook messages while screening a case for possible criminal prosecution against Shaw. Shaw was under investigation for allegedly interfering in the sexual abuse probe of the Louisville Metro Police’s Explorer program, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the case. “There is no place in police departments for men or women who hold such strongly held prejudices, including recommending shooting people simply because of their race,” O’Connell wrote. The LMPD recruit was not named. The recruit sent racist responses to Shaw as well, according to O'Connell's letter. LMPD Chief Conrad said the recruit was employed by the department from Oct. 17, 2016 until he resigned on Feb. 27, 2017. “I am disgusted by the shocking and appalling statements released today – between the former Prospect Assistant Chief of Police Todd Shaw, and a former LMPD recruit,\\" Conrad said in a statement. Had the department known about the messages, \\"he would never have been considered for employment. These atrocious, racist attitudes have no place in society – anywhere,\\" Conrad wrote. \\"Any person, who holds these thoughts, has no business ever donning a uniform and representing those who have sworn to serve every member of every community. These actions spit in the face of the determined effort hundreds of thousands of law enforcement officers put forth to build trust and legitimacy in the communities they serve.” In the August letter, O’Connell told Evans his office would not move forward with any prosecutions in which Shaw might be called to testify, and would notify defense attorneys about the Facebook messages. Prosecutors are in the process of dismissing about two dozen cases because of Shaw's credibility problems. Shaw, who retired from LMPD as a sergeant in 2009, was investigated for providing illegal assistance to Kenneth Betts, one of two officers charged with committing sexual abuse of teens while with the Louisville department’s Explorer mentoring program. Shaw's attorney argued in court documents that his client's Facebook messages are \\"unrelated and not relevant\\" to LMPD's investigation of the Explorer program. But Judge McDonald-Burkman ruled Thursday that Shaw was assistant chief -- and for awhile interim chief when Sherrard was on leave -- and \\"that level of responsibility lends itself to a higher level of public scrutiny.\\" The judge noted the messages were \\"embarrassing\\" for Shaw, but \\"they are not of the private nature intended to be shielded from public disclosure.\\" She said the messages call Shaw's integrity as a police officer into question. In another Facebook message, Shaw told the recruit housing projects needed to be leveled. \\"For years I have seen the blacks live off uss (sic) and putting them in one big housing area breeds HUGE peoblems (sic)\\" Shaw wrote. \\"We don't see a Muslim problem around here we just see lazy ass people that don't want to work and that entices more Mexicans to cross the border and take the American jobs ... .\\" And in a message about Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Shaw said King was \\"nothing but a raciast (sic) womanizer ... but because someone shot him, I get a day off with pay each year so I will take it.\\" Last October, as LMPD undercover officers were preparing to serve a search warrant for computers at Betts’ business, Betts allegedly asked Shaw to access the National Crime Information Center database, or NCIC, to run the license plates of the officers to determine their identities, the sources said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the investigation. Shaw was accused of ordering a Prospect officer to run the plates for Betts, who was no longer a police officer when he made the request. Betts resigned from LMPD in 2014. Improperly accessing the NCIC database is a criminal offense. Shaw is under investigation for misdemeanor official misconduct, the sources told WDRB News. Josh Abner, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Attorney’s office, declined to say if that investigation is ongoing. Nick Mudd, who represents Shaw in the criminal investigation, said Shaw was cleared of criminal wrongdoing. Below is the full letter from O'Connell.

A former assistant Prospect police chief sent numerous racist messages to a Louisville Metro Police recruit, including one that said if he caught black juveniles smoking marijuana, he should shoot them. Todd Shaw sent the “highly disturbing racist and threatening Facebook messages” to the recruit, according to a letter Jefferson County Attorney Mike O’Connell sent to Prospect Mayor John Evans. Shaw, who had previously worked 20 years as a Louisville officer, was suspended, then fired, last year from the Prospect force. O’Connell told Evans that while Shaw and the recruit were discussing a training scenario in which the recruit was to write a paper on \\"the right thing to do\\" if he caught three juveniles smoking marijuana, Shaw stated: \\"Fuck the right thing. If black shoot them.” Shaw, instructing the recruit how to handle parents of a juvenile caught smoking pot, wrote: “If mom is hot then fuck her. If dad is hot then handcuff him and make him suck my dick. Unless daddy is black.

O’Connell said Shaw sent the private Facebook messages in September and October 2016. “As Jefferson County Attorney, I feel compelled to notify and warn you of Shaw’s deeply offensive and racist statements,” O’Connell told the mayor. “There is no place in police departments for men or women who hold such strongly held prejudices, including recommending shooting people simply because of their race.” O’Connell also said it was “quite disturbing that Shaw, a senior law enforcement officer with more than 20 years’ experience, was expressing his offensive racist views with a young recruit training to be a Louisville Metro Police officer.” The county attorney's office said it would move to dismiss two dozen District Court cases in which Shaw was the sole witness, regardless of whether the defendants were black. O'Connell told reporters Friday that Shaw was terminated and that the recruit — who was not identified — wasn't hired by Louisville Metro. Rejecting Shaw's bid to keep the messages private, Jefferson Circuit Judge Judith McDonald Burkman ruled Thursday that they revealed \\"prejudices that bring into question Shaw's integrity as a law enforcement officer\\" and that public concern was \\"magnified by his rank.'' O'Connell told reporters that his office supports police officers \\"but this kind of person walking the streets of this community with a gun or badge should never be tolerated.

I find that the key to a successful conversation in any language is to speak to people not only in their spoken language but also with the body language they know best. Britain, along with much of Northern Europe, has a non-touch culture, so personal space is very important. In a formal situation, we would usually greet each other with a handshake. Informally, but not so often, my British friends and I would greet with a hug. Hardly ever would we greet with a kiss on the cheek, let alone a hug and two kisses on the cheek![:||] Here in the south of Italy, and in many different parts of the world, both men and women greet with two kisses on the cheek, use a lot of hand signs and often touch each other. In other words, little personal space is left between people when communicating. At university, I have learnt to successfully communicate in spoken Italian. And since I moved to live with the local people, I have also started to pick up their body language. Sometimes, I find myself not knowing what hand signs to use when expressing myself. However, what I know for sure is that I would miss the opportunity to fully put myself in the Italian culture if I keep my personal space unbroken. Here are 5 body language tips in Italy; * Use different signs; head, arms and hands. * Use facial expressions. Always smile at people! It is said that smiling is the most powerful unspoken way to communicate friendliness. * Use eye contact , because \\"the eyes are the window to the soul.\\" * Don't worry about personal space.

The film stars Billy Crystal as Harry Burns and Meg Ryan as Sally Albright, who share a love-hate relationship over the years and explore the question of whether men and women can ever just be friends. This line occurs during one of the movie's most memorable scenes, which takes place in Katz's Delicatessen in Manhattan, New York. The scene features Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) demonstrating the idea of faking an orgasm to Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) as a way to prove women's ability to convincingly simulate sexual pleasure. Sally's noisy and enthusiastic performance attracts the attention of everyone in the restaurant, and all activity comes to a halt as other patrons and employees watch her with a mix of shock and curiosity. The line \\"I'll have what she's having\\" is delivered by an older woman sitting nearby, who witnesses Sally's act and makes the witty remark after Sally finishes her demonstration. This character, named \\"Older Woman Customer\\" in the film's credits, is played by Estelle Reiner – the director Rob Reiner's mother.

Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group...

In Mollie's opinion it is necessary to make full use of language and she enjoys telling a story,which is what every writer should be doing. \\"If you aren't telling a story, you're a very dead writer indeed.\\" She says. With the chief function of a writer being to entertain,Mollie is indeed an entertainer. \\"I have this great love of not only the meaning of language but of the music of language,\\" she says. \\"This love goes back to early childhood.

So finally I thought that this woman must have something,since she was a good teacher and I decided when I was nine that I would be a writer.\\" This childhood intention is described in her novel,A Sound of Chariots,which although written in the third person is clearly autobiographical and gives a picture both of Mollie's ambition and her struggle towards its achievement.

PUBLISHED:. 05:18 EST, 7 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 11:01 EST, 7 February 2013. A south African man has become the first person in the world to be convicted of killing a great white shark after he hooked one while fishing from the shore. Leon Bekker, of George, Western Cape,. pleaded guilty to contravention of the Marine Living Resources Act which. includes attempting to kill, disturb or be in possession of a white. shark without a permit. Bekker pointed out that he had no. idea at first that he'd hooked a great white shark but he pleaded guilty so. as not to waste the court's time. Catch: Fisherman Leon Bekker poses with the great white shark he caught off the South African coast. But in a landmark decision Mossel Bay Magistrate's Court handed him a fine of R120,000 (£8,550) or a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for five years. The unprecedented case is the only great white shark conviction in a South African court to date - the first country to impose legislation in protecting great white sharks. Great white sharks have been protected. in South African waters since 1991 and no person is permitted to catch. them, or even to attempt to catch them. Penalty: In a landmark ruling, Bekker was fined £8,500 under the Marine Living Resources Act. But for years anglers who landed the sharks were able to successfully argue that they had not been targeting great whites. Environmentalists believe the ruling. sets a new precedent in that anyone using heavy-duty fishing tackle in. an area where white sharks are known to inhabit is effectively. breaking the law. Shark scientist Ryan Johnson, who appeared as an expert witness in the case, welcomed the verdict. He told the Cape Times: 'A lot of law. enforcement officers were reluctant to prosecute because they knew it. was difficult to prove the anglers had targeted white sharks. 'This prosecutor analysed the law and. said as anglers fishing with heavy equipment in an area known for white. sharks, they would have a reasonable expectation of catching great. white sharks, and so just by fishing with that equipment in that area. they are in effect breaking the law.' Photographs of Bekker giving a. thumbs-up sign after hauling the shark onto the rocks, sparked an angry. outcry after they were published in the paper two years ago. However photographs of anglers posing with dead great whites are not uncommon and there is an on-going illegal trade in great white shark body parts such as jaws, which fetch a very high price. Department of Agriculture, Forestry. and Fisheries spokesman Lionel Adendorf said: 'This is the first great. white shark case and conviction in any South African court. We are. certain that the sentence will serve as a deterrent.' Bekker pleaded guilty saying he did not want to waste the court's time but pointed out he had no idea he'd hooked a great white shark at the time. Although great white sharks have been protected in South Africa since 1991, there is evidence to suggest that they continue to be targeted by recreational fisherman as a trophy species. The World Wildlife Fund welcomed the. ruling. Spokesman Dr Eleanor Yeld Hutchings said: 'This is the first. legal case, and conviction, around the catching of a white shark in. South Africa. 'For. authorities to take such clear action is an excellent indication of. their commitment to upholding protected species status.' The not inconsiderable sentencing of Leon Bekker will hopefully be a deterrent to these practices in South Africa. As far as I am aware, this is also a world first in terms of prosecution for harming a white shark.' The great white was caught on the shore near the city of Geroge on South Africa's Cape. Anger: Photographs of Bekker hauling the shark onto the rocks, sparked an outcry in South Africa after they were published two years ago. No person is allowed to trade in, or have possession of any parts of a white shark, even their teeth, without a permit. In Australia, while Great White. Sharks are also protected species in Australian waters, legislators have. recently approved a plan to kill sharks that venture too close to. people in the water. There. were five fatal shark attacks in Western Australia in the past year,. with many residents calling for a more aggressive shark management. plan. South Africa sees it's fair share of great white attacks. one particular hotspot is Capetown's Fish Hoek beach which has seen three attacks in the last eight years. Hot spot: Capetown's Fish Hoek beach has seen three attacks in the last eight years. In September last year, British tourist Michael Cohen was attacked with a. shark biting off his right leg above the knee and part of his left leg. That followed two fatal attacks including that of Zimbabwean tourist Lloyd Skinner who was pulled undewater and dragged out to sea in 2010. Only his diving goggles were found. And in November 2004, a 77-year-old Tyna Webb, was attacked and killed by a shark while doing the backstroke. City officials are now considering installing a 355-metre long net across a stretch of the beach to create a safe swimming area. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Nearly all boats were made out of wood until the late 19th century, and wood remains in common use today in boat construction. Elm in particular was used for this purpose as it resisted decay as long as it was kept wet (it also served for water pipe before the advent of more modern plumbing).\\" Answer: A:","output":"Wood is a versatile and abundant material that has played a crucial role in various aspects of human life since antiquity. Apart from being used for building houses and boats, wood has found applications in numerous other areas as well. Some of these are: 1. Furniture: One of the most common uses of wood is in the production of furniture. Chairs, tables, cabinets, beds, and other household items are fashioned from different types of wood, each with its unique characteristics like strength, durability, and aesthetic appeal. 2. Flooring: Wooden flooring has remained popular due to its durability, warmth, and visual appeal. Hardwoods like oak, maple, and walnut are often used for this purpose, while engineered wood and laminate options provide budget-friendly alternatives. 3. Instruments: Wood is a key component in the construction of various musical instruments. The unique resonance and warmth provided by wood make it ideal for the construction of string instruments like guitars, violins and cellos as well as percussion instruments like drums and marimbas. 4. Tools and Equipment: Historically, wood has been used to create tools and equipment for a wide range of purposes. From simple hand tools like hammers and axes to more complex devices like looms, wheelbarrows and machinery components, wood's strength and workability make it an excellent choice. 5. Art and Sculpture: Wood has been a popular medium for artists and craftsmen for centuries. Intricate carvings, statues, and other decorative items are often made from woods like mahogany, cedar, and teak, showcasing the material's natural beauty. 6. Sports equipment: Many sports rely on wooden equipment, including baseball bats, cricket bats, and hockey sticks. Wood provides the necessary strength, flexibility, and durability needed for these high-impact activities. 7. Transportation: Apart from boats, wood has also been utilized in the construction of other modes of transportation, such as horse-drawn carriages, wagons, and early automobiles. While the advent of modern materials like steel and aluminum has largely replaced wood in these applications, wood continues to be used in the restoration of historic vehicles and carriages. 8. Bridges and Infrastructure: Wood has been employed in the construction of bridges and other essential infrastructure, especially in areas with abundant timber resources. While modern bridges are typically built using materials like steel and concrete, wooden bridges still exist in some locations, serving as both functional infrastructure and historical landmarks. 9. Fuel and Charcoal: Wood has long been used as a fuel source for cooking, heating, and industrial processes. Additionally, wood can be converted into charcoal, which is widely used for barbecuing and as a key ingredient in the production of steel and various chemicals. 10. Paper and Pulp: Wood is the primary raw material for creating paper, cardboard, and related products. The pulp and paper industry relies on vast quantities of wood from sustainably managed forests to produce goods vital to education, communication, and packaging. In summary, wood's versatility, availability, and unique characteristics have made it an essential material in a wide range of applications, extending far beyond its role in building houses and boats. Humans have capitalized on these qualities to create items of practical use, artistic expression, and technological advancement that continue to shape our lives today."},{"instruction":"Question: When did Ferdinand II die?

We have the equation, -3983 = 400 * m + 2017. Now imagine you have -3983 candies on one side and 400 bags of m candies plus 2017 candies on the other side. We want to find out how many candies are in each bag (that's m!). First, let's move the 2017 candies from the right side to the left side by taking away 2017 candies from both sides. This will make it easier for us to find out what m is. So, -3983 - 2017 = 400 * m. Now let's see how many candies we have on the left side: -3983 - 2017 = -6000 candies. Now we have -6000 = 400 * m. Now, we want to know how many candies are in each bag (m). To do this, we'll divide the number of candies we have on the left side (-6000) by the number of bags (400). So, m = -6000 / 400 Now let's divide: m = -15 So, there are -15 candies in each bag (m). Since we can't really have negative candies, this is just a fun way of saying m = -15 in our equation. Great job solving it!"},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Mary Youngblood plays a type of flute that is held in front of the player, and has what type of finger holes?

Get a couple scrabble tiles and drill a hole in the top. Add a wire and bend into a circle. Add to ear wires. Explanation: In terms of naive physics reasoning, option (A) is more sound because it involves creating a hole in the scrabble tiles, adding a wire through the hole, and bending it into a circle. This process ensures that the tiles are securely attached to the ear wires by means of the wire loop. Option (B) is less sound because, in addition to the aforementioned steps, it involves gluing the tiles together. This extra step is unnecessary and could potentially make the earrings more prone to breakage, as the glue may not hold the tiles securely in place. Moreover, adhering the tiles together might also limit their movement and make the pair of earrings less visually appealing."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Hidalgo Movie plot: In 1890, American Frank Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) and his mustang, Hidalgo, are part of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, where they are advertised as \\"the world's greatest distance horse and rider\\". Hopkins had been a famous distance rider, a cowboy, and a dispatch rider for the United States government; in the latter capacity he carried a message to the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment authorizing the Wounded Knee Massacre of Lakota Sioux. Wealthy Sheikh Riyadh (Omar Sharif) has sent his attachÃ© Aziz (Adam Alexi-Malle) to ask the show to either stop using the phrase \\"the world's greatest distance horse and rider\\" or allow Hopkins and Hidalgo to prove themselves by entering the Middle Eastern \\"Ocean of Fire\\" race: an annual 3,000-mile survival race across the Najd desert region. The Sheikh is custodian of the al-Khamsa line, considered to be the greatest distance horses in the world, and traditionally the race has been restricted to pure-bred Arabian horses and Bedouin or Arab riders. In addition to the grueling conditions, prevailing animosity and contempt for a Christian \\"infidel\\" and âimpureâ horse, horse and rider face stiff competition, including the wealthy and unscrupulous British horse breeder Lady Anne Davenport (Louise Lombard). To complicate matters, Sheikh Riyadh has promised his daughter Jazira Jazeera (Zuleikha Robinson), his only surviving child, in marriage to the rider of his horse, should he win. She hopes to prevent this by giving Hopkins advice and information to help him win, thereby resulting in greater danger for them both. Sheikh Riyadh's outcast brigand nephew, who will stop at nothing to gain control of the al-Khamsa line, raids the race camp, kidnaps Jazira, and threatens to kill her unless he gets his uncle's prize stallion racer as her ransom. Hopkins manages to rescue Jazira. However, Davenport and the Sheikh's nephew try to sabotage the race by eliminating the rival riders, but are thwarted when Hopkins kills the nephew.

The Sheikh's nephew is an outcast brigand and is determined to gain control of the al-Khamsa line, which is regarded as the greatest distance horses in the world. By kidnapping Jazira, the Sheikh’s only surviving child, the nephew seeks to pressure his uncle into giving up his prized stallion racer in exchange for Jazira's safe return. The movie Hidalgo, which is set in 1890, revolves around American Frank Hopkins (played by Viggo Mortensen) and his mustang, Hidalgo. They are part of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, where they are promoted as \\"the world's greatest distance horse and rider.\\" Wealthy Sheikh Riyadh (played by Omar Sharif) challenges this claim by inviting Hopkins and Hidalgo to participate in the Ocean of Fire, a 3,000-mile survival race across the Najd desert region. Lady Anne Davenport, a wealthy and unscrupulous British horse breeder, also joins the competition. Throughout the movie, Hopkins and Hidalgo face various obstacles and challenges, including the grueling conditions of the race, as well as animosity and contempt from other racers due to their Christian background and Hidalgo's \\"impure\\" breed. Sheikh Riyadh's daughter, Jazira, attempts to help Hopkins by providing information to improve his chances of winning, which in turn puts both of them in greater danger. In addition to the external challenges, the movie also explores internal struggles, such as Hopkins' journey to find redemption after being haunted by his past actions while working as a dispatch rider for the U.S. government, including having carried the message that authorized the Wounded Knee Massacre. As you consider investing in this film proposal, it is crucial to evaluate factors such as the film's potential target audience, the strength of the story, and the overall market trends for the genre.

On Sunday, September 30th, the President of the Serbian Republic (SC), Milan Jelić, tragically died due to a heart attack. The unexpected and unfortunate event occurred while Jelić was watching a football match in his hometown of Modrica. As a prominent political figure, Jelić's death undoubtedly had a significant impact on the Serbian Republic and its residents. Milan Jelić, born on March 26, 1956, had begun his career in politics in the early 1990s and was elected as the President of the Serbian Republic in 2007. In his presidency, Jelić dedicated time and resources towards rebuilding the economy and infrastructure of the region, which had been severely disrupted by the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. This helped to promote stability and growth in the Serbian Republic and fostered a culture of cooperation between the various ethnic communities residing within the country's borders. Jelić's efforts were aimed at reducing ethnic tensions and creating a brighter future for the population of the Serbian Republic. The sudden and unexpected passing of President Jelić while attending a football match in his hometown was a shock to the nation and the international community. It is essential to note that football is an immensely popular sport in the region, and it represents a source of national pride and unity amongst its people.

Though it reached No. 130 on the Billboard chart, Freak Out! was neither a major commercial nor critical success when it was first released in the United States. Many listeners were convinced that the album was drug-inspired, and interpreted the album's title as slang for a bad LSD trip. The album made the Mothers of Invention immediate underground darlings with a strong counter-cultural following. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa quotes a negative review of the album by Pete Johnson of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote: I guess you might call it surrealistic paintings set to music. Not content to record just two sides of musical gibberish, the MOI devote four full sides to their type of \\"artistry\\". If anyone owns this album, perhaps he can tell me what in hell is going on ... The Mothers of Invention, a talented but warped quintet, have fathered an album poetically entitled Freak Out, which could be the greatest stimulus to the aspirin industry since the income tax. The album developed a major cult following in the United States by the time MGM/Verve had been merged into a division of PolyGram in 1972. At that time many MGM/Verve releases including Freak Out! were prematurely deleted in an attempt to keep the struggling company financially solvent. Zappa had already moved on to his own companies Bizarre Records and Straight Records which were distributed by Warner Bros. Records. Freak Out! was initially more successful in Europe and quickly influenced many English rock musicians. According to David Fricke, the album was a major influence on the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Paul McCartney regarded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as The Beatles' Freak Out!

ADVERTISEMENT CNN was first to report Tuesday that Sadler was no longer working in the Trump administration. President Trump declined to comment on the report during a bill signing ceremony when asked by a reporter about Sadler's job status. The aide was active in the White House press office with her name on press releases as recently as Monday. Sadler's reported exit comes after accusations from McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, that Sadler apologized for the comments privately and promised to do so publicly, before reneging on that promise. The younger McCain said on ABC's \\"The View,\\" where she is a co-host, that Sadler's reversal showed the Trump administration to be \\"incapable\\" of apologies. \\"I was promised an apology, Kelly Sadler, publicly to my family. I did not receive that,\\" McCain said. \\"This is not an administration that's capable of apologizing.\\" \\"When I had a conversation with Kelly, I asked her to publicly apologize and she said she would,\\" she added. \\"I have not spoken to her since and I assume that it will never come.\\" The aide's comments sparked an effort inside the West Wing to identify people who leak information to the press, a phenomenon that staff members said made it difficult to do their jobs. That reportedly led to a contentious exchange in the Oval Office when Sadler allegedly told Trump that senior White House communications aide Mercedes Schlapp was behind several of the leaks, while Schlapp was in the room. Sadler made her initial comments after John McCain, a top GOP critic of the Trump administration, wrote a letter to his Senate colleagues urging them to reject Haspel's nomination to the CIA over her past work on the agency's \\"enhanced interrogation\\" program, which many consider torture. \\"Ms. Haspel’s role in overseeing the use of torture by Americans is disturbing. Her refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying,” wrote McCain, who was tortured during his time in captivity in Vietnam. “I believe the Senate should exercise its duty of advice and consent and reject this nomination.\\" Haspel was eventually confirmed to serve as the director of the CIA, with most Republicans and several Democrats backing her nomination. Sadler has not released any public statements since the incident, and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has refused to address the issue at her daily press briefings. “I'm not going to validate a leak, one way or another, out of an internal staff meeting,\\" Sanders said during an early May press briefing at the White House. John Bowden contributed to this report, which was updated at 7 p.m. ||||| (CNN) Kelly Sadler, the White House communications aide who made an imprudent comment about Republican Sen. John McCain's health, was quietly let go Tuesday nearly a month after making the insensitive remark. \\"Kelly Sadler is no longer employed within the Executive Office of the President,\\" wrote Raj Shah, the principal deputy press secretary, in an emailed statement. The White House had been strategizing an exit for Sadler for the last two weeks, a senior administration official said. There had been a discussion about relocating her to another agency or department outside of the White House, and it remains unclear if she is going somewhere else or leaving the administration entirely. In the aftermath of the comment -- in which Sadler told a meeting that McCain's opposition to CIA director nominee Gina Haspel didn't matter because he's \\"dying\\" -- the White House refused to condemn her remark, and she did not apologize publicly. She remained on the staff for nearly a month before departing. Privately, Sadler did apologize to McCain's daughter Meghan in a phone call. But afterward, Ms. McCain publicly questioned why Sadler still had a job at the White House. Read More ||||| Kelly Sadler joked last month that Sen.

Story Continued Below Sadler’s leaked comments set off a firestorm in Washington, but neither President Donald Trump nor his staff publicly rebuked her. Instead, the president viewed the widespread reporting about her comments as a sign that leaking in the White House had gotten out of control.

I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"Sure, let's break down the solution step by step. 1. First, let's find out how many blouses are in the hamper. Since 75% of her blouses are in the hamper, we'll need to calculate 75% of 12 blouses: 0.75 (percentage as a decimal) x 12 blouses = 9 blouses 2. Next, let's find out how many skirts are in the hamper. Since 50% of her skirts are in the hamper, we'll need to calculate 50% of 6 skirts: 0.50 (percentage as a decimal) x 6 skirts = 3 skirts 3. Lastly, let's find out how many slacks are in the hamper. Since 25% of her slacks are in the hamper, we'll need to calculate 25% of 8 slacks: 0.25 (percentage as a decimal) x 8 slacks = 2 slacks 4. Now that we've found the number of each type of clothing in the hamper, we can add them up to find the total number of clothes Brie needs to put in the washer: 9 blouses + 3 skirts + 2 slacks = 14 pieces of clothing So, Brie needs to put 14 pieces of clothing in the washer."},{"instruction":"The Broncos' defense limited Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady to 188 yards passing and no touchdowns, but their defensive effort was wasted by a poor performance from their inconsistent offense.

When his father and the Nevilles were forced to flee to Ludlow in 1459, Richard and his older brother, George (later Duke of Clarence), were placed in the custody of the Duchess of Buckingham, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. When his father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard, who was eight years old, and George were sent by his mother, the Duchess of York, to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton and participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as King Edward IV in June 1461. Context: Richard's Council of the North, described as his \\"one major institutional innovation\\", derived from his ducal council following his own viceregal appointment by Edward IV; when Richard himself became king, he maintained the same conciliar structure in his absence. It officially became part of the royal council machinery under the presidency of John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln in April 1484, based at Sandal Castle in Wakefield. It is considered to have greatly improved conditions for northern England, as it was, in theory at least, intended to keep the peace and punish law breakers, as well as resolving land disputes. Bringing regional governance directly under the control of central government, it has been described as the king's \\"most enduring monument\\", surviving unchanged until 1641. In December 1483, Richard instituted what later became known as the Court of Requests, a court to which poor people who could not afford legal representation could apply for their grievances to be heard. He also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. He ended the arbitrary benevolences (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of to somebody else, required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted certain forms of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in fraudulent measure, and prohibited fraudulent collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts. Richard's death at Bosworth resulted in the end of the Plantagenet dynasty, which had ruled England since the succession of Henry II in 1154. The last legitimate male Plantagenet, Richard's nephew, Edward, Earl of Warwick (son of Richard III's brother Clarence), was executed by Henry VII in 1499. The only extant direct male line of Plantagenets is the House of Beaufort, headed today by Henry Somerset, 12th Duke of Beaufort. But the Beaufort line was barred from the succession by Henry IV.

Step 2: Relate the given answer to the question - To answer \\"Why are many plants green?\\", we need to consider the color of chlorophyll, as it is the primary pigment responsible for the absorption of light during photosynthesis in plants. Step 3: Evaluate how well the given answer addresses the question - The given answer does connect chlorophyll's poor absorption of green light to its evolutionary origin in the presence of purple halobacteria. While this information provides background context, it does not directly address the question of why plants are green. Step 4: Identify the missing information - In order to effectively answer the question of why plants are green, it would be helpful to further explain how chlorophyll's poor absorption of green light results in plants appearing green to our eyes. Step 5: Suggest an improved answer - A more comprehensive answer could be: \\"Many plants appear green because they contain chlorophyll, the pigment responsible for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs light in the blue and red wavelengths, but it reflects green light poorly, making plants appear green to our eyes. This characteristic may have originated in chlorophyll-producing organisms living in oceans with purple halobacteria, which were already exploiting photosynthesis.\\" In conclusion, the initial answer given is not a complete or sufficient response to the question \\"Why are many plants green?\\" An improved answer would directly relate chlorophyll's poor absorption of green light to plants appearing green to our eyes, and provide evolutionary context, as suggested in Step 5."},{"instruction":"Кориолан Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Of course!

The sheep got infected with scrapie.","output":"To determine whether the sentence, \\"The sheep got infected with scrapie,\\" is considered correct by the strictest standards, it's necessary to examine it from different linguistic perspectives such as grammar, syntax, word choice, and context. Linguists may approach this from various angles, including descriptive approach, which seeks to describe how language is actually used, and prescriptive approach, which dictates rules and establishes standards for language usage. 1. Grammar: From a grammatical standpoint, the sentence appears to be correct. It contains a subject (the sheep), a verb (got infected), and a complement (with scrapie). The subject is a noun, the verb is in the passive form (inflected with the past participle 'infected'), and the complement is a prepositional phrase indicating the source of the infection. 2. Syntax: The syntax of the sentence is also appropriate. The structure follows the typical English pattern of subject-verb-complement, with the subject coming first, followed by the verb, and then the complement. The prepositional phrase \\"with scrapie\\" effectively modifies the verb \\"got infected,\\" providing essential information about the infection. 3. Word Choice: The word choice in the sentence is appropriate in terms of conveying the meaning. \\"Sheep\\" is the suitable term to refer to the livestock, and \\"scrapie\\" is the correct term for the prion disease that affects sheep and goats. \\"Infected\\" clearly indicates that the sheep contracted the disease, while \\"with\\" serves as an apt preposition linking the verb to the object. In addition, the use of the passive voice (\\"got infected\\") is appropriate, as it emphasizes the disease and its effect on the sheep rather than focusing on the agent causing the infection. 4. Context: Considering context is vital for understanding the appropriateness of a sentence. If the sentence is used in an informal conversation, it is acceptable, as it provides adequate information. However, in a more formal or scientific context like a research paper or an academic article, a more precise and technical sentence could be used, such as \\"The sheep was diagnosed with scrapie\\" or \\"The sheep contracted scrapie.\\" Overall, by the strictest standards and taking into account the perspectives mentioned above, the sentence \\"The sheep got infected with scrapie\\" is considered grammatically and syntactically correct. It conveys the intended meaning effectively, with appropriate words and structure. However, depending on the context in which the sentence is used, slight modifications may be necessary for enhanced clarity, specificity, or formality."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Update your resume.

Speaking to CNN in interviews Tuesday and Wednesday, Voss-Wittig said the Syrian first lady \\"should get her act together\\" and \\"not worry so much about her husband but worry a little bit more about women in her country.\\" A U.N. diplomat said the video was produced by Voss-Wittig and Sheila Lyall Grant, the wife of Britain's U.N. ambassador, \\"on their own initiative.\\" Voss-Wittig stresses that the video isn't a U.N. product or \\"done by us as spouses.\\" \\"It's done by us as women who care and as women who have an international profile ourselves,\\" she said. Profile: Asma al-Assad, Syria's first lady. Syria has been engulfed in violence for 13 months as a national uprising spread after the government began cracking down on peaceful protests. The United Nations estimates at least 9,000 people have died since the demonstrations began, while others put the death toll at more than 11,000. The video comes days after U.N. and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan forged what has become a fragile cease-fire. \\"We think it's a good moment now that the cease-fire has been installed. It's very wobbly, it's not quite working yet but we think she should not hide behind her husband's back anymore and should come forward with a straight message for peace,\\" Voss-Wittig said. \\"Stand up for peace, Asma,\\" a voice in the video demands. \\"Speak out now. For the sake of your people. Stop your husband and his supporters. Stop being a bystander.\\" In one clip, the Syrian first lady can be seen bending down to kiss a young girl stepping off a bus. The next image is of a woman embracing what appears to be a dead child. \\"Asma, when you kiss your own children goodnight, another mother will find the place next to her empty,\\" the narrator says. The video is the latest in a series of professionally produced videos aimed at stirring or shocking people into action. It asks viewers to sign a petition. Other recent examples that went viral include \\"Kony 2012,\\" a documentary on a notorious Africa warlord's use of child soldiers in Uganda, and a video showing Mexican children acting out the roles of drug traffickers, kidnappers and victims. Once described by Vogue magazine as \\"a rose in the desert,\\" the London-born al-Assad graduated from King's College with a degree in computer science. She worked for JP Morgan as an investment banker before marrying Bashar al-Assad in 2000, just months after he became president. According to a cache of e-mails leaked to CNN, the first lady appears to have spent much of the past year shopping online for expensive jewelry, art and furniture, and e-mailing boutiques in London and Paris. In one e-mail exchange with an art dealer in London, she -- apparently using a false name -- inquired about six artworks that feature butterflies. The dealer responds that the works cost between Â£5,000 and Â£10,500 (7,800 and 16,500). The art inquiry was sent October 28, the same day Syrian protesters staged a massive demonstration in the city of Hama in which they called for an end to the Syrian president's rule. \\"No one cares about your image,\\" the voice in the video says. \\"We care about your action.\\"","output":"- Wives of British and German ambassadors to the UN call on Asma al-Assad, Syria's first lady, to stop her husband's actions in an online video. - The video juxtaposes images of elegant al-Assad with those of suffering Syrian women and children. - Huberta von Voss-Wittig, wife of Germany's UN ambassador, urges Asma to speak out against the violence and shed her bystander status. - The video was made independently by von Voss-Wittig and Sheila Lyall Grant, wife of Britain's UN ambassador, in hopes of stirring or shocking people into action. - The nation-wide violence in Syria has resulted in an estimated 9,000 to 11,000 deaths."},{"instruction":"If uh radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done they're maybe they're a little more efficient, can we conclude that \\"I knew some of them were struggling with radio but still doing their best.\\"?

Singer Motors was founded in 1905 and specialized in manufacturing a range of cars, as well as bicycles and motorcycles. The company was well-known for its premium vehicles and technological innovations, which often resulted in the production of high-quality and unique car designs. Let's delve deeper into the two mentioned models: 1. Singer Chamois: The Singer Chamois was a small car produced from 1964 to 1970. It was essentially a luxury version of the popular Hillman Imp, a model produced by the Rootes Group, which acquired Singer Motors in 1956. The Chamois was designed to appeal to buyers searching for a more upscale vehicle within the Imp range. The Singer Chamois was powered by a rear-mounted 875cc aluminum engine that produced around 42 horsepower. It featured a rear-wheel drive layout, with a rear cooling system as well. The car's design offered a water-cooled inline-four engine placed longitudinally behind the rear axle, which was quite unique among other mini cars at the time. This design choice resulted in a larger and more spacious cabin, making it more comfortable for passengers. In terms of visual differences, the Chamois had a distinct grille design, featuring a horizontal three-bar grille with a centrally-mounted Chamois emblem. It also offered better interior trim, including wood veneer dashboard, individual front seats, improved upholstery, and the signature 'Chamois' badge on the bonnet and rear. Throughout its production run, the Singer Chamois saw multiple variants such as Chamois Sport and Chamois Coupé, which differed mainly in their performance and styling features. 2. Singer Gazelle: The Singer Gazelle was a larger car manufactured from 1956 to 1970. It was a luxurious version of the Hillman Minx, another model from the Rootes Group, and was marketed as an upmarket alternative within the same range. The Gazelle underwent several revisions and iterations during its production years, with six distinct series being introduced. The first series of the Gazelle featured a four-cylinder side-valve engine of 1,390cc displacement, which produced 47 horsepower. In later series, the engine was upgraded to a more modern overhead-valve unit, and by the time the Gazelle reached its sixth generation, it had a 1,725cc engine that offered 65 horsepower. In terms of its design and styling, the Gazelle typically featured unique grille designs, badging, improved interior trim, and wood veneer dashboard. The Gazelle also incorporated wooden door cappings, full-width wheel trims, and chrome bumpers, adding to its upmarket appeal. The Singer Gazelle was available in various body styles, including a 4-door saloon, a 5-door estate, and a 2-door convertible. The convertible version was particularly popular due to its sleek design and premium feel. In conclusion, Singer Motors Limited, the British car manufacturer, produced the Singer Chamois and Singer Gazelle models. These cars were positioned as luxurious versions of existing popular models from the Rootes Group, providing customers with more upscale features and refined styling. Singer Motors continued to operate until 1970, when the brand was eventually retired by the Rootes Group, which itself would later merge into the Chrysler UK and then finally become a part of the Peugeot group."},{"instruction":"My question: \\"Portuguese people settled in Anatolia before expanding into Central Asia.\\" Is the above claim true? Options: - yes - no Please think gradually:","output":"no"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Gangrene (or gangrenous necrosis) is a type of necrosis caused by a critically insufficient blood supply. This potentially life-threatening condition may occur after an injury or infection, or in people suffering from any chronic health problem affecting blood circulation. The primary cause of gangrene is reduced blood supply to the affected tissues, which results in cell death. Diabetes and long-term smoking increase the risk of suffering from gangrene. - Bleeding, also known as hemorrhaging or haemorrhaging, is blood escaping from the circulatory system. Bleeding can occur internally, where blood leaks from blood vessels inside the body, or externally, either through a natural opening such as the mouth, nose, ear, urethra, vagina or anus, or through a break in the skin. Hypovolemia is a massive decrease in blood volume, and death by excessive loss of blood is referred to as exsanguination. Typically, a healthy person can endure a loss of 1015% of the total blood volume without serious medical difficulties (by comparison, blood donation typically takes 810% of the donor's blood volume). The stopping or controlling of bleeding is called hemostasis and is an important part of both first aid and surgery. - Rheumatoid vasculitis is skin condition that is a typical feature of rheumatoid arthritis , presenting as peripheral vascular lesions that are localized purpura , cutaneous ulceration , and gangrene of the distal parts of the extremities . - Purpura is a condition of red or purple discolored spots on the skin that do not blanch on applying pressure. The spots are caused by bleeding underneath the skin usually secondary to vasculitis or dietary deficiency of vitamin C (scurvy). They measure 0.31 cm (310 mm), whereas petechiae measure less than 3 mm, and ecchymoses greater than 1 cm. - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors with half the risk attributed to each. The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. Environmental factors may include psychological stress, trauma, and certain infections. The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a \\"central sensitization syndrome\\". Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology. There is no specific diagnostic test. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. The treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage. Fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 28% of the population. Females are affected about twice as often as males. Rates appear... - Scurvy is a disease resulting from a lack of vitamin C. Early symptoms include weakness, feeling tired, curly hair, and sore arms and legs. Without treatment, decreased red blood cells, gum disease, and bleeding from the skin may occur. As scurvy worsens there can be poor wound healing, personality changes, and finally death from infection or bleeding. Scurvy is caused by not enough vitamin C in the diet. It typically takes at least a month of little to no vitamin C before symptoms occur. In modern times, it occurs most commonly in people with mental disorders, unusual eating habits, alcoholism, and old people who live alone. Other risk factors include intestinal malabsorption and dialysis. Humans and certain other animals require vitamin C in their diets to make the building blocks for collagen. Diagnosis is typically based on physical signs, X-rays, and improvement after treatment. Treatment is with vitamin C supplements taken by mouth. Improvement often begins in a few days with complete recovery in a few weeks. Sources of vitamin C in the diet include citrus fruit and a number of vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes. Cooking often decreases vitamin C in foods. Scurvy is currently rare. It occurs more often in the developing world in association with malnutrition. Rates among refugees are reported at 5% to 45%. Scurvy was described as early as the time of ancient Egypt. It was a limiting factor in long distance sea travel, often killing large numbers of people. A Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind, was the first to prove it could be treated with citrus fruit in a 1753 publication. His experiments represented the first controlled trial. It took another 40 years before the British Navy began giving out lemon juice routinely. - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months. While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. A group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence. RA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed... - Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce. Infectious disease, also known as transmissible disease or communicable disease, is illness resulting from an infection. Infections are caused by infectious agents including viruses, viroids, prions, bacteria, nematodes such as parasitic roundworms and pinworms, arthropods such as ticks, mites, fleas, and lice, fungi such as ringworm, and other macroparasites such as tapeworms and other helminths.

Oklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United States, covering an area of 69,899 square miles (181,040 km2), with 68,595 square miles (177,660 km2) of land and 1,304 square miles (3,380 km2) of water. It lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri, on the north by Kansas, on the northwest by Colorado, on the far west by New Mexico, and on the south and near-west by Texas. Much of its border with Texas lies along the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen, a failed continental rift. The geologic figure defines the placement of the Red River. The Oklahoma panhandle's Western edge is out of alignment with its Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is 2.1 miles (3.4 km) to 2.2 miles (3.5 km) east of the Texas line. The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first as a result of a survey by Spain in 1819. It was then set along the 103rd meridian. In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered the Texas line was not set along the 103rd meridian. Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd meridian was approximately 2.2 miles (3.5 km) to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the surveying error. The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd meridian.

This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a lack of interest or relevance to his career goals, dissatisfaction with the educational system, or a desire to pursue more practical, hands-on learning opportunities. The premise does not necessarily tell us about the individual's level of knowledge or his ability to succeed in life. To determine whether this premise entails the hypothesis \\"He learned everything he needed to know to be successful,\\" we need to examine various aspects of the situation, including the criteria for success, the individual's personal and professional goals, and the resources available for learning beyond the academic realm. Firstly, it is essential to recognize that success is a subjective and multifaceted concept. It can manifest in different ways for different people and can encompass a range of factors such as financial stability, personal and professional achievements, happiness, strong relationships, self-fulfillment, and the ability to create a positive impact in the world. Therefore, the definition of success can be highly individualized and contextualized. In this particular case, if the individual in question has placed an emphasis on acquiring particular skills, knowledge, or experiences that are not readily available within the confines of traditional academia, then it is possible that he could attain success by focusing on alternative learning methods. For instance, practical experience, internships, apprenticeships, self-study, mentorship, online courses, or even travel and exposure to different cultures could significantly contribute to his chances of achieving his personal and professional goals. Moreover, the hypothesis \\"He learned everything he needed to know to be successful\\" can be seen as an endorsement of lifelong learning, which involves seeking out new information, experiences, and perspectives throughout one's life. By stepping away from traditional academic structures, the individual may be opening himself up to an environment where he can continually adapt and grow his knowledge base to better align with his vision of success. However, it is equally important to consider that putting one's academic past behind does not always correlate with the idea that the individual learned everything he needed to know. A person's academic experiences can provide valuable foundational knowledge and skills necessary for success in certain fields and industries. If the individual had left academia prematurely or without mastering the essentials, it could limit his capabilities and potential for success in various aspects of his life. In summary, the premise \\"He has put his academic past behind him\\" alone does not offer enough information to determine whether it entails the hypothesis \\"He learned everything he needed to know to be successful.\\" To make this determination, one must consider various factors, including the individual's definition of success, personal and professional goals, and alternative learning methods and experiences that could contribute to his overall growth and success. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is not necessarily straightforward and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis."},{"instruction":"FINAL EXAM Question 1. Lauren J.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","output":"We hate these shopping centers - although we can see, that the same concept is coming to Denmark. It is understandable that the dislike for shopping centers might stem from a variety of reasons. The rapid growth and spread of large shopping centers could be seen as a negative sign, particularly when considering the impact on local businesses, communities, and the environment. Firstly, one of the primary concerns surrounding shopping centers is the decline of local businesses. Shopping centers tend to host big-box stores and multinational chains, which can make it difficult for smaller, independent retailers to compete. This can lead to a decrease in the number of unique shops and a loss of character within local areas. Small businesses play an essential role in any community, not only by contributing to its economy but also by providing personalized services and fostering a sense of connection among residents. Moreover, shopping centers might contribute to the homogenization of cities and towns. Instead of vibrant neighborhoods, each with their distinctive charm and individuality, cities can become a collection of indistinguishable shopping destinations. This homogenization can negatively impact local culture and ultimately make cities less attractive to both residents and tourists. Another concern is the environmental impact of shopping centers. These vast complexes often require large areas of land, which might result in the loss of green spaces, increased traffic congestion, and significant pollution. Additionally, the construction and operation of shopping centers can consume substantial amounts of water, energy, and other resources. Critics argue that projects like these might not be sustainable and could contribute to climate change and other environmental crises. Furthermore, shopping centers can contribute to a more sedentary lifestyle since they often encourage driving to the venue, due to the large parking lots provided. This can result in a decrease in walking and biking, both of which are essential for maintaining good health and overall well-being. Lastly, the rise of e-commerce platforms has led to an ongoing debate about the necessity of physical shopping centers. Online shopping offers convenience, accessibility, and often better prices for consumers. As a result, the relevance of shopping centers may be questioned in light of growing digital alternatives. Despite these concerns, it is important to recognize that shopping centers can also have positive aspects, such as providing jobs, serving as social hubs, and offering economic benefits to the communities they reside in. However, striking a balance between preserving the unique characteristics of neighborhoods, supporting local businesses, and minimizing the environmental impact is crucial for sustainable urban development. In relation to Denmark, it is important for the country to consider the potential ramifications of adopting large shopping center models. This will allow Denmark to ensure its urban planning and development efforts support the unique characteristics, culture, and values that its residents appreciate, while still offering a variety of shopping options for its citizens."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article in one sentence. Ahmed Kathrada, who was jailed alongside Nelson Mandela, said that Mr Zuma's resignation would end a \\"crisis of confidence\\" in the government. Mr Zuma said on Friday he would repay the money but would remain in his post. He has faced widespread calls for his resignation from South Africa's opposition. South Africa's highest court ruled that Mr Zuma had failed to uphold the constitution by ignoring instructions to repay some of the 16m in state funds spent on renovations at his private residence. In a televised address on Friday, Mr Zuma made no reference to the calls for his resignation. Can Zuma survive after apology? The leadership of Mr Zuma's party, the African National Congress, said it was united behind its leader, but the intervention of 86-year-old Mr Kathrada, a party veteran, may carry weight. Along with Mr Mandela, Mr Kathrada was among eight ANC activists sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of trying to overthrow the apartheid government during the 1963-1964 Rivonia Trial. In an open letter published in South African media, Mr Kathrada said: \\"In the face of such persistently widespread criticism, condemnation and demand, is it asking too much to express the hope that you will choose the correct way that is gaining momentum, to consider stepping down? \\"I know that if I were in the president's shoes, I would step down with immediate effect.\\" The scandal is arguably the biggest yet to hit Mr Zuma, who has fended off accusations of corruption and cronyism since before he took office in 2009. The public protector, an anti-corruption body, ruled in 2014 that 23m of public money had been improperly spent on Mr Zuma's rural home in Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal province, and ordered him to reimburse part of the expense. South African papers are abuzz with reactions to President Jacob Zuma's apology for improper spending on his rural home, and speculation about what he will do next. The Johannesburg Star's Janet Smith says Mr Zuma must be observing events in Brazil , where there are growing calls for the resignation of President Dilma Rousseff over corruption charges. The Sowetan's report about Mr Zuma's apology is overshadowed by the ongoing saga involving the president and the Indian-born Gupta family, which has allegedly been allowed undue influence. The paper's front-page comment yesterday was headlined \\"It's official: he's a failed president\\" In the Mail and Guardian, Carien du Plessis foresees difficulties for the ruling ANC if Mr Zuma were to resign, saying: \\"In a party split down the middle in more or less equal factions... things are more likely to fall apart.\\" Business Day's reports about the apology includes opposition Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane's description of it as an insult, and ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe's efforts to discourage calls for the president to step down. The president claimed he had acted \\"in good faith\\" and \\"never knowingly and deliberately set out to violate the constitution\\". \\"Any action that has been found not to be in keeping with the constitution happened because of a different approach and different legal advice,\\" he said, before issuing an apology for the \\"frustration\\" caused. The case had been brought by two opposition parties, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Democratic Alliance (DA). They have launched impeachment proceedings against Mr Zuma, but these are unlikely to be successful because of the ANC's large majority in parliament.","output":"South African President Jacob Zuma faces continuing calls for his resignation after the country's highest court ruled that he had failed to uphold the constitution by ignoring instructions to repay state funds spent on his private residence."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Here is a hypothesis: The 24 China Folk Culture features craftspeople in traditional costumes. Here are the options: OPT: (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no; Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. To provide a detailed explanation, let us take a closer look at both the premise and the hypothesis. The premise states that the 24 China Folk Culture Villages represent China's ethnic variety and feature craftspeople in traditional costumes along with folksong and dance performances. This suggests that the villages showcase a range of cultural aspects from China's various ethnic backgrounds, which includes multiple forms of cultural expressions such as clothing, music, and dance. The hypothesis states that the 24 China Folk Culture features craftspeople in traditional costumes. This statement merely highlights one of the cultural aspects mentioned in the premise, specifically, the part about traditional costumes worn by craftspeople. Now let's consider the available options: (1). Yes - This option signifies a direct correlation between the premise and the hypothesis. If the premise is true and the 24 China Folk Culture Villages do indeed showcase craftspeople in traditional costumes alongside other aspects like folksong and dance performances, then the hypothesis is also true, as it correctly points out that traditional-costumed craftspeople are a part of the cultural exhibition. (2). It is not possible to tell - This option suggests that, based on the provided information, there is uncertainty in establishing a connection between the premise and the hypothesis. In this case, however, the statement from the premise clearly covers the fact that craftspeople in traditional costumes are included in the display at the 24 China Folk Culture Villages. So, this option is not applicable. (3). No - This option implies that there is no correlation between the premise and the hypothesis, meaning that even if the premise is true, the hypothesis might still be false. This option is not applicable either, as the premise directly supports the hypothesis by mentioning craftspeople in traditional costumes as one of the featured cultural aspects. Since the premise and the hypothesis are directly related, with the latter being a specific detail derived from the former, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer is Option (1)."},{"instruction":"Sie ist in den wichtigsten Indizes vertreten, unter anderem im DAX, Dow Jones (DJ) Stoxx 50, DJ Euro Stoxx 50, DJ Stoxx Utilities Index sowie in dem deutschen Dividendenindex (DivDAX) und dem DJ Sustainability Index.

Today, we will talk about a math problem that looks big and difficult, but with our magical steps, we'll make it fun and easy. Are you ready to solve a math mystery with me? Let's start! Our math wizard gave us a magical formula! The formula is y = ax^2 + c. This is called a quadratic function. Have you heard about it? It's just a fancy name that helps us identify shapes of things we can draw with this formula. Don't worry too much about it; just remember that we need to play with it to find something else. First, we have to \\"simplify\\" our magical formula. That means making sure that all the things that look the same are together. In our formula, we only have three parts: \\"ax^2,\\" \\"c,\\" and \\"y.\\" So, there's nothing to simplify. We can move to the next step. Next, we need to find something called a \\"domain\\" and a \\"range.\\" The domain is all the possible 'x' values we can use in our formula, and the range is all the possible 'y' values we can get from it. For our formula, the domain would be any number because any number can be our 'x' value! So the domain is all the numbers we can think of, from really small to really big. The range will be different depending on our 'a' value, but it will either be above or below the 'c' value. For now, let's just remember that the range is the space our formula lives in. Now, we will do something magical! We will switch the places of 'x' and 'y'. That means our formula will become x = ay^2 + c. We call this the \\"inverse function\\" because we flipped! Isn't it cool? The next step is to rewrite our new flipped formula to say what 'y' equals. To do that, we will subtract 'c' and then divide by 'a'. Our new formula will be y = (x-c)/a and that's our inverse function! Now, we need to find the domain and range of our flipped formula. Just like before, the domain will be all numbers because any number can be our 'x' value. The range will be different depending on our 'a' value, but it will either be above or below the 'c' value. Lastly, we need to check if our inverse function works. To do this, we need to make sure that when we use the first formula to find 'y' and then use the inverse formula with the same 'x', we get back our original 'x'. This may sound tricky, but if we follow the steps, it will work! So, by following these magical steps, we have played and solved a math mystery together! You are now math wizards and can find the inverse of any quadratic function. Don't forget to share this magic with your friends!

A:","output":"A: As of today, the largest troop contributor to the United Nations Peacekeeping missions is Ethiopia. However, it is essential to understand that the number of troops contributed by a country to UN peacekeeping operations can vary over time due to political and operational factors. Ethiopia, a landlocked country in East Africa, has consistently been one of the top contributors to the United Nations peacekeeping forces over recent years. This commitment reflects the nation's desire to actively promote global peace and security through its participation in these missions. Annually, Ethiopia provides thousands of its troops for various UN peacekeeping missions across the globe. As of March 2022, according to the data available on the United Nations Peacekeeping website, Ethiopia has contributed around 5,899 personnel to various UN missions. Ethiopia is followed closely by Rwanda, Bangladesh, and Nepal, which also contribute significant numbers of troops to peacekeeping initiatives. The personnel provided by Ethiopia serve in numerous capacities: troops, police, military experts, and others. They work together with the rest of the peacekeeping force to maintain stability, protect civilians, and enforce peace agreements in conflict-ridden areas. Ethiopia's participation in UN missions benefits the nation in several ways. First, it allows Ethiopia to engage positively with the international community, fostering collaboration and relationships with other nations. Second, Ethiopian troops gain valuable experience and training in the field, which helps improve their overall military preparedness. Third, Ethiopian involvement in peacekeeping missions reflects its commitment to upholding its foreign policy principles, which include commitment to multilateralism and global peace. Ethiopian peacekeepers have been deployed in a range of UN missions, such as the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), and the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA), among others. In conclusion, Ethiopia is currently the largest troop contributor to the United Nations Peacekeeping missions. By participating in these missions, Ethiopia strengthens its international relations, enhances its military capabilities, and upholds its commitment to global peace and security. However, it is important to note that participation rates in peacekeeping missions can change over-time due to various factors, so it remains crucial for the international community to stay engaged and support nations that contribute to peacekeeping efforts."},{"instruction":"This is some data: The Golden Curry eatType restaurant; The Golden Curry food English; The Golden Curry priceRange high; The Golden Curry familyFriendly yes; The Golden Curry near The Bakers.

The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\" Answer: A:","output":"The key to the administration of the caliphate in the Ottoman Empire was a combination of factors, including the central role of the sultan, the influence of the Imperial Harem, the strong educational system of the palace schools, and the establishment of support among the ruling elite.

The first recorded use of the word \\"techno\\" in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built. - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Tech house is a subgenre of house music that mixes elements of techno with house. The term \\"tech house\\" developed as a shorthand record store name for a category of electronic dance music that combined musical aspects of techno, such as \\"rugged basslines\\" and \\"steely beats,\\" with the harmonies and grooves of progressive house. The music originally had a clean and minimal production style that was associated with techno from Detroit and the UK. In the mid to late 1990s a scene developed in England around club nights such as The Drop run by Mr.C & Plink Plonk, Heart & Soul, and Wiggle run by Terry Francis and Nathan Coles. Other DJs and artists associated with the sound at that time included Charles Webster, Bushwacka!, Cuartero, Dave Angel, Herbert, Funk D'Void, Ian O'Brien, Derrick Carter, and Stacey Pullen. By the late 90's London nightclub The End, owned by the former Shamen rapper Richard West (Mr C) and Layo Paskin, was considered the home of tech house in the UK. Tech house tracks are typically between 610 minutes in length. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - Trance is a genre of electronic music that developed during the 1990s in Germany. It is characterized by a tempo lying between 125 and 150 beats per minute (BPM), repeating melodic phrases, and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 \\"peaks\\" or \\"drops.\\" Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno, house, pop, chill-out, classical music, tech house, ambient, and film music. - Matthias Paul, better known by his stage name Paul van Dyk (born 16 December 1971 in Eisenhüttenstadt, East Germany) is a German Grammy Award-winning DJ, record producer and musician. One of the first true superstar DJs, Paul van Dyk was the first artist to receive a Grammy Award nomination in the newly added category of Best Dance/Electronic album for his 2003 release \\"Reflections\\". He was named the World's number one DJ in both 2005 and 2006, something only few DJs have ever achieved. He was the first ever DJ to be named number one by \\"Mixmag\\" in 2005. By 2008, he had sold over 3 million albums worldwide. - The Politics of Dancing 2 is an album of trance music mixed by Paul van Dyk as a sequel to his The Politics of Dancing . - Mixmag is a British electronic dance and clubbing magazine, published in London, England. Launched in 1982, the magazine covers dance events, and reviews music and club nights. - East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR, was an Eastern Bloc state during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany. - Eisenhüttenstadt (literally \\"ironworks city\\" in German) is a town in the Oder-Spree district of the state of Brandenburg, Germany, on the border with Poland. It had a population of 32,214 as of 31 December 2008. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'publication date'.

If you can please add Voice calling facility like Viber !\\" Answer:","output":"Rating: 4 This review is generally positive and shows enthusiasm about the messaging app. The reviewer clearly states that they have found the app to be the best messaging app they have used. They mention their satisfaction despite only using the app for a short period. This reflects the high degree of satisfaction with the performance and user experience of the app. The review is rated 4 (out of 5) for the following reasons: 1. Constructive feedback: The reviewer offers a specific suggestion for improvement - adding a voice calling feature like Viber. This constructive feedback indicates that the reviewer is engaged with the app and has thought about possible areas of improvement. It is essential for developers to know the areas where they could potentially enhance their product to meet users' expectations better. 2. Clear expression of satisfaction: The use of capital letters for \\"SUPER\\" and the exclamation mark at the end demonstrates the reviewer's high level of satisfaction with the app. This is a useful qualitative measure of user satisfaction, as it helps developers understand the positive aspects of their product. 3. Comparisons with other apps: The inclusion of Viber as a point of comparison allows developers to research and identify best practices in the messaging app space and possibly implement similar features in their product. This comparison also shows that the reviewer has previous experience with other messaging apps and can recognize the superior qualities of the reviewed app. 4. Candidness and authenticity: The reviewer provides an honest account of their usage, mentioning that they have only used the app for a short time but are already convinced of its superiority. This adds credibility to their positive review because they are openly admitting the limitations of their experience and are not exaggerating their satisfaction. The review is not rated 5 due to the following reason: 1. Lack of detail: The reviewer does not provide specific details about the app's features or aspects that they enjoy or find superior to other messaging apps. A more detailed review, including examples of these positive attributes, would give the developers a better understanding of their users' preferences and make the review more helpful to other potential users. While the enthusiasm is evident, the review could benefit from elaborating on specific reasons that led to this level of satisfaction. In conclusion, this review appears genuine, offers constructive feedback, and expresses a high level of satisfaction with the messaging app. However, it could benefit from more detailed descriptions of its positive aspects.

Review: This item looks cute in the picture but it looks like something you would buy at a flea market for really cheap. My opinion is it's just a super tacky lamp. Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, it appears that this product review is not positive. The title, \\"Not that great,\\" immediately indicates that the reviewer was not fully satisfied with the product. The language used in the review further supports this assertion. The reviewer mentions that the item looks cute in the picture, suggesting that their initial impression of the product was favorable. However, they go on to say that the actual item looks like something you would buy at a flea market for a very low price. This comparison indicates that the reviewer found the product to be of inferior quality, as flea markets are often associated with secondhand or cheaply-made items. The association with a flea market suggests that the reviewer may have felt deceived by the product's appearance in the picture, leading to disappointment with the actual item. Furthermore, the reviewer states that, in their opinion, the product is \\"just a super tacky lamp.\\" The use of the word \\"tacky\\" is a clear indication that the reviewer did not find the product aesthetically pleasing. The term \\"tacky\\" typically refers to something that looks cheap, tasteless, or unattractive, supporting the idea that the reviewer was not impressed with the product's design or overall appearance. In conclusion, the given product review is not a positive one due to the dissatisfaction with the product's quality, appearance, and perceived value. The reviewer expressed disappointment in both the quality, comparing it to a flea market item, and the design, referring to it as tacky. These factors demonstrate that the product did not meet the reviewer's expectations, ultimately leading to a negative review of the item."},{"instruction":"Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Anthony Mann's westerns with Jimmy Stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with John Ford and Howard Hawks as the best film director in that genre. He certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy Stewart - in Mann's films there is an edge to Jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience. In WINCHESTER '73 it was the relationship of Stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance. Here it is a \\"I trust only myself\\" attitude, which leads to one complication after another. Even before the film properly begins he (as Jeff Webster) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to Seattle because of some dispute (we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive, or they tried to steal the cattle). He meets his match in Skagway, the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to Dawson. Skagway's boss is a so-called law man named Gannon (John McIntyre) who reminds one of the real boss of Skagway in the \\"Gold Rush\\" Jefferson \\"Soapy\\" Smith and Judge Roy Bean. The problem is that neither Smith nor Bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as Gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money. Stewart's herd interrupted a public hanging - so (as a penalty fine) the herd is confiscated (to be sold later for Gannon's profit). Stewart is partner with Ben (Walter Brennan - who oddly enough won his last Oscar playing Judge Roy Bean). They are also joined by Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) and also meet two women, the sophisticated Rhonda Castle (Ruth Roman) and the friendly and helpful Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvert). Rhonda works closely with Gannon, but had helped Jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in Seattle. However, she has a similar \\"I only trust myself\\" attitude to Jeff. She does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to Dawson. He, Ben, and Rube go but at night (while the others are asleep) they go back and steal back their cattle. Renee follows and warns them that Gannon and his associates are following. Jeff holds off Gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the Canadian border, although Gannon points out that since Jeff has to return by way of Skagway Gannon can wait until he does to hang him. The reunited party of Rhonda and Jeff split over the trail to take to Dawson, Jeff opting for a longer and safer route. After he is proved right, they go by his route and reach Dawson only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields. The herd is sold to Rhonda, and Jeff, Ben, Rube, and Renee start prospecting. There is soon two groups in the town of Dawson. One led by Connie Gilchrist and Chubby Johnson want to build a decent town. But the Mounties won't be setting up a station in Dawson for months. The other, centering around the \\"dancehall\\" run by Rhonda, are in cahoots with Gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers (Robert J. Wilke - really scary in one sequence with Chubby Johnson and Jay C. Flippen, Jack Elam, and Harry Morgan). Jeff wishes to steer clear of both, and head with his new wealth and Ben for a ranch they want in Utah. But will they get there? And will Jeff remain neutral? The performances are dandy here, including Stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers, but would otherwise be peaceful enough. Brennan is playing one of his patented old codgers, whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results. Flippen is a drunk at first, but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind - and one who has a chance to verbally stab Stewart in the heart using Stewart's own words against him. McIntyre would achieve stardom on television in WAGON TRAIN replacing Ward Bond, but his work in Mann's films show his abilities as a villain (such as his trade post opportunist who outsmarts himself in WINCHESTER '73). He is, as is said elsewhere on this thread, really sleazy - but he has a sense of humor. Roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being, whose fate is determined by her better feelings. And Calvert is both a voice of conscience and a frontier \\"Gigi\\" aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman. Best of all is the Canadian Rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of Monument Valley by John Ford. Mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film, and the viewer will appreciate the results.

Capricorns are naturally ambitious, hard-working people. Most will enjoy discussing their professional goals and the progress they've made toward them. Try talking to her about whatever she's doing to get ahead in life — whether this includes a nine-to-five job or personal projects like art, writing, etc. — and don't be surprised if she's ready to talk about these things at great length. Work may be a topic that you find boring, but don't have to sound like you're asking her robotic questions at a job interview when you talk to her about hers. In fact, with some creativity (and an air of gentle mischief), you can add a little flirty zest to these normally dry questions. Here are just a few examples: Bland questions: \\"Where do you work?\\" \\"What do you do?\\" \\"Do you enjoy that?\\" \\"Where do you see yourself in five years?\\" Zesty questions: \\"So, what's your plan for making your first million?\\" \\"What's your next step in life?\\" \\"Are you more of a Gordon Gekko person or a Lorenzo Anello person?\\" Because they value ambition and determination, most Capricorns respect someone who's worked hard and achieved big successes. However, Capricorns are modest and conservative at heart, so they're unlikely to respond well to extravagant boasting. Instead, try dropping subtle hints about your accomplishments by working them into the conversation naturally. See below for a few examples: Blunt brags: \\"You see these shoes? These are real alligator skin.\\" \\"We should go cruising in my new Bugatti this weekend.\\" \\"I just won employee of the month at my dad's real estate business for the fifth time in a row!\\" Subtle sweet-talking: \\"I'm hoping to use my signing bonus to do something nice for us.\\" \\"I only wear this watch on special occasions — I bought it for myself when I got my Master's.\\" \\"I don't usually do this, but I like to enjoy something nice after things go well at work.\\" Capricorns aren't generally people who will shy from a little friendly sparring. Planning dates that involve some degree of competition can lead to great fun and some serious romantic sparks. However, intense, heated competition is a no-no. Too much competition can lead to resentment and, in addition, Capricorns aren't likely to enjoy the embarrassment of losing at a high-stakes game. Good date ideas: Bowling, cards, mini golf, shooting/archery, arcade games, board games with drinks. Bad date ideas: Street racing, one-on-one street rules basketball, high-stakes poker. If you're dominating at your competition, it may be a good idea to let your date win at least once at whatever you're doing to prevent embarrassment. Try not to make it too obvious that you're letting her win — this can be more embarrassing than losing in the first place. Most Capricorns are practical people that are likely to appreciate a gift a little more for its value and usefulness than for its symbolic meaning. While a piece of jewelry or a bouquet of some fragrant flowers is almost always a sweet gesture, you'll want some of your gifts to be a little more down-to-earth. Try to get her things she'll get continued, long-lasting use and enjoyment out of, rather than one-time thrills. The ideal practical gift for a Capricorn woman depends on her personal hobbies and interests. For instance, if she enjoys drawing, try getting her a high-quality sketch pad and a set of professional pencils. If she's a natural-born athlete, get her a membership to an exclusive gym with the finest exercise equipment. There's no \\"right\\" answer here — it all depends on the woman. While Capricorns are unlikely to appreciate gaudy, ostentatious displays of wealth, they are naturally status-conscious and will enjoy sampling the finer things in life every once in a while. To celebrate special occasions (and sometimes \\"just because\\"), make an effort to treat your Capricorn lover to a fancy time out. Good date ideas: Museums, operas, fancy restaurants, film festivals, art shows, weekend getaways, wineries, etc. Short on cash? It's possible to enjoy the finer things in life on the cheap if you're creative. For instance, try checking a local university's \\"events\\" website — it will usually be possible to see traveling speakers, attend book signings, and more for very cheap or even free. Summary:","output":"To connect with a Capricorn, discuss ambitious goals, subtly mention successes, enjoy friendly competition, give practical gifts, and occasionally enjoy fancy outings together."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: \\"Keep out or I'll chase you out! This is my property!\\" You hear this every spring. It is a long musical sound --- a bird song! Birds use their songs to communicate different messages to one another. People who study bird sounds are learning their meanings. Usually it is the male that sings. Early in spring he sings to say that he has picked out a piece of property. He sings to attract a female of his same kind. Together they will raise a family in his territory . He sings to tell all other birds of his kind to keep out. Each kind of bird has its own type of song. Cardinals sing something that sounds a little like \\"What cheer, cheer, cheer.\\" Towhees sing, \\"Drink your tea.\\" Most of the time, birds pay attention only to the songs of birds of their own kind. Cardinals answer cardinals, and song sparrows answer song sparrows. A cardinal knows that a song sparrow will not try to steal its mate. So you can see one reason why a cardinal may chase away another cardinal but will not bother a song sparrow. Most different kinds of birds eat different things. To find enough to eat, a bird needs a big piece of land to search in. Many kinds of birds have some ways of dividing up the land into territories. Song sparrows, cardinals ovenbirds, and white-throated sparrows are some of the birds that have territorial systems. Especially in early spring, birds work out the boundaries between their territories by singing \\"keep out\\" threats and by chasing and fighting each other. The birds continue singing to tell females that they have set up territories. Neighboring birds seem to agree that there are make believe fences between their pieces of property. Then they do not have to waste energy chasing each other instead of taking care of their young. Scientists guessed that some birds could recognize their neighbors by small differences in their songs. Two scientists who studied white-throated sparrows found that these birds can even tell the difference between songs of individual birds of their own kind. White-throated sparrows...

King has published 54 novels, including seven under the pen name Richard Bachman, and six non-fiction books. He has written nearly 200 short stories, most of which have been collected in book collections. Many of his stories are set in his home state of Maine. His novella \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\" was the basis for the movie \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" which is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. - Continental philosophy is a set of 19th- and 20th-century philosophical traditions from mainland Europe. This sense of the term originated among English-speaking philosophers in the second half of the 20th century, who used it to refer to a range of thinkers and traditions outside the analytic movement. Continental philosophy includes the following movements: German idealism, phenomenology, existentialism (and its antecedents, such as the thought of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche), hermeneutics, structuralism, post-structuralism, French feminism, psychoanalytic theory, and the critical theory of the Frankfurt School and related branches of Western Marxism. - Literary theory in a strict sense is the systematic study of the nature of literature and of the methods for analyzing literature. However, literary scholarship since the 19th century often includesin addition to, or even instead of literary theory in the strict senseconsiderations of intellectual history, moral philosophy, social prophecy, and other interdisciplinary themes which are of relevance to the way humans interpret meaning. In humanities in modern academia, the latter style of scholarship is an outgrowth of critical theory and is often called simply \\"theory.\\" As a consequence, the word \\"theory\\" has become an umbrella term for a variety of scholarly approaches to reading texts. Many of these approaches are informed by various strands of Continental philosophy and sociology. - Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman (born Neil Richard Gaiman, 10 November 1960) is an English author of short fiction, novels, comic books, graphic novels, audio theatre, and films.

In 2013, \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" was voted Book of the Year in the British National Book Awards. - A metaphor is a figure of speech that refers, for rhetorical effect, to one thing by mentioning another thing. It may provide clarity or identify hidden similarities between two ideas. Where a simile compares two items, a metaphor directly equates them, and does not use \\"like\\" or \\"as\\" as does a simile. One of the most commonly cited examples of a metaphor in English literature is the \\"All the world's a stage\\" monologue from \\"As You Like It\\": - Joanne Michèle Sylvie Harris, (born 3 July 1964) is an English author, best known for her award-winning novel \\"Chocolat\\" which was later turned into a successful film.

Though most likely to be remembered today as the husband of writer Shirley Jackson , he was influential for the development of literary theory in the 1940s and 1950s . Equally skeptical of every major critical methodology of his time , he worked out an early instance of a critical theory , exploring ways that critics can be foiled by their own methods . \`\` Each critic , '' Hyman wrote in The Armed Vision , \`\` tends to have a master metaphor or series of metaphors in terms of which he sees the critical function ... this metaphor then shapes , informs , and sometimes limits his work . '' Hyman saw it as his own critical task to point out these overriding themes by which , tacitly , other critics organized their work and their thinking . Hyman was born in Brooklyn , New York and graduated from Syracuse University in 1940 , where he met Jackson . He was a staff writer for The New Yorker for much of his life , and although he did not possess a graduate degree , taught at Bennington College in Bennington , Vermont . From 1961 to 1965 , Hyman was the literary critic of The New Leader . After Jackson 's death in 1965 ( both she and Hyman died relatively young ) , he married Phoebe Pettingell , who later edited a posthumous volume of his work . Mr. Hyman was also a noted jazz critic , having written hundreds of essays on the subject in addition to his career as a writer and teacher . - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). - Humanities are academic disciplines that study aspects of human culture. In the Middle Ages, the term contrasted with divinity and referred to what is now called classics, the main area of secular study in universities at the time. Today, the humanities are more frequently contrasted with natural and sometimes social sciences as well as professional training. - \\"All the world's a stage\\" is the phrase that begins a monologue from William Shakespeare's \\"As You Like It\\", spoken by the melancholy Jaques in Act II Scene VII. The speech compares the world to a stage and life to a play, and catalogues the seven stages of a man's life, sometimes referred to as the seven ages of man: infant, schoolboy, lover, soldier, justice, Pantalone and old age, facing imminent death. It is one of Shakespeare's most frequently quoted passages. - Sociology is the study of social behaviour or society, including its origins, development, organization, networks, and institutions. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, disorder, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes.

He’d apparently just driven around the block & came right back. Mom & I looked at each other and smirked- she was thinking the same thing I was: “what’d he forget this time?” But then Dad got out of the car.. and on his face was the look. In my young life, I’d never seen that look before, but it chilled me to the core and I just knew something bad was coming. Mom knew it too; the smirk quickly left her face as Dad came over and said.. “Mom.. I hope I heard this wrong.. but on the radio they said a woman drowned at the lake.. I hope I’m wrong, I barely caught the name, but I think they said it was your sister..” The cookout was forgotten; we went inside & started making phone calls, and unfortunately it was indeed my aunt. She & her family had gone swimming to cool off; apparently she’d gotten a cramp or something and gone under while nobody was looking, and by the time she was missed it was too late.

Some bigender individuals express two distinct \\"female\\" and \\"male\\" personas, feminine and masculine respectively; others find that they identify as two genders simultaneously. It is recognized by the American Psychological Association (APA) as a subset of the transgender group. A 1999 survey conducted by the San Francisco Department of Public Health observed that, among the transgender community, less than 3% of those who were assigned male at birth and less than 8% of those who were assigned female at birth identified as bigender. - Gender identity is one's personal experience of one's own gender. Gender identity can correlate with assigned sex at birth, or can differ from it completely. All societies have a set of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a person's social identity in relation to other members of society. In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females, a gender binary to which most people adhere and which enforces conformance to ideals of masculinity and femininity in all aspects of sex and gender: biological sex, gender identity, and gender expression. In all societies, some individuals do not identify with some (or all) of the aspects of gender that are assigned to their biological sex; some of those individuals are transgender or genderqueer. Some societies have third gender categories. - Washington Allston (November 5, 1779 July 9, 1843) was an American painter and poet, born in Waccamaw Parish, South Carolina.

The speed and maneuverability of the new Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles transform it \\"from simply a means of transportation to an offensive capability,\\" Brig. Gen. Michael Brogan said. There are about 300 of the all-terrain MRAPs being used in combat, Brogan said. Military leaders seek 6,000 more of the vehicles to protect troops from improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Last year, the number of IEDs planted by insurgents more than doubled to nearly 8,000. The ability to travel off-road is critical in Afghanistan. The country is about the size of Texas and has rugged terrain and few paved routes. Standard MRAP trucks, which have a high center of gravity and weigh more than 30,000 pounds, have been confined mostly to the roads that do exist. Lack of mobility makes MRAPs and other heavier vehicles easier to target for insurgents, Brogan says. Better mobility was a key requirement for the new truck. \\"This vehicle offers the ability that the baseline MRAPs didn't, namely the ability to get off-road and maneuver,\\" Brogan said. \\"That makes the targeting exponentially more difficult for the bad guys.\\" The vehicle enables troops to stay unpredictable and confound insurgents, says Dakota Wood, a military analyst with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. \\"As long as you have to travel on roads, you make yourself an easier target,\\" Wood said. \\"If you broaden your options on where you can go, that's good for you.\\" MRAPs have proved far safer in bomb blasts in Afghanistan than any other vehicle. Troops are \\"tens of times\\" more likely to be wounded or killed in other vehicles in an IED attack, according to the Pentagon's Joint IED Defeat Organization. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told a Senate panel Tuesday that IEDs are \\"absolutely the worst killer and maimer of our troops.\\" He said MRAPs made \\"a huge difference\\" in limiting the carnage from IEDs. Starting this month, 500 to 1,000 new MRAPs will begin arriving per month in Afghanistan, Gates told senators. There are more than 70,000 U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan, and about 100,000 will be there later this year as part of the escalation ordered by President Obama. There may be the need for 4,000 more MRAPs, Brogan said. The final number will be determined by the Pentagon and combat commanders. It takes about 14 hours for Oshkosh Defense, the truck's maker, to produce the vehicle on its assembly lines in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Brogan said. The company is about 300 trucks ahead of schedule, he said. It's an expensive effort. The trucks cost about 1 million apiece. Demand for them requires that each is flown in by cargo jet. It costs more than 150,000 to fly each one aboard an Air Force C-17 cargo jet or 140,000 aboard a commercial flight. By spring, the Pentagon hopes to have enough of the trucks in Afghanistan to begin sending them by ship, a slower but cheaper alternative to flying, Brogan said.

Demonstrations were held in 18 cities Thursday. The biggest and most violent was in Sao Paulo, where police shot tear gas and protesters threw rocks and smashed the windows of a car dealership and a bank. While thousands of people took part in the protests, they were still much smaller than the massive marches seen during the Confederations Cup last year when tens of thousands took to the streets. In the morning, the Homeless Workers Movement blocked main avenues across the city and about 4,000 people marched on the Arena Sao Paulo where the inaugural game of the World Cup will be held on June 12.

Hannah is making banana bread. She needs to use 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush. It takes 4 bananas to make one cup of mush. If Hannah uses 20 bananas, how many cups of flour should she use? What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: 15?","output":"To find out how many cups of flour Hannah should use, we can follow these step-by-step reasoning process: Step 1: Determine the proportion of bananas to cups of mush. The given information says it takes 4 bananas to make one cup of mush. Step 2: Calculate how many cups of banana mush can be made from 20 bananas. Hannah uses 20 bananas, so we will divide the number of bananas she has (20) by the proportion of bananas per cup of mush (4 bananas per cup). 20 bananas ÷ 4 bananas/cup = 5 cups of banana mush. Step 3: Determine the proportion of banana mush to cups of flour. Hannah needs 3 cups of flour for every 1 cup of banana mush, which is a 3:1 ratio (flour:banana mush). Step 4: Calculate how many cups of flour are needed for the amount of banana mush. Using the ratio determined in step 3, Hannah needs 3 cups of flour for 1 cup of banana mush, thus 3 times the amount of banana mush. 5 cups of banana mush × 3 cups of flour/cup of banana mush = 15 cups of flour. So, the answer is 15. Hannah should use 15 cups of flour for making banana bread with 20 bananas."},{"instruction":"Yahoo Local Out of BetaThis morning, while driving to work, I heard a radio commercial for Yahoo! Local.

Options: A. Yes; B. No;","output":"B. No The right answer to the question \\"what moving downhill due to the force of gravity can dissolve carbon in sedimentary rock?\\" is not \\"raft.\\" The word \\"raft\\" would typically refer to a flat structure used for support or transportation over water. While it is true that water moving downhill due to the force of gravity can dissolve carbon in sedimentary rock, the term \\"raft\\" is unrelated to that process. However, allow me to provide an explanation describing how the movement of water can lead to the dissolution of carbon in sedimentary rocks. Carbon is an essential element found in different types of rocks, including sedimentary rocks such as limestone and dolomite. These rocks often contain calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or magnesium carbonate (MgCO3), resulting from the accumulation of shells, coral, and other organic materials over time. Water, as it moves downhill due to gravity, participates in a process known as chemical weathering. Chemical weathering refers to the breakdown and alteration of rocks at Earth's surface as a result of chemical reactions, which may occur with the presence of water or other substances. In the case of water dissolving carbon in sedimentary rocks, the water and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere react to create a weak acid called carbonic acid (H2CO3). When this weak carbonic acid comes into contact with sedimentary rocks containing calcium or magnesium carbonates, a reaction occurs. The acid reacts with the carbonate minerals, breaking them down and dissolving the carbon contained within. This can result in the formation of new compounds, such as calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2) and magnesium bicarbonate (Mg(HCO3)2), which are soluble in water and can be carried away by the downward flow. This dissolution process can contribute to the formation of caves, sinkholes, and other karst features in regions containing carbonate-rich sedimentary rocks. It also plays a role in the global carbon cycle by transporting dissolved carbon from the Earth's surface to rivers and eventually to the oceans. In conclusion, while it is accurate to say that water movement due to gravity can dissolve carbon in sedimentary rock, \\"raft\\" is not the appropriate term to describe that process. Rather, it's the interaction of water (primarily via the formation of carbonic acid) with carbonate minerals present in sedimentary rocks that results in the dissolution of carbon."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical next event?

Your task is to generate answer \\"yes\\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \\"no\\". Review: Undoubtedly one of the great John Ford's masterpieces, Young Mr. Lincoln went practically unnoticed at the time of its initial release, no wonder because the year was 1939 when many of the greatest movies of the whole cinema history had been released, including the most mythical Western in the history of the genre, John Ford's milestone Stagecoach and many others, such as Gone with the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington which took the Oscar in the only category Young Mr. Lincoln was nominated for, which is Original Screenplay. It continued to be the most underrated Ford's film for many years ahead destined to gradually fade away in the shadow of other John Ford's masterpieces, but by the end of the 1950s American and European film critics and historians took a hold of a note written by legendary Russian director Sergei Eisenstein about the Young Mr. Lincoln where he praised it and acknowledged that if he would only have had an opportunity to direct any American film ever made till then, it would be definitely John Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln. Impressed by such an undoubted preference from Eisenstein, critics began to see the film again but only with a bit different eyes and film's reputation has been increasing ever since. It was far not for the first time the life of one of the most legendary American presidents was brought to the screen. Right in the beginning of the 1930s Griffith did it in his Abraham Lincoln and the same year as Ford's film, MGM released John Cromwell's one called Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Curiously enough both of them were based on a very successful Broadway Stage Play released in 1938 and written by Robert Sherwood. As far as John Ford's films are concerned, we can easily find many references to the life and deeds and even death of mythical Lincoln's figure in several of director's works, such as 1924 The Iron Horse or 1936 The Prisoner of the Shark Island, the second one, just as Young Mr. Lincoln, utilizes as the main musical theme the favourite Lincoln's song - Dixie. The screenplay based on a previously mentioned Stage Play and Lincoln's biographies was written by Lamar Trotti in collaboration with John Ford himself, which was quite a rare thing for Ford to do but final result was simply superb - a script combining elements of the Play with several historical facts as well as myths and legends about the beginning of Abraham Lincoln's life and law practice culminating in a hilarious but mostly heartbreaking trial scene, which is the film's highest point and main laugh and tears generator, where Lincoln defends the two young brothers accused of a murder and have to devise a manner to help their mother too when she is brought before the court as a witness and where the prosecuting attorney (played by Donald Meek) demands her to indicate which one of her sons actually committed the murder obviously obliging her to the making of an impossible choice of condemning to death one and letting live the other. Overall it's a very touching, heart-warming and even funny film with simply magnificent performance from Henry Fonda in his supreme characterization of Abraham Lincoln and with overwhelming richness of other characters no matter how little or how big they are incarnated from the wonderful and intelligent screenplay and conducted by the ability of John Ford's genius at one of its best deliveries ever.

Register the business name: You can register your business under the Shops and Establishments Act of your state. This is not mandatory but helps in case of any legal disputes. Visit your local municipal body or district industry center to register. 5. Apply for a Permanent Account Number (PAN): As a sole proprietor, your personal PAN will be used for the business's financial activities. If you do not have a PAN, apply for one at the Income Tax Department's website. 6. Open a business bank account: Approach a bank to open a current account in your business name. You may need to provide proof of identity, PAN, business address, and registration certificate (if applicable). 7. Obtain necessary licenses and permits: Depending on your business type, you may need to acquire specific licenses or permits from local, state, or central authorities. Examples include GST registration, professional tax registration, FSSAI license (for food businesses), and import-export code (for import/export businesses). 8. Set up your office/workspace: Rent or purchase a space suitable for your business operations. Ensure that it meets all your needs and complies with local zoning and permit regulations. 9. Hire employees (if necessary): As a sole proprietor, you will likely be responsible for managing all aspects of your business. However, depending on the nature and size of your business, you may need to hire employees or engage in contractual services. 10. Market your business: Develop and implement marketing strategies to attract customers to your business. This may involve creating a website, utilizing social media, and running promotions. 11. Keep proper financial records: Maintain accurate financial records for tax filing and accounting purposes. Hire an accountant or use accounting software to help with accurate record-keeping. 12. File your taxes: Sole proprietorships pay taxes on the individual income tax slab. File your income tax returns annually, as well as any other taxes applicable to your business. Regarding government policies supporting sole proprietorship in India, there are several initiatives: 1. The MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) development scheme supports sole proprietorships by providing financial assistance, technical support, and access to resources, training, and networking opportunities. 2. The Startup India initiative aims to promote entrepreneurship by providing funding support, tax benefits, and assistance in patent filing for eligible startups. 3. The Mudra Yojana scheme offers loans to small enterprises, including sole proprietorships, ranging from INR 50,000 to INR 10 lakhs. 4. The Stand-up India scheme supports first-time entrepreneurs, particularly among women and individuals from Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) communities, by providing easier access to loans and financial assistance. 5. The Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) aims to create an environment that fosters entrepreneurship and innovation by providing funding, incubation support, and mentorship to startups. In conclusion, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question seeks detailed information on how to start and operate a sole proprietorship in India, while the second question asks about government policies supporting such businesses in the country.

Knock em dead! Richard Termine for The New York Times Stephanie Wright Thompson, Brandon Bales and, right, Matthew Maher in Steve Steven? Richard Termine for The New York Times Matthew Maher, center, in \\"Have You Seen Steven?\\" No such collegial cheer is cheered before performances of Ann Marie Healys play Have You Seen Steve Steven? at the East 14th Street Theater. But it would not feel terribly out of place. Ms. Healys creepy comedy is play No. 6 of 13 to be presented by 13P, a feisty group of playwrights who have banded together to produce their work in New York. Affection for the enterprise is hard to resist, especially since the majority of the writers are women, who are chronically underrepresented on local stages. Im not sure Ms. Healys relentlessly quirky exercise in neo-absurdism will win many converts to the cause, but the play can be granted a little leeway as part of a healthy, even inspirational exercise in authorial self-determination. Set in a McMansion in the Midwest, the play is a lumpy mixture of silly Saturday Night Live-style comedy and X Files spookery. The whole shebang is spritzed with experimental obscurantism that recalls any number of absurdist and postabsurdist playwrights. Alissa Ford, a warm but absent smile plastered on her face as she putters around in sweats, does a fair impression of Julia Sweeney, the former SNL star, in her role as a perky-to-the-point-of-unhinged mother named Mary Clarkson. (The Midwestern accent is a hoot.) Mary, who speaks in exclamation points, is trying to get her languid 17-year-old daughter, Kathleen (Stephanie Wright Thompson), to share her enthusiasm at the prospect of a visit from their old friends the Dudleys and their son, Tommy. Only thing is, Kathleen cant seem to remember who they are, these old friends, although she is assured that she and Tommy used to play endless games together in the backyard when they were youngsters. Kathleens likewise perky father, Frank (Tom Riis Farrell), comforts her by observing that this absent-mindedness is no big thing. Forgetting is a little gift your mind gives you as you get older, he says with a fatherly grin. Mom and Dad are disturbing enough, with their antic chipperness and vague chatter about the bean-dip stain on the couch and the sherazz theyve run out of. But odder still is the neighbor named Hank Mountain (Matthew Maher, sinister even in a festive ski cap), who pops in for a few minutes of weird banter. You seem to have lost your little dog there! he says apropos of nothing as he bids Kathleen goodbye. This invisible pet will come to assume portentous significance as the play chugs along through a protracted, increasingly unhinged scene in which the Dudleys and the new exchange student they just ordered arrive for Ritz Bits and cheese cubes. The return of Hank with another peculiar neighbor, Vera (Carol Rosenfeld), tips the play firmly into eerie territory. The visitors begin taunting one and all about the ghost pet  Steve Steven he was called  that once figured in Kathleens and Tommys childhood games. Soon these local menaces have brainwashed everyone into anxious gabble about the little dog and other nonsense. Sample exchange: Wait a minute. I didnt hear anything about paninis. Paninis is shaped small like the cards? Cards are shaped like paninis, but paninis are DVDs. Paninis are DVDs, and DVDs are the network. So it goes, inanely, for some time. I am fairly confident Ms. Healy does not intend the play to be an oblique commentary on the turmoil in Iraq, and I would venture to say it is not a satire of the religious disputes that roiled Europe in the 17th century. But what Ms. Healy is seeking to say  about bourgeois consumerism, or the communication gap between generations, or the disorienting emptiness of American life, or the corruption of language  I would not dare to guess. Perhaps she and her director, Anne Kauffman, believe this merry exercise in obfuscation is a slyly subversive analysis of any or all of the above (or something else entirely), but I remain unpersuaded. I hate to be a scold, but even playwrights whose methods resemble madness ultimately must communicate some sense of meaning. It is only natural to want to be in on the joke, after all. Beckett and Ionesco, Albee and Pinter may not conform to the dictates of naturalism or make their points explicitly, but they certainly communicate a perceptible and compelling vision of human experience. The 70 minutes of aimless tomfoolery in Have You Seen Steve Steven? never do. The play has a few appealing moments as a satire of middle-class boorishness, but it dissolves too soon into a soup of silly dialogue garnished with hints of the numinous and the ominous. Fun and games are all well and good, Ms. Healy, but even Twister has a discernible goal. HAVE YOU SEEN STEVE STEVEN?

Dan candied apples, pears, plums and quince. Joey candied ginger, peaches, pineapple and oranges but had some humidity in the room the fruit didn't turn out right. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fruit had a shorter shelf life because of bad preservation, apples or ginger? Hint: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. A:","output":"Given the information provided, it is not possible to determine which fruit had a shorter shelf life due to bad preservation - apples or ginger - based solely on the paragraph above. However, we can infer that Joey's candied fruits, including ginger, were negatively affected due to the humidity in the room. This humidity could have attracted moisture, causing fermentation and potentially leading to unpleasant results or spoilage. So, in this specific situation, it is likely that Joey's candied ginger had a shorter shelf life compared to Dan's candied apples because of the humidity issue during the preservation process."},{"instruction":"Robin got closer to her mother after they both started the same hobby.

She played a significant role in the narrative of the Hebrew scripture, specifically in the Book of Genesis. Sarah, who was initially named Sarai, was married to Abraham, originally called Abram. Together, they become the biblical patriarch and matriarch of the Hebrew nation. Their story is significant in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. Sarah, the daughter of Terah, was born in the ancient city of Ur, located in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). She and her husband Abraham are introduced in the Book of Genesis as God's chosen couple to have many descendants and establish a great nation. Sarah and Abraham's faith in God is an essential theme in their story. When they first received the divine promise of progeny, both Sarah and Abraham were already old, and Sarah was considered barren, meaning she could not have children. Despite being skeptical, Sarah and Abraham trusted the divine plan and stayed steadfast in their faith. For years they lived and traveled in Canaan as nomads, holding to the promise they had received. However, unable to bear children for Abraham and still remaining childless well past menopause, Sarah encouraged her husband to take her Egyptian maidservant, Hagar, as a concubine. Hagar bore a child named Ishmael, who became the father of the Arab people. Though this seemed like a workable solution, Sarah and Hagar later had disputes, ultimately leading to Hagar and Ishmael's departure. When Sarah was ninety years old, she miraculously conceived a child, as was foretold by God. She then gave birth to Isaac, their long-awaited son. Isaac was named so because \\"Isaac\\" means \\"laughter\\". The name alludes to both Sarah and Abraham laughing at the idea of having a child at their old age when God's prophecy was announced to them earlier. The birth of Isaac is considered a miracle, manifesting the power and grace of God. The story of Sarah and the birth of Isaac mark a crucial point in the Bible, since Isaac is considered the primary ancestor of the Israelite nation. Isaac subsequently married Rebekah and had twin sons, Esau and Jacob. Jacob, later renamed Israel, would father twelve sons who went on to establish the Twelve Tribes of Israel, thus fulfilling God's promise made to Sarah and Abraham of having countless descendants, making a great nation, and inheriting the land of Canaan."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\").

Article: Against the supposition that forest fires in Alaska, Canada and Siberia warm the climate, scientists have discovered that cooling may occur in areas where burnt trees allow more snow to mirror more sunlight into space. This finding suggests that taking steps to prevent northern forest fires to limit the release of greenhouse gases may warm the climate in northern regions. Usually large fires destroyed forests in these areas over the past decade. Scientists predict that with climate warming, fires may occur more frequently over the next several centuries as a result of a longer fire season. Sunlight taken in by the earth tends to cause warming, while heat mirrored back into space tends to cause cooling. This is the first study to analyze all aspects of how northern fires influence climate. Earlier studies by other scientists have suggested that fire in northern regions speed up climate warming because greenhouse gases from burning trees and plants are released into the atmosphere and thus trap heat. Scientists found that right after the fire, large amounts of greenhouse gases entered the atmosphere and caused warming. Ozone levels increased, and ash from the fire fell on far-off sea ice, darkening the surface and causing more radiation from the sun to be taken in. The following spring, however, the land within the area of the fire was brighter than before the fire, because fewer trees covered the ground. Snow on the ground mirrored more sunlight back into space, leading to cooling. \\"We need to find out all possible ways to reduce the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\\" Scientists tracked the change in the amount of radiation entering and leaving the climate system as a result of the fire, and found a measurement closely related to the global air temperature.

The young son of one of the anglers falls into the water and something unseen drags him under the surface. Another angler prepares a flare gun but he slips and accidentally fires it into the deck, which is soaked with gasoline dropped earlier by the boy. The vessel bursts into flames and explodes; everybody aboard is killed. Jim Hill (McClure) and his wife Carol witness the explosion. Later, Jim and Carol's dog goes missing and the pair finds its dismembered corpse on the nearby beach. The following day, teenagers Jerry Potter (Meegan King) and Peggy Larson (Lynn Schiller) go for a swim at the beach. Jerry is abruptly pulled under the water. Peggy believes it is a prank until she discovers his mutilated corpse. Peggy screams and tries to reach the beach but a monstrous figure attacks her and drags onto the sand. The humanoid creature tears off her swimsuit and rapes her. That night, two more teenagers are camping on the same beach. Billy (David Strassman) is about to have sex with his girlfriend, Becky (Lisa Glaser) when another humanoid monster claws its way inside, kills him and chases Becky onto the beach. She outruns her assailant but then runs into the arms of yet another monster, which throws her to the sand and rapes her. More attacks follow; not all of them successful, but few witnesses survive to tell the public about the incidents; only Peggy is found alive, though severely traumatized. Jim's brother is also attacked, prompting Jim to take a personal interest in the matter. A company called Canco has announced plans to build a huge cannery near Noyo. The murderous, sex-hungry mutations are apparently the result of Canco's experiments with a growth hormone they had earlier administered to salmon.

Up to 40 children were transferred to a secure unit of the Barwon prison, a high-risk, maximum security prison for men, located near Geelong, following ongoing rioting by youth in the Parkville and Malmsbury juvenile prisons. Barwon is the prison where notorious gangland criminal Carl Williams was beaten to death by another inmate in 2010. The move to send children there was announced by the government as an interim measure while sections of the Parkville facility damaged during rioting were rebuilt. The children are being sent to the Grevillea unit of Barwon prison as a temporary measure, entirely separate from the adult population, however it is unclear how long they would be kept there for. But the director of legal advocacy at the Human Rights Law Centre, Ruth Barson, said she spoke to several of the children being held in Barwon on Saturday evening, and that a number of them had not been involved in the rioting. “Most of the children in Barwon are on remand so they’ve not been found guilty of the crimes they’re being detained for,” she said. “One young man who came from Parkville and who had not been involved in the rioting there has now gone from attending school every day while at Parkville and doing really well, to being locked in a concrete box for up to 23 hours each day. “There’s no doubt the government has a policy challenge on its hands, but cruelty can never be a justifiable response. The nation rallied in response to Don Dale and Victorians should also rally against the inhumane treatment of [these] children.” Most of the children held at Barwon were only 16 years old and were being subject to solitary confinement, lawyers who visited the children over the weekend said. Many have a registered disability, have been exposed to family violence and are in the child protection system. They have been cut off from access to education or treatment programs, lawyers said, which they would normally receive in youth detention. However, Guardian Australia has been told by government sources that there are teachers on site as well as health services and a visitors centre for family visits. Standard management does not involve 20 hours of lock-down per day, sources said. But Barson said that: “They haven’t seen the sky for close to a week”. “They’re fearful and reported being threatened with the use of dogs, restraints and gas,” she said. On Wednesday, the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service will argue in the supreme court that the transfer of children to Barwon was unlawful and an abuse of their human rights. The minister for families and children, Jenny Mikakos, told Guardian Australia on Sunday: “We will defend this matter vigorously in court”.“The steps taken by the Government are consistent with relevant legislation and Victoria’s charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities,” she said. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Human rights lawyers claim that children in a maximum security prison in Victoria, Australia, are being held in solitary confinement and denied access to fresh air, describing the conditions as “unequivocally unfit for children.” The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service will argue in the supreme court that the transfer of children to Barwon prison was unlawful and an abuse of their human rights."},{"instruction":"Featuring Juaquin James Malphurs, better known as Waka Flocka Flame, Another Day in Paradise is a mixtape by which hip hop recording artist?

Clean energy is bipartisan issue, they write. We need clean energy industries. Policies that encourage clean energy have been introduced with bipartisan support, they say. Authors: U.S. must act to keep up with international markets, help national security.","output":"Title: The New Congress Must Steer America Towards Clean Energy for a Brighter Tomorrow Introduction The recent transformation in the political landscape necessitates an urgent need for sustainable job creation and an end to fossil fuel dependence. Gordon and Caldwell outline an exciting possibility for the new Congress in the realm of clean energy—a domain that holds potential for bipartisan support, job creation, and improved national security. A Bipartisan Consensus: Clean Energy as Our Future Clean energy emerges as a major bipartisan issue, capable of bridging gaps across the political spectrum. For some, the promise of a greener environment takes precedence, while others see its potential to improve the economy, create jobs, and boost national security. The good news is that historical policies have demonstrated that clean energy can benefit both parties, and can find a common ground in the pursuit of a more sustainable future. Fueling Growth and Job Creation in Clean Energy Industries As a rapidly growing sector, the clean energy industry commands a significant share of the U.S. and global markets. By making a swift shift towards clean energy technologies and industries, Congress has the opportunity to create millions of new jobs across the economic spectrum. This spans from positions in research and innovation, to manufacturing and installation, extending to maintenance and operational services. Bipartisan Policies Pave the Way It is encouraging to note that in recent years, clean energy policies have been introduced with bipartisan support, providing a strong foundation for future progress. With lawmakers aligning their focus on advancing clean energy technologies and infrastructure, they are taking essential steps towards a future that upholds America's environmental, economic, and security interests. Keeping Up With International Markets While the global clean energy arena continues to burgeon, it is vital that the United States takes a proactive role in this market. Failure to seize the opportunity will risk falling behind in the race for clean energy superiority and allow international competitors to capitalize on the benefits that this emerging sector has to offer. Strengthening National Security The shift towards clean, sustainable energy sources can contribute significantly to national security for multiple reasons. By diversifying energy sources, the U.S. will reduce its reliance on volatile geopolitical regions that may pose threats to foreign policy. Energy independence is a critical factor for a nation's sovereignty and can alleviate concerns that arise from external energy dependencies. Conclusion The new Congress has a tremendous opportunity to act in the best interests of the American people and the country's future. By prioritizing clean energy as a bipartisan issue, lawmakers have the ability to create new jobs, ensure a clean and sustainable environment, and bolster national security. It is a pivotal moment for the United States as it stands on the brink of an energy revolution—and the nation must seize it to progress towards a prosperous future for all."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that contains a fact.","output":"Step 1: Choose a subject or topic that provides a factual base.

But just up the road is a very different world, a huge modern factory complex appearing almost out of nowhere in the rolling green countryside. It is home to Dairymaster, one of Ireland's most remarkable and successful stories of entrepreneurial innovation. Why one of the world's leaders in dairy farming technology is to be found in such a quiet part of Ireland is, a bit like the seniors' singing session, a lot to do with tradition, kinship and community. \\"My father Ned started the company back in 1968 as a one-man operation, installing and supplying equipment locally,\\" says today's chief executive, Edmond Harty. \\"At that time he saw there was a need to improve what was available in the marketplace and to do it much quicker, and that's really how the company was born,\\" he says. The factory is on land Mr Harty's grandfather once farmed. That generation could scarcely have imagined today's technology which helps the company plough a business furrow in over 40 countries worldwide, with everything sold created and made in Causeway, and Japanese and Russian marketing staff among the crew in Kerry. \\"We're based in a part of Ireland that's synonymous with dairy farming,\\" says Mr Harty, who seems just as much at home in the field as in the company headquarters, as he weaves his way through a herd of giant inquisitive cattle near the factory. Kerry is famed for music and poetry and a trademark swashbuckling style in Gaelic football, so the genes of flair and imagination are never far away in a county with its own distinctive character. Farming roots are key to the firm's creations and innovations to make farming easier for both farmer and cow. Many of the 300-strong workforce with engineering skills and degrees are also steeped in the local agricultural tradition and instinctively understand the needs and language of those who farm the land. \\"The staff by and large are local and they very much understand the processes that happen here on farms, what needs to be done, what opportunities there are to improve those processes. We build and we develop the knowledge, the capability within the company ourselves really,\\" says Mr Harty. But farming knowledge is only part of the equation: a marriage with engineering imagination and creativity has been vital. Mr Harty's real passion from childhood was in engineering, with screwdrivers and spanners as common in his schoolbag as pencils, and a degree in mechanical engineering and a PhD followed. Understanding animals as well as farmers is essential, he says, and working with nature and cows' natural behaviour has driven inventions and much of the research and development in Causeway. A new generation of milking machine mimicked a suckling calf rather than hand-milking as conventional machines do: the revolutionary design coming after painstaking study of calves suckling cows, using the most advanced imaging technology. What is it like to be an entrepreneur in different parts of the world? The BBC's global team are talking to people starting their own businesses around Europe. What battles do they face to make their mark and make money? Read more My Business stories \\"Mimicking what a calf actually does has allowed us to optimise the milking process, get better udder health, to make milking quicker and get more milk from those same cows,\\" says Mr Harty. Innovation is vital for a place at the cutting edge of a competitive and demanding sector, he says. \\"As an organisation we've built a very strong research and development capability in terms of a whole variety of technologies. \\"That's not only across the animal sciences and veterinary roles but also in electronics, in mobile app development and in the mechanical engineering side of things,\\" he says. The cow is at the centre of everything - with near sacred status. Happy cows make happy farmers so Mr Harty says animal welfare is very important. Less stressed cows yield more milk. The hundreds of cows around the factory all wear bright blue necklaces - nothing to do with corporate branding but instead with the company's \\"moo monitor\\" device attached. Mobile app technology inside the bovine jewellery presents the farmer on his phone with constant information on a cow's health, feeding, breeding cycle and resting. With emigration again affecting many rural communities in Ireland in hard economic times, the realisation of Ned Harty's dream has meant jobs at home in Causeway and a cadre of locals with high-tech skills. Ireland's Silicon Valley for cows perhaps, created by an entrepreneurial spirit which provides local jobs while helping farmers as far away as Siberia and Japan.","output":"In a quiet part of Ireland, there's a big modern factory called Dairymaster. This company uses technology to help make dairy farming better and easier for farmers and cows. It was started by a man named Ned in 1968 and his son, Edmond, runs it today. Many people who work at Dairymaster have farming backgrounds and know a lot about the needs of farmers and their cows. They combine their farming knowledge with engineering skills to create new inventions. For example, they made a milking machine that works like a calf suckling instead of how a human would milk a cow by hand. This helps cows stay healthy and produce more milk. Dairymaster also makes a \\"moo monitor\\" that can be attached to a cow's neck, and it helps farmers keep track of their cows' health using their phones. The company helps farmers in over 40 countries and has created jobs for the people of Causeway, Ireland."},{"instruction":"Question: In which district of London would you find Harrods department store?

Each dolphin has its own signature whistle to identify itself and to call others. Dolphins don't have the ability to smell, but their hearing and eyesight are excellent. We also asked Jane if dolphins have got their own language. She told us that they have and that dolphins started talking to each other from birth. They make different sounds, including whistles, squeaks and click. Sometimes they even sound like a heavy metal band! We then asked Jane if any interesting experiments have been done. She told us that a very interesting experiment had been done with a mother dolphin and her two-year-old baby in an aquarium. They talked to each other over the telephone! The two dolphins were in separate tanks which were connected by a special under water system. Unfortunately the biologists couldn't understand what the dolphins were talking about because they haven't been able to decode dolphin language yet. However, it was very clear that the dolphins knew what they were talking about. Finally we asked Jane if there was hope that we would be able to understand dolphins in the near future.

But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally. Where people are more at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland? A:","output":"People in the inland areas are more at risk of mental retardation due to iodine deficiency compared to those in coastal areas. This is because individuals living in coastal regions obtain more iodine naturally from their food sources, as the soil and water there contain higher levels of iodized salt. Inland areas often have soil that lacks sufficient amounts of iodine. Consequently, crops grown in these regions may not absorb enough iodine, leading to a reduced iodine content in the food consumed by the local population. Additionally, freshwater bodies in the inland areas might not provide sufficient iodine compared to the saltwater found in coastal regions. Iodine deficiency is a significant public health concern, as it can lead to various types of disorders like goiter, hypothyroidism, and developmental disorders, including mental retardation. These disorders are commonly referred to as iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). To address iodine deficiency, especially in inland areas, many countries have introduced iodized salt and iodine supplements programs. These initiatives have led to a substantial decline in iodine deficiency disorders among at-risk populations. In summary, people living in inland areas are at a higher risk of mental retardation due to iodine deficiency compared to those residing in coastal regions. Awareness about the importance of consuming iodine-rich food and using iodized salt can help to mitigate the risk and prevent related disorders."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process: - The salt water is heated - As the saltwater is heated the water becomes a gas - The salt particles sink to the bottom of the container - Gaseous water is piped into another container - Allowed to cool - The salt particles are left behind in the first container - The second container contains fresh water. Question: suppose more pressure on rocks happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The process described is a method of desalinating saltwater by heating it, causing water to evaporate, leaving behind the salt, and then condensing the water vapor in a separate container to collect fresh water. Now, to answer your question about the influence of more pressure on rocks and its effect on salt being removed from the water: Applying more pressure on rocks may result in an increased release of salts and minerals from the rocks into the surrounding water. This would lead to a higher salt concentration in the water. However, the desalination process itself is based on the principle of separating water molecules from salt molecules through evaporation and condensation. As long as the desalination process is carried out effectively, the separation of salt from the water should still occur. In conclusion, while more pressure on rocks could result in more salt dissolving into the water initially, if the desalination process is working properly, it should still be able to remove the salt effectively. So, it would have no major effect on the salt removal efficiency in the second effect mentioned (i.e. condensation of gaseous water in another container)."},{"instruction":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many years passed between the first and last rebellion?","output":"Title: The Temporal Span Between the First and Last Rebellions in History Introduction Rebellions have been an integral part of human history since time immemorial. They emerge from the collective desire for significant social, economic, and political changes, often driven by mounting dissatisfaction and inequality among the populace. In order to explore the passage of time between the first and last rebellion, it is necessary to understand the context of these events and what constitutes a rebellion in historical terms. A Brief Overview of Rebellions Rebellions can generally be defined as organized movements that attempt to challenge or overthrow a ruling power or existing order. They may be sparked by a range of factors, including religious disagreements, economic hardships, political ideology, or sociocultural issues. They usually involve the populace in nonviolent and violent actions that culminate in major contests for power. From the earliest recorded rebellions to the most recent uprisings, such movements have served as pivotal moments in shaping human societies. The First Rebellion: Kadesh Insurrection in Ancient Egypt (c. 2380 BC) While there might be other instances of rebellion even earlier in time, the lack of recorded history makes it difficult to ascertain. One of the first notable uprisings was the Kadesh Insurrection, which took place in the Egyptian Old Kingdom during the reign of Pharaoh Pepi II, around 2380 BC. This rebellion arose from the diminishing power of the Pharaoh, rampant corruption within the ruling class, and increasing dissent among the people. The Kadesh Insurrection involved several lower-ranking officials who took advantage of the weakened state to gain power and independence for their regions. This rebellion eventually contributed to the fall of the Old Kingdom and ushered in the era of the First Intermediate Period in Ancient Egypt. The Kadesh Insurrection represents an early manifestation of collective resistance against a ruling power. The Last Rebellion: Myanmar Anti-Coup Protests (2021) Rebellion as a concept continues to be relevant in the modern era. With varying factors contributing to unrest and dissatisfaction, people all around the globe continue to voice their opposition against oppressive regimes and call for change. The most recent rebellion, as of this writing, is the ongoing Myanmar (Burma) Anti-Coup Protests that began in February 2021. This rebellion ensued when the Myanmar military seized power through a coup on February 1, 2021, overthrowing the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. The military has since imposed a state of emergency, arrested politicians and activists, and restricted access to information by controlling the media and the internet. The people of Myanmar, however, have chosen to rise against this oppressive regime, with thousands taking to the streets and engaging in acts of civil disobedience to demand the restoration of democracy. Time Passed between the First and Last Rebellion To determine the number of years passed between the first and last rebellion, we account for the time from the Kadesh Insurrection in 2380 BC until the Myanmar Anti-Coup Protests in 2021 AD. It is important to remember that the BC and AD dating system has no year zero. Consequently, we must factor this absence in our calculation: Years Passed = (2380 years BC [Before Christ] + 1 year [to account for the lack of year zero] + 2021 years AD [Anno Domini]) Years Passed = 2,380 + 1 + 2,021 = 4,402 years Conclusion In conclusion, approximately 4,402 years have passed between the Kadesh Insurrection in Ancient Egypt and the Myanmar Anti-Coup Protests. While the context and circumstances of these rebellions differ significantly, they both epitomize the resilience of the human spirit and the unwavering desire for social and political liberties. As long as there are systems of power and authority, humanity will continue to rebel against the asymmetries of justice, fairness, and equity."},{"instruction":"1st Valley Bank is a development bank (3rd in terms of assets) in the Philippines, based in Baroy, Lanao del Norte and servicing various areas in Mindanao, specifically the provinces of Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Misamis Occidental, Misamis Oriental, Bukidnon, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga Sibugay.

With limited financial resources and facing the constant threat of conflict, the facility has earned a reputation for its unconventional approach to keeping its residents on display. Here, zookeepers are forced to resort to taxidermy when faced with the unfortunate demise of their treasured creatures. As smuggling living animals across tumultuous borders becomes increasingly difficult, the stuffed remnants of former inhabitants serve as a poignant reminder of the challenges faced by those who dedicate their lives to conservation in this troubled region. The process of preserving the deceased creatures is carried out meticulously by skilled taxidermists like Mohammed Awaida. As the Palestinian zoo owner carefully holds the taxidermy monkey, one can see the immense dedication and care that has gone into the reconstruction process. With captivating realism, each animal is preserved in a lifelike pose, their glassy eyes gazing out into a world they once inhabited. Despite the grim reality of this makeshift museum, the Khan Younis zoo continues to draw a steady stream of visitors who come to admire its unusual collection of mummified fauna. Curious children and families gather around the enclosures, taking photographs and sharing stories about the once-living creatures. In such a challenging environment, the zoo provides a much-needed escape, offering a rare opportunity to connect with the natural world and learn about the incredible diversity of species that call our planet home. Though the zoo's management faces an uphill battle in terms of funding and resources, their efforts have not gone unnoticed by the international community. Animal welfare organizations and compassionate individuals around the globe continue to rally behind the Khan Younis zoo, offering financial support and technical expertise to help improve the facility. There is hope that, with continued assistance, the zoo may one day be able to replace the stuffed specimens with living, breathing residents once more. In an area where conflict and suffering seem omnipresent, the Khan Younis zoo and its remarkable collection of mummified creatures stand as a poignant symbol of the resilience and determination that define the people of Gaza. Despite immense hardship, these resourceful keepers demonstrate a deep commitment to caring for and preserving the natural world, even in the most challenging of circumstances. Their persistence and dedication promote a sense of hope – for a future in which communities can live in harmony with the wildlife that shares their environment. For now, the emaciated stuffed lion, the monkey missing limbs, and the porcupine with its brittle spines must continue to serve as a reminder of the difficulties faced by those who strive to protect and conserve the world's most vulnerable species. Through their somber gaze, these lifeless yet compelling creatures convey a powerful message: that preserving the beauty and biodiversity of life on Earth is a responsibility that transcends borders, politics, and conflict. No matter how dire the situation, there will always be those who steadfastly choose to stand on the side of life."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Sediment settles in a place due to gravity - The sediment breaks down into small particles - Wind or water picks up the sediment - The sediment travels along the same route as the wind or water - The sediment is deposited at new locations by the wind or water - The sediment is picked up again by new wind or water - The sediment travels further - The sediment is deposited again in a new place.

Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing. Before I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary. Why detoxes don't work Firstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies. I read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \\"shining glory\\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox.

The review begins by addressing the cost of the product, emphasizing that the reviewer believes it to be too expensive and not worth the price. This sets a tone of dissatisfaction from the onset, as the reviewer clearly feels that they did not receive value for their money. Additionally, the use of the rhetorical question, \\"For some dough, sauce and cheese...really?\\" adds a sense of incredulity regarding the perceived prioritization of profit over quality. Moreover, the reviewer recounts their personal experience upon eating the pizza, further emphasizing their disappointment in the product. By stating that it \\"wasn't anything special,\\" the reviewer suggests that the product failed to meet their expectations, further solidifying the negative sentiment of the review. There is a sense of frustration apparent in the comment, as the reviewer expected a better outcome for the price they paid.

As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host.

It is essential to understand the various factors affecting the learning process and how these emotional responses play a role in how children perceive and interact with their environment. 1. Confusion: As young learners, children are often novices of the world around them, which can lead to confusion about various aspects of life. Their developing cognitive abilities may make it difficult for them to fully comprehend complex concepts. Furthermore, they have limited life experiences compared to adults, which influences their understanding and might lead to misunderstandings. 2. Anger: Learning about some of the harsh realities or unfairness of the world can be upsetting and infuriating for children. They may witness or experience inequality, injustice, or conflicts that rob them of their sense of safety and comfort. Coming to terms with these negative aspects may lead to feelings of anger and resentment, which can impact children's overall learning and development. 3. Sadness: Children may encounter loss, grief, or disappointment in various aspects of life, which could lead to feelings of sadness. Learning about harsh realities, such as incidents of racism, violence, or environmental destruction, may deeply affect their empathetic nature. Moreover, personal experiences of setbacks or failures can result in demotivation and sadness, affecting their enthusiasm and interest in learning. 4. Loss of innocence: As children learn about the various aspects of life, their exposure to some of the harsher realities can lead to a loss of innocence. It's an inevitable part of growth and development, but it can be challenging for young children who may initially have an optimistic and naïve worldview. They start to recognize the existence of negative and harmful aspects, leading to a more complex understanding of the world around them. 5. Frustration: The learning process is full of challenges, and these challenges can lead to feelings of frustration for children. Difficult subjects or concepts, interpersonal conflicts, personal shortcomings, and societal expectations can all contribute to frustration. Additionally, children with learning difficulties or special needs may experience increased frustration levels while trying to adapt to new situations or cope with their challenges. To better address these issues and support children's learning journey, it is vital that parents, educators, and other caregivers provide a nurturing and compassionate environment. This includes cultivating emotional intelligence, fostering a growth mindset, and providing appropriate guidance and support to help children navigate these challenges and emotions efficiently. Ultimately, helping children develop resilience and adaptability will empower them to learn from these experiences and turn them into opportunities for growth and development."},{"instruction":"Title: numbingly familiar Review: This book is numbing!

It is suggesting that the child ate only ice cream while in the kitchen. 3.

But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally. But I can use this background: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. What is an answer for this question: Where people are less at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland?","output":"Based on the provided background information, people in coastal areas are generally less at risk of mental retardation due to higher iodine levels naturally present in their food sources, like seaweed and saltwater fish. The soil in coastal regions also contains more iodized salt, contributing to a higher natural intake of iodine for the population living there. In contrast, those living in inland areas may face a higher risk of iodine deficiency as the soil has less naturally occurring iodized salt, which can lead to developmental difficulties, including thyroid gland function issues and mental retardation. However, the introduction of iodized table salt in the 1920s helped mitigate this problem by making it easier for people to increase their iodide intake, regardless of their location. Nowadays, with easy accessibility to iodized salt and a more globalized food transport system, people in both coastal and inland areas can obtain sufficient iodine in their diets if they consume iodine-rich products and iodized salt, thus reducing the overall risk of mental retardation due to iodine deficiency."},{"instruction":"* helle bach has worked as a freelance choreographer since 1999.

The first letter of the sentence, \\"H,\\" should be capitalized as it marks the beginning of the sentence. 2. The name \\"Helle Bach\\" must be capitalized, as proper nouns (names of specific people, places, or things) should always be capitalized. In this case, both \\"Helle\\" and \\"Bach\\" need to be capitalized as they form the full name of the person. 3. The other words in the sentence (\\"has worked as a freelance choreographer since\\") should remain in lowercase since they are all common nouns, verbs, conjunctions, or prepositions, none of which generally require capitalization in a sentence unless they appear at the beginning of a sentence or form part of a proper noun. 4.

Be as specific as possible and ask yourself if each part is really important to performing the required tasks. Hiring the right employees means hiring people who can do the job well, rather than hiring someone based on how they look, sound, or move. For example, while a person in a wheelchair might not be suitable for a position that requires active mobility, most positions would be suitable. Don't exclude someone until you are sure that they cannot perform the job to company standards. There needs to be a thorough understanding of the company’s culture and management style before defining the proper recruitment and evaluation process. This includes a definition of the employee’s style and goals. For example, a corporate culture that focuses on the bottom-line exclusively with an autocratic management style is looking for one kind of employee while a company that balances all stakeholders might prefer those who work comfortably in teams. Very often, the first exposure you have to a candidate will be their resume and other application materials. In order to make sure that you get the best candidate possible, you need to study and pay attention to the details of the candidate’s application materials. There are a number of things you can glean from their application. Look for typos, spelling mistakes, formatting issues, and more. These problems can be indicative of a lazy or unqualified candidate; however, don’t eliminate a candidate for a typo or two. Use this information to evaluate the candidate on the whole. Has the candidate put together a personalized application that is tailor fit to your company? Look for specific mentions of your company and anything that suggests the candidate has read up on your company. These may be evidence of a candidate who is very engaged and interested in the position. Has the candidate included all relevant information, such as dates of employment and dates of education? If they have not, they might be trying to gloss over something that could hurt their candidacy. Once you have the applicant's resume, look through it to figure out their level of education and/or training. This is particularly important for entry-level workers without much or any work experience. Make sure that their education or training is up to the standard required for the position. This may be a degree, grade point average, or professional certification. Once you've assessed their education, look for other indications of leadership, relevant activities outside of schoolwork, and awards that could otherwise speak to their character. If the applicant has relevant work experience, you should focus particular attention on the candidate’s job history. This is extremely important as it will provide you with a lot of information about their ability and commitment level. Note any special achievements or awards for exceeding sales goals or breaking company records. These are all signs that the prospective employee has high standards of performance and pushed him or herself to excel. Does the candidate move from position to position very often? This could suggest they don’t get along with their coworkers, or that they have a commitment issue. Has the candidate advanced in their career? If the candidate has moved up very quickly and has gained higher compensation and more responsibilities, this could be indicative of someone who is a go-getter and is top candidate material. Has the candidate had a lapse in employment or have they been out of the industry for an amount of time? There are many reasons why someone might have gaps in their resume. Make sure to get the full story before holding an employment or industry gap against them. A person with a disability, for instance, may have gaps in their employment history due to employer stereotypes, but this person may still be an excellent employee given the chance. One of the most important steps in finding the most qualified candidate is to contact their professional references. Once you contact professional references, you will be able to gather more information about the candidate’s abilities and commitment. References may be able to tell you about general disposition and whether the employee consistently pushed to succeed, as well as any issues caused in the workplace like harassment or violence. Make sure to call and talk to the reference in person for the best results. Make sure to compile a list of questions for the references before you contact them. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is: To hire the right employees, start by creating a list of necessary competencies, abilities, and characteristics specific to the role. Don't exclude candidates based on appearances or stereotypes, and consider company culture and management style when defining your recruitment process.

Assess candidates' education, training, work experience, and job history, paying attention to achievements, career growth, and employment gaps. Contact professional references to gather more insights into the candidates' abilities and work ethics.

In his wounded state, the suspect is captured, enclosed in a steel containment box, and taken directly to the VA experimental lab. If not Vlad, he surely is a vampire.With Dr Hirsch's death, new Delphi project director, William Bassett [Jack Donner], requests another physician to take Dr Hirsch's place. Dr Joseph \\"Joe\\" McKay [Garett Maggart] takes the call and so becomes private physician to Simon Molinar, vampire. Working only when the sun is directly overhead and transfusing Simon with donated blood, Joe removes the bullets from Simon's back (including one musketball from years previous) and performs a series of routine examinations.

A:","output":"In the movie, \\"Demon Under Glass,\\" the primary intention of the characters upon capturing the vampire, Simon Molinar, is to study and examine him in a controlled environment. Dr. Samuel Hirsch had been preparing for this opportunity, having already set up a sunproof containment box, retractable sun roof, and observation deck on the top floor of the V.A. Hospital in Los Angeles. Following Dr. Hirsch's death, Dr. Joseph \\"Joe\\" McKay takes his place and becomes the private physician to Simon Molinar. Dr. McKay performs a series of routine examinations on the vampire, such as removing bullets from his back, checking his blood pressure, and observing other physiological traits unique to vampires. It is evident that the characters have a great interest in understanding Simon's vampiric attributes and are attempting to learn more about the nature of vampires from a scientific and medical perspective. Throughout the movie, while the primary focus is on studying the vampire, the characters may also be seeking ways to ultimately neutralize or vanquish him to prevent any harm he might cause to humans. The efforts of Detective Gwen Taylor to capture \\"Vlad,\\" the murderer of LA prostitutes, indicate that there might be a desire to protect society from the dangers of vampires in the larger context of the story. In conclusion, the characters in \\"Demon Under Glass\\" intend to study and examine the captured vampire, Simon Molinar, to better understand the nature of vampires while possibly searching for ways to neutralize or defeat him in the interest of public safety."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Ratatouille Movie plot: The movie opens with a TV show featuring Chef Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett), owner of the best restaurant in Paris, talking about his bestselling cookbook, which proudly bears his mantra \\"Anyone Can Cook!\\"A rat named Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt) begins talking about his life in monologue fashion. Remy states that he has enhanced senses of both taste and smell, which makes him very particular about what he eats. Remy's brother Emile (Peter Sohn) is impressed by this talent, but their father Django (Brian Dennehy) who leads the rats' colony, could care less - until Remy reveals that he can recognize the scent of rat poison in or near food. Django puts Remy to work sniffing and testing food for the rest of the clan. Remy is not happy about the rats having to steal food from the garbage; he would prefer to go to the kitchen and take the \\"fresh\\" samples. But Django hates and fears humans so he forbids Remy (and all other members of the clan) to interact with them.Despite his father's orders, Remy spends several nights in a human home, reading Chef Gusteau's cookbook and watching television programs about cooking. Before long he has a near-expert level of knowledge about food preparation. One day, Remy takes Emile into the kitchen to get some spices that will go with some other food samples they have gathered. Emile hesitates, but agrees to go with his brother. While inside, Remy sees on TV that a famous food critic named Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), gave Gusteau's restaurant a less-than-stellar review that resulted in the restaurant losing one of its five stars. A heartbroken Gusteau died soon after, which meant the loss of another star according to tradition.While watching news of Gusteau's death, Remy accidentally wakes the elderly woman who lives in the home which the rats have colonized. Django orders everyone to get away as fast as possible but Remy stays behind to grab Gusteau's book. The rats manage to escape on miniature rafts into a river.

The escalated action aims to win extra cash for tasks that are dirty or involve outside work and heavy lifting. The janitors work for Cordia, a body of Glasgow City Council, which said it was working to ensure schools ran as normal but could not rule out some disruption. Unison has said that janitors are entitled to a Working Context and Demands Payment which ranges from about Â£500 to more than Â£1,000 annually. The union said that since members began boycotting certain duties in January, schools and playgrounds were not being cleaned as quickly and thoroughly as previously. A council spokeswoman said the dispute did not involve all janitors - just those primary school ones who are members of Unison. \\"The council will continue to work with Cordia to ensure that our schools and nurseries will be open for business as usual,\\" she said. \\"Our expectation is that all Breakfast Clubs will operate as normal during the five-day industrial action. \\"However, parents and carers need to be aware that this is subject to change at short notice depending of local arrangements and circumstances.\\" A spokesperson for Cordia Services LLP said: \\"Cordia has exhausted each of the stages of its formal grievance process with the janitorial staff who are participating in industrial action. \\"The organisation is working closely with Glasgow City Council Education Services to ensure there is minimal disruption at affected schools.\\"","output":"Some janitors are not happy with how much money they get for their jobs.

Mr. and Mrs. Boyden take their 3 children to a leisure park. They buy tickets for the whole family. The cost of an adult ticket is 6 more than the cost of a child ticket. The total cost of the 5 tickets is 77. What is the cost of an adult ticket?","output":"Step 1: Let's denote the cost of an adult ticket as \\"A\\" and the cost of a child ticket as \\"C\\". Step 2: According to the problem, the cost of an adult ticket is 6 more than the cost of a child ticket. So, we can write the equation: A = C + 6. Step 3: Mr. and Mrs. Boyden buy two adult tickets and three child tickets, which cost a total of 77. We can write this equation as: 2A + 3C = 77. Step 4: Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables: (1) A = C + 6 (2) 2A + 3C = 77 Step 5: To solve for the variables, we can use the substitution method. We can substitute equation (1) into equation (2): 2(C + 6) + 3C = 77. Step 6: Expand and simplify the equation: 2C + 12 + 3C = 77. Step 7: Combine the terms with the same variables: 5C + 12 = 77. Step 8: Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation: 5C = 65. Step 9: Divide both sides by 5 to find the cost of a child ticket: C = 13. Step 10: Now that we have the cost of a child ticket, we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find the cost of an adult ticket: A = 13 + 6. Step 11: Calculate the cost of an adult ticket: A = 19.

The sentence only conveys a scene where a mountain climber is present on a snowy plain near a mountaintop. However, it can be inferred that the climber might be taking a break, as they are in a plain area near the mountaintop, which could be an ideal spot for resting before resuming the climb. But without more context or information, it's not accurate to definitively conclude that the mountain climber is actually taking a break. There might be other reasons for the climber to be near the mountaintop, such as scouting or technical issues.

Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world. - The Habsburg Monarchy or Empire, occasionally also styled as the Danubian Monarchy (\\"Donaumonarchie\\"), is an unofficial appellation among historians for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the between 1521 and 1780 and then by the successor branch of Habsburg-Lorraine until 1918. The Monarchy was a composite state composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The dynastic capital was Vienna, except from 1583 to 1611, when it was moved to Prague. From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the Austrian Empire, and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. - The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. - Solomon Judah Löb HaKohen Rapoport ( June 1 , 1786 -- October 15 , 1867 ) ( Hebrew : ) , was a Galician rabbi and Jewish scholar . He was born in Lemberg , Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria . He married in 1810 Franziska Freide Heller , the daughter of the well - known Aryeh Leib Heller , and was instrumental in publishing the work Avnei Miluim of his father in law . He wrote both the index , sources and numerous comments . After various experiences in business , Rapoport became rabbi of Tarnopol ( 1837 ) and of Prague ( 1840 ) . He was one of the founders of the new Wissenschaft des Judentums movement . His chief work was the first part of an ( unfinished ) encyclopaedia ( Erekh Millin , 1852 ) . Equally notable were his biographies of Saadia Gaon , Nathan ( author of the Arukh ) , Hai Gaon , Eleazar Kalir and others . Thrown upon his own resources about 1817 , Rapoport became the collector of the meat - tax on farmers . He had already given evidence of marked critical ability , though his writings previously published were of a light character -- poems and translations . His critical talent , however , soon revealed itself . In 1824 he wrote an article for Bikkure ha - ' Ittim on the independent Jewish tribes of Arabia and Abyssinia . Though this article gained him some recognition , a more permanent impression was made by his work on Saadia Gaon and his times ( published in the same journal in 1829 ) , the first of a series of biographical works on the medieval Jewish sages . Because of this work he received recognition in the scholarly world and gained many enthusiastic friends , especially S. D. Luzzatto .

Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries. With Poland unable to effectively defend itself, and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers. - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. - The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, also known as Galicia or Austrian Poland, became a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as a result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772, when it became a Kingdom under Habsburg rule. From 1804 to 1918 it was a crownland of the Austrian Empire. After the reforms of 1867, it became an ethnic Pole-administered autonomous unit under the Austrian crown. The country was carved from the entire south-western part of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. Among the many ceremonial titles of the princes of Hungary was \\"ruler of Galicia and Lodomeria\\". - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south.

They fill their buckets at the spigot and carry them to the pool. Caleb can add 7 gallons from his bucket and Cynthia can add 8 gallons from her bucket each trip. It will take 105 gallons to fill the pool. How many trips will it take for Caleb and Cynthia to fill the pool with their buckets? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step. Step 1: Determine the total gallons added per trip Caleb can add 7 gallons, and Cynthia can add 8 gallons from their respective buckets in one trip. Adding these together gives the total gallons added per trip: 7 gallons (from Caleb) + 8 gallons (from Cynthia) = 15 gallons So, they can add a combined total of 15 gallons per trip. Step 2: Find how many full trips are needed To find out how many full trips are needed, divide the total gallons needed to fill the pool (105 gallons) by the combined gallons per trip (15 gallons): 105 gallons ÷ 15 gallons/trip = 7 trips It will take them 7 full trips to fill the 105-gallon pool with their buckets. Step 3: Check if there are any remaining gallons In this scenario, there are no remaining gallons because 105 gallons is an exact multiple of 15 gallons. So, no partial trips are needed.

Carved into the crystal is a symbol of a dead tree. Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn.

The objective is to isolate the variable g on one side of the equation. Step 1: Subtraction Subtract 19*g from both sides of the equation to eliminate g from one side. 22*g - 19*g = 19*g + 3 - 19*g This simplifies to: 3*g = 3 Step 2: Division Now, the equation is 3*g = 3. To isolate g, divide both sides of the equation by 3.

In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs. The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method. Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001.

The passage is not related to sports, business, or science/technology (Options 2, 3, and 4). Pim Fortuyn was a Dutch politician who gained prominence as a populist leader, critical of multiculturalism and immigration. He was assassinated in 2002, shortly before the general elections. His assassination highly affected Dutch society and led to public shock, with many saying the Netherlands had lost its innocence. Pim Fortuyn's murder marked the first political assassination in the country since the 17th century. This incident exposed underlying societal tensions regarding immigration and multiculturalism, which were actively debated during that period. Just two years later, filmmaker Theo van Gogh was violently murdered, on November 2nd, 2004. Van Gogh was known for his controversial views on various social and political issues, most notably, his critique of Islamic extremism. The brutal murder of van Gogh evoked a strong sense of déjà vu among the Dutch population, and served as a reminder of the ongoing cultural and political challenges faced by the nation following Fortuyn's assassination. Both these tragic events prompted discussions and debates on freedom of speech, immigration, national identity, and radical ideologies.

He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

Step 1: Identify key historical events related to US territorial expansion. There are several significant events that played a role in the US territorial expansion, including the Louisiana Purchase (1803), the Oregon Trail (1840s), and the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). Step 2: Determine which event directly led to the US acquiring the last piece of land needed for expansion. While all of these events contributed to the expansion of the United States, it was the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 that directly provided the United States with the last piece of land needed to reach the Pacific Ocean. Step 3: Provide context for the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed on February 2, 1848, and marked the end of the Mexican-American War. As a result of this agreement, Mexico ceded approximately 525,000 square miles of territory to the United States, which included modern-day California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and portions of Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, and Oklahoma.

Given these facts, what help prokaryotes to move among the following options: - organisms - tentacles - glucose - feet - Energy. - Energy - Mitosis - cilia Answer:","output":"Flagella are the primary structures that help prokaryotes move. Prokaryotes, such as bacteria and archaea, are single-celled organisms that lack a defined nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Among the given options, cilia and flagella are the most relevant structures aiding in the movement of microorganisms. However, the primary structure responsible for the movement of prokaryotes is flagella. Flagella are long, slender, whip-like structures that extend from the cell membrane of certain prokaryotic cells. They are made up of protein subunits called flagellin, which form helical chains that create a hair-like filament. This filament is anchored to the cell membrane by a basal body, which contains a motor protein that powers the rotation of the flagellum. The rotation of the flagellum propels the prokaryote through its environment, allowing it to navigate towards or away from specific stimuli, such as nutrients or toxins. Cilia, on the other hand, are shorter, hair-like structures more commonly found in eukaryotic cells, like those in the human respiratory system or on the surface of protozoans. While cilia can aid in the movement of some eukaryotic microorganisms, they are not found in prokaryotes. It's essential to understand that while flagella and cilia are the physical structures that help prokaryotes move, energy is also required for movement. The energy required for the movement of prokaryotes is usually derived from the metabolism of glucose or other sources of nutrients. Prokaryotes convert the chemical energy present in these nutrients into the mechanical energy needed to rotate the flagella. In summary, among the options given, flagella are the primary structures responsible for prokaryote movement. Cilia, while aiding the movement of some eukaryotic microorganisms, are not found in prokaryotes. Additionally, energy derived from the metabolism of glucose or other nutrients powers the movement of these microorganisms."},{"instruction":"many data thieves may not be so sophisticated after all , according to a study to be released wednesday .

Born on February 8, 1932, in New York City, Williams has cemented his name in the world of film music composition by creating some of the most recognizable and celebrated scores in the history of cinema. John Williams started working on the first Star Wars score in 1977 for the original film, which is now recognized as Episode IV - A New Hope. The film's director, George Lucas, approached Williams after being impressed by his previous work on films like Jaws and, particularly, his talent for creating dramatic and memorable musical themes. Together, they crafted one of the most iconic film scores in history, marked by Williams' powerful orchestral arrangements and stirring melodies. Throughout the years, John Williams has composed scores for all three movies in the original Star Wars trilogy, A New Hope (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983), as well as the prequel trilogy, The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of The Clones (2002), and Revenge of The Sith (2005). Later, he returned to work on the sequel trilogy, composing the scores for The Force Awakens (2015), The Last Jedi (2017), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Some of the most famous and beloved musical themes conceived by Williams for the Star Wars saga include the iconic \\"Star Wars Main Title Theme,\\" \\"The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme),\\" \\"Leia's Theme,\\" \\"The Force Theme (more commonly known as \\"Binary Sunset\\"), and \\"Duel of the Fates,\\" among many others. These memorable themes have become synonymous with the Star Wars universe and its epic storytelling, contributing immensely to the films' emotional impact and enduring legacy. In recognition of his stellar work, John Williams has received numerous awards and nominations for his Star Wars compositions. This includes five Academy Award nominations, four of which he won for Best Original Score (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and The Force Awakens). Additionally, Williams' Star Wars scores have achieved accolades in the form of Grammy Awards, BAFTAs, and Golden Globe nominations. Over a career spanning more than sixty years, John Williams has earned a distinctive place in the history of film music with his unforgettable Star Wars scores and many other contributions to renowned films such as Jaws, E.T.

Choices: - pull up covers - fall asleep - brush teeth - remove the covers - get laid The rationale to choose \\"pull up covers\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The rationale to choose \\"pull up covers\\" as the answer is as follows: 1. Assess the goal: The goal in this scenario is to go to bed with a pretty girl and to get warm. 2. Analyze the choices: We are given several choices and we need to determine which choice aligns with the goal. - Pull up covers: This choice implies getting under the covers, which would help in generating warmth by trapping body heat. - Fall asleep: Falling asleep doesn't directly contribute to getting warm or spending time with a pretty girl in bed. - Brush teeth: While important for dental hygiene, brushing teeth has no direct connection to achieving the desired goal of getting warm or sharing the bed with a pretty girl. - Remove the covers: This choice is counterproductive to the goal, as removing the covers would lead to a loss of heat retention, making it more difficult to get warm. - Get laid: Although this choice may imply intimacy, it doesn't necessarily have a direct impact on achieving warmth. Additionally, it depends on mutual consent and might not be appropriate or accurate considering the ambiguity of the question's phrasing. 3.

The controls for this train set allow him to make it go faster or slower and it even has a rail switch to make it travel on different tracks branching off to the left or right. Will making the train switch to a different track be considered acceleration, yes or no. Hint: Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well. Answer:","output":"Yes, making the train switch to a different track will be considered acceleration. When the train changes its direction due to the rail switch, it experiences a change in its velocity vector (since direction is a part of velocity). Even if the train maintains the same speed while switching tracks, the change in direction constitutes acceleration. Remember, acceleration takes into account both changes in speed and changes in direction of a moving object. In this case, the train undergoes acceleration even without a change in speed, solely due to the change in its direction of motion when it switches tracks."},{"instruction":"Review: soderbergh 's best films , \`\` erin brockovich , '' \`\` out of sight '' and \`\` ocean 's eleven , '' Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The provided movie review sentence can be interpreted as positive.

Options: - able to hear - very quiet - pay attention - shut up - hatred Reasoning process:","output":"To arrive at the answer to this question, let's analyze each option and relate it to the act of listening to someone. 1. Able to hear: To listen to someone, a basic prerequisite is having the ability to perceive sounds. The auditory sense (hearing) is essential for listening to what someone is saying. Therefore, being able to hear is directly connected to listening. 2. Very quiet: Being quiet might allow one to better listen to someone else, but it is not a skill specifically related to the act of listening. It's a behavior that can support listening but does not define the skill of listening. 3. Pay attention: Listening involves focusing on the speaker and consciously trying to understand their message. Paying attention is a key skill related to listening as it enables someone to process and comprehend the information being shared. 4. Shut up: While not speaking (or shutting up) when someone else is speaking can be a behavior that supports listening, it is not the skill of listening itself. It is merely a necessary condition to allow listening but does not encapsulate the whole process of listening. 5. Hatred: This is an emotion or feeling that has no direct connection to the act of listening. It does not define any skill related to listening to someone.

Options: - yes - no Chain-of-thought:","output":"The claim above states that Ahura Mazda revealed himself to Zarathustra as the one true god. Let's break down this claim step-by-step and examine it using human common sense: 1. Ahura Mazda is a deity from Zoroastrianism, an ancient Persian religion. 2. Zarathustra (also known as Zoroaster) is the founder of Zoroastrianism and is believed to have received revelations from Ahura Mazda. Now, we will consider whether the claim can be verified by human common sense and without a web search: 1. Religious beliefs and spiritual experiences are subjective and vary from person to person. What one individual may claim to be a divine revelation could be viewed differently by another person. 2. While the claim might be accepted as a matter of faith by followers of Zoroastrianism, it may not hold true for individuals from other religious backgrounds or those who are non-religious. 3. Human common sense alone cannot verify the claim because it relies on personal beliefs, interpretation of religious texts, and historical accounts. A definitive answer about the validity of the claim would require research, investigation, and conversation with experts in the field of religious studies. Based on this chain-of-thought analysis, the answer to the question is: - no (the claim cannot be verified by human common sense and without a web search)"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Questions: The elementary-age child was asked to describe a ball, what word did he likely use for it? Options: - rubber - circular - spherical - round - rolling down street Answer:","output":"The elementary-age child most likely described the ball as \\"round.\\" This option is in line with common sense because the concept of \\"round\\" is simpler and more relatable to young children as compared to the other choices provided. Children at that age usually have a basic understanding of shapes and can easily recognize that a ball is round. They may not yet have learned or fully grasped the more advanced terms like \\"circular\\" and \\"spherical.\\" Additionally, their language skills and vocabulary may not yet be advanced enough to use or differentiate between these terms. - The option \\"rubber\\" does not necessarily describe the shape or appearance of the ball. It mainly refers to the material that the ball could be composed of, and the child may not necessarily know or mention the material when describing the ball's appearance. - The option \\"circular\\" is a more precise term to describe a flat, two-dimensional shape like a circle, rather than a three-dimensional object like a ball. Furthermore, young children might not have learned this term yet or may not use it instead of \\"round\\" which is more commonly used among them. - The option \\"spherical\\" is an accurate description of the ball's shape. However, this term is more advanced and might not be a part of an elementary-age child's vocabulary or understanding. - Finally, the option \\"rolling down the street\\" is more of an action or a situation involving the ball rather than a description of the ball itself. Given these reasons, \\"round\\" is the most common sense answer as it is a simple and accurate description that an elementary-age child would likely use in explaining the appearance of a ball."},{"instruction":"Potrivit rapoartelor de anul trecut, CCR, care are judecători şi procurori internaţionali, urma să se concentreze asupra cazurilor delicate din punct de vedere politic, lăsând majoritatea proceselor în seama instanţelor inferioare.

Many are also equipped to carry out anti-submarine, anti-air, and anti-surface operations. The NATO standard designation for these vessels is DDG. Nations vary in their use of destroyer D designation in their hull pennant numbering, either prefixing, or dropping it altogether. The U.S. Navy has adopted the classification DDG in the American hull classification system. - The 18 Forrest Sherman - class destroyers were the first US post-war destroyers ( DD - 927 to DD - 930 were completed as destroyer leaders ) . Commissioned beginning in 1953 , these ships served until the late 1980s . Their weaponry underwent considerable modification during their years of service . Four were converted to guided missile destroyers . This class also served as the basis for the Charles F. Adams - class guided missile destroyer . Three ships of the class have become museum ships , nine have been sunk in training exercises , and the others have been scrapped or are scheduled to be scrapped . - The Russo-Japanese War (8 February 1904 5 September 1905) was fought between the Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea. The major theatres of operations were the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden in Southern Manchuria and the seas around Korea, Japan and the Yellow Sea. - In naval terminology, a destroyer is a fast, maneuverable long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against smaller powerful short-range attackers. They were originally developed in the late 19th century as a defence against torpedo boats, and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, these \\"torpedo boat destroyers\\" (TBD) were \\"large, swift, and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats.\\" Although the term \\"destroyer\\" had been used interchangeably with \\"TBD\\" and \\"torpedo boat destroyer\\" by navies since 1892, the term \\"torpedo boat destroyer\\" had been generally shortened to simply \\"destroyer\\" by nearly all navies by the First World War. - Destroyer Leader (DL) was the United States Navy designation for large destroyers from 9 February 1951 through the early years of the cold war. United States ships with hull classification symbol DL were officially frigates from 1 January 1955 until 1975. The smaller destroyer leaders were reclassified as destroyers and the larger as cruisers by the United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification; so destroyer escorts could be reclassified as frigates (FF) in conformance with international usage of the term. Background. By the end of World War I the destroyers intended to screen formations of battleships had evolved to a displacement of approximately 1100 tons armed with four guns and six or more torpedoes. Italy had built three \\"esploratori\\" (scout cruisers) approximately 70% larger than contemporary destroyers. The Washington Naval Treaty encouraged United Kingdom satisfaction with its traditional fleet of s and United States contentment with similar and s, while the signatories with smaller fleets explored alternative warship configurations between the classical definitions of destroyer and cruiser. Italy launched three more \\"esploratori\\" and France responded with six \\"Chacal\\"-class \\"contre-torpilleur\\" super destroyers. Japan launched the minimum light cruiser followed by the \\"Fubuki\\"-class special type destroyers with endurance to escort the \\"Kido Butai\\" mobile force of aircraft carriers over the wide reaches of the Pacific. - In the Royal Navy and other navies of Europe and the Commonwealth of Nations, ships are identified by pennant number (an internationalisation of \\"pendant number\\", which it was called before 1948). Historically, naval ships flew a flag that identified a flotilla or type of vessel. For example, the Royal Navy used a red burgee for torpedo boats and a pennant with an H for torpedo boat destroyers. Adding a number to the type-identifying flag uniquely identified each ship.

Answer:","output":"The Forrest Sherman-class destroyers have the relation 'operator' with the United States Navy."},{"instruction":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Victoria Wood, (19 May 1953 - 20 April 2016) was an English comedian, actress, singer and songwriter, screenwriter, producer and director. Wood wrote and starred in dozens of sketches, plays, musicals, films and sitcoms over several decades, and her live comedy act was interspersed with her own compositions, which she performed on the piano. Much of her humour was grounded in everyday life and included references to quintessentially \\"British\\" activities, attitudes and products. She was noted for her skills in observing culture and in satirising social classes. Victoria Wood was the youngest child of Stanley Wood, an insurance salesman, who also wrote songs for his company's Christmas parties, and Nellie Wood (nee Mape). She had three siblings: a brother, Chris, and two sisters, Penny and Rosalind. Wood was born in Prestwich and brought up in Bury - both then in Lancashire. She was educated at Fairfield County Primary school and Bury Grammar School for Girls, where she immediately found herself out of her depth. She recalled in an interview for Desert Island Discs in 2007: I was always top of the class, and when I went to grammar school I could not deal with everyone being as clever... I went under. I was a mess, a bit of a misfit. I didn't have any friends, let alone try to be funny...I didn't do any work, didn't have clean clothes and didn't wash. If I didn't have any money I'd steal from people, and if I hadn't done my homework I'd steal someone else's. I was envious of all the groups: the horsey group, the girls who went out with boys, the clever ones. Looking back, I feel really sorry for that little girl. Wood developed eating disorders, but in 1968, her father gave her a piano for her 15th birthday. She later said of this unhappy time \\"The good thing about being isolated is you get a good look at what goes on. I was reading, writing and working at the piano all the time. I was doing a lot of other things that helped me to perform\\". Later that year she joined the Rochdale Youth Theatre Workshop, where she felt she was \\"in the right place and knew what I was doing\\" and she made an impression with her comic skill and skill in writing. She went on to study drama at the University of Birmingham. How did things go for her at the University of Birmingham?","output":"Victoria Wood went on to study drama at the University of Birmingham after joining the Rochdale Youth Theatre Workshop.

What is the main source of energy for the water cycle?","output":"To answer this question, I must first identify the water cycle and its components, and then determine the energy source that drives it. Step 1: Identify the water cycle and its components The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is the continuous process of water moving from Earth's surface to the atmosphere and back. It consists of several processes, including evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. Step 2: Determine the energy source that drives the water cycle The primary source of energy responsible for driving the water cycle is solar energy (sunlight). Solar energy heats the Earth's surface and causes water from oceans, rivers, and lakes to evaporate and rise into the atmosphere. Transpiration, which is the release of water vapor by plants, also contributes to the water cycle, and this process too is driven by solar energy.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Richard Gaddis is a small-time crook with a penchant for con games. To hook marks, he acts like a well-to-do businessman, dressing like one and driving a Mercedes-Benz S500, believing that one must look like a professional in order to be a successful conman. Gaddis is searching for a new partner with whom he can perform more sophisticated cons. He discovers Rodrigo after he sees the young man playing some minor con games in a casino-bar. When Rodrigo is caught, Gaddis acts the part of a vice officer to save him from being arrested. Rodrigo's contribution is a face and naive manner so trustable that he is able to con anyone, while Richard is both completely unprincipled and clever. After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees. Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts.

In this statement, the Brent crude oil price is the topic of discussion. Brent Crude is a major trading classification of sweet light crude oil that serves as one of the primary benchmarks for global oil prices. It is extracted from the North Sea and is used as a reference point for the pricing of around two-thirds of the world's internationally traded crude oils. The crisis mentioned here could be any significant economic, financial, political, or environmental event that had a detrimental impact on the global oil market, leading to a sustained drop in oil prices. For instance, it could refer to the 2008 global financial crisis, the 2014 collapse in oil prices, or the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, each of which resulted in significant declines in oil prices. The text highlights that the price of Brent crude oil has fallen throughout the crisis, signaling an ongoing or persistent decline in the commodity's value. There are several reasons why oil prices may fall during a crisis. Often, a decrease in demand caused by a contraction in global economic growth leads to a suppression of oil prices, with reduced industrial production and transportation activities lowering the overall consumption of oil. Additionally, crises can disrupt supply chains and production activities, leading to uncertainty and price volatility. Moreover, the statement emphasizes that the Brent crude oil price remains below the vital 110 mark. This indicates that the current oil price is considered low compared to historical or expected values, which could have significant implications for the global energy industry and economy. When oil prices are low, producers may scale back or suspend production activities, resulting in potential layoffs, reduced investments, and potential consolidation within the industry. Furthermore, maintaining oil prices below the 110 mark can have policy implications for oil-producing countries. Many countries rely heavily on oil revenues to support their budgets and national economies, making a sustained period of low oil prices detrimental to their fiscal stability. These countries may be forced to implement austerity measures, reduce domestic expenditures, and seek alternative sources of revenue, such as taxes or tariffs, to counter the decline in oil income. In conclusion, the statement refers to a situation where the Brent crude oil price fell throughout a specific crisis, leading to a prolonged period of decline that has resulted in the value remaining below the critical 110 mark. The decrease in oil prices may have been caused by several factors, such as reduced demand, disrupted supply chains, or market uncertainty, and it can have far-reaching consequences for the global energy industry, economies, and policy decisions of oil-producing nations."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a context, a question, three options, and an answer.

The first film was released in the UK as an October half-term frolic but went on to play for three months, while the 2013 sequel, which was accorded a more prestigious June release, ran for six. In terms of looks and brains, the films had nothing on Pixar, but they shared two magic ingredients that helped make them endurable hits. One was a chart-friendly soul number from Pharrell Williams on the soundtrack (Happy, the theme from Despicable Me 2, went on to become the most-downloaded song in British chart history). And the other was the Minions: a horde of linguistically impaired, marzipan-coloured cylinder people in the service of the films’ nefarious anti-hero Gru, who provided a steady stream of slapstick relief. The appearance of a Minions-only spin-off film in the gap between the second and impending third Despicable Mes, therefore, makes perfect business sense: in fact, Penguins of Madagascar pulled a similar stunt only last December, with mostly successful results. But what’s surprising about Minions is that it squanders these yellow oddballs’ new-found freedom: in fact, it yokes them to a permanent supervillain gig almost as soon as it possibly can, as if directors Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin and screenwriter Brian Lynch were terrified of skittering too far off-piste. Before it cops out, though, the film’s a delight. It opens with a hand-drawn prologue, in which we see the Minions evolving from a shoal of plankton-like parasites. As they scramble up the food-chain – in the wakes of progressively bigger and nastier boss fish, naturally – they finally bob to the ocean’s surface and, like a self-inflating life-raft, the film suddenly plumps out into rubbery CGI. Then follows a string of miniature skits, in which the small yellow types serve various historical brutes, from Tyrannosaurus Rex to the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. Frustratingly, what seems like the set-up for an internship with Richard Nixon (the Minions bob into New York Harbor in 1968, under a grinning poster of the US president) comes to nothing. Instead, three Minion emissaries, called Kevin, Bob and Stuart, make for a villain convention in Florida, where they throw in their lot with Scarlett Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock), a rising star on the bad-guy circuit. (Jon Hamm gives what will surely be the most negligible voice performance of the year as Herb, her husband-slash-kit man.) And it’s here the film’s spark is snuffed out for good: the focus shifts to Scarlett’s convoluted plan to overthrow the Queen of England, and the film becomes a fourth-rate Despicable Me clone. You sense a shuddering apprehension in every creative choice – as if one false move, or even an overly brazen one, would destabilise the formula. The Sixties setting, for instance, seems to have been chosen largely so the plot can dovetail with what we should probably now call The Despicable Me Expanded Universe, rather than for its unique look or specific comic potential. Most of the film could be taking place anywhere, and the period detail doesn’t extend much further than hippies, teapots and songs by Donovan and The Kinks – real souvenir-shop stuff. In the same way, there’s no attempt to give the Minions material that might better play to their preverbal, indestructible strengths. Had Balda and Coffin drawn inspiration from silent comedy – as Aardman Animations did for their intricately funny Shaun the Sheep movie – you suspect the film might have been better equipped to sustain the energy of those giddy early minutes. But instead, it soon becomes one barely choreographed, weightless action sequence flailing into the next. On paper, Minions adds up: as, no doubt, will its box-office takings. But making films for a young audience isn’t – or at least shouldn’t be – the same thing as maths. Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Minions Movie: A Fun Adventure with Our Favorite Yellow Helpers\\""},{"instruction":"they may have good deals and sometimes but their customer service sucks they could use all new employees as far as cashiers. because of them I only go there when I absolutely have to Choose the sentiment of this review?

Article: Recently, some concerns have been raised about the health of the world's banana plants. Many media reports have said that bananas may completely disappear in the coming ten years. Bananas are one of the world's most important food crops. They are also the fourth most valuable export. Bananas do not grow from seeds. Instead, they grow from existing plants. Bananas are threatened by disease because all the plants on a farm are copies of each other. They all share the same genetic weaknesses. For example, the Cavendish banana is most popular in American markets. It is an important export crop. However, some kinds of fungus organisms easily infect the Cavendish. Black Sigatoka disease affects the leaves of Cavendish banana plants. The disease is controlled on large farms by putting chemicals on the plant's leaves. Farmers put anti-fungal chemicals on their crops up to once a week. Another fungal disease is more serious. Panama disease attacks the roots of the banana plant. There is no chemical treatment for this disease. Infected plants must be destroyed. Panama disease has affected crops in Southeast Asia, Australia and South Africa. There is concern that it may spread to bananas grown in the Americas. This could threaten an important export product for Central and South America. The International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain, whose headquarter lies in France, supports research on bananas. The group says that more research must be done to develop improved kinds of bananas. The group says that fungal diseases mainly affect only one kind of banana. In fact, there are five-hundred different kinds of bananas. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says the Cavendish banana represents only ten percent of world production. The UN agency says farmers should grow different kinds of bananas. This protects against diseases that affect only one kind. Experts warn that disease may cause the Cavendish banana to disappear. This has already happened to one popular banana because of its... Question: Bananas are threatened by diseases because _ . Options: A: they have genetic weaknesses against disease.

The comments made at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing reflected growing frustration in Congress about the U.S.-led war, which is entering its 17th year. ​As recently as November, General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, acknowledged that the conflict remained a stalemate. Since then, a wave of high-profile insurgent attacks have rocked the capital, Kabul. The Taliban now controls or contests almost half the country, according to latest U.S. estimates. Despite the setbacks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who is helping oversee the new White House strategy, gave a positive assessment of the conflict. \\"The president's South Asia strategy is showing some signs of progress,\\" Sullivan said. \\"On the battlefield, we are seeing the Taliban's momentum begin to slow.\\" But lawmakers from both parties expressed skepticism. \\"Something is clearly not working,\\" said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and longtime Afghan war critic. \\"By any standard, the current security situation is grim.\\" Some lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump, who last week said he didn't want to talk with the Taliban — a statement that seemingly contradicted his own strategy. After Sullivan and a top Pentagon official told the lawmakers that the U.S. was in fact still open to negotiations with the Taliban, lawmakers pressed for more details. \\"You can see that the world and those involved in the peace process may be pretty confused about what the U.S. position is. What is it?\\" asked Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. Sullivan said he thought Trump was expressing a reaction to last month's terrorist attacks, and was pointing out that \\"significant elements of the Taliban are not prepared to negotiate.\\" \\"And it may take a long time before they are willing to negotiate,\\" he added.

It was one of the boldest abductions of foreign workers in years. The abductions were meant to avenge France ’s armed intervention in neighboring Mali, Mr. Oublaïd said, a conflict that has escalated since French warplanes began striking Islamist fighters who have carved out a vast haven there. On Thursday, the United States became more deeply involved in the war, working with the French to determine how to best deploy American C-5 cargo planes to ferry French troops and equipment into Mali, according to an American military official. The United States has long been wary about stepping more directly into the Mali conflict, worried that it could provoke precisely the kind of anti-Western attack that took place in Algeria, with deadly consequences. After the raid to free the hostages, the Algerians acknowledged a price had been paid. Photo “The operation resulted in the neutralization of a large number of terrorists and the liberation of a considerable number of hostages,” said Mr. Oublaïd, the communications minister. “Unfortunately, we deplore also the death of some, as well as some who were wounded.” Algerian national radio described a scene of pandemonium and high alert at the public hospital in the town of In Amenas, where wounded and escaped hostages were sent. The director of the hospital, Dr. Shahir Moneir, said in the report that wounded foreign hostages were transferred to the capital, Algiers. In a telephone interview from the hospital, one of the Algerians who had been held captive, who identified himself as Mohamed Elias, said some of the hostages had exploited the chaos created by the Algerian assault to flee. “We used the opportunity,” he said, “and we just escaped.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Senior American military officials said that aides traveling in London with Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta were struggling to get basic information about the raid, and that an unarmed American Predator drone was monitoring the gas-field site. One senior official said that possibly seven to eight Americans were among the hostages — the first official indication of the number of Americans involved — and that he did not know if any had been killed in the raid. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said his office had not been told ahead of time, an implicit criticism of the Algerian government. A spokesman said that Mr. Cameron had learned of the raid through Britain’s own intelligence sources and that “the Algerians are aware that we would have preferred to have been consulted in advance.” Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The gravity of the crisis prompted him to cancel plans to deliver a major speech in Amsterdam . Japan also expressed strong concern, saying Algeria had failed not only to advise of the operation ahead of time, but to heed its request to halt the operation because it was endangering the hostages. “We asked Algeria to put human lives first and asked Algeria to strictly refrain,” the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, quoted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as telling his Algerian counterpart, Abdelmalek Sellal, by telephone late Thursday. The situation is “very confused,” President François Hollande of France said at a news conference in Paris and was “evolving hour by hour.” Mr. Hollande gave the first official confirmation that French citizens were among the captives. Photo A European diplomat who was involved in the effort to coordinate a Western response to the hostage seizure said that the information available to the United States, France and Britain had been “confusing at best, and sometimes contradictory.” Several Western officials complained that the Algerians appeared to have taken none of the usual care exercised to minimize casualties when trying to free hostages. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “They care deeply about their sovereign rights,” said the European diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s delicacy. Even before reports of the Algerian military’s raid began to emerge, many hostages — Algerian and foreign — were reported to have escaped as the kidnappers failed to persuade the Algerian authorities to give them safe passage with their captives. The Algerian news site T.S.A. quoted a local official, Sidi Knaoui, as saying that 10 foreigners and 40 Algerians had managed to flee after the kidnappers made several attempts to leave with the hostages. Ireland confirmed that an Irish citizen, Stephen McFaul, had escaped. The man had contacted his family and was “understood to be safe and well and no longer a hostage,” Irish officials said. Earlier, a French TV station, France 24, quoted an unidentified hostage as saying the attackers “threatened to blow up the gas field.” Algeria’s interior minister, Daho Ould Kablia, said the seizure of the gas field had been overseen by Mokhtar Belmokhtar, an Algerian who fought in Afghanistan in the 1980s and had reportedly established his own group in the Sahara after falling out with other Qaeda leaders. The description of the leader was one of the most specific pieces of information given by the Algerians on a day of vague and contradictory accounts of the abduction and raid. Well into the night, officials warned that hostages were still being held inside the compound and that the crisis remained unresolved. “It’s a painful situation. It’s not over,” said a senior Algerian official. “I can’t tell you how many are left in there. No numbers. None at all. Nothing is certain.” ||||| Thirty-four hostages and 15 kidnappers have been killed in eastern Algeria after the military launched a rescue attempt, according to the group holding the hostages. Thursday's reported deaths came a day after dozens of foreigners and Algerians were taken hostage by heavily armed fighters near the In Amenas gas field. The fighters said they seized the hostages in retaliation for Algeria letting France use its airspace to launch operations against rebels in northern Mali , but security experts said the raid appeared to have been planned well in advance. Algeria's Communication Minister Mohamed Said confirmed that hostages had been killed or wounded in an ongoing army assault. \\"The operation is ongoing,\\" he said, speaking on national television in the first official comment on the rescue operation. The minister said \\"several people\\" were killed or wounded, adding that an \\"important number\\" of hostages were freed. The spokesman for the Masked Brigade, which had claimed responsibility for the abductions on Wednesday, told Mauritanian ANI news agency that the deaths were a result of a government helicopter attack on a convoy transporting hostages and kidnappers. The official Algerian APS news agency said nearly 600 Algerian workers and four foreign hostages - two Britons, a Frenchman and a Kenyan - had been freed during the operation. The Irish foreign ministry said an Irish man had also been freed. Refusal to negotiate The Masked Brigade spokesman said Abou el-Baraa, the leader of the kidnappers, was among those killed in the helicopter attack. He said the fighters would kill the rest of their captives if the army approached. Algeria has refused to negotiate with what it says is a band of about 20 fighters. Youcef Bouandel, professor of International Affairs, talks to Al Jazeera about the crisis Algerian Interior Minister Daho Ould dismissed theories that the fighters had come from Libya, 100km away, or from Mali, more than 1,000km away. He said the well-armed gunmen were from Algeria itself, operating under orders from Moktar Belmoktar, al-Qaeda's strongman in the Sahara. ANI, which has been in constant contact with the al-Qaeda-affiliated kidnappers, said seven hostages were still being held: two Americans, three Belgians, one Japanese and one British citizen. Norwegians, French, Romanian and Malaysian citizens were also among those taken hostage. The White House said it believed Americans were among the hostages and was concerned about reports of loss of life. \\"This is an ongoing situation and we are seeking clarity,\\" spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. Japanese critical Japan's Vice Foreign Minister Minoru Kiuchi, who is now in Algeria, urged the Algerian government to put an \\"immediate end\\" to the military operation. Britain was not given prior notice of the Algerian government operation to release hostages and would have preferred to have been informed, Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman said. A Briton was among two people killed on Wednesday, after fighters launched an ambush of a bus carrying employees from the gas plant to the nearby airport. The In Amenas gas field is jointly operated by British oil giant BP, Norway's Statoil and Algeria's Sonatrach. France launched a major offensive against the rebel group Ansar al-Dine in Mali on January 11 to prevent them from advancing on the capital, Bamako. Algeria had long warned against military intervention against the rebels, fearing the violence could spill over the border. Al Jazeera's Paul Brennan, following the hostage situation from London, said Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has allied himself with the West in the fight against al-Qaeda. \\"As recently as last year it seemed that he was turning the last stronghold of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the mountains up in the north where the Berber people are natives, against those Arabs that have been coming in from outside,\\" he said. \\"The Algerian authorities have been enjoying significant successes in targeting al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb leaders.\\" ||||| The attack on the Algerian gas field has raised fears of the conflict in Mali becoming an international battle bleeding across the porous borders of the Sahel and Sahara region. It also presents a major challenge to the military-dominated regime in Algiers – still in the shadow of a decade of bloody civil war – which had been accused of having an ambiguous stance towards the Mali crisis. Algeria will now firmly be dragged into resolving the Mali conflict, while also dealing with the return of major action by Islamist groups on its home turf. The hostage-taking has spelled out the complexities of the unrest in the Sahel: a tangled mix of communal tensions, economic struggle, desertification, poverty, criminality, kidnapping and smuggling, which shifts seamlessly across borders. With six days of French airstrikes failing to erode the Islamist gains in Mali, French special forces prepared to launch a land assault on Wednesday around Diabaly, 250 miles (450 km) from the capital. France's aim is to secure the vast desert area seized last year by an Islamist alliance, which combines al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) – the terrorist network's north African wing – with Mali's homegrown Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (Mojwa) and Ansar Dine rebel groups. But the Algerian hostage drama at the BP oilfield far away to the north at the Algerian-Libyan border marks a turning point and a widening of the game. Attacks on oil-rich Algeria's hydrocarbon facilities are very rare, despite the country's decades of fighting an Islamist insurgency, mostly in the north. Jon Marks, associate fellow at Chatham House, London's leading foreign affairs thinktank, said: \\"The attack is remarkable for a number of reasons. \\"If you look at Algeria's conflict of the 1990s, out of which AQIM sprang, the major oil and gas fields of the deep south, a strategic interest to Europe, were not attacked. Even in Algeria's bloody history, this is the first time there has been major attack on a hydrocarbon facility. \\"It shows the degree to which the events in Mali are an international Sahel and Sahara-wide issue. These groups are international: including Malians, people who came from the Libya conflict, but also from Algeria and Mauritania.\\" He said the attack showed how deep-rooted those groups were. \\"The groups we are now calling AQIM, that the French military are targeting, have roots going back decades in the region. They have been involved in cigarette smuggling, electronic goods smuggling, guns, drugs, a lot of criminality.\\" He described it as a potent \\"interface\\" where criminality meets politics in an area that is \\"more and more desperate\\". Algeria, the region's economic and military powerhouse where the regime of generals holds firm despite the Arab spring elsewhere, had been a major opponent of foreign armed intervention in Mali, preferring negotiations. Until now, it fiercely clung to its policy of non-intervention in its neighbours. But has now opened its airspace to the French air force, a historic event, and vowed to secure its vast desert border with Mali, an undertaking commentators say is almost impossible in the poorly patrolled desert wastes. Although an ally of the US and France in fighting terrorism for years, Algeria has been accused by some of playing a double game in the Sahel where Islamist groups have flourished since the country's bloody war of independence. The regime's involvement in Mali and the Sahel will now become more of a focus, as the conflict looks likely to be drawn out. A poll on Wednesday found 64% of French people felt the Mali intervention would increase the risk of a terrorist attack on French soil, and armed patrols were in force at potential targets such as the Eiffel Tower. France had been acutely aware that hostage-taking in the Sahel would be the key immediate risk of its sudden Mali intervention. Unlike Algerian terrorist operations in the 1990s, AQIM has never struck on French soil. But the militant groups that seized control of northern Mali last year had targeted foreigners for years on their own turf. They already hold seven French hostages as well as four Algerian diplomats, seized several years ago. AQIM has made tens of millions of dollars from kidnapping Algerian businessmen or political figures for ransom, as well as foreigners. On the same day that France launched its sudden Mali intervention last week, it staged a rescue attempt of a French intelligence agent held for more than three years by rebels in Somalia, and referred by the fake name of Denis Allex. If the French rescue mission to save Allex was destined to deliver a warning against hostage-taking and head off reprisals against French hostages, the operation went spectacularly wrong. Two French soldiers died and the hostage was presumed to have been killed by his jailers during the failed assault. The French president, François Hollande, was at pains once again on Wednesday to say France had \\"no interest\\" in Mali and was just \\"serving peace\\". Hollande emphasised his promise to break with murky post-colonial relations of the past. Mali is small beer within the wider context of French economic interests in west Africa, but Mali's neighbours are a different matter. Niger's uranium services one third of the French nuclear power stations which produce most of the country's electricity. It was in Niger that workers for French nuclear firm Areva were kidnapped in 2010, four are still held in the Sahel. Algeria – Africa's biggest country and France's biggest African economic partner – is a major exporter of oil and gas to Europe. The oil field hostage-taking shows the wider global interests that could now come into play. ||||| Story highlights U.S. military plans to fly French troops to nations near Mali, an official says France has been helping Mali's government battle Islamist militants from its north Several other nations have vowed support for Mali French airstrikes have recently struck near the central town of Diabaly French warplanes pounded Islamist militant targets in Mali Thursday as international efforts to help the African nation's government fight insurgents gained momentum. For a fourth consecutive day, airstrikes hit in and around Diabaly -- a town in central Mali, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of the capital of Bamako -- prompting men, women and children to flee or find cover, witnesses said. \\"People are desperate to get out,\\" said Ibrahim Toure, a civilian who left Diabaly on Thursday. French fighter jets targeted the town since Monday, after Islamist rebels settled in a military camp on its outskirts that had been abandoned by Malian soldiers. The Islamists told Diabaly's residents they could stay, and they prevented some from leaving, said Cheick Oumar, a construction worker in the town.

There, they imposed a strict interpretation of Sharia law by banning music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also damaged Timbuktu's historic tombs and shrines. The International Criminal Court has launched a war-crimes investigation amid reports that residents have been mutilated and killed for disobeying the Islamists. The United Nations has noted accounts of amputations, floggings and public executions such as the July stoning of a couple who had reportedly had an affair. As the rebels moved southward toward Bamako, such reports prompted an international response, led by the French. In addition to sending its warplanes, the French have stationed about 1,400 troops inside Mali in \\"Operation Serval.\\" Europe's largest powers appeared united in their goal of removing al Qaeda-linked militants from the West African nation, where Islamist rebels are fighting to form their own territory in the north. This effort gained renewed urgency after militants -- upset at Algeria for allowing warplanes to use its airspace to launch attacks in Mali -- took hostage scores of Algerian and foreign workers at an Algerian gas facility about 60 kilometers (about 40 miles) west of the Libyan border. Nations including Germany, Belgium and Canada have pledged to contribute transport planes. Others, such as Italy, are promising \\"logistical support\\" for the operation. The United States is supporting the French-led effort in Mali \\"with intelligence and airlift,\\" said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The plan is for U.S. military aircraft, accompanied by U.S. military security forces, to fly French troops and equipment into a neighboring country -- because the airport in Bamako is \\"very busy\\" -- after which they can move on the ground, a U.S. defense official said. Washington has not decided whether to grant French requests for surveillance and aerial refueling services, the official said. By this weekend, U.S. trainers will be in Africa \\"to offer pre-deployment training and sustainment packages\\" for troops from African nations who are heading to Mali. In response to a request for help from Malian authorities, European Union foreign ministers agreed Thursday on a mission to train Mali's army, the EU said. The mission is to include instructors, support staff and force protection for 15 months, it added. The agency has said about 450 non-combat troops will be launched, perhaps by next month. French President Francois Hollande has said it was a \\"necessary decision\\" to enter the country. \\"There are terrorist networks which, following what happened in Libya last year, have installed themselves in a large part of West Africa and are trying to destabilize the area and are involved in trafficking,\\" he said Thursday. \\"Our duty is to put an end to this, and France assumes its responsibility.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The conflict in Mali became an international issue when a militant group attacked a gas-field compound in Algeria in retaliation for France allowing its airspace to be used for operations against Islamist rebels in Mali.

Understanding \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" (DADT): DADT is a policy that originated in the United States military in 1994. It prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing closeted homosexual or bisexual service members while barring openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons from military service.

Now that we have understood the two components, let's see if there's any connection: There is no connection between the DADT military policy and inventory accounting. The DADT policy was specifically related to issues surrounding sexuality in the military, whereas inventory accounting is a financial practice used in businesses to manage and value inventory.

They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains. Now, I have a new situation: A scientist has just returned to the lab after working out in the field. While in the field, she collected two flowers to examine in detail.

Be prepared for the dog to be sick. Place your dog in a spot in the car where it can see out. Consult with your vet about whether your dog needs medication to prevent nausea. Consider alternative treatments.\\" Article:","output":"Title: A Guide to Preventing and Managing Your Dog's Motion Sickness Introduction If you've ever traveled with a pet, you've probably realized that some dogs have an affinity for the open road, while others are more hesitant to ride along. A crucial factor in the latter scenario may be motion sickness, which affects canines much the same way it affects humans. While dogs can't verbalize their discomfort, they may exhibit definitive signs of motion sickness that, as a pet owner, you should be aware of. In this article, we will discuss how to assess your dog for motion sickness, how to prepare for car rides, and various ways to help your furry companion feel better while in motion. 1. How to Assess if your Dog has Motion Sickness A dog with motion sickness may exhibit one or more of the following symptoms: - Excessive drooling - Frequent yawning or panting - Whining and pacing - Lethargy or an unwillingness to move - Vomiting - In extreme cases, diarrhea or loose stools Not all dogs with motion sickness will show these symptoms, but if your pup has exhibited any of them during previous car rides, it's crucial to take the necessary precautions before hitting the road. 2. Be Prepared for the Dog to Be Sick If you suspect that your dog may experience motion sickness, be prepared. Avoid feeding your dog a large meal before travel, as a full stomach may exacerbate nausea. Instead, offer a light snack a few hours prior to the trip. Here are some essentials to bring along: - Towels or sheets to protect the car seats - Disposable bags or a container in case of an emergency clean-up - Water for possible rinsing or cleaning - Baby wipes to clean up smaller messes Having these supplies on hand will make managing any unexpected instances of motion sickness less stressful for both you and your pet. 3. Positioning your Dog for an Optimal Experience The most comfortable spot for your dog may be a location where they can easily see outside the car. This can help prevent disorientation and dizziness, which can contribute to motion sickness. Some suggestions for ideal positioning are: - A secured and appropriately-sized pet carrier - A doggy car seat that elevates your pet to look out the window - A travel-safe harness with a seatbelt attachment - In the backseat, using a pet barrier to keep them contained These options will also ensure your dog's safety in the event of sudden stops or other unpredictable scenarios on the road. 4. Consulting with Your Vet about Preventative Medication If your dog's motion sickness symptoms are persistent, it's wise to discuss the issue with your veterinarian. They may recommend medications designed to combat nausea caused by motion sickness. Some commonly prescribed medications include: - Cerenia (maropitant citrate): A prescription medication that alleviates vomiting and motion sickness in dogs - Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine): An over-the-counter antihistamine that also helps with nausea - Meclizine (Bonine): Another over-the-counter antihistamine that is useful for motion sickness Always consult with your vet before administering any medications to your dog, as dosages and administration guidelines may vary based on your pet's size, age, and medical history. 5. Exploring Alternative Treatments In addition to medication, some pet owners turn to alternative treatments to help with dog motion sickness. Acupuncture, motion sickness pressure point bracelets, and herbal remedies may provide relief for some pets. It's important to talk to your vet about these methods before trying them to ensure they are safe for your dog. Conclusion Dealing with your dog's motion sickness can be stressful for both you and your pet. Recognizing the signs, being prepared for the car ride, and taking preventative measures can make all the difference in providing a more comfortable experience for your dog. Always consult with your vet for guidance on appropriate solutions, so that you and your canine companion can hit the road with confidence and ease."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer from options.

Assuming that: With higher levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in ocean water, the water becomes more acidic. Answer:","output":"If Jim lowers the amount of carbon dioxide being absorbed by the ocean, the level of acidity in the ocean will become smaller. To understand the reasoning behind this answer, it is essential to delve into the process of ocean acidification and the role carbon dioxide plays in this phenomenon. Ocean acidification is a chemical process that occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere dissolves in the ocean, resulting in an increased concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) and a lower pH value. This means that the ocean water becomes more acidic. The process can be explained through the following chemical reactions: 1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolves in ocean water (H2O) to form carbonic acid (H2CO3): CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 2. Carbonic acid (H2CO3) dissociates into a bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) and a hydrogen ion (H+): H2CO3 → HCO3- + H+ 3. Some of the bicarbonate ions further dissociate into carbonate ions (CO3 2-) and hydrogen ions (H+): HCO3- → CO3 2- + H+ As a result of these reactions, the concentration of hydrogen ions increases, leading to a decrease in pH value (increase in acidity) of the ocean water. Moreover, the increased acidity can have detrimental effects on marine life, particularly on organisms with calcium carbonate shells, as the increased concentration of hydrogen ions react with carbonate ions (CO3 2-) to form more bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), thereby decreasing the availability of carbonate ions for these organisms to build their protective shells and skeletons. Now, when Jim lowers the amount of carbon dioxide being introduced to the ocean, fewer molecules of CO2 will dissolve in the ocean water, leading to the following consequences: - A decrease in the formation of carbonic acid (H2CO3), hence reducing the generation of hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). - Lower concentrations of hydrogen ions in the ocean, resulting in a reduced rate of reaction between hydrogen ions and carbonate ions (CO3 2-) to form bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). - An overall higher concentration of carbonate ions, which are essential for marine organisms to build their shells and skeletal structures. As a result, the ocean's acidity will decrease, leading to a higher (less acidic) pH value. Therefore, by lowering the amount of carbon dioxide introduced to the ocean, Jim indirectly contributes to a decrease in the ocean's acidity level."},{"instruction":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Good\\"","output":"To rate this review on a scale of 1-5, I need to consider the factors below: 1.

He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor.

By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war.

In this statement, the author highlights an observable phenomenon in the global financial system. The \\"nervous center of gravity\\" refers to the focus of the world's financial and economic activities, where important decisions and transactions take place. The core countries, namely the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, dominate this center due to their strong economies and influence. The statement also points out that these core countries maintain high current account deficits, which means that they import more goods and services than they export. This results in a negative balance that needs to be financed. This is where the surpluses from poorer countries come into play. Poorer countries, in contrast, usually have a positive current account balance, as they tend to export more than they import. The author suggests that the global financial system cyclically shifts its focus back to these core countries, emphasizing their importance in the global economy. This is done by channeling funds from countries with a surplus to those with a deficit, allowing them to maintain their high levels of consumption and investment. In turn, the core countries support the economic growth and development of the poorer countries through trade, investments, and aid. However, this system of resource redistribution and interdependence has its drawbacks. For instance, the core countries may become dangerously reliant on external funds to maintain their lifestyles, leading to unsustainable debt levels. On the other hand, the poorer countries supplying the funds might become vulnerable to economic shocks or political turmoil within the core countries, which could hamper their own development. In summary, the statement describes the cyclical nature of the global financial system, where the focus continuously shifts back to the core countries, which rely on poorer countries to finance their high current account deficits. This interdependence can stimulate economic growth and development worldwide, but it also carries risks for all countries involved."},{"instruction":"Q:Article: Paris is the capial of France.

Cher (; born Cherilyn Sarkisian (Armenian: Sherilin Sargsyan); May 20, 1946) is an American singer and actress. Sometimes called the Goddess of Pop, she has been described as embodying female autonomy in a male-dominated industry. She is known for her distinctive contralto singing voice and for having worked in numerous areas of entertainment, as well as adopting a variety of styles and appearances during her six-decade-long career. At age 16, Cher dropped out of school, left her mother's house, and moved to Los Angeles with a friend. She took acting classes and worked to support herself, dancing in small clubs along Hollywood's Sunset Strip and introducing herself to performers, managers, and agents. According to Berman, \\"[Cher] did not hesitate to approach anyone she thought could help her get a break, make a new contact, or get an audition.\\" Cher met performer Sonny Bono in November 1962 when he was working for record producer Phil Spector. Cher's friend moved out, and Cher accepted Sonny's offer to be his housekeeper. Sonny introduced Cher to Spector, who used her as a backup singer on many recordings, including the Ronettes' \\"Be My Baby\\" and the Righteous Brothers' \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\\". Spector produced her first single, the commercially unsuccessful \\"Ringo, I Love You\\", which Cher recorded under the name Bonnie Jo Mason. Cher and Sonny became close friends, eventual lovers, and performed their own unofficial wedding ceremony in a hotel room in Tijuana, Mexico, on October 27, 1964. Although Sonny had wanted to launch Cher as a solo artist, she encouraged him to perform with her because she suffered from stage fright, and he began joining her onstage, singing the harmonies. Cher disguised her nervousness by looking at Sonny; she later commented that she sang to the people through him. In late 1964, they emerged as a duo called Caesar & Cleo, releasing the poorly received singles \\"Do You Wanna Dance?\\", \\"Love Is Strange\\", and \\"Let the Good Times Roll\\". Cher signed with Liberty Records' Imperial imprint in the end of 1964, and Sonny became her producer. The single \\"Dream Baby\\", released under the name \\"Cherilyn\\", received airplay in Los Angeles. Encouraged by Imperial, Cher worked with Sonny on her second solo single on the label, a cover version of Bob Dylan's \\"All I Really Want to Do\\", which peaked at number 15 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1965. Meanwhile, the Byrds had released their own version of the same song. When competition on the singles charts started between Cher and the Byrds, the group's record label began to promote the B-side of the Byrds' single. Roger McGuinn of the Byrds commented, \\"We loved the Cher version ... We didn't want to hassle. So we just turned our record over.\\" Cher's debut album, All I Really Want to Do (1965), reached number 16 on the Billboard 200; it was later described by AllMusic's Tim Sendra as \\"one of the stronger folk-pop records of the era\\".","output":"This text is about Cher, an American singer and actress who is sometimes called the Goddess of Pop.

The statement came a day after Obama outlined steps to reform intelligence gathering measures, saying the classified leaks by Snowden created a public distrust in programs meant to safeguard Americans. \\"As Snowden has stated, his biggest concern was if he blew the whistle and change did not occur,\\" Julian Assange said in a written statement. \\"Well, reforms are taking shape, and for that, the president and people of the United States and around the world owe Edward Snowden a debt of gratitude.\\" Obama has refused any characterization of Snowden as a \\"whistle-blower\\" or \\"patriot,\\" telling reporters there were \\"other avenues\\" the former National Security Agency contractor could have taken instead of leaking national security surveillance information. The president said Snowden's leaks came in \\"dribs and drabs,\\" giving a false general impression that \\"we are somehow out there willy-nilly sucking information from everybody.\\" At the same time, Obama sought to assure the public that there are safeguards in place, while acknowledging the need for transparency. Among the steps being taken, according to the president: Working with Congress to pursue appropriate improvements of the telephone data program; reforming the secret court that approves that initiative; improving transparency to provide as much information as possible to the public, including the legal rationale for government collection activities; and appointing a high-level, independent group of outside experts to review surveillance technologies. Snowden stepped forward publicly in June to claim responsibility for leaking to the media that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States. The agency also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents, he said. Snowden fled first to China and then to Russia before Moscow granted him temporary asylum despite pressure from the Obama administration to return him to the United States to face charges. He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, for the leaks. If Snowden believes his actions were right, \\"he can appear before a court with a lawyer and make his case,\\" the president said. Snowden and others have contended that he did America and the world a service by revealing information on secret programs, which they say wrongly impinge on people's right to privacy in furtively giving too much information to the U.S. government. \\"The simple fact is that without Snowden's disclosures, no one would know about the programs and no reforms could take place,\\" Assange said.

Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The transition between the end of the Eocene and the beginning of the Oligocene is marked by large-scale extinction and floral and faunal turnover (although minor in comparison to the largest mass extinctions). Most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature. They included the last of the ancient cetaceans, the Archaeoceti. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - Megadontosuchus is a genus of tomistomine crocodylian from the middle Eocene of Italy . Fossils have been found from Monte Duello in the province of Verona . The genus is currently monotypic , with the type and only species being M. arduini . The species was originally named in 1880 , although it was assigned to the genus Crocodilius ( now spelled Crocodylus ) . The genus was first erected by paleontologist Charles C. Mook in 1955 along with the tomistomine genus Kentisuchus , which was also first classified as Crocodilius . No holotype for Megadontosuchus was designated in 1880 , and a lectotype was n't proposed until 2007 . Megadontosuchus differs from other tomistomines in that it has a more robust rostrum , very large teeth ( hence the generic name meaning big - toothed crocodile ) , and large supratemporal fenestrae on the skull table . - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain. - Crocodylus is one of three genera from the subfamily Crocodylinae of the family Crocodylidae. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Kentisuchus is an extinct genus of tomistomine crocodylian. It is considered one of the most basal members of the subfamily. Fossils have been found from England and France that date back to the early Eocene. The genus has also been recorded from Ukraine, but it unclear whether specimens from Ukraine are referable to \\"Kentisuchus\\". - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011. - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world. - The Crocodylidae family of crocodylians includes the true crocodiles which are the members of the subfamily Crocodylinae and the \\"Tomistoma\\" genus. Currently, the family includes two subfamilies, Crocodylinae and Tomistominae, with the latter being a subject of controversy whether it is a crocodile or belongs to the family Gavialidae. Further genetic analysis has to be done to come to a final conclusion. - A holotype is a single physical example (or illustration) of an organism, known to have been used when the species (or lower-ranked taxon) was formally described. It is either the single such physical example (or illustration) or one of several such, but explicitly designated as the holotype. Under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), a holotype is one of several kinds of name-bearing types. In the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and ICZN the definitions of types are similar in intent but not identical in terminology or underlying concept. What is the relationship between 'megadontosuchus' and 'tomistominae'? A:","output":"Megadontosuchus is a genus of tomistomine crocodylian. Tomistominae is a subfamily within the Crocodylidae family that includes Megadontosuchus and other related genera."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: This task is about translating a given English language sentence to French.

Gerri Peev. PUBLISHED:. 09:24 EST, 12 March 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:42 EST, 12 March 2013. Backbench Tory MPs have been ordered by their party’s hierarchy to stop attacking the Prime Minister on Twitter. They were urged to exercise more caution when tweeting to avoid damaging the Conservatives’ general election prospects. Tory strategist Lynton Crosby met MPs last night with David Cameron to discuss their tactics for the 2015 poll. Ticking off: Tory MPs are to be told to stop speculating on Twitter about David Cameron's chances of wining the next election. Backbenchers were told to refrain from criticising the party’s policies and leadership in the wake of the disastrous Eastleigh by-election which saw the Tories relegated to third behind UKIP. No 10 has reminded MPs that they are ‘participants, not commentators’ after a string of tweets were seen as ‘distracting’. MPs were told instead ‘to get out the message that we have created one million extra private sector jobs, that net migration has reduced by a third and that crime is down. These messages are being drowned out.’ One of the MPs who regularly criticises Downing Street on Twitter is Dr Sarah Wollaston. Help or hindrance? Totnes MP Sarah Wollaston and Lichfield MP Michael Fabricant are among the Tory backbenchers to use Twitter to criticise the party leadership. Within two hours of MailOnline reporting on the warning from No 10 to Tory MPs that they are 'participants not commentators', Dr Wollaston took to Twitter to insist she would not be silenced, including the message: **** ***. Dr Wollaston then deleted the message, and reposted it without the asterisks. When Home Secretary Theresa May made a. speech over the weekend that was widely seen as a leadership pitch, Dr. Wollaston reinforced the idea that Mr Cameron was in trouble. She tweeted that the No 10 ‘inner circle. still look far too posh, male and white’ adding that ‘Cameron is. running out of time to fix it’. On Monday night, she tweeted: ‘We don’t. need a leadership challenge but I would challenge the leader to change. his advisers.’ Tory election guru Lynton Crosby will tell MPs that they must focus on key messages like job creation and reforming welfare. Then after word got out that Tory MPs. were encouraged to stop tweeting criticism of the PM, Dr Wollaston. tweeted the message ‘**** ***’. Former whip Michael Fabricant is another prolific tweeter. The MP was openly discussing his party’s. problems during the Eastleigh by-election, tweeting that many of the. policies trumpeted by UKIP were Tory ideas but voters did not realise. this ‘because of mixed messaging’. The PM has become a late convert to Twitter, following his pronouncement. in 2009 that ‘too many tweets might make a t**t’. Now officials at Tory. HQ are encouraging MPs to follow his Twitter messages. When Mr Cameron. tweets, they are urged to retweet the message to their own followers. Last night Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher said: ‘Things are so bad. for Cameron that he is reduced to gagging his own backbench MPs on. Twitter because he’s fearful that they might tell it how it is. ‘This is a weak and increasingly out of touch prime minister desperately trying to stop his divided party imploding.’ But Tory MP Eleanor Laing said: ‘There are some people who are openly. talking about challenges to the leadership. They should all be quiet.’ Mark Pritchard questioned why Mr Cameron had taken so long to 'catch up' with backbench opinion on Europe. Peterborough MP Stewart Jackson, a frequent critic of Mr Cameron, urged the PM to realise more right-wing policies would be popular. While his colleagues post a stream of comments online, the PM uses his account for more mundane messages, like this one from a visit to Mercedes-Benz in Buckinghamshire yesterday.

The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times.

The international agreement in question is the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR), which stipulates that when a foreign national is arrested, they must be informed of their right to communicate with and have access to their home country's consular officials. This crucial part of the international law is designed to ensure that foreign nationals receive fair and impartial treatment while in custody. The Mexican government and Tamayo's attorneys argue that Tamayo's rights under the VCCR were violated when he was not informed of his right to consular assistance after his arrest. This omission, they argue, had a profound impact on the fairness of his trial and the appropriateness of his death sentence. They maintain that had Tamayo been given access to consular assistance, he might have received better legal representation and had greater success in presenting his defense. Additionally, they point out that the United States has an obligation, as a signatory to the VCCR, to uphold and abide by its provisions. Not doing so in Tamayo's case would be a violation of international law, which could have negative consequences for the United States and its relations with other nations. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also expressed concern that executing Tamayo without addressing these violations could potentially put other U.S. citizens at risk abroad if foreign governments choose to retaliate in kind. Despite these arguments and the diplomatic pressure coming from both the Mexican government and U.S. Secretary of State, the state of Texas proceeded with Tamayo's execution. This raises serious concerns about the U.S.'s commitment to upholding its international obligations, and its willingness to comply with the principles of fairness and due process as defined by international law. Furthermore, it highlights the need for a comprehensive review of how the United States ensures that the rights of foreign nationals are protected within the criminal justice system."},{"instruction":"The dermis is the inner layer of skin.

Second question: What is a tributary? Are these two questions asking the same thing? + no. + yes.","output":"The first question, \\"What is tributary?\\" is not grammatically correct, as it's missing an article before the word \\"tributary.\\" However, the intended meaning can still be understood, which asks for an explanation of the term \\"tributary.\\" The second question, \\"What is a tributary?\\" is correctly phrased and seeks to know the meaning of the term \\"tributary\\" as well. Thus, although the first question has a grammatical issue, both questions can be interpreted to be asking the same thing. I will provide a detailed and long answer to the intended question. A tributary is a river or stream that flows into a larger river or a mainstem (also called a parent) river or, more broadly, into a body of water, such as a lake or ocean. Tributaries play a crucial role in the hydrological cycle and contribute to the overall water flow, biodiversity, and ecology of a region. They can be natural or artificial (created by humans through various means and purposes). Often, the point where a tributary merges with the mainstem river is called the confluence. Tributaries can also be arranged in a hierarchical structure known as a dendritic drainage system, which resembles the branches of a tree. The formation of tributaries is influenced by various geographical and geological factors, such as the underlying rock and soil composition, precipitation patterns, topography, and vegetation. In general, tributaries form when smaller watercourses, created by surface or groundwater flows, combine and eventually reach a more substantial body of water. This process can also be influenced by erosion, water velocity, and sediment transport. Tributaries provide essential ecological functions, such as: 1. Habitat: Tributaries serve as critical habitats for various aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial species. They provide shelter, breeding grounds, and feeding opportunities for fishes, crustaceans, insects, birds, mammals, and plants. 2. Biodiversity: Tributaries increase the overall biodiversity of an area by creating distinct aquatic ecosystems and maintaining gene flow between populations of aquatic organisms. Moreover, they serve as refuges for unique, rare, and endemic species. 3. Nutrient cycling: Tributaries help transport and recycle nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, that are essential for the growth and productivity of plants and algae in aquatic ecosystems. They also facilitate the decomposition of organic matter, contributing to energy and nutrient cycling. 4. Sediment transport and deposition: Tributaries carry sediment from their source areas and deposit them along their course and in the mainstem river or the larger body of water. These sediments form various aquatic and riparian habitats and promote the development of diverse plant communities. 5. Flood mitigation: Tributaries help regulate water flow by absorbing and dispersing floodwaters, reducing the magnitude and impacts of floods on downstream areas. However, tributaries can also be vulnerable to various human-induced pressures, such as pollution, dam construction, water extraction, and habitat destruction. These can lead to the degradation of tributary systems and negatively impact their ability to provide essential ecological functions. Thus, it is crucial to manage and protect tributaries as they contribute to the overall health and sustainability of river systems and larger water bodies, as well as support the communities and ecosystems that depend on them."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me the answer to when did the last civil war vet die??","output":"Absolutely, my dear little friend!

Options: - round - cheap - break window - hard - fun to play Step-by-step reasoning process below:","output":"Parents encourage their kids to play baseball for several reasons: 1. Physical activity: Baseball provides an opportunity for children to be physically active and engage in exercise, which promotes a healthy lifestyle. Regular physical activity helps develop cardiovascular endurance, muscle strength, and flexibility. Baseball involves various movements like running, catching, and throwing, which help enhance motor skills and coordination. 2. Social development: Playing baseball allows kids to interact with their peers, fostering social development and communication skills. The sport involves teamwork, allowing children to learn the importance of working together and relying on one another to succeed. This interaction also contributes to the development of strong bonds and friendships. 3. Building character: Baseball teaches essential life skills such as responsibility, dedication, and commitment. Kids learn to be punctual, respect authority, and follow rules, which can positively impact their growth and development. Additionally, baseball helps cultivate a strong work ethic as the players learn to put in the effort to improve their skills and contribute to the team. 4. Mental stimulation: Baseball is not just a physically demanding sport, but it also requires strategic thinking and focus. Players need to make split-second decisions based on the game situation, such like deciding when it's beneficial to steal a base or choosing which base to throw the ball to make an out. This aspect of the game helps develop problem-solving and decision-making skills in children. 5. Fun and enjoyment: Baseball is a fun and exciting sport to play, allowing children to enjoy the thrill of competition while participating in an activity they love. Parents often want their kids to have fun and make lasting memories, and participating in baseball games and practices can achieve that. In conclusion, parents encourage their kids to play baseball due to its numerous benefits, ranging from physical fitness and social development to character building, mental stimulation, and, most importantly, the fun and enjoyment it offers."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Process: - Get the ice tray - Remove any ice cubes currently in the tray - Fill the tray with cold water - Ensure the tray is evenly filled to an appropriate level - Open the freezer - Place the tray in the freezer - Close the freezer door - Wait. suppose a person is conserving water happens, how will it affect MORE ice cubes being made.

Rachel Baker, 32, from Addlestone, Surrey, had gained weight steadily since her teens, eating big meals including frozen ready meals and takeaways and frequently snacking on crisps, chocolate and fizzy drinks. Her weight crept up to 19 stone after giving birth to son, and she realised that she couldn’t bend down to tie her shoelaces without getting breathless. Her doctor had also warned that her body mass index (BMI) was 'off the chart'. Rachel Baker, 32, has gone down from a size 22 (left) to a slim size 8 (right) after realising she was so obese she was breathless tying her own shoelaces. Ms Baker said before losing the weight (left) she loved toast, frozen ready meals, roast dinners and desserts, whereas now (right) she eats porridge, soup and fresh fish with vegetables. Ms Baker was always overweight as a teenager, but after putting on three stone after the birth of her son, now two, her weight spiralled out of control. She became so obese a doctor said her BMI was 'off the scale' A doctor told her she was so obese that her BMI, previously 43 before her pregnancy, was now off the scale, and this spurred her to lose weight through the LighterLife diet plan and taking more exercise. LighterLife is a diet plan in which food is replaced with ready-mixed packs or shakes which contain all the nutrients a person's body would need in a day, but totalling only 600 calories. Ms Baker also attended weekly weighing and counselling sessions which helped her learn how to cook healthy meals, avoid the urge to eat and keep the weight off long-term. Since shedding the weight 11 months ago Ms Baker says she is able to race around with her son and now has achieved her goal of looking elegant while driving a carriage. Mrs Baker said: 'I realised I was holding my breath to do up my shoes and the shock of this was my lowest point. ‘I had the big tire around my middle. It was pressing on my chest so I couldn’t breathe. ‘Then I thought “I wonder how heavy I am”. 'I wasn't paying attention because I was running around after my son. I was looking after him but not after myself. ‘My son is young and active and I didn’t want to miss any moments while he was playing sports or running around outside’ Ms Baker said she had been overweight since her teenage years. She said: ‘I’ve always been bigger. I remember being 13 in secondary school and having meetings with the school dietitian because I was bigger than I was supposed to be. Ms Baker decided to join LighterLife's weight loss programme and through changing her diet and carrying out exercise, she managed to lose nearly 10 stone in under a year. A doctor said Ms Baker's BMI, which was over 43, was so high it was 'off the scale'. A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 25. BEFORE:. Breakfast: Two slices of toast with buttered jam. Mid-morning: Packet of crisps or chocolate bar and some fruit. 11am: Another similar snack. Lunch: Two rounds of sandwiches with corned beef, egg mayonnaise or tuna mayonaise, a pack of crisps, a yoghurt, a chocolate or Frusli bar. 2pm: Another snack, typically like crisps or ypghurt,. 4pm: Crackers with cream cheese. Dinner: A big dinner, such as pasta and sauce with cheese, spaghetti bolognaise, lasagne, frozen southern fried chicken with chips and peas, frozen chip shop fish, or a chicken Korma curry with rice and peshwari naan. Always had a dessert like bread and butter pudding, slice of cheesecake or half a tub of Haagen Daz ice cream. On weekends, Ms Baker would always eat a full roast dinner. 8pm: A snack such as biscuits, a chocolate bar or crisps. Drinks: Tea with milk throughout the dayFizzy drinks such as diet coke. AFTER:. Breakfast: A controlled amount of porridge oats and soya light milk. Black coffees, leaf teas.

Dinner: Fish such as haddock, plaice or salmon baked in olive oil with peas, a pulse mix or some broccoli. Malteasers as a dessert. ‘I was always conscious that I was bigger than my friends.’ At age 22, she decided to lose weight and went to the gym, even running a 5km Race for Life. But after the birth of her son she could no longer maintain such an exercise regime. She said her pregnancy weight, combined with a lack of exercise and a near-addiction to unhealthy food, meant her weight began to soar. She said: ‘I love food, I love Italians, Chinese, Mexican, Indian. ‘I always ate dessert, that was the pleasing part of the meal. ‘My intake was high but my exercise was low. ‘Then I got pregnant and put on an extra three stone. The amount of food that went into my body was just incredible.' She added she didn’t realise her weight was so high: ‘When you put on a couple of pounds a month, you don’t notice. 'If your jeans get a bit tight you don’t really notice, you just wear something else in your wardrobe.’ The moment she realised she was breathless bending down to tie her laces was the ‘trigger’ moment. After this she went to her GP, who confirmed that her BMI, which was 43 before she became pregnant, was now so high it was ‘off the scale’. Ms Baker was officially classed as 'morbidly obese' at over 43, well outside the healthy range of 18.5 to 25. She looked around for a weight loss programme. ‘I was conscious of Pauline Quirke’s story. That’s when I found LighterLife. 'I went for a consultation and I liked the weekly group sessions. After I’d done a couple of weeks I didn’t worry about not being with my family. I enjoyed it, it was time for me. 'We didn’t talk about dieting and calories and food. It was like life lessons. It was about identifying the eating triggers. We did things like worry trees. 'So we resolved our life issues so we didn’t need food to solve it. 'Tiredness was a big factor for me. I had a time between 7 and 8, after dinner, child in bed, and that time was snack time. 'I would pick up something that I wouldn’t need for nutrition.' Sticking to the diet, she managed to lose between two and six pounds a week, eventually shedding almost 10 stone. Ms Baker’s hobby is horse carriage driving and so she decided to set herself a goal of losing weight so she could feel graceful at the reins. She said: ‘I have been driving carriages for two and a half years. I show my mother’s horse and drive around the country showing the horse. ‘When I was getting to the end of the season, I was going into a new class where I needed a sense of elegance. She has finally achieved her goal of looking elegant while carrying out her hobby of horse carriage driving. Before her weight loss she says she felt 'cumbersome', 'like a workman' and struggled getting on the horse. Before losing weight Ms Baker said she would have struggled sitting down cross-legged for a picnic, but with her trim physique she is able to enjoy picnics with her son. ‘I felt very cumbersome. I felt like a workman like rather than elegant. I found it hard to get on and off the horse which is embarrassing. ‘So I aimed to start the year confident and elegant, with a lovely hat. To feel as if I belonged more. And now I do!’ One of the greatest joys of losing weight is that she is now able to play with her son, she said. ‘My son loves picnics but I would have struggled to sit cross legged before on the ground, and my knees would hurt getting up. Now I can have a picnic without worrying.' She added: ‘Now I run around with my son, I race him while he’s on the bike. He always says \\"chase me chase me!\\" and I can now.’ Ms Baker said: ‘Now I run around with my son, I race him while he’s on the bike.

Heavily promoted in a campaign during which Chrisye was interviewed on the national television station TVRI and on radio, the album eventually sold 400,000 copies.The following year Chrisye recorded Percik Pesona (Stain of Enchantment) with Jockie. Produced after Amin's death, the album featured songs written by Chrisye's close friend Junaidi Salat, as well as Jockie and Guruh. The album's title was chosen by vote; the titular song was not released as a single. Percik Pesona, released in August 1979, was a critical and commercial failure. After discussing the issue with other artists, Chrisye blamed the album's failure on its similarity to Badai Pasti Berlalu. As a result, following a period of contemplation, he began branching out into different genres. That same year he was on the panel of the Prambors Teenage Songwriting Competition, held on 5 May.After deciding that romantic pop songs influenced by easy listening would suit him best, Chrisye began recording his next album, Puspa Indah (Beautiful Flower). All but one of the songs were composed by Guruh Sukarnoputra; the album also featured the English-language \\"To My Friends on Legian...

It seemed Justin was always asking Matthew to handle the responsibility of cleaning the kitten's dirty litter box just because Matthew usually worked from home. Today, however, Matthew decided to put his foot down. He gathered his thoughts and walked into the living room, finding Justin playing video games on the couch. \\"Hey Justin, can we talk for a moment?\\" Matthew asked hesitantly. Justin paused the game and looked at Matthew quizzically. \\"Uh sure, what's up?\\" Matthew took a deep breath, trying to keep his emotions in check. \\"I feel like I've been the one consistently taking care of the kitten's litter box. I understand that I work from home, but I think we should figure out a fair system for both of us.\\" Justin looked surprised at Matthew's request. \\"I didn't realize it was bothering you this much. Alright, let's come up with a plan.\\" The two roommates sat down together, brainstorming ideas to share the responsibility without getting into any disagreement. After an hour of discussion, they came up with a solution. The new plan was simple but fair: They would alternate weeks for cleaning the litter box. Moreover, Justin agreed to be more aware of the kitten's needs and help out with other cat responsibilities, such as feeding and playing, to make their shared living situation more harmonious. They shook hands, agreeing to the new arrangement and feeling a sense of relief as they stepped toward a better, more balanced roommate relationship. As weeks passed by, Matthew noticed a significant improvement in their interactions. Justin kept his word, and they both played their part in taking care of the kitten, now named \\"Stella.\\" The newfound balance allowed them to bond over Stella's antics and even laugh together at her silly behavior. Surprisingly, Matthew and Justin began spending more time together. The evenings were now filled with friendly chats while watching movies or cooking dinner as a team. Their friendship flourished, with Stella being the catalyst that brought the two roommates closer. On a sunny Sunday afternoon, as Matthew and Justin returned from a trip to the park with Stella, they marveled at how things had changed in just a few months. The litter box dispute had become a distant memory, replaced by the warmth and trust of a true friendship. Stella the kitten had come into their lives, unknowingly teaching them a valuable lesson: addressing problems openly and honestly can lead to understanding and stronger bonds between people.

Options: - misunderstanding - silliness - laughter - learning about - idleness The answer is \\"silliness\\" because A:","output":"People often consider chatting with friends when there is work to do as \\"silliness\\" because engaging in non-work-related conversations during work time can lead to several issues for both the employee and the employer. Though there might be a misunderstanding, laughter, or learning about something interesting through these conversations, it is ultimately seen as idle behavior due to the lack of productivity associated with it. 1. Distraction and reduced productivity: Engaging in idle chitchat while work is pending can lead to distraction from the task at hand. As a result, there is a decline in the overall efficiency and productivity of the individuals and, consequently, the organization as a whole. Gossip and conversations might be fun in the short term, but they can seriously hinder the achievement of work objectives. 2. Unprofessionalism: When employees are constantly chatting and laughing with friends instead of focusing on their work, it can make them appear unprofessional. This behavior might result in colleagues or supervisors questioning their dedication and commitment to the job. In some cases, it could even damage their career advancement opportunities. 3. Time management issues: One of the key aspects of effective work performance is the ability to prioritize tasks and manage time well. Engaging in silliness and idle conversations can cause employees to lose track of time and become overwhelmed when deadlines approach. As a result, the quality of their work may suffer, or they may need to put in extra hours to catch up, impacting work-life balance. 4. Strained work relationships: Continual chatting can also affect workplace relationships in a negative way. Colleagues who prefer to focus on their tasks may get annoyed or irritated by the constant talking and laughter, which could create tension within the team and hamper collaboration efforts. 5. Potential disciplinary action: In more serious cases, employers may have strict policies against idling and non-work-related activities during work hours. Engaging in such behaviors can potentially lead to disciplinary action or even termination of employment if it is a recurring issue. While chatting with friends can be a good way to maintain social connections or release some stress, it is crucial to strike a balance to ensure that work is not negatively impacted. Therefore, \\"silliness\\" is the most suitable option described here, as it encompasses the lack of seriousness in prioritizing work over leisurely conversations, leading to various detrimental outcomes on professional and personal levels."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: Maybe we just need a rest first and then come back to the dialogue in early 2011.

Stock the pond with both submerged and floating plants. They will use the underwater plants when they are larvae, and perch on the tall plants when they are adults. Try getting eelgrass, fanwort, hornwort, anacharis, wild celery, corkscrew rush, blue flag iris, parrot’s feather, pondweed, water lilies, and lotus flowers. You can find water plants at garden centers and online. Place shrubs around the edge of the pond to give the dragonflies more places to land. This also makes your pond even more beautiful and appealing. The dragonflies will have more places to perch and live. You can plant border plants and shrubs.

Answer choices: - cool - Wet - Dry - arid - Dark - H20 - soil - Cold The answer to this question is:","output":"Arid. Cacti are adapted to arid environments, which are characterized by low rainfall, high evaporation rates, and generally dry conditions. These plants have developed specific features and functions to help them survive in such challenging settings. Arid environments can be found in desert regions and other areas with a lack of moisture, which can vary from hot deserts like the Sahara Desert to cold deserts like the Gobi Desert. It also includes semi-arid regions with slightly more precipitation but still considered water scarce. Cacti have evolved numerous adaptive mechanisms to overcome the challenges posed by an arid environment: 1. Succulence: Cacti store water in their thick, fleshy stems, which allows them to survive long periods of drought. This also enables them to have a low surface area to volume ratio, reducing water loss through transpiration. 2. Shallow and extensive root systems: Cacti have wide-reaching but shallow root systems that enable them to capture water from a larger area surrounding the plant. Rainwater often does not penetrate deep into the soil in arid environments, so having a shallow root system is advantageous. 3. Photosynthesis adaptations: Cacti perform a different type of photosynthesis called Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis. This process allows them to open their stomata (pores) at night to take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen, reducing water loss during the hottest and driest hours of the day. 4. Spines instead of leaves: Most cacti have spines, which are modified leaves, instead of regular flat leaves. Spines not only serve as protection against herbivores but also help to shade the plant's surface and reduce water loss through transpiration. 5. Slow growth rates: Cacti typically grow very slowly to conserve water and nutrients. This also helps them withstand periods of drought without suffering significant damage. In conclusion, cacti are well-adapted to arid environments through a variety of specialized mechanisms and features that allow them to efficiently conserve water, capture moisture when it is available, and tolerate the harsh conditions in dry regions."},{"instruction":"The greenlanders and the natives in Canada which is both Inuit and Indian Add punctuation.","output":"The Greenlanders and the natives in Canada, which include both Inuit and Indian populations, share many similarities in terms of their history, culture, and ways of life. However, there are also distinct differences that set them apart. Historically, both the Greenlanders and the Canadian natives have faced colonization by European powers. The Greenlanders experienced Danish colonization in the 18th century, which had a significant impact on their culture and language. Similarly, the Canadian natives were colonized by the British and the French, which led to the gradual erosion of their traditions, languages, and territories. Culturally, both the Greenlanders and the Canadian natives are known for their strong connection to their land and the environment. For instance, the Inuit people of both Canada and Greenland have traditionally relied on hunting, fishing, and gathering for sustenance. Key components of their diet include fish, seals, whales, and caribou. Additionally, both populations have a rich tradition of storytelling, art, and music, which have been passed down through generations. In terms of languages, though both groups have experienced the assimilation of the colonizing forces' languages, they have managed to retain their native tongues to a significant extent. In Greenland, the majority of the population speaks Greenlandic (Kalaallisut), which is an Inuit language, while in Canada, various indigenous languages are spoken, including Inuktitut (another Inuit language), Cree, Ojibwe, and Mi'kmaq, among others. Despite these similarities, there are notable differences between the Greenlanders and the Canadian natives. One distinction lies in their political status. Greenland, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, has managed to gain significant self-governance, with many responsibilities transferred to the local government. On the other hand, Canadian natives have experienced varying levels of self-governance, with some First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities exercising control over certain aspects of their territories, though many still face ongoing challenges in terms of land rights and resource management. Moreover, the Canadian natives have experienced even further cultural and linguistic diversity compared to the Greenlanders. While the major ethnic group in Greenland is the Inuit, representing 89% of the population, Canada is home to a vast array of indigenous groups, such as the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, each with their own unique cultures, languages, and histories. This diversity has given rise to numerous distinct communities across Canada, each with their own social structures, religious beliefs, and practices. Lastly, a key difference between the Greenlanders and the Canadian natives is their societal integration and participation in the wider society. In recent years, Greenland has seen a rapid modernization, with its people increasingly engaging with global issues and adopting modern lifestyles alongside their traditional ways. Canadian native communities, while also witnessing modernization, continue to grapple with the effects of colonization and historical trauma, and as a result, many communities face challenges in areas such as healthcare, education, and economic development. In conclusion, the Greenlanders and the natives in Canada, including both Inuit and Indian populations, share several similarities in terms of their historical experiences, cultural practices, and connections to the land. However, the distinct political status, cultural and linguistic diversity, and societal integration of these populations demonstrate the rich complexity and uniqueness of each group."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"AWESOME best emulator ever。but i wish it could fast forward\\" The answer is:","output":"Based on the content of the review, it appears that the user has a positive experience with the emulator and considers it the best.

How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea? Have we been influenced by something, processed it... What do most people think about creativity? - It does not exist - not enough information - It is difficult to define - It does not mean anything A:","output":"Creativity is a multifaceted concept that is challenging to pin down and define for everyone, as it involves multiple aspects, such as the ability to think outside the box, the generation of new ideas, and the application of skills and effort. People may have different perspectives on what constitutes creativity, and as a result, they might emphasize different aspects of it, such as the uniqueness of ideas, skill, and the amount of hard work involved. The origin of unique ideas in creativity can be a topic of much debate. Some may view it as random, divine inspiration, or as a result of subconscious processing influenced by various experiences or stimuli. It's possible that the sources of unique ideas can vary from person to person, and the process of discovering, nurturing, and expressing creativity can be highly personal as well. Public opinion on creativity may vary, with some people believing that it doesn't exist or is too difficult to define, while others may acknowledge its challenges but still see value in understanding and engaging with creativity. Ultimately, creativity remains an abstract concept that can be perceived and interpreted differently by each individual."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Steve is bored at work.

Given the context: Why did Skylar do this? Possible answers: keep Taylor in check, let Taylor roam free, get tired of Taylor The answer is:","output":"To figure out the answer, let's analyze the information provided in the question and context. 1. Skylar has had enough: This statement implies dissatisfaction or frustration with the situation. 2. Orders Taylor to go back to the house: Skylar takes action to end the current situation. 3. Possible answers: keep Taylor in check, let Taylor roam free, get tired of Taylor Now, let's evaluate each possible answer: A. Keep Taylor in check: Since Skylar orders Taylor to go back to the house, it suggests a desire for control and to restrain Taylor. This possibility matches Skylar's actions and emotions, as they seem to be frustrated with the current situation. B. Let Taylor roam free: This option contradicts Skylar's actions. Ordering Taylor to go back to the house is the opposite of giving freedom. C. Get tired of Taylor: This option is also plausible since Skylar has had enough and takes action to change the situation. They might be tired of Taylor's behavior, presence, or something else related to Taylor. Based on the analysis, both possible answers A (keep Taylor in check) and C (get tired of Taylor) seem to align with Skylar's actions and emotions. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine which answer is more accurate. However, given the directness of Skylar's order to go back to the house, answer A (keep Taylor in check) might be slightly more appropriate, as it emphasizes the desire to control the situation."},{"instruction":"Where would a zoo keep a lemur?

Halévy about completing his old tutor's unfinished opera Noé. Although no action was taken at that time, Bizet remained on friendly terms with the Halévy family. Fromental had left two daughters; the elder, Esther, died in 1864, an event which so traumatised Mme. Halévy that she could not tolerate the company of her younger daughter Geneviève, who from the age of 15 lived with other family members. It is unclear when Geneviève and Bizet became emotionally attached, but in October 1867, he informed Galabert: \\"I have met an adorable girl whom I love! In two years she will be my wife!\\" The pair became engaged, although the Halévy family initially disallowed the match. According to Bizet they considered him an unsuitable catch: \\"penniless, left-wing, anti-religious and Bohemian\\", which Dean observes are odd grounds of objection from \\"a family bristling with artists and eccentrics\\". By summer 1869, their objections had been overcome, and the wedding took place on 3 June 1869. Ludovic Halévy wrote in his journal: \\"Bizet has spirit and talent. He should succeed\\".As a belated homage to his late father-in-law, Bizet took up the Noé manuscript and completed it.

Bizet's marriage was initially happy, but was affected by Geneviève's nervous instability (inherited from both her parents), her difficult relations with her mother and by Mme. Halévy's interference in the couple's affairs. Despite this, Bizet kept on good terms with his mother-in-law and maintained an extensive correspondence with her.

They made some changes to the story that don't make much sense to me. Daniel Webster in the story was a famous lawyer from New Hampshire in the story. In the movie he is an editor. A lawyer makes more sense since he ends up representing Jabez Stone against the devil him/herself (he was a man in the story, but was a woman in the movie) in a trial where both of their souls are on the line. As an editor, it doesn't seem likely that Daniel Webster would have the skill to do this. The acting was decent by all except for Alec Baldwin and Dan Aykroyd. These are two actors that I like, they just did an awful job in this movie. It was as though they thought they were acting in a comedy, but the movie was more a serious one than a comedy. This might be partly due to the fact that the movie was filmed with a particular vision in mind, and was then re-edited by somebody else. Given this fact, it's surprising that it was at all coherent. I was surprised to see a fair amount of SNL cast members in the movie, which further leads me to believe it may have originally been filmed with the intention of it being more of a comedy. All in all I would have to say it wasn't completely awful, but it wasn't much good. If I could get the hour and a half back and do something else with it, I would. The ending was especially disappointing. As in the original story, Daniel Webster defeats the devil in the trial. Jabez then starts out again at the beginning of the movie...literally, we are just brought back to the first scene with Jabez, and then the movie abruptly ends. It actually looked as though they just replayed Jabez' first scene over and called it the end. There is no indication that Jabez has the benefit of any of the knowledge or experience he gained, so who is to say he didn't just repeat his mistakes over again, and perhaps over and over in an endless loop? It was an extremely disappointing end and did not make a lot of sense. The decent cast, and the acting of everyone except for Baldwin and Aykroyd are the only things that keep this from being a complete and total crap sandwich.

Article: My father was Chief engineer of merchant ship, which was sunk in Word War II. The book Night of the U-boats told the story. Memories In September, 1940, my mother, sister and I went to Swansea, where my father's ship was getting ready to sail. We brought him a family photograph to be kept with him at all times and keep him safe. Then I remember my mother lying face down, sobbing. She had heard from a friend that the ship had been sunk by a torpedo . I can remember the arrival of the telegram , which in those days always brought had news. My grandmother opened it. It read, \\"Safe, Love Ted.\\" My most vivid memory is being woken and brought down to sit on my father's knee, his arm in a bandage. He was judged unfit to return to sea and took a shore job in Glasgow for the rest of the war. For as long as I can remember, he had a weak heart. Mother said _ was caused by the torpedoes. He said it was because of the cigarettes. Whichever, he died suddenly in his early 50s. Ten years later I read Night of the U-boats and was able to complete the story. Torpedo One torpedo struck the ship. Father was in the engine room, where the third engineer was killed. He shut down the engines to slow the ship making it easier for it to be abandoned. By the time he got on deck he was alone. Every lifeboat was gone except one which had stuck fast. When he tried to cut it free, it swung against the ship, injuring his hand and arm. He had no choice but to jump -- still with the photograph in his pocket. Three days later, he and other survivors were safe in Glasgow. All 23 with him signed the back of the photograph. A Toast In my room is the book and the photograph. Often, glass in hand, I have wondered how I would have dealt with an explosion, a sinking ship, a jump into a vast ocean and a wait for rescue? Lest we forget, I have some more whisky and toast the heroes of the war. Question: We can infer that the mother and children went to Swansea _ .

Options: - pass out - slurred speach - forgetfulness - death - stumbling Let's give stream of consciousness first:","output":"There can be multiple reasons why someone might be unable to talk to other people after getting drunk. Here is a step-by-step justification for each option: 1. Pass out: This can be a possibility because excessive alcohol consumption can lead to passing out or falling asleep involuntarily. When someone passes out, they lose consciousness and are physically unable to speak to others. 2. Slurred speech: Alcohol can affect the nervous system, which includes the muscles that control speech. As a result, a drunk person might have difficulty forming words or speaking clearly, making it hard for others to understand them. 3. Forgetfulness: Alcohol can impair short-term memory, making it difficult for someone who’s drunk to remember what they were going to say or follow a conversation. This forgetfulness can make it challenging to communicate effectively with others. 4. Death: Although quite an extreme scenario, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to alcohol poisoning, which can be fatal. In such cases, the person would not be able to talk to others or even be conscious. 5. Stumbling: Alcohol impairs coordination and balance, leading to unsteady movements or stumbling. While this wouldn't directly prevent someone from talking to others, it can make it harder to engage in a conversation as they may struggle to maintain their balance and focus on speaking. In summary, reasons someone might be unable to talk to other people after getting drunk include passing out, slurred speech, forgetfulness, death, and stumbling. The impact of alcohol on the individual and the severity of these effects will vary depending on the amount consumed and the person's tolerance."},{"instruction":"Courtney liked to collect marbles. She kept them in mason jars. One jar had 80 marbles. Her second jar had twice that amount. She just started her third jar which currently has 1/4 the amount of her first jar. How many marbles does she have in total? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Find out how many marbles are in the second jar. We are told that the second jar has twice the number of marbles as the first jar. Since the first jar has 80 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles in the second jar as follows: Total marbles in the second jar = 80 marbles (in the first jar) x 2 Total marbles in the second jar = 160 marbles Step 2: Find out how many marbles are in the third jar. We are told that the third jar has 1/4 the amount of the first jar. To find out how many marbles are in the third jar, we can calculate it as follows: Total marbles in the third jar = 80 marbles (in the first jar) x 1/4 Total marbles in the third jar = 20 marbles Step 3: Calculate the total number of marbles. Now that we know how many marbles are in each jar, we can simply add the number of marbles from all three jars to find the total number of marbles: Total marbles = 80 marbles (first jar) + 160 marbles (second jar) + 20 marbles (third jar) Total marbles = 260 marbles So, Courtney has a total of 260 marbles in her collection."},{"instruction":"Question: What is the name of one of the great hospitals in Mexico City?

This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. Now, I have a new situation: Two competing countries used different energy sources to produce their electricity. Turkey used mostly fossil fuels, while Greece used nuclear power. Answer this question please: Which country caused less air pollution? Answer:","output":"Given the background information and the new situation, Greece, which used nuclear power to generate its electricity, caused less air pollution compared to Turkey, which predominantly used fossil fuels. The primary reason for this is the nature of the two energy sources used. Fossil fuels, when burned for electricity generation, release several types of pollutants into the atmosphere. The most harmful of these include sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter, and carbon dioxide (CO2). Sulfur and nitrogen oxides contribute significantly to acid rain, a phenomenon that harms aquatic ecosystems, plants, and infrastructure. Particulate matter is associated with respiratory problems in humans as it contaminates the air we breathe. Carbon dioxide, an important greenhouse gas, significantly contributes to global warming by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. On the other hand, nuclear power is widely recognized as a low-carbon electricity source. During the production of nuclear energy, there are negligible emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. The process of nuclear fission — the splitting of atoms in a nuclear reactor — generates a large amount of heat without burning any material, thereby avoiding the release of pollutants associated with combustion. This makes it a much cleaner form of energy in terms of air pollution. However, it's crucial to mention that while nuclear power plants produce less air pollution, they involve other environmental challenges; chiefly, the production of highly radioactive waste. This waste must be carefully managed and stored due to its long-lasting radiotoxicity — a task with significant technical and security implications. Given these points, we can conclude that in terms of air pollution specifically, the country utilizing nuclear power — in this case, Greece — was likely causing less harm to the environment. Additionally, this implementation of nuclear energy contributes significantly less to the global phenomena of climate change and global warming due to the absence of greenhouse gas emissions. Conversely, Turkey's use of fossil fuels for electricity generation implies a higher level of air pollution and a greater contribution to these global issues."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: Each nitrogenous base has one or two rings that include which atoms? A: Answer:","output":"The paragraph provided does not contain any specific information about the structure of nitrogenous bases. However, as an AI assistant, I can use my knowledge of nitrogenous bases to provide a detailed answer to the question. Nitrogenous bases are key components of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). There are two major types of nitrogenous bases: purines and pyrimidines. Purines have a two-ring structure, consisting of a six-membered pyrimidine ring fused with a five-membered imidazole ring. These two rings include atoms of carbon and nitrogen. The two purines found in DNA are adenine (A) and guanine (G), and in RNA, they are again adenine (A) and guanine (G). Pyrimidines have a single six-membered ring structure, which also comprises atoms of carbon and nitrogen. Three pyrimidines are found in nucleic acids: cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U). In DNA, cytosine (C) and thymine (T) are the pyrimidines, whereas in RNA, cytosine (C) and uracil (U) are the pyrimidines. Therefore, to answer the question, each nitrogenous base, whether a purine or a pyrimidine, has one or two rings that include atoms of carbon and nitrogen."},{"instruction":"Write the answer: Horse Racing.

Total age of the family today without the baby = 85 + (5 * 3) = 85 + 15 = 100 Step 3: Today, the average age of the 6 family members (including the baby) is also 17. Total age of the family today (with the baby) = average age * number of members Total age today = 17 * 6 = 102 Step 4: To find the age of the child, we subtract the total age of the family without the baby from the total age of the family with the baby. Age of the child = 102 - 100 = 2 So the age of the child is 2 years old (Option B)."},{"instruction":"Loop antennas consist of a loop or coil of wire. Loops with circumference of a wavelength or larger act similarly to dipole antennas. However loops small in comparison to a wavelength act differently. They interact with the magnetic field of the radio wave instead of the electric field as other antennas do, and so are relatively insensitive to nearby electrical noise. However they have low radiation resistance, and so are inefficient for transmitting. They are used as receiving antennas at low frequencies, and also as direction finding antennas. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): If you needed to place an antenna somewhere with a large amount of interference, which type would be best?","output":"In a situation with a large amount of interference, a loop antenna, specifically a magnetic loop antenna, would be the best choice. This is because magnetic loop antennas can offer superior performance in environments with high levels of electrical noise and interference. Magnetic loop antennas are designed for receiving purposes and interact mainly with the magnetic field of the radio wave, instead of the electric field like most other antennas. This makes them less sensitive to electrical noise and interference that are common in urban or industrial areas. These antennas are very compact and exhibit directional properties, which can further help to minimize interference. As compared to other types of antennas, such as dipoles or monopoles that interact with the electric field, magnetic loop antennas focus on the magnetic component of the electromagnetic wave. As a result, they provide a significantly better signal-to-noise ratio in the presence of high electrical noise and interference. One drawback of magnetic loop antennas is that they have low radiation resistance, which makes them inefficient for transmitting. However, in a situation where you primarily need a receiving antenna with high noise immunity, the magnetic loop antenna would be the best choice. To sum up, if you need to place an antenna in an area with a large amount of interference, a magnetic loop antenna would be the best choice due to its relative insensitivity to electrical noise, compact size, and directional properties. These characteristics make it a suitable option for receiving signals in challenging environments while minimizing the negative effects of interference."},{"instruction":"It would have been really nice to go back at night and lay in the grass , and look up at the stars with all of the quiet peaceful chirping and the cool breeze .

The patient, a 62-year-old man, was made to sleep, tied with blue drapes and lying face up on a narrow table. But no one was touching him. Instead, the operation was being performed by a robot, whose three metal arms went through pencil-sized holes in the man's chest. At the ends of the robot's arms were tiny metal fingers, with turning wrists, which held a tiny instrument, a light and a camera. The robot's arms and fingers were controlled by Dr. Randall K. Wolf, sitting at a computer in a corner of the operating room about 20 feet away. This sort of operation, heart surgeons say, is the start of what may be the biggest change in their profession since heart bypass surgery began nearly 30 years ago. \\"The reason we make cuts is that we have big hands,\\" said Dr. Wolf, the director of the surgery at Ohio State. The robot's _ fingers, no longer than a nail on the small finger, at the end of the long sticks could work better. Eventually, surgeons believe, most heart surgery will be done by robots whose arms are put in through pencil-sized holes punched in patients' chests.

By BRIAN SEIBERTJAN. 29, 2016 In a 19th-century stone castle in Yonkers, the ballet choreographer Justin Peck tried something he had never tried before: directing a film. He did not look nervous. Nor did he seem intimidated by his surroundings: the ornate, centuries-old furnishings from Europe; the travel trunks left in the attic by the Ballets Russes choreographer Michel Fokine, who lived and taught in the castle in the 1930s. Gently making suggestions or demonstrating what he had in mind, the 28-year-old Mr. Peck appeared self-assured. “If that doesn’t work,” he said at one point, “I have a Plan B.” Both the attitude and the preparedness behind it are characteristic. The film, shot in November, was a small side project, a trailer for “The Most Incredible Thing,” Mr. Peck’s new work for New York City Ballet, where he is resident choreographer and a soloist. If he were a more anxious person, this ballet, which will have its debut at the David H. Koch Theater on Tuesday, Feb. 2, could give him plenty to be anxious about. The cast of 56 dancers, including 11 children from the School of American Ballet, is more than twice as large as any he has handled before. And this is his first attempt at narrative — the kind of story ballet that audiences are said to clamor for and that contemporary choreographers rarely succeed in delivering. It’s an important, perhaps inevitable, test for a choreographer who is now in extreme global demand. In April, San Francisco Ballet will present its first premiere by him. When Miami City Ballet visits New York that month, it will show off one of two Peck creations it has recently commissioned. In July, the august Paris Opera Ballet will add its imprimatur, performing its first Justin Peck premiere only a few months after performing his earlier “In Creases.” New Peck, old Peck: Everyone seems to want a piece of Peck. One work that many want is “Year of the Rabbit.” (Miami City, Dutch National Ballet and Pacific Northwest Ballet will all perform it in the next few months.) That was the first piece of his that New York City Ballet performed in Manhattan, way back in 2012. Mr. Peck was still in the corps of City Ballet, which he joined in 2007. He has since been promoted, but it’s his choreographic career that has raced at rabbit speed. “The Most Incredible Thing” is his 10th work for his home troupe. As the numbers have mounted, so has the praise, the critical assessments that place him at the very top of ballet choreographers, with Christopher Wheeldon and Alexei Ratmansky. This may be the greatest pressure of all: high expectations. “The Most Incredible Thing” takes its story from an 1870 fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The music, however, is brand-new — an orchestral score by Bryce Dessner, a genre-defying composer who is also a member of the indie rock band the National. The scenery and costumes — by Marcel Dzama, an artist with his own hip associations — are extravagant and fanciful. But there are no projections or special effects. The aim, Mr. Peck explained a few weeks ago, was to honor “the way ballets used to be made.” It seems telling that Mr. Peck, who has a significant following on Instagram and who has choreographed for an iPad app, has chosen a fable about the value of craftsmanship and the enduring power of art. Andersen’s tale concerns a contest for the hand of the king’s daughter and half the kingdom. The young man who wins is a creative type. The “most incredible thing” that he designs and builds is an extraordinary contraption, a clock of moving figures with a different assemblage for each hour: the four seasons at the stroke of four, the nine muses at the stroke of nine. People have been suggesting stories to Mr. Peck for a while, he said: “This one stuck because it translates so well into dance.” Indeed, the scenario sounds like a customized prompt for the kind of formal invention that, along with his musicality, has won Mr. Peck acclaim. In The New Yorker, Joan Acocella has written of his “rare skill” with ensemble patterns: “Almost giddily, they coalesce and dissolve, and then a new one appears. Spectators laugh for joy.” It’s also possible, when listening to Mr. Peck describe the new ballet’s creator hero as a confident but not cocky person, to sense a self-portrait. He certainly came across that way while choreographing the work. Calmly, as precious rehearsal time ticked away, he tried out option after option, methodical rather than indecisive. And calmly, he asked dancers to push past their perceived limits. The usual dancer response: “Let me try that again.” Members of New York City Ballet in Justin Peck's \\"Belles-Lettres” (2014), which will return to the repertory for the company’s spring 2016 season. “Justin has this quiet demeanor,” said Lourdes Lopez, artistic director of Miami City Ballet, “but he has this amazing ability to walk into the studio, laugh with the dancers, and then boom!” — dive right into serious work. “The transition is effortless with him.” His manner in rehearsal was the same whether he was working with one dancer or dozens. By slightly lowering or raising his voice, he could shift seamlessly from giving a dancer a subtle note to rearranging major traffic patterns. He seemed aware of everything, and when the dancers took five, he did not, his mind whirring almost visibly as he puzzled out a rhythm with the pianist or consulted with his rehearsal assistant, the City Ballet soloist Craig Hall. Mr. Hall recalled that his faith in Mr. Peck began during the creation of “Year of the Rabbit.” He said, “Justin pulled something out of me that I didn’t know I had in me.” Mr. Hall and Mr. Peck shared a dressing room, and that made a difference. As the principal dancer Amar Ramasar explained, “Being around us constantly, he knows us inside and out.” Mr. Peck agreed. “Seeing the dancers day to day, in class, I discover more layers and details,” he said. It’s unusual for a choreographer at his level to still be dancing. (Mr. Wheeldon, his predecessor as resident choreographer, had retired from performing before taking the position.) But the routine of being a dancer keeps him rooted as more people tug at him. “It makes it easier to say no to stuff,” he said. Besides, there are still pieces in the City Ballet repertory he wants to dance and to learn from the inside: Jerome Robbins’s “Fancy Free”; his favorite ballet, George Balanchine’s “Symphony in Three Movements.” Watching the work of Balanchine and Robbins night after night while he was a student at the School of American Ballet was his education in choreography, he said. His system for making a ballet is self-taught. “Probably nobody else does it the same way,” he said. He spends a lot of time in the studio alone, developing movement on his own body. “I want to make sure I’m thorough,” he said, “going through a certain sequence then veering off in five directions to find the one that musically feels right. If you do that work, you can later act spontaneously with the dancers. You can go off the trail, because you know the trail.” Mr. Peck believes in planning. At the beginning of work on “The Most Incredible Things,” he made super-detailed outlines for his collaborators, replete with references to other art he had in mind. His colleagues report that he was always encouraging them to be more themselves, but showed no hesitation in asking for revision after revision. Mr. Dessner, who praised Mr. Peck for his “sixth sense” about music, summed it up: “He knows what he wants.” One pressure he claims not to feel is the pressure to be Balanchine’s heir. Ballet lovers have been auditioning and rejecting candidates for that role since the master’s death in 1983. “That talk is kind of silly,” he said. “I feel removed from that whole overhead that has haunted this company for decades.” He noted influences from the past in Balanchine’s work and from Balanchine in his own work. “But the art has to keep moving forward,” he said. “That’s sort of why I’m doing this narrative ballet that’s not another ‘Swan Lake.’” Mr. Peck believes that ballet, especially narrative ballet, can benefit from a faster pace, more in accord with how people are now used to absorbing information. “When I saw ‘Hamilton,’” he said, “there was so much information, so fast, I had to keep up with it. I find that quality in art exhilarating.” At the same time, he considers his choreography to be classical and is confused when people say it isn’t. “I’m always having a mental dialogue with myself,” he said, “trying to find the right balance between a classical basis and how we can edge it forward a bit. Every piece changes constantly on that axis from the first rehearsal to the premiere.” Mr. Peck said he is also still figuring out how many projects he should take on, and where. Starting this fall, he plans to focus exclusively on City Ballet for a year. That’s his home, and the buzz there is about how exciting and fresh and awesome it is to be in the company right now because of him. “Everyone believes in Justin,” Mr. Hall said. “Dancers who aren’t involved in one of his pieces get jealous. They’re always peeking in.” “Everyone was happy for him,” Hans Christian Andersen writes at the end of his fairy tale. “And there was no one who was envious. And that was the most incredible thing.” A version of this article appears in print on January 31, 2016, on page AR1 of the New York edition with the headline: Calmly Creating a Kingdom.

As the boat threatened to sink the husband got off, but his wife was trapped in the boat. Instead of freeing his wife and getting her to shore, Graham grabbed Rosie, their pet dog. With Rosie safe and sound, Graham returned for Sheryl. All are doing fine. It's a great story, but it doesn't strike me as especially newsworthy. News is supposed to be about something fairly unique, and recent research suggests that, in the right circumstances, lots of people also would have grabbed their Rosie first. We have strange relationships with our pets. We lavish our pets with adoration and better health care than billions of people receive. We speak to pets with the same high-pitched voices that we use for babies. As an extreme example of our feelings about pets, the Nazis had strict laws that guaranteed the humane treatment of the pets of Jews being shipped to death camps. A recent paper by George Regents University demonstrates this human involvement with pets to an astonishing extent. Participants in the study were told a situation in which a bus is out of control, bearing down on a dog and a human. Which do you save? With responses from more than 500 people, the answer was that it depended: What kind of human and what kind of dog? Everyone would save a brother, grandparent or close friend rather than a strange dog. But when people considered their own dog versus people less connected with them--a distant cousin or a hometown stranger--votes in favor of saving the dog came rolling in.

They argue that she got the big picture right: without her passion and pioneering work, people wouldn’t have recognized the perils of pesticides. But those arguments are hard to square with Dr. Baldwin’s review. Dr. Baldwin led a committee at the National Academy of Sciences studying the impact of pesticides on wildlife. (Yes, scientists were worrying about pesticide dangers long before “Silent Spring.”) In his review, he praised Ms. Carsons’s literary skills and her desire to protect nature. But, he wrote, “Mankind has been engaged in the process of upsetting the balance of nature since the dawn of civilization.” While Ms. Carson imagined life in harmony before DDT, Dr. Baldwin saw that civilization depended on farmers and doctors fighting “an unrelenting war” against insects, parasites and disease. He complained that “Silent Spring” was not a scientific balancing of costs and benefits but rather a “prosecuting attorney’s impassioned plea for action.” Ms. Carson presented DDT as a dangerous human carcinogen, but Dr. Baldwin said the question was open and noted that most scientists “feel that the danger of damage is slight.” He acknowledged that pesticides were sometimes badly misused, but he also quoted an adage: “There are no harmless chemicals, only harmless use of chemicals.” Ms. Carson, though, considered new chemicals to be inherently different. “For the first time in the history of the world,” she wrote, “every human being is now subjected to contact with dangerous chemicals, from the moment of conception until death.” She briefly acknowledged that nature manufactured its own carcinogens, but she said they were “few in number and they belong to that ancient array of forces to which life has been accustomed from the beginning.” The new pesticides, by contrast, were “elixirs of death,” dangerous even in tiny quantities because humans had evolved “no protection” against them and there was “no ‘safe’ dose.” She cited scary figures showing a recent rise in deaths from cancer, but she didn’t consider one of the chief causes: fewer people were dying at young ages from other diseases (including the malaria that persisted in the American South until DDT). When that longevity factor as well as the impact of smoking are removed, the cancer death rate was falling in the decade before “Silent Spring,” and it kept falling in the rest of the century. Why weren’t all of the new poisons killing people? An important clue emerged in the 1980s when the biochemist Bruce Ames tested thousands of chemicals and found that natural compounds were as likely to be carcinogenic as synthetic ones. Dr. Ames found that 99.99 percent of the carcinogens in our diet were natural, which doesn’t mean that we are being poisoned by the natural pesticides in spinach and lettuce. We ingest most carcinogens, natural or synthetic, in such small quantities that they don’t hurt us. Dosage matters, not whether a chemical is natural, just as Dr. Baldwin realized. But scientists like him were no match for Ms. Carson’s rhetoric. DDT became taboo even though there wasn’t evidence that it was carcinogenic (and subsequent studies repeatedly failed to prove harm to humans). It’s often asserted that the severe restrictions on DDT and other pesticides were justified in rich countries like America simply to protect wildlife. But even that is debatable (see www.tierneylab.com), and in any case, the chemophobia inspired by Ms. Carson’s book has been harmful in various ways. The obsession with eliminating minute risks from synthetic chemicals has wasted vast sums of money: environmental experts complain that the billions spent cleaning up Superfund sites would be better spent on more serious dangers. The human costs have been horrific in the poor countries where malaria returned after DDT spraying was abandoned. Malariologists have made a little headway recently in restoring this weapon against the disease, but they’ve had to fight against Ms. Carson’s disciples who still divide the world into good and bad chemicals, with DDT in their fearsome “dirty dozen.” Ms. Carson didn’t urge an outright ban on DDT, but she tried to downplay its effectiveness against malaria and refused to acknowledge what it had accomplished. As Dr. Baldwin wrote, “No estimates are made of the countless lives that have been saved because of the destruction of insect vectors of disease.” He predicted correctly that people in poor countries would suffer from hunger and disease if they were denied the pesticides that had enabled wealthy nations to increase food production and eliminate scourges. But Dr. Baldwin did make one mistake. After expressing the hope “that someone with Rachel Carson’s ability will write a companion volume dramatizing the improvements in human health and welfare derived from the use of pesticides,” he predicted that “such a story would be far more dramatic than the one told by Miss Carson in ‘Silent Spring.’ ” That never happened, and I can’t imagine any writer turning such good news into a story more dramatic than Ms. Carson’s apocalypse in Eden. A best-seller titled “Happy Spring”? I don’t think so.

As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning. In the winter of 1987, Minneapolis car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) is desperate for money; repayment is due on a large GMAC loan that he fraudulently collateralized with nonexistent dealership vehicles. Dealership mechanic Shep Proudfoot (Steve Reevis), an ex-convict, refers him to an old partner in crime, Gaear Grimsrud (Stormare). Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota, where he hires Gaear and Carl Showalter (Buscemi) to kidnap his wife, Jean (Kristin Rudr d), and extort a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, Wade Gustafson (Presnell). He gives the men a new car from his dealership's lot, and promises to split the 80,000 ransom with them. Back in Minneapolis, Jerry pitches Gustafson a lucrative real estate deal; when Gustafson agrees to front the money, Jerry attempts to call off the kidnapping, but it is already in motion. Then, he learns that Gustafson plans to make the deal himself, leaving Jerry a paltry finder's fee. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean in Minneapolis as planned. While transporting her to their remote cabin hideout, a state trooper pulls them over outside Brainerd, Minnesota for driving without the required temporary tags over the dealership plates. After Carl tries and fails to bribe the trooper, Gaear kills him. When two passing eyewitnesses spot Carl disposing of the body, Gaear kills them as well. The following morning, Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand), who is seven months pregnant, initiates a homicide investigation. Records from the murdered trooper's last traffic stop, along with a phone call to Proudfoot, placed at a local truck stop by two suspicious men, lead her to Jerry's dealership, where she questions Jerry and Proudfoot. While in Minneapolis, Marge reconnects with Mike Yanagita (Steve Park), an old classmate who takes her to dinner, tells her that his wife, another classmate, has died, and attempts to seduce her. Jerry informs Gustafson and his accountant, Stan Grossman (Larry Brandenburg), that the kidnappers have demanded 1 million, and will deal only through him. Meanwhile, Carl, in light of the unanticipated complication of three murders, demands that Jerry hand over the entire ransom (which he still believes is 80,000); and GMAC gives Jerry 24 hours to repay their loan or face legal consequences. When the time comes for the money drop, Gustafson decides to deal with the kidnappers himself. At the pre-arranged drop point in a parking garage, he refuses to hand over the cash-filled briefcase to Carl until his daughter is returned. Carl kills Gustafson, takes the briefcase, and flees, but not before taking a bullet in the jaw from Gustafson. When he opens the briefcase, Carl is astounded to discover far more than the anticipated 80,000. He removes that amount to split with Gaear, then stashes the rest, intending to return for it later and keep it for himself. At the hideout, he discovers that Gaear has killed Jean. After a heated argument over who gets the new car that Jerry gave them, Gaear kills Carl as well. During a phone conversation with a mutual friend, Marge learns that Yanagita's dead wife was never his wife, nor is she dead, and that Yanagita is the perpetrator behind a long series of anonymous harassments. Reflecting on Yanagita's treachery and convincing lies, Marge returns to the car dealership and re-questions Jerry, who refuses to cooperate. When she asks to speak to Gustafson, Jerry panics and flees the dealership. After returning to Brainerd, Marge drives to Moose Lake, where she recognizes the dealership car from the dead trooper's description. She finds Gaear feeding the last of Carl's body into a wood chipper. He tries to escape, but Marge shoots him in the leg and arrests him. Meanwhile, North Dakota police track Jerry to a motel outside Bismarck, where he is arrested while attempting to escape through a bathroom window. That night, Marge and her husband, Norm (John Carroll Lynch), discuss Norm's mallard painting, which has been selected as the design for a US postage stamp. Marge is very proud of his achievement, and the two happily anticipate the birth of their child.

Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) Gut Reactions.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"Gregorio administered epinephrine to patients."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"What happens when the wire touches the battery?\\" and the following answer choices: - chemical reaction - The battery glows - heat energy - The battery dies - Electricity flows - Electricity stops - electromagnetic energy - activation energy Now knowing that completing a circuit causes electricity to flow through that circuit and when completing the circuit, just touch the wire to the battery, choose the best answer.

Passage:In the biblical account, Joseph's other son is Manasseh, and Joseph himself is one of the two children of Rachel and Jacob, the other being Benjamin. Biblical scholars regard it as obvious, from their geographic overlap and their treatment in older passages, that originally Ephraim and Manasseh were considered one tribe – that of Joseph. The Book of Revelation, however, accords only Ephraim the tribal name of Joseph. According to several biblical scholars, Benjamin was originally part of the suggested Ephraim-Manasseh single \\"Joseph\\" tribe, but the biblical account of Joseph as his father became lost. A number of biblical scholars suspect that the distinction of the Joseph tribes (including Benjamin) is that they were the only Israelites which went to Egypt and returned, while the main Israelite tribes simply emerged as a subculture from the Canaanites and had remained in Canaan throughout. According to this view, the story of Jacob's visit to Laban to obtain a wife originated as a metaphor for this migration, with the property and family which were gained from Laban representing the gains of the Joseph tribes by the time they returned from Egypt; according to textual scholars, the Jahwist version of the Laban narrative only mentions the Joseph tribes, and Rachel, and does not mention the other tribal matriarchs at all.

At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Now, I have a new situation: Rob is a chemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to devise a technique that would be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests.

It's like a big project to build roads and other important things to help Pakistan and China become better friends and work together. Now, let's try to understand your questions. 1. Why is India trying to sabotage CPEC? Imagine India and Pakistan are two kids who don't always get along. Now, Pakistan has a new friend, China, helping them with their CPEC project. India might feel left out or worried about getting less attention. So India may try to stop or slow down this project to not let Pakistan and China become too powerful together. 2. Why is India frustrated and upset by Pakistan's CPEC? This question is kind of like the first one. India feels upset about the CPEC project because they think Pakistan and China will become better friends, and this might make India feel like a weaker kid on the playground.

Jordan brought Sasha early for their international flight. And I was wondering How would Jordan feel afterwards? A:","output":"To determine how Jordan might feel after dropping Sasha off at the airport, let's consider their situation and feelings step-by-step. Step 1: Consider the friendship. As Jordan and Sasha are close friends, it is reasonable to assume that Jordan might feel some level of sadness or emotional strain because of the separation. Step 2: Reflect on the circumstances. It is an international flight, which could indicate a longer time apart or the possibility of Sasha moving away. This, in turn, may amplify the feelings of sadness and emotional strain. Step 3: Assess Jordan's actions. Jordan brought Sasha early to the airport, which indicates a sense of responsibility and care. This demonstrates that Jordan values their friendship and is proactive in ensuring a smooth experience for Sasha. Step 4: Contemplate the aftermath. After dropping Sasha off, Jordan may feel relief for the task being successfully completed and satisfaction for helping their friend. However, they might also experience loneliness and a sense of loss in the absence of their close friend. Taking all these factors into account, I would say that Jordan likely feels a mix of emotions after dropping Sasha off at the airport. They may feel a sense of accomplishment and relief for completing the task but also sadness and loneliness due to the temporary or prolonged separation from their close friend."},{"instruction":"Translate to German: Legislation that empowers citizens with freedom of expression, free and independent elections, and freedom of association is crucial, and it must be made clear to the public that no one is above the law.

Step 1: Analyze the given choices - The choices given are: smiles, dissonance, accord, band together, and rapport.

Step 3: Choose the most relevant answer - Band together: This phrase implies that people who agree with each other might join forces or unite in some way to act upon their agreement.

Article: Food for thought in the US Before I left for America, everyone warned me to watch my weight because it's easy to put on weight there. That's true. One thing I still cannot _ is the food and drink. Almost every American person loves sodas, especially those full of ice cubes. I remember the first day I came to my host family. When I asked them for a glass of hot water, they all looked at me and thought I was crazy! At my school there's no water dispenser but there's one in each classroom in China. All the American students drink water from taps outside the restrooms that are specially designed for drinking. The water is cold and the school doesn't have hot water. The most popular food here is hamburgers and French chips, which are junk food in China. Most students who eat at school prefer those to salads. They also eat lots of pizzas and hot dogs. As a result, you can always see some really fat people in school. Luckily, my host mom is really a great cook. She always makes food from different countries and eats a balanced meal every day. So I have a lot of fruit and vegetables. At my host family's home, they usually eat biscuits. These old-fashioned biscuits are low in fat and flavored with buttermilk, butter, and a bit of honey. Oh here comes the most interesting thing: the word \\"biscuit\\" in China actually means \\"cracker \\" here. Real biscuits are a kind of soft cake.

I mean, it wasn't packed, thank goodness, but people were coming in like crazy! Quite impressive at the heavy flow of traffic for a Saturday lunch hour. I came in and asked the girl at the front how it works here. She went through how I stand in line, and place my order at the counter and they make the food while I order. There's also a HUGE selection of cold beer as you walk through line that's on ice, along with a great selection of cold side items to go with whatever you eat. I took my time ordering at the register, and felt really comfortable taking my time. No rush or pressure to \\"hurry up\\" and I had a lot of questions about their menu. They had 3 different types of brisket, and I asked what the difference was between all three. The girl told me that one was lean, one was not, and I forget what the third one was. You can go with a half pounder type meal, or a smaller sandwich which is what I had wanted. I went with the Moist Brisket, creamed corn, and a medium drink. Total bill was just 9 and change. I got my food and went to take a seat. Everything here is picnic table style, so your going to end up sitting next to strangers, which I'm fine with. They have BBQ sauce, hot sauce and one or two other items at each end of the picnic tables. If your stuck in the middle, I don't know how you would get the BBQ sauce if its clear at the other end. The Brisket itself was AWESOME! Most, tender and definitely awesome! I totally loved how it tasted, and everything was just right. They also have a HUGE hand washing station for when your done eating. Why do I love this? First, BBQ is messy! You get your hands kinda gross from the sauce and who wants to go into the bathroom just to wash your hands? They have 4 or 5 different nozzles and the water is nice and warm..soap and towels to! right there out in the open! I love it. Here's why I deducted a star. It's going to sound SO DUMB but I think you'll get it. First, there wasn't really any BBQ sauce on the sandwich itself. That's fine because the meat tasted perfect without it. Normally, at other BBQ places, there's a selection of a few different sauces to choose from if you want to dress your meat with sauce. Rudy's only had 2. Regular and spicy. Okay, I'll take that. Here's the catch. The sauce is IMPOSSIBLE to get out of the container! They have this weird nozzle on the sauce container and you must use both hands to get it out...including pounding on the bottom of the bottle and turning it 100% bottoms up! I know what your thinking...the bottle must be empty, right? NO ITS 100% FULL. I got so irritated with it, that I just stopped putting sauce on! I want more sauce! Why does it have to be a major project? Eveyrtime I tried to sauce my sandwich, it became a huge bottle beating project! Basically, they need better nozzles that let more sauce out so I don't have to break the dam thing to put it on my sandwich! argh!!!!! Overall, I would 100% recommend this place! GO EAT HERE.

Born on October 1, 1878, in Adelaide, South Australia, Helen Mayo was a notable figure in Australian medical history. She was a successful medical doctor, medical educator, social reformer, and the first woman elected to an Australian University Council. She studied medicine at the University of Adelaide, where she later became the first female member of the University Council in 1914. Dr. Mayo specialized in the field of pediatrics and established a reputation for her contributions to child and maternal health in Australia. With her dedication to improving public health, she co-founded the School for Mothers (later renamed the Mothers' and Babies' Health Association) in 1909, which provided education and support for new and expectant mothers. The organization was instrumental in significantly reducing maternal and infant mortality rates in the region. In addition to her education and social reform efforts, Dr. Mayo was also a suffragist and a supporter of women's rights. She actively campaigned for women's issues, including equal pay and workplace opportunities, throughout her career.

Step 2: Analyze the negative aspects of the review The reviewer points out that the backlight is not efficient for their eyes due to their age. This could be a potential issue for users who have similar eyesight concerns. Step 3: Compare the positive and negative aspects While the positive features seem to outweigh the negative aspect, the concern about the backlight might be a critical issue for potential buyers with eyesight problems. Based on these considerations, the review would slightly increase the chances of buying the product. However, depending on personal preferences and the importance of the backlight feature to the user, it could also decrease the chances for those who prioritize this aspect."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a statement written in Gujarati.

The decision means that from December 1, cigarettes and tobacco products must be sold in plain olive green packets with graphic health warnings, such as pictures of mouth cancer and other smoking-related illnesses. Although the impact of Australia on their global business is small, the law could have a major effect if it is adopted as a precedent in other countries, especially the fast-growing economies that cigarette firms see as markets of the future. The laws are in line with World Health Organisation recommendations and are being watched closely by countries including Britain, Norway, New Zealand, Canada and India, which are considering similar measures to help fight smoking. British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the laws in Australia's High Court, claiming the rules were unconstitutional because they effectively extinguished their intellectual property rights. In a brief statement, the High Court said a majority of its seven judges believed the laws did not breach Australia's constitution. A full judgment will be released later. The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 1 billion people around the world are regular smokers, with 80 percent in low- and middle-income countries. Shares in tobacco groups dipped lower with Philip Morris down 0.5 percent in New York and BAT off 1.9 percent and Imperial Tobacco down 1.7 in London. Supporters of the measure hailed the legal victory as an important step for public health in Australia and any other countries that may copy it. Australian Attorney-General Nicola Roxon hailed the ruling as \\"a watershed moment for tobacco control around the world\\". \\"The message to the rest of the world is big tobacco can be taken on and beaten,\\" said Roxon, whose father, a smoker, died of cancer when she was 10. \\"Without brave governments willing to take the fight up to big tobacco, they'd still have us believing that tobacco is neither harmful nor addictive,\\" she said after the ruling. According to the global Tobacco Atlas, a report on smoking produced by the World Lung Foundation and the American Cancer Society, 17 percent of male deaths and 14 percent of female deaths in Australia are due to tobacco. \\"We hope other nations follow Australia's lead and eliminate the use of tobacco packaging as a marketing tool, to help reduce the global tobacco death toll -- which is on track to reach half a billion people this century,\\" said Australia's Cancer Council Chief Executive Ian Olver. FIRST OF MANY BLOODY NOSES? Countries with legal systems similar to Australia's may be among the first to try to copy the packaging logo ban. New Zealand's Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia said the decision gave New Zealand more confidence to push ahead with similar measures. In Britain, which is also considering such steps, anti-smoking and health campaigners welcomed the ruling. \\"This is a major victory not just for Australia but for the world and the first of many bloody noses for the tobacco industry on plain packaging. It should encourage the British government to go ahead with legislation,\\" said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of anti-smoking lobby group Action on Smoking and Health. Britain finished a four-month consultation process on plain packaging last week and will now analyze the thousands of responses it has received. It is expected to make a decision on whether to push ahead with legislation later this year. The Department of Health said no decision had been taken, although Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has been quoted as saying \\"we no longer see smoking as part of life\\" and that he wanted tobacco companies to have \\"no business in the UK\\". Canada, meanwhile, has just implemented graphic warning rules and is watching developments in Australia. \\"At this time, the Department is not planning any regulatory action to require plain packaging for tobacco packages. Health Canada continues to review available research on plain packaging as a form of tobacco control and closely monitors plain packaging proposals put forward in other countries, such as Australia,\\" Olivia Caron, a spokeswoman for Health Canada, said. A spread of plain-package laws to emerging markets, such as Brazil, Russia or Indonesia, could threaten cigarette firms' sales growth. In Indonesia, the government said it would like to follow Australia's example. \\"That's excellent ... this is one way to protect the people,\\" Health Minister Nafsiah Mboi told Reuters. However, anti-tobacco campaigner Tulus Abadi, head of the national commission on tobacco control, said there had been little movement from the government on a draft law to include graphic warnings on cigarette packets like those in Australia. Russia's Rospotrebnadzor, the state consumer protection agency, was not available for comment on Wednesday. But plain-package laws are not likely to come to that country anytime soon, one Russian anti-tobacco analyst said. \\"For now, we (Russia) would not be able to get rid of companies' logos from cigarette packages,\\" said Dmitry Yanin, a Russian anti-tobacco activist and head of the International Confederation of Consumer Societies. \\"But we do hope the ruling will help us implement a law that calls for introduction of graphic images of the effects of smoking on cigarette packages.\\" CHALLENGES Tobacco firms say plain packaging laws violate their intellectual property rights and will stimulate a black market in fake or illegally imported cigarettes. \\"It's still a bad law that will only benefit organized crime groups, which sell illegal tobacco on our streets,\\" British American Tobacco Australia spokesman Scott McIntyre said after the decision. However, he said the firm would comply. Firms can also use free trade arguments against plain packaging laws. Australia is already fighting trade complaints in the World Trade Organization (WTO) from Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, which claim the laws unfairly restrict trade, although their trade with Australia is negligible. Philip Morris said it would launch a legal challenge against the laws under a bilateral Australia-Hong Kong investment agreement. \\"There is still a long way to go before all the legal questions about plain packaging are fully explored and answered,\\" Philip Morris spokesman Chris Argent said in a statement.

So we can simplify 7w - 20w to -13w. So, our equation becomes 0 = -13w - 39. Now, we want to set -13w equal to 39. If we get rid of the negative sign, we can think of it as trying to find out how many times we can fit 13 into 39. So, we do 39 divided by 13, and that equals 3. So, if our puzzle piece fits 3 times, then w equals 3!

Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. and the situation: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB.

Successful and happy people have an idea of how their life should be and they set lots of goals to help them succeed. By setting goals you are taking control of your life. It's like having a map to show you where you want to go. Think of it this way. There are two drivers. One has a destination in mind which is laid out for her on a map. She can drive straight there without any wasted time or wrong turns. The other driver has no goal or destination or map. She starts off at the same time from the same place as the first driver, but she drives without an aim around, never getting anywhere, just using up gas and oil. Which driver do you want to be? Winners in life set goals and follow through on them. Winners decide what they want in life and then get there by making plans and setting goals. Unsuccessful people just let life happen by accident. Goals aren't difficult to set--and they aren't difficult to reach. It's up to you to find out what your goals and ideals really are.

I’ve always wanted to run for office. Maybe governor one day. Would I be able to avoid the waves of bipartisanship, and actually do what I believe is the best for the people of my state. Or would I collapse under the political pressures and sign up for agreements I know in my heart and mind won’t help the people. Only time will tell. I just don’t see a point. I actually have many goals, but I struggle to see the overall point of accomplishing any of it. Especially seeing as anything I do will be lost in the ink-blots of history.

Article: Some days, don't you think, \\"Wouldn't it be nice if the laundry would just do itself?\\" Self-cleaning clothes may sound crazy. But Australian researchers have found a way to make something like this possible! A team at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, found a way to put special nanostructures into clothing, which can then clean the clothes. When sunlight hits the nanostructures, they break down the dirt and stains that don't belong on your clothes. The nanostructures don't break down the actual clothing because cotton and the other clothing materials are too strong to be broken down. According to CNN, the researchers cover the clothing in a solution made of silver and copper nanostructures. All it takes is 40 minutes of sunlight and your clothes will look as good as new. So if you spill on yourself during lunch, you can step outside for a walk, and it will be clean by the time you go inside. It not only makes your life easier, but it can also be good for the environment. According to the US Department of Energy, the average load of laundry uses about 25 gallons (about 94 liters) of water. Water is a very important resource, so using less of it to wash clothes is better for the environment. But one of the scientists at RMIT University knows more needs to be done. \\"There's more work to do before we can start throwing out our washing machines,\\" said Dr Rajesh Ramanathan, \\"but this is a strong foundation .\\" So what's the next step? Ramanathan wants to either start selling the solution by itself or convincing clothing makers to treat the clothing with the solution while clothes are being made. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Options: A: Silver and copper sell well. B: The solution is not put into practice. C: Clothing makes certainly like the solution. D: We don't need washing machines any more.","output":"From the passage, we can learn that B: The solution is not put into practice. The researchers have developed a solution using silver and copper nanostructures that can clean clothes when exposed to sunlight, but it hasn't been implemented yet, and washing machines are still needed. Dr. Rajesh Ramanathan mentioned that there is more work to be done before washing machines can be thrown out."},{"instruction":"A splendid example of how Hollywood could (and still can) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up. In the case of \\"the Big Sky,\\" writer Dudley Nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the Pulitzer prize-winning author, A.B. Guthrie. In so doing, they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation. The epic nature of Guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character, Boone Caudill, from a naive, Kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor/mountain man, has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author's intent. In the movie version, Boone's presence is nothing except underwhelming. Intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give Guthrie's novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever. Most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the Zeb Calloway character, who was an incidental, minor character in the book, only occupying a handful of pages. On the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, Dick Summers, the veteran pioneer, is missing altogether!!! It is also apparent that director Hawks decided the Zeb character in the movie, played by actor Hunnicutt, wasn't irritating enough. So Zeb/Hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious, voice-over narration that is the Hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing, editing, and direction. Some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based (William Wyler's \\"Ben-Hur\\" is an excellent example). But this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself. The story is dull and clichéd, and the characters - at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script - are just shallow and boring shadows of Guthrie's literary vision. And unfortunately, Kirk Douglas' star appeal, which could have helped lift this film, was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given. If you can believe it, the film version of Guthrie's Pulitzer prize-winning sequel, \\"The Way West,\\" also starring Kirk, is even worse. In my opinion, \\"The Big Sky\\" further solidifies Howard Hawks' place as one of the most overrated, tepid directors in the history of cinema. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as strongly negative and deeply disappointed. The reviewer criticizes Hollywood's adaptation of \\"the Big Sky,\\" expressing frustration over the significant alterations made to the original story and the subpar quality of the film as a whole. The reviewer also views the film as a missed opportunity to showcase the potential of the source material."},{"instruction":"Eduardo is a teacher.

Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment. \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. What is probably true about Africa?

The use of words like \\"stupid\\" and \\"pointless\\" indicates a sense of disapproval and suggests that the critic found no redeeming qualities in the film. In a more detailed analysis, the critic's choice of the word \\"stupid\\" implies that the movie may have lacked intelligence, originality, or creativity. The plot might have been poorly thought out, the dialogue might have been shallow or the characters could have been underdeveloped or unbelievable. This critique may also suggest that the movie had humor or situations that were deemed to be in poor taste or offensive. Additionally, referring to the movie as \\"pointless\\" suggests that the critic found no meaningful message or purpose in the film. The audience may not have been able to relate to the characters or connect to any themes presented. This important aspect indicates that the critic believed the movie failed to make an emotional, intellectual, or artistic impact on its audience. It is possible that the critic's choice of these two words also indicates that the movie did not live up to its potential or that it was a wasted opportunity. The critic might have been disappointed by an otherwise talented cast or crew that seemed to have misused their skills on this project.

In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904.

Movie title: The Grifters Movie plot: The film opens with a voiceover (done by producer Martin Scorsese) where it's explained that bettors at racetracks will deliberately bet high on certain horses to lower the odds and earn more money.Lily Dillon (Angelica Houston) works for a Baltimore gangster, Bobo Justus, who has her place such bets on horse races. After collecting the earnings, Lily opens a hidden compartment in the trunk of her car and skims several thousand dollars from the payoffs and hides it among the other money she's stolen from Bobo. One of Bobo's associates calls her in New Mexico and tells her to go to the downs in La Jolla. Lily agrees and says she'll stop by Los Angeles to see her son.In L.A., Roy Dillon (John Cusak), Lily's 25-year-old estranged son, works several small-time cons. One of his tricks is showing a bartender a 20 bill then slyly switching it for a ten, fooling the bartender in to giving him change for a 20. One day, Roy is caught by one of his marks who seizes his arm and jabs him hard in the chest with the end of a club. Roy manages to walk out of the bar and make it home. While he lays in pain in his bed, he dreams of his first meeting with the man, Mintz, who taught him how to con people. Mintz' advice to Roy, and one of his steadfast rules, was to never take a partner in a con - it can only end in ruin.That night Roy's girlfriend, Myra Langtry (Annette Benning), a grifter herself, stops by and they have sex. The next day, Lily shows up at Roy's place and the two have a tense conversation where Roy points out that Lily hasn't contacted him in eight years. The conversation becomes more intense, with Roy feeling great resentment over their falling out. Lily notices that Roy is incredibly ill and feverish and has him taken to a hospital where he's treated for internal bleeding to the injury to his abdomen and lives.Both Lily and Myra visit Roy in the hospital and there is instant animosity between the two.

The answer to this question is:","output":"In the movie \\"The Grifters,\\" the character of Cole is not explicitly mentioned in the provided plot summary. The main characters listed are Lily Dillon played by Angelica Huston, Roy Dillon portrayed by John Cusack, and Myra Langtry played by Annette Bening. The film is about the gritty world of con artists and grifters, with a core focus on the complex relationships between these three characters and the inevitable consequences of their actions.

During April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen discussed these paradoxes: \\"Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\\" What happened soon after the massive credit crunch hit?","output":"Soon after the massive credit crunch hit, the United States experienced a recession. This recession further deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, causing financial institutions to suffer significant credit losses. The economy became caught in an adverse feedback loop, leading to a widespread process of balance sheet deleveraging that affected nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers cut back on their purchases, especially of durable goods, and focused on building their savings. Businesses canceled planned investments and laid off workers in an effort to preserve cash. As a result, financial institutions began shrinking their assets in order to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the ongoing economic storm.

In 1917 Sun Yat-sen had become commander-in-chief of a rival military government in Guangzhou in collaboration with southern warlords. Sun's efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were ignored, however, and in 1920 he turned to the Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. But for political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How did the Soviets try to befriend the Chinese Revolutionist?","output":"The Soviets tried to befriend the Chinese Revolutionists through a combination of political, ideological, and practical means aimed at strengthening their relationship and collaboration. These efforts were directed at supporting both Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) and the newly established Chinese Communist Party (CCP). 1. Political and ideological alliance: To foster closer ties with the Chinese Revolutionists, the Soviets highlighted their shared revolutionary goals, anti-imperialist sentiments, and aspirations for national rejuvenation. Both parties sought to challenge the hegemony of Western powers and create a new world order based on socialist principles. By emphasizing these shared objectives, the Soviets aimed to forge a strong and lasting alliance with the Chinese revolutionaries. 2. Criticism of Western imperialism: The Soviet Union wanted to differentiate itself from the Western powers, which had a history of exploiting and dominating China. By launching scathing attacks on Western imperialism and offering an alternative vision for international cooperation based on socialist principles, the Soviets aimed to win the trust and support of Chinese revolutionaries. 3. Material support and military assistance: The Soviet Union provided the Chinese revolutionaries with financial aid, military equipment, training, and advisors to enhance their capabilities in their struggle against the warlords and other domestic enemies. This practical support greatly benefited the Chinese revolutionary cause and deepened their appreciation of the Soviet Union as a strategic partner and ally. 4. Advice and guidance: The Soviets shared theoretical, organizational, and strategic expertise in revolutionary theory and action that benefited both the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party. By helping them build their respective organizations, they aimed to create stronger, more effective partners for advancing their mutual interests. 5. Fostering cooperation between the Kuomintang and CCP: The Soviet Union encouraged and facilitated collaboration between Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party, which was important to bringing them together as allies in the fight against their common enemies. This cooperation led to the formation of the First United Front in 1924, which allowed these two parties to coordinate their efforts more effectively. Overall, the Soviet Union's attempts to befriend the Chinese Revolutionists were multifaceted and focused on both ideological and practical aspects. They sought to build a strong relationship based on mutual interests, shared revolutionary goals, and the desire to challenge Western imperialism. This approach fostered a strong alliance between the Chinese revolutionaries and the Soviet Union, which significantly influenced China's political development during the early 20th century."},{"instruction":"- Water is absorbed through roots - Chloroplast cells in leaves contain chlorophyll - Chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight - Energy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen gets released into atmosphere - Hydrogen and carbon dioxide used to create glucose - Glucose is food for plants.

However, prior to this break-up, Standard Oil had a firm grip over various areas, controlling more than 80 percent of the share in some regions. In this article, we will explore the regions in which Standard Oil held its massive share and discuss the context behind the company's significance. Step 1: Setting the Stage - Dominance of Standard Oil: In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Standard Oil, founded by John D. Rockefeller, was the largest and most powerful oil corporation in the United States. The company pioneered various business tactics such as horizontal and vertical integration, which allowed them to control key elements of the oil industry, from drilling to refining and marketing. By using aggressive strategies such as undercutting prices and buying out competitors, Standard Oil secured its dominion over the industry. Step 2: Identifying the Regions: In 1911, prior to the company’s break-up, Standard Oil controlled more than 80 percent of the market shares in several areas. These regions included: a. New England: Standard Oil's control over this northeastern area of the United States was paramount, and it was able to assemble a strong distribution network across the region. b. Mid-Atlantic States: Home to many prominent oil refineries and processing facilities, the importance of this region cannot be overstated. Standard Oil owned numerous refineries and storage facilities in this region, allowing them to efficiently process and distribute oil. c. The Midwest: The Midwest states provided fertile ground for Standard Oil to both consolidate its operations and expand its reach in the industry. With a vast network of pipelines and distribution centers, the company maintained a stronghold on the oil market in this region. d. The Pacific Coast: With its access to international markets, the West Coast was an essential asset for Standard Oil. The company had control over a significant portion of refining capacity, ensuring a strong influence on pricing and market availability in the area. Step 3: Understanding the Impact of Standard Oil's Control In these areas, the dominance of Standard Oil led to a near-monopoly on the oil and kerosene market, enabling them to dictate prices and control supply. This eventually drew the attention of regulators, who were increasingly concerned about the power Standard Oil wielded in the American economy. Consequently, it was this intensive control that ultimately led to the antitrust suit against the company. Conclusion: In 1911, Standard Oil's influence stretched far and wide, with a control of more than 80 percent of the share in key regions such as New England, Mid-Atlantic States, the Midwest, and the Pacific Coast. This monopolistic grip on the market was eventually challenged by antitrust regulators, culminating in the landmark Supreme Court decision to break up Standard Oil. The case of Standard Oil serves as a significant historical lesson in the importance of market competition and the consequences of unchecked corporate power."},{"instruction":"In the United States, botanist Asa Gray an American colleague of Darwin negotiated with a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, but learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning to exploit the absence of international copyright to print Origin.

Jack Doyle. PUBLISHED:. 19:54 EST, 23 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:20 EST, 24 October 2013. They sound like fairly obvious requirements for any employee, let alone an upholder of the law: Don’t turn up for work drunk; don’t have sex on duty; be honest. The police force, however, thinks otherwise. So much so, in fact, that those three instructions are to be issued to all officers in a new ten-point code. Other parts of the code tell police that they should ‘respect and obey the law’, act with integrity at all times and not abuse their positions. New code: Police officers will have to abide by the new ten-point plan. Ethics: Mrs May used the speech at The College of Policing Conference in Bramshill near Hook in Hampshire to set out a new code for all police officers. The code is to be introduced after a. series of scandals which have shaken public confidence in the force,. including the Plebgate row and the investigation into the Hillsborough. disaster. But critics said. telling officers not to break the law or be corrupt – and reminding them. to be courteous to the public – was a ‘statement of the blindingly. obvious’. The draft Code of Ethics was published yesterday by the. College of Policing, which was created up to set and maintain standards. for policing in England and Wales. It. was endorsed by Home Secretary Theresa May, who said it was. ‘astonishing’ that police had not had an explicit code of ethics before. The ten headings include honesty and integrity, courtesy towards the public, and equality and diversity. Under. the latter, officers are told to uphold the Human Rights Act, while. under ‘fitness for work’ officers are told to not make themselves ‘unfit. or impaired for duty as a result of drinking alcohol’ or using drugs. The. ‘work and responsibilities’ section includes an edict to ‘maintain. strictly professional behaviour when on duty, including not engaging in. sexual conduct’. Officers. are also told not to ‘use your professional position to establish or. pursue a sexual or improper emotional relationship’ with a ‘vulnerable’ person. The IPCC was given more powers in December 2012 for a probe into the Hillsborough Disaster. The code also. includes a new obligation on officers to report or challenge any of. their colleagues who fall below the standards of the code. Chief. Constable Alex Marshall, the head of the College of Policing, said:. ‘It’s right to spell out in plain language what’s expected of people and. also we have to learn lessons from the past.’ He. added: ‘We have a code of ethics for doctors, for lawyers for all the. serious professions and I don’t think they say they don’t need it. written down.’ He also accepted some individual officers had ‘let us. down’ in the past with their conduct. But. critics pointed to the oath which all police constables already have to. take. In it, they swear to serve the Queen with fairness, integrity,. diligence and to accord equal respect to ‘all people’. Gerard. Batten, of UKIP, said: ‘Aren’t these things that the police are. supposed to have been doing on duty since 1829 when the first police. force was set up? Do they know something we don’t that they feel the. need to re-state ten points of the blindingly obvious?’ Highlights:","output":"1.

Generally, this expression of thoughts and feelings has been in the form of oral speech. When there is a spoken language problem, communication can be carried out through sign language, in which gestures stand for letters, words, and ideas. Tourists and people unable to hear or speak have often had to turn to this form of expression. When gestures describe words or ideas, they can often be used internationally. When used for spelling words however, where each gesture stands for a single letter, people must share the same written language. Body language sends ideas or thoughts by certain actions, either meaningfully or not. A wink can be a way of showing that the person is only joking. A nod means agreement, while shaking the head indicates disagreement. Other forms of language can be found in Braille (a reading system of raised dots read with the fingertips used by the blind), signal flags, Morse code, and smoke signals. Road maps and picture signs also guide and warn people. While language is the most common form of communication, other systems and techniques also express human thoughts and feelings.

Writing a brief sentence involves focusing on the main idea you want to convey while minimizing the use of unnecessary words that may make the message obscure or confusing. To achieve this conciseness, one must keep the sentence structure simple, use strong, specific verbs and nouns, and avoid redundancies. A great way to structure a brief sentence is by following the subject-verb-object format, where one presents the most pertinent information in an easily comprehensible manner. Furthermore, eliminating wordy phrases and overusing adverbs and adjectives can considerably improve the quality of a brief sentence. Employing these practices often results in clear and concise communication that effectively conveys the intended meaning. The art of brevity in communication is of paramount importance in our fast-paced world where attention spans are continually shrinking. Crafting an exquisite brief sentence requires skill and practice, with the reward being that readers and listeners can grasp the message effortlessly. Brevity serves as an act of courtesy to one's audience, acknowledging that their time is valuable and hence conveying information in a concise manner. Moreover, short sentences can leave a lasting impression due to their simplicity and memorability. In sum, creating a brief sentence is an art that combines simplicity and clarity in a manner that delivers the intended message concisely. Remember to focus on the most important information, use the subject-verb-object format, avoid redundancies, and eschew extraneous words. By prioritizing the art of brevity in your communication, you optimize your message for the time constraints and attention spans of your audience, cultivating more effective and memorable exchanges."},{"instruction":"Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = Giraffe, eatType = pub, food = Italian, area = riverside Sentence:","output":"Introducing the Giraffe, a vibrant riverside pub with an exquisite menu offering a delightful fusion of traditional Italian cuisine, where you are invited to unwind and enjoy breathtaking views while savoring every bite in this magnificent culinary hotspot."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: Check with your state or national government's business regulatory agency to find out what type of licensing is required for you to practice as an independent sales rep in your area.

To be well disciplined is to have learned to live in accordance with the sensible rules and regulations that society has set up for the behavior of its members. Unless the child learns from each disciplinary situation how better to govern his conduct, effective discipline has not been developed. Parents must accept for themselves the idea that successful discipline results in learning. When they approach situations in which a child must adapt themselves to demands made upon them as learning situations, many problems usually thought of in connection with discipline disappear. Unfortunately, the word discipline has come to have other less constructive meanings. Far too often discipline is thought of as punishment. To many people, to discipline a child means to spank him or use some other method of punishment. Such people consider discipline a way of either keeping a child from doing something or of forcing him to do something. It is the task of parents to build within themselves and within the children with whom they live this capacity for self-direction, based upon an understanding of what is required of individuals in a democratic society. This means learning to act in those ways known to be necessary for the \\"good life\\", not for one's self alone but also for others. Developing the capacity for self-discipline in a child is a long, slow process. Much patience is required on the part of the parents. During this development, it is important that the child's self- confidence and comfortable acceptance of himself should never be sacrificed in a disciplinary battle; instead it should be increased through the ways in which his parents meet disciplinary situations. Many parents show a good deal of impatience if the little child does not rapidly learn how to keep clean, eat well, be orderly, and do what he is told. They are so eager for him to achieve these things that they seem to try to push him rapidly through his baby period. They seem also to think that learning to do these things...

Wildlife photographer Pickett Smith is taking photographs of the local flora and fauna as he canoes through a swamp surrounding an island containing the affluent mansion estate of the wealthy and influential Crockett family. Also evident throughout the swamp are numerous indicators of pollution, which Pickett believes are connected to pesticide use on the island plantation. After Clint Crockett accidentally tips over Smith's canoe, he and his sister Karen escort Smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire Crockett family. The grouchy, wheelchair-bound patriarch Jason intends on spending the next day enjoying both the 4th of July and his own birthday celebrations uninterrupted. Due to the mutual dislike of the fauna around the mansion, Jason sends a man named Grover to spray pesticide in order to get rid of the frogs. Pickett later discovers Grover's corpse covered in snakebites in the swamp not far from the house. Despite this warning, Jason continues with his celebrations the next day. Early next morning, Michael Martindale sets out to check on a possible downed telephone line. He accidentally shoots himself in the leg and is rendered immobile by strange white moss hanging down from the surrounding trees. Tarantulas descend from the branches and kill him.

It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... Why did North Korea have a chance at sanction relief A. not enough information B. Because they may denuclearize C. Because they have 20 million D. Because they meet with Trump The answer is:","output":"B.

Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood.

Carmen never seems to stop thinking about work and tends to ignore him. Carmen asks Dale, her boss to allow her to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional Polish village of Alvania, the man killed at the beginning of the film. She also mentions that the luggage of all the missing tourists ends up being found all around rural parts of central Europe. Dale isn't interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time and does not give her permission to go. Instead, he would rather have her investigate why a farmer's bees go missing. Carmen and her intern Sara visit Eric's mother, Laura. Laura tells them that she has tried to get the help of both the Polish and the American Police. However, they are unwilling or too busy to help her.

Premise: \\"The big man, face puffy from Jon's beatings, dropped the broken spear and drew a heavy slaughtering knife.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The big man fell to the ground, knocked unconscious by Jon's beating.\\" The premise communicates several pieces of information: 1. There's a big man involved in the event. 2. The big man's face is puffy as a result of Jon's beatings, implying that he was subjected to physical violence by Jon. 3. The big man dropped a broken spear, which could have been the result of the fight or his weapon before the altercation. 4. The big man has drawn a heavy slaughtering knife, indicating that he is preparing to continue the fight, or at least, defend himself with another weapon. Now, let's examine the information within the hypothesis: 1. The big man fell to the ground, suggesting inactivity or incapacitation. 2. The cause of the big man's fall is attributed to being knocked unconscious by Jon's beating, connecting the premise's mention of Jon's physical violence. The critical difference between the premise and hypothesis is that the premise demonstrates the big man's continued participation in the fight or interaction, while the hypothesis assumes that Jon's beatings rendered the big man unconscious and incapacitated. Therefore, based on the information presented in the premise, it does not entail the hypothesis \\"The big man fell to the ground, knocked unconscious by Jon's beating.\\" The premise suggests that despite being beaten by Jon, the big man is still actively engaged in the situation and has not been knocked unconscious. Ideally, for the hypothesis to be entailed by the premise, both statements must align logically, and the premise should contain enough information to make the hypothesis a reasonable and necessary conclusion.

In what city did the seial killer, upon whom Dennis Cooper's \\"Jerk\\" is based, commit his murders? A:","output":"Dennis Cooper's \\"Jerk\\" is a work of fiction inspired by real-life serial killer Dean Corll. Dean Corll, also known as the \\"Candy Man\\" or the \\"Pied Piper,\\" committed his murders primarily in and around Houston, Texas. Dean Corll, together with his accomplices Elmer Wayne Henley, Jr. and David Owen Brooks, kidnapped, raped, tortured, and murdered at least 28 young men and boys between 1970 and 1973. He gained the moniker \\"Candy Man\\" because of his family's candy factory, which also served as a location where he would lure some of his intended victims. The murders committed by this group are commonly referred to as the \\"Houston Mass Murders.\\" In \\"Jerk,\\" Cooper draws from the disturbing realities of Dean Corll's actions, adding his own artistic twist with an experimental approach to storytelling. The narrative is told in the form of a puppet show, where the puppets act out and depict key events in the life of the serial killer and his accomplices. The selection of Houston as the primary setting for Dean Corll's horrific crimes might stem from a combination of factors. For one, it is the largest city in the state of Texas, which increases the likelihood of potential victims. Additionally, its nature as a thriving city full of economic opportunities might have facilitated the attraction and luring of unsuspecting young people. Lastly, Corll had a personal connection to Houston—he was residing in the area while carrying out these atrocities, and as mentioned earlier, his family operated a candy business based in the city. In conclusion, Dennis Cooper's \\"Jerk\\" bases its story on the real-life events of serial killer Dean Corll, who perpetrated his gruesome acts primarily in the city of Houston, Texas. Cooper's fictional work offers readers a chilling and thought-provoking perspective on the macabre events surrounding Corll's life and the tragic fate of his victims."},{"instruction":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Honky Tonk music was not popular The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music, replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with \\"smooth strings and choruses\\", \\"sophisticated background vocals\\" and \\"smooth tempos\\".

The temblor caused damage to businesses -- mostly spilled merchandise and a few shattered windows. Friday night, dozens of dwellings were red-tagged as officials looked for structural damage. Officials in the cities hardest hit -- Fullerton, Brea and La Habra -- have not yet released damage estimates. It appears the damage was modest, and there were no serious injuries. About 50 residents were let back into their Fullerton apartment units, which had been red-tagged Friday night after the 5.1 earthquake near La Habra, according to Fullerton Fire Battalion Chief John Stokes. City building department inspectors were out in force Saturday to examine the 20 units at the building on Associated Road. They were deemed safe. Elsewhere in the city, about 19 residents in six single-family homes across northern Fullerton remained displaced, Stokes said. Most appeared to be staying with friends or relatives after a nearby shelter at a La Habra community center was closed by the Red Cross due to lack of requests for assistance. About 13 water line breaks were reported in Fullerton after Friday's quake, including three ruptures under city streets. By Saturday night, they had all been repaired, Stokes said. In Buena Park, a 60-year-old man was transported to an area hospital with minor injuries after a TV toppled on him, Schultz said. Is your home earthquake ready? For most, the biggest headache was clearing away the aftermath of the quake, which was preceded and followed by a series of smaller nerve-rattling temblors that continued into Saturday. About 2:30 p.m., a shallow magnitude 4.1 earthquake hit the nearby Rowland Heights area but no damage or major injuries were reported. Friday night's shaking left scattered damage across the La Habra area, near the quake's epicenter, hitting houses, apartments and businesses as well as street lights that were left dangling precariously. \\"From 20 to 30 businesses suffered broken plate-glass windows, many of them along Whittier Boulevard,\\" La Habra Police Sgt.

There was broken glass in every room and some cracks in the home's stucco, he said. \\"We spent most of the night just trying to clean it up so the kids wouldn't wake up in the morning and be reminded of it,\\" he said. Their home on Canyon Drive had been without water since early Saturday, when a city crew shut off a broken water main. For most of the night, a geyser 75 feet tall spilled into a giant birdbath-like depression formed when the asphalt dipped, he said.

The Puente Hills thrust fault, which brought Friday night’s magnitude-5.1 quake centered in La Habra and well over 100 aftershocks by Sunday, stretches from northern Orange County under downtown Los Angeles into Hollywood — a heavily populated swath of the Los Angeles area. A magnitude-7.5 earthquake along that fault could prove more catastrophic than one along the San Andreas, which runs along the outskirts of metropolitan Southern California, seismologists said. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that such a quake along the Puente Hills fault could kill 3,000 to 18,000 people and cause up to 250 billion in damage. In contrast, a larger magnitude 8 quake along the San Andreas would cause an estimated 1,800 deaths. In 1987, the fault caused the Whittier Narrows earthquake. Still considered moderate at magnitude 5.9, that quake killed eight people and did more than 350 million in damage. Part of the problem with the potential damage is that the fault runs near so many vulnerable older buildings, many made of concrete, in downtown Los Angeles and Hollywood. And because the fault, discovered in 1999, is horizontal, heavy reverberations are likely to be felt over a wide area. The shaking from a 7.5 quake in the center of urban Los Angeles could be so intense it would lift heavy objects in the air, like the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake in Northern California, where the shaking was so bad “we found an upside-down grand piano,” USGS Seismologist Lucy Jones told the Los Angeles Times. That would “hit all of downtown,” Jones said. “And everywhere from La Habra to Hollywood.” Reporting for KCAL9, Brittney Hopper talked to an expert who told her that all the recent quakes we are having are actually causing seismologists more concern. Thomas Jordan, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center says experts are studying the recent earthquakes very closely. “We can’t predict earthquakes,” he said, “but you know, I’d say we’re a little bit nervous.” Like Jones, Jordan does not want to see a major quake hit the Puente Hills fault. “It would be very damaging to central Los Angeles,” he said, “An earthquake engineer once told me this could be the earthquake from Hell.” Jordan also says it’s a myth that big quakes — like Friday’s 5.1 in La Habra — release the stress on faults. “They don’t relieve the pressures that cause earthquakes very much and more frequently, they’re actually associated with bigger earthquakes,” Jordan said.

There were no \\"User Prohibited Options\\" where content protection code instructs the player to refuse commands to skip a specific part (such as fast forwarding through copyright warnings). (Some DVD players, particularly higher-end units, do have the ability to ignore the blocking code and play the video without restrictions, but this feature is not common in the usual consumer market.) What is the answer to this question: How does LaserDisc operation vary from DVD?","output":"To answer the question on how LaserDisc operation varies from DVD, let's break down the information from the article step by step and compare the two: 1. Control over playback process: LaserDisc players provide a great degree of control over the playback process, allowing users to execute pause, fast-forward, and fast-reverse commands without restrictions. DVD players may enforce \\"User Prohibited Options\\" where content protection code restricts certain playback commands such as fast-forwarding through copyright warnings. 2. Transport mechanism and command obedience: In LaserDisc players, the transport mechanism generally obeys all user commands, except in cases of malfunctions. However, DVDs may have limitations due to content protection codes which instruct the player to refuse specific commands in certain parts of the video. 3. Compliance with content protection restrictions: Some higher-end DVD players can bypass content protection restrictions and play the video without limitations, but this feature is not commonly found in the usual consumer market. LaserDisc players do not impose such restrictions on command execution. In summary, LaserDisc operation varies from DVD operation mainly in terms of user control over the playback process, command obedience, and compliance with content protection restrictions. LaserDisc players generally provide more control to the user and do not enforce content protection limitations, while DVD players may enforce restrictions based on content protection codes and limit user commands."},{"instruction":"1.

Established in 1895 by Léon Gaumont, it marks the beginning of the film industry's journey, playing a significant role in the evolution and history of cinema. Gaumont Film Company is the first major film studio and was created only a few years after the invention of moving pictures by the Lumière Brothers in 1895. Due to its inception in the early development of cinema, Gaumont has been able to influence and contribute to the growth of this art form. The initial focus of Gaumont Film Company was on the manufacturing and sales of film projection equipment. Léon Gaumont, an inventor and engineer himself, worked on creating and improving projectors, cameras, and other film-related machinery. The company, under Gaumont's leadership, produced various types of cameras, including the Chrono-Gaumont and the Biographe-Gaumont. With the growth of the film industry, Gaumont set its sights on producing films. The company brought Alice Guy-Blaché into the fold, one of the earliest female film directors in history, who directed hundreds of short films for Gaumont before moving to the United States. This partnership led Gaumont Film Company to pioneer various filmmaking techniques, such as synchronized sound and colorization of films. In the early 20th century, Gaumont continued to make innovative strides in the film industry by developing the first newsreel and inventing the concept of a movie trailer. The company also established the Gaumont-Palace in Paris, a grand movie theater boasting the largest cinema screen in Europe at that time. Gaumont's influence extended to international markets, with offices opening in various countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States. Throughout its history, Gaumont Film Company produced and distributed many ground-breaking and iconic films, including works by celebrated filmmakers like Abel Gance, Jean Vigo, and Federico Fellini. The company maintained relevance by adapting to the changing landscape of the film industry, embracing the digital era, and expanding into television production. In conclusion, Gaumont Film Company holds the title of the world's oldest film studio. Established in France in 1895 by Léon Gaumont, it has been a fundamental component in the evolution of the film industry, contributing to technological advancements and trailblazing the way for future filmmakers. Gaumont Film Company's rich history is a testament to its enduring significance in the world of cinema."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: While on a road trip near El Paso, Texas, Michael, Margaret, their young daughter Debbie, and their dog, Peppy, search for the \\"Valley Lodge.\\" Michael and his family finally reach a house which is tended by the bizarre, satyr-like Torgo, who takes care of the house \\"while the Master is away.\\" Michael and Margaret ask Torgo for directions to Valley Lodge; Torgo simply replies that there is no place like that around here.

That could leave","output":"the decision up to individual states, which means each state will decide if it wants to allow or not allow same-sex couples to marry. People are waiting for the judges to say if the law that was made in 1996, which says only a man and a woman can be married, is fair or not. The judges talked about this for two days, and in about three months they will tell us what they think. This is a very important topic to many people, because they believe everyone should have the right to marry and be treated fairly, no matter if they are a man or a woman marrying someone of the same gender."},{"instruction":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: dress from the movie and i would love to find the dress or pattern .","output":"The most important words in the given sentence are: 1. Dress - This is the central focus of the sentence, as the person is looking to find a specific dress or its blueprint. It is the main object of interest and the reason for the search. 2. Movie - This provides the context for the dress being sought. The dress is not any dress but one that appeared in a movie, adding a layer of significance and establishing a more specific criterion for the desired item. 3. Find - This verb highlights the action the person wants to take: to locate or acquire the dress or pattern. The goal is to search for and ultimately obtain the desired item either for personal use or admiration. 4. Pattern - This word is significant because it offers an alternative option to the dress itself—a blueprint or design that can be used to recreate the dress, rather than the actual dress from the movie. It broadens the scope of what the person is looking for and suggests they might be interested in sewing or designing the dress themselves. 5. Love - This word conveys the emotional aspect behind the statement and emphasizes the strong desire or excitement the person has towards finding the dress or its pattern. It provides insight into their motivation. In summary, the words \\"dress,\\" \\"movie,\\" \\"find,\\" \\"pattern,\\" and \\"love\\" are the most important in the sentence. These words help to identify the object of interest (the dress), its context (from a movie), the desired action (to find it), an alternative option (the pattern), and the emotional motivation behind the search (love)."},{"instruction":"But we should not do with narcissus tuberose and lily petals of which may turn black from the procedure Can you repeat this sentence, but add in punctuation?","output":"But, we should not do with narcissus, tuberose, and lily petals, of which may turn black from the procedure."},{"instruction":"Colin Horner, 35, was shot in front of his three-year-old son at Balloo Link, Bangor, at 14:45 BST on Sunday. He was a friend of loyalist Geordie Gilmore who was shot dead in March in a feud between factions of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Police believe dashcam footage from other motorists could prove vital. They want to trace Mr Horner's movements between the time that he left the Rathgael area of Bangor, where he was living, at 13:30 BST and 14:30 BST when he arrived at the car park. They also want to find out more about a red Ford Mondeo car with false number plates which was seen leaving the scene of the shooting - it was later found burnt out near the Six Road Ends. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Det Supt Richard Campbell said Mr Horner was murdered in a \\"very brutal\\" and \\"completely reckless\\" way. \\"We know that he went into the store with his son for about ten minutes, got back in his car, put his son in the rear and was just about to get into car,\\" he said. \\"He was approached by a single gunman, we believe.\\" The police officer said Mr Horner was hit three times and died in hospital. He said the child was immediately beside his father when he was shot in what he called a \\"hugely barbaric act\\". One stray bullet hit another vehicle. Police have described the killing as a \\"brutal, senseless and horrendous\\" attack that Mr Horner's son will carry with him throughout life. It is understood the gunman was wearing a dark hoody with the hood up and had his face covered. Ulster Unionist North Down MLA Alan Chambers, who arrived at the car park about 10 minutes after the shooting, said the scene was \\"surreal\\". \\"There was a casualty on the ground, there was about six paramedics round the person working very, very hard with CPR and also administering fluids to him,\\" he said. \\"They worked on him for maybe 45 minutes, they put him then onto a trolley and moved him into an ambulance and worked on him in the ambulance for another 20 minutes and then the ambulance left the scene with a police escort.\\" Mr Chambers said hundreds of people were there, unaware of what had happened. \\"On a sunny bank holiday weekend, as a man lay fighting for his life, people were walking by blissfully unaware of what happened carrying tins of paint and wallpaper under their arms,\\" he said. Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said the Bangor community would be \\"deeply shocked\\" by this murder. \\"To shoot someone in a busy supermarket car park in sight of children and shoppers shows a brutality and recklessness that will not be tolerated,\\" he said. \\"The PSNI are doing all they can to bring to justice anyone involved.\\" DUP MLA Gordon Dunne said people were in \\"shock and disbelief\\" at what had happened. \\"This was something we thought was past us, but, sadly, on occasions, is still with us,\\" he told BBC Northern Ireland's Good Morning Ulster. Mr Dunne said any suggestion of a link to a loyalist feud was \\"speculation\\". \\"Whoever is responsible must be brought before the courts for this terrible deed,\\" he said. The DUP MLA said community relations were extremely good in Bangor and, as he and his colleagues were canvassing for the forthcoming election, they had a sense that things were \\"stable and settled\\". Alliance North Down MLA Stephen Farry said the shooting had \\"sent shockwaves\\" throughout the town. \\"My thoughts are with the loved ones of the man shot dead. There can never be any excuse for carrying out such an act, which has left a man dead and a family mourning,\\" he said. \\"Violence has no place in our society and those who carried out this attack must be taken off the streets. I would urge anyone with information on it to contact police immediately.\\" Sinn FÃ©in MLA Chris Hazzard condemned the shooting. \\"Whoever was behind this shooting wants to drag us back to the past. It will not happen,\\" he said. Green Party MLA Steven Agnew said the murder was \\"very shocking\\". \\"This took place in broad daylight on a busy shopping day, with children and families present. A large number of people will have been shocked by this incident.

I found the following answer on Google: A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine). Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the provided answer is not correct when addressing the source of a superhero's powers. Instead, it refers to the term used for a female superhero. The source of a superhero's powers varies greatly, depending on the hero in question and the universe they belong to, such as Marvel or DC. Some common sources of superhero powers include: 1. Genetics and mutation: A superhero could be born with special abilities as a result of their genetic makeup. For instance, the various mutants from the X-Men series, like Wolverine and Cyclops, possess unique powers due to genetic mutations. 2. Scientific accidents or experiments: Some superheroes' powers originate from surviving an accident or exposure to particular substances. For example, Spider-Man gained his abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider, while the Fantastic Four were transformed after exposure to cosmic radiation. 3. Advanced technology: Superheroes may use advanced technology to provide them with powers. In some cases, this technology is created by the superhero themself or crafted for them by a supporting character. Examples include Iron Man's powered armor suit and the gadgets used by Batman. 4. Magic: Several heroes' powers come from magic, either by being imbued with magical abilities or coming from magical realms. For instance, Doctor Strange derives his abilities from the mystic arts, while Thor, the Norse god of thunder, is a magical being from Asgard. 5. Alien origin: Superheroes can gain powers through their extraterrestrial heritage or technology from other planets. Superman, for example, draws his strength from Earth's yellow sun, while other heroes, such as the Green Lantern, wield power from an alien source, like the Green Lantern ring. 6. Training and physical prowess: Some superheroes do not possess supernatural powers. Instead, they have highly developed skills, usually through intense training or physical conditioning. Batman is an example of a hero who relies on his intellect and combat skills, rather than superpowers. 7. Divine or mystical intervention: In some cases, a superhero's origin story may involve intervention from a higher power or divine being. For instance, Wonder Woman was created from clay and brought to life by the gods of Greek mythology, who granted her various abilities. In conclusion, the source of a superhero's powers can vary significantly depending on the specific character and narrative. The provided answer does not address this topic, only mentioning the terms used for female superheroes."},{"instruction":"Question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Take the case of Julian Castro, the San Antonio mayor who has now thrown political observers a curveball by accepting an offer from President Obama to join the Cabinet as secretary of housing and urban development. Castro has been talked about before as a potential 2016 candidate for vice president. The idea of his moving to Washington, if he's confirmed at HUD, is sure to keep tongues wagging for the next couple years. It will also provide plenty of opportunity for unsolicited advice.

However, if something doesn’t make sense to you, don’t do it! You still have your own mind. No culture is better than any other, and therefore their way of life doesn't necessarily have to be adopted. Take traffic rules, for example.

Never compromise safety or your happiness just to fit in. Going to Brazil on your own can, at least initially, be very daunting. To make the transition easier, find other expats to help pad the culture shock. They are going through the same thing, or have at one point or another. They can point you to all the wonderful \\"bits of home\\" they've cultivated. Brazil is huge and multicultural – you'll be able to find certain comforts (brand names, certain foods, etc.) if you know where to look. In addition to expat friends, you need native friends, too, to show you the ropes. They’ll know all the happening spots, the best places to get food, and show you a side of the country that expats aren’t able to. They'll be the ones that give you the most memorable stories, too. Don't know where to start? You can meet people hanging out at cafes, clubs, at futbol games, or through your students if you teach them your language. What's more, some families love taking in foreigners. Next time a friendly looking older woman smiles at you, initiate a conversation just by saying hello and asking her name.

Hoke with about 15,000 Confederate troops and the iron-clad CSS Albemarle After a gallant defense which lasted three days Gen. Wessells surrendered the town. He was taken to Libby Prison, whence he was transferred successively to Danville, Macon and Charleston.

Usage: In the input passage, it is mentioned that \\"On June 6, 1861, he was promoted major of the 6th US Infantry.\\" Therefore, Wessells was promoted to major in 1861. This meets the criteria because the year is directly stated in the passage. Part #2: Understand the context of Libby Prison. Usage: In the passage, it's mentioned that \\"He was taken to Libby Prison, whence he was transferred successively to Danville, Macon and Charleston.\\" This portion gives the information about Libby Prison, but it does not provide the exact period of how long Libby Prison been in existence.

Usage: In this case, the answer to the question \\"How long had Libby Prison been in existence for by the year Wessells was promoted to major of the 6th US Infantry?\\" can be determined by looking at the year Wessells was promoted (Part #1) and the context of Libby Prison (Part #2). Since the information can be extracted only from Part #1 but the context of Libby Prison is not enough to determine the exact period of Libby Prison's existence, the answer to this question should be \`b\` (No).

Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology Professor Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin. The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless zombified Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Later, Ash is forced to sever his bitten right hand, which has become possessed. While Ash deals with this force, the professor's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with more pages of the Necronomicon in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. The four of them find an embattled Ash, who is, seemingly, slowly being driven insane due to his encounter with the demon, such as hallucinating that the room comes to life and begins laughing hysterically at him. At first, he is mistaken for a murderer by the four people because he shoots at them through the door (mistaking them as the Evil Force), but they find out the truth after listening to a recording of Annie's father, Professor Knowby, that talked about how his wife Henrietta...

The attack was a costly success and came to be known as \\"von Bredow's Death Ride\\", which was held to prove that cavalry charges could still prevail on the battlefield. Use of traditional cavalry on the battlefields of 1914 proved to be disastrous, due to accurate, long-range rifle fire, machine-guns and artillery. Von Bredow's attack had succeeded only because of an unusually effective artillery bombardment just before the charge, along with favorable terrain that masked his approach. Now answer this question: What military tactic proved to be unsuccessful on the 1914 battlefields?","output":"The military tactic that proved to be unsuccessful on the 1914 battlefields was the traditional cavalry charge. This tactic, which consisted of mounted soldiers charging en masse into enemy lines or formations, had been effective in earlier conflicts such as the Battle of Mars-la-Tours. However, with the advancements in weapon technology and changes in the nature of warfare by 1914, cavalry charges faced numerous challenges that made them largely ineffective and disastrous. During the initial stages of World War I in 1914, several factors contributed to the failure of the traditional cavalry charge as a viable military tactic. These included: 1. Accurate, long-range rifle fire: The development of improved rifles, such as the bolt-action rifle, allowed soldiers to fire more accurately and at greater distances than before. This improvement in infantry firepower meant that cavalry charging towards enemy lines would suffer significant casualties even before reaching their target. 2. Machine guns: The invention and widespread use of machine guns further increased the lethality of infantry defenses. These rapid-firing weapons could mow down entire groups of charging cavalry with ease, rendering the tactic nearly suicidal at times. 3. Artillery: High-explosive artillery shells could cause immense devastation on tightly packed formations of troops, including cavalry. As artillery became more advanced and precise, it posed a significant threat to charging cavalry. Additionally, the development of barbed wire as a defensive measure made it difficult for cavalry units to maneuver across the battlefield. 4. Defensive trench warfare: World War I is infamous for the large-scale use of trench warfare, where opposing forces would dig and occupy trenches while exchanging fire across a \\"no man's land.\\" This defensive style of warfare made it difficult for cavalry to find appropriate opportunities to charge against the enemy, as they could not easily cross the obstacle-ridden terrain and avoid concentrated enemy fire. In conclusion, the traditional cavalry charge as a military tactic proved to be unsuccessful on the 1914 battlefields due to several factors, including accurate long-range rifle fire, machine guns, artillery, and the rise of defensive trench warfare. These elements of modern warfare combined to make cavalry charges largely futile and extremely costly in terms of lives lost."},{"instruction":"Can we conclude from \\"A young boy holds an ak-47.\\" that \\"The boy is not holding a gun.\\"?

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: very dead B: a very good swimmer C: very saved A:","output":"According to the context provided, where Remy saved Austin's life after he fell into the water, Austin would likely feel a range of emotions as a result of this experience. The three answer choices provided do not fully capture the emotions Austin might feel, but we can evaluate and choose the best one. A: very dead - This answer is not accurate because, since Remy saved Austin's life, Austin would not feel dead. Rather, he would feel alive and grateful because his life was spared. B: a very good swimmer - This answer is also not accurate, as there is no information in the context provided that suggests Austin's swimming skills played a role in his rescue or the way he feels after being saved. It is possible that he would want to improve his swimming abilities in light of the incident, but his direct feeling in response to being saved would not be related to his swimming prowess. C: very saved - Out of the three options, this one best answers the question according to the context. While a better phrasing might have been \\"grateful\\" or \\"relieved,\\" \\"very saved\\" implies that Austin feels fortunate that Remy was there to rescue him from the water. It suggests that Austin is aware his life was in danger and now feels secure because of Remy's actions. Overall, answer choice C: very saved is the best answer according to the context provided. However, the emotions Austin might feel are likely to be more complex and could include gratitude, relief, and perhaps a desire to strengthen his swimming abilities to avoid such a dangerous situation in the future."},{"instruction":"Michael Cassio, or simply Cassio, is a fictional character in William Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\".
