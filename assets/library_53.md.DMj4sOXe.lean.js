Question: Which British-based clothing and adult toy company is named after the secretary of the male founder Caborn Waterfield? Answer:","output":"The British-based clothing and adult toy company named after the secretary of the male founder, Caborn Waterfield, is Ann Summers. The company was founded in 1972 and has since become a household name in the United Kingdom, known for selling a range of lingerie, adult toys, and other intimate products. Caborn Waterfield, a businessman and entrepreneur, established the company with the intention to revolutionize the adult retail market in the UK. Before founding Ann Summers, the adult retail space in the UK had a somewhat seedy reputation and was primarily dominated by male-oriented shops. Waterfield's vision was to create a brand that would break away from this stigma and cater to both men and women equally, offering a diverse range of products to enhance their intimate lives. The name Ann Summers was inspired by Waterfield's secretary, Annice Summers, because he wanted a catchy name that would appeal to both genders and reflect the company's mission to provide products for the evolving sexual needs of couples. Waterfield ultimately chose his secretary's name because he felt it had the right mix of approachability and female-empowerment. Ann Summers has grown substantially since its founding, now operating over 100 retail stores in the UK and Ireland, as well as an extensive online presence. The company is widely credited with transforming the way adult products are sold by creating a more welcoming and inclusive shopping environment. Its stores are brightly lit and have a women-friendly atmosphere, reflecting the company's commitment to breaking down the barriers surrounding the adult retail industry. In addition to offering a diverse range of products for women and men, Ann Summers has also become a pioneer in hosting 'party plan' events, which are similar to Tupperware-style parties. At these events, which usually take place in the homes of Ann Summers' consultants or party hosts, women can get together to discuss and try a selection of the company's products in a comfortable and private setting. Ann Summers prides itself on promoting a sex-positive message and empowering women and men to explore their desires in a safe, judgment-free space. This approach has led to its sustained success, allowing the company to remain relevant and adapt to the changing cultural landscape over the years. The brand has come a long way, and its strong focus on inclusivity and female empowerment has helped redefine the adult retail market in the UK."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Negative Yelp Review:  I must say I had high expectations for \\"The Happy Plate,\\" given the rave reviews from several friends and glowing recommendations online. Despite my anticipation, my experience at this establishment was nothing short of disappointing. Upon entering, I found the ambiance of the restaurant quite lackluster and ordinary. The dim lighting made it difficult to navigate through the room, and the tables felt cramped. Service started as a slow trudge, taking 20 minutes just to get water and have our orders taken. Without any exaggeration, my main course was an epicurean calamity. I ordered the grilled salmon with lemon herb sauce, and what arrived resembled a sad, overcooked slab of fish, completely devoid of any sauce. My dining companions did not fare any better - the risotto was mushy and bland, while the steak was cooked unevenly and lacked seasoning. What struck me as worse than the poor quality of food was the apathetic attitude of the staff. When I approached them to express my dissatisfaction, they provided a lukewarm apology but failed to offer any solution or compensation. For a restaurant that is supposedly top-tier, this is absolutely unacceptable. My overall experience at \\"The Happy Plate\\" left me feeling unimpressed and dissatisfied. I genuinely hope they can rectify these issues in the future, but as for now, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a quality dining experience. b. Positive Yelp Review:  Before I dive into my glowing review of \\"The Flavorful Oasis,\\" let me just say that you are in for an absolute treat when you decide to dine at this phenomenal gem of a restaurant. From a mouthwatering menu to impeccable service, they have it all down pat. Upon arrival, the delightful aroma of the kitchen's offerings wafted through the air, and we were greeted by the friendly staff who showed us to our table. The décor was elegant and inviting, with tasteful artwork and just the right level of lighting to create a warm, comfortable atmosphere. \\"The Flavorful Oasis\\" offers a wide variety of dishes, making it hard to choose from their extensive menu. Eventually, I decided on the pan-seared sea bass with a tropical mango salsa, accompanied by garlic mashed potatoes. When I took my first bite, I was transported to culinary heaven. The sea bass was cooked to perfection, flaky and tender on the inside, while the mango salsa was a harmonious blend of sweetness and acidity. The garlic mashed potatoes were creamy and packed with flavor - utter decadence on a plate! The stellar service we experienced only added to our fantastic evening. Our server was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu, consistently ensuring we were enjoying our meal and never in need of anything. Furthermore, the owner even paid us a visit to inquire about our dining experience, emphasizing their genuine commitment to customer satisfaction. In summary, \\"The Flavorful Oasis\\" is a top-notch dining establishment with exquisite dishes, remarkable service, and an ambiance that exudes both elegance and comfort. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience, and I cannot wait for my next visit to this enchanting oasis!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Brotherhood Movie plot: A young American man arrives in Palermo by plane. A taxi driver at the airport immediately gets word to Frank Ginetta (Kirk Douglas), who hides, armed with a gun, until he realizes that the visitor he's been warned about is actually his kid brother, Vinnie (Alex Cord). Frank happily welcomes his brother and takes him home, catching up on old times. But his wife, Ida (Irene Papas), reminds him that \\"they're going to send someone,\\" suggesting that perhaps Vinnie is the one. In a flashback, Frank recalls better times in New York, beginning with Vinnie's homecoming from military service and subsequent marriage to Emma Bertolo (Susan Strasberg). The father of the bride, Dominick Bertolo (Luther Adler) is a Mafia don, as is the groom's brother, Frank. And among those paying their respects as guests at the wedding are mob leaders like Egan (Murray Hamilton), Rotherman (Val Avery) and Levin (Alan Hewitt), who are the equals of Frank and Dominick in the New York region's organized crime. These capos within the Organization meet as a board to coordinate their business. The majority becomes increasingly unhappy with Frank's position, as he seems opposed to every new idea. Frank also dispenses justice on his own in the old Sicilian fashion, without seeking approval from the others. They, not being of Sicilian origin, are trying to leave behind the old traditional methods, such as when two of Frank's hit men kill a stool pigeon in the marshes and leave him tied to a chair with a canary stuffed in his mouth â as a warning to others who might talk too much. Frank still fondly remembers his father, who also was a mafioso who was assassinated in a hit. Vinnie is more of a businessman, and takes sides with the other board members in ventures they intend to pursue without his brother. Frank resents this, striking Vinnie for defying him and insisting to the board that Vinnie will have no part in what they have planned.

As for the movie title, plot, and other details provided in your question: Movie title: The Brotherhood Movie plot: The story revolves around Frank Ginetta, a Mafia don, and his younger brother, Vinnie, who arrives in Palermo unexpectedly.

This creates tension between the brothers, while also delving into flashbacks to explore better times in New York and the impact of their Mafia-related family history on their present-day lives.

Article: Western philosophy regarded emotion in varying ways. In stoic theories it was seen as a hindrance to reason and therefore a hindrance to virtue. Aristotle believed that emotions were an essential component of virtue. In the Aristotelian view all emotions (called passions) corresponded to appetites or capacities. During the Middle Ages, the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by scholasticism and Thomas Aquinas in particular. There are also theories of emotions in the works of philosophers such as René Descartes, Niccolò Machiavelli, Baruch Spinoza and David Hume. In the 19th century emotions were considered adaptive and were studied more frequently from an empiricist psychiatric perspective.

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Options: ['a ) 24', 'b ) 48', 'c ) 64', 'd ) 80', 'e ) 512']","output":"This task is asking you to calculate the volume of a cube provided that it's similar to another cube but twice as long, wide, and high. In other words, you need to apply the knowledge of geometry to find the volume of the described cube.  The guidelines provided are the dimensions of the original cube: its volume is 64 cubic feet. The second cube has length, width, and height, which are twice the corresponding dimensions of the original cube. Using these guidelines, here's what you have to do: 1. Understand the properties of a cube. A cube has equal length, width, and height, and the volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the length of any side. So, if the cube has a volume of 64 cubic feet, it means that the side length of this cube is the cube root of 64, which is 4 feet. 2. Now consider the second cube, which is twice as long, wide, and high as the original cube. Therefore, the length, width, and height of this cube would be 2 times the respective dimensions of the original cube. In this case, 2 times the side length of the original cube (4 feet) gives you 8 feet.  3. Calculate the volume of the second cube. Unlike area, volume scales cubically, meaning that every dimension is cubed (multiplied by itself twice). Thus, the volume of the second cube is the cube of its side length; that is, 8 feet cubed or (2 * 4 feet) cubed equals 512 cubic feet. Comparing with the given choices, 'e) 512' is the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Devastated, she stays in his cafe the entire night, eating a blueberry pie he made, and also telling stories about each other. Jeremy, having an eidetic memory, explains her the bowl of keys he is keeping, knowing the story of every person who left the key in his cafe and keeping it in the bowl in case someone comes back for them. Elizabeth leaves her key of her apartment and leaves Jeremy's cafe. Elizabeth, now calling herself Lizzie, eventually drifts to Memphis, Tennessee, where she takes two jobs, waitress by day and barmaid by night, in order to earn enough money to finance the purchase of a car. She regularly sends postcards to Jeremy, taking a liking to him, without revealing where she lives or works and, although he tries to locate her by calling all the restaurants in the area, he fails to find her. Later on, he decides to send out postcards to any restaurants she may be to try to find her. One of Lizzie's regulars at both jobs is local police officer Arnie Copeland, an alcoholic who cannot accept the fact his wife Sue Lynne has left him and is flaunting her freedom by openly socializing with a younger man named Randy. He confesses to Lizzie his many attempts at achieving sobriety have ended in failure, taking many AA meetings but failing. One night off duty in the bar where Lizzie works, he drunkenly threatens Sue Lynne with his gun if she leaves. Later on, Arnie drives drunk and dies after crashing into a pole. Lizzie comforts Sue Lynne at the crash site, before leaving town, and is given the money towards Arnie's tab at the bar, revealing to Lizzie that she made a mistake and that she misses him.

I've been wedding dress shopping at about 4 places including here.  This has been the worst experience I've had by far.  I made an appointment over a week in advance.    The woman who \\"helped\\" me, Anissa, was very unhelpful.  In spite of being about 10-15 minutes into my appointment time, she ended up helping someone else who came in to pick up her dress.  This was not a fast pick up process.  I was left to zip up myself and walk out to the mirror alone.  When I asked her how the dress looked bustled, she said she didn't know.  I asked if she had a photo.  She said she did not have a photo but I could look up online how dresses bustle because they are all the same.  She did not offer to look up anything, write any of the dress names down, really help me with much of anything.  I had to really prompt her for everything. This was my one and only chance to try on dresses with my dad.  He was struggling a great deal with the camera and she did not offer to help at all.    I am not a fussy bride, nor a high needs bride.  I do believe that if you make an appointment in advance and are prepared to spend 2,000, the sales person should be there for the customer.    During the appointment, Anissa answered the phone and stayed on the phone for about 10 solid minutes.  I also work in retail.  I am sometimes understaffed.

The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad.

He served as president of Augsburg College and helped found the Lutheran Free Church.  - Augsburg College is a private, coeducational liberal arts college located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Upon its founding in 1869, it was a Norwegian-American Lutheran seminary known as Augsburg Seminary. Its first college class began in the fall of 1874. Today, the college enrolls approximately 3000 undergraduate students and 800 graduate students. The school is known for its emphasis on service learning; volunteering in the community is both an instructional strategy and a required part of a students coursework.

Sven Oftedal ( 3 June 1905 -- 23 June 1948 ) was the Norwegian Minister of Social Affairs in 1945 and 1945 - 1948 .  - The Lutheran Free Church (LFC) was a Lutheran denomination that existed in the United States, mainly in Minnesota and North Dakota, from 1897 until its merger into the American Lutheran Church (ALC) in 1963. The history of the church body predates its official organization, and a group of congregations that did not join the ALC formed the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations. Background. Georg Sverdrup and Sven Oftedal were two scholars from prominent Haugean families in Norway who came to Augsburg Seminary in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to teach in the 1870s, bringing with them a radical view of Christian education that was centered on Scripture and the simple doctrines of Christianity. The Haugean movement took its name from Norwegian lay evangelist Hans Nielsen Hauge who spoke up against the Church establishment in Norway. Sverdrup and Oftedal had been concerned about hierarchy within the Christian church as well as the study of the Bible. They believed that, according to the New Testament, the local congregation was the correct form of God's kingdom on earth. Their vision was for a church that promoted a living Christianity, emphasized an evangelism that would result in changed lives, and enabled the church member to exercise his/her spiritual gifts.

It is a constitutional monarchy with the rank of principality, headed by the Prince of Liechtenstein.  - Montafon (in local dialect: \\"\\"Muntafu\\")\\" is a 39 km long valley in the federal state of Vorarlberg (Austria) that is crossed by the river Ill (Vorarlberg). It extends from the city of Bludenz and the Verwall Alps in the north, to the Silvretta and Rätikon mountain range in the south. Piz Buin is with 3312m the highest peak within the Silvretta mountain range.  - Gorfion is a mountain on the border of Austria and Liechtenstein in the Rätikon range of the Eastern Alps , with a height of 2,308 metres ( 7,572 ft ) .  - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.  - The Central Eastern Alps, also referred to as Austrian Central Alps or just Central Alps comprise the main chain of the Eastern Alps in Austria and the adjacent regions of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy and Slovenia.  - The Alpine Rhine Valley is a glacial alpine valley, formed by the part of the Alpine Rhine (German: ) between the confluence of the Anterior Rhine and Posterior Rhine at Reichenau and the Alpine Rhine's mouth at Lake Constance. From Reichenau, the Alpine Rhine flows east, passing Chur and turning north, forms the border between the canton of St. Gallen of Switzerland on the left, west side and first Liechtenstein and then Vorarlberg, Austria on the right, east side. The Swiss-Austrian border follows the historical bed of the Rhine, but today the river follows an artificial canal within Austria for the final . The Rhine Valley in this area extends to about . Its upper third has the character of an Alpine valley, enclosing a bottom plain of about across. Downstream of Vaduz, the valley widens considerably, developing into a broad plain, measuring some across at its lower end along the southern shores of Lake Constance. From the point of the Rhine's emergence from Lake Constance, it is known as High Rhine.  - Central Europe lies between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity.

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet).  - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities.  - The Prättigau Valley, in the canton of Graubünden (Grisons), Switzerland, is home to the world-famous ski resorts of Klosters and neighbouring Davos in the Landwasser Valley.

Q:Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:  Dan, a renowned pedologist, visited two farms near his home town. Grape farm had depleted soils and a low crop production, while Fruit farm, having parcels with depleted soils in the past, established an agroforestry system starting a decade ago which helped stabilize soil and increase production.

In this case, we have: - Depleted soils can be protected from erosion by groundcover plants in agroforestry systems - Agroforestry helps in preventing erosion, stabilizing soil, and increasing soil cover  - Agroforestry can lead to cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff - Fruit farm implemented an agroforestry system a decade ago, which helped stabilize soil and increase production - Grape farm had depleted soils and low crop production Step 2: Compare the farming methods of the two farms. Fruit farm implemented an agroforestry system that helped stabilize soil and increase production. Grape farm, on the other hand, had depleted soils and low crop production, which indicates that they did not adopt agroforestry practices. Step 3: Determine which farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods. Since Grape farm did not implement an agroforestry system, they did not benefit from the advantages of cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:As a boy, a reclusive and antisocial Sufferton resident, Max Seed, was disfigured in a school bus crash that killed everyone else involved in it. In 1973, Seed began torturing and murdering people, filming some of his victims starving to death in his locked basement, and ultimately racking up a bodycount of 666. In 1979, Seed is arrested by Detective Matt Bishop in a siege that claims the lives of five of Bishop's fellow officers. Seed is sentenced to death by electric chair, and incarcerated on an island prison, where he is a model inmate, only acting out when he kills three guards who try to rape him.On Seed's execution date, the electric chair fails to kill him after two shocks. Not wanting Seed to be released due to a state law that says any convicted criminal who survives three jolts of 15,000 volts each for 45 seconds walks, the prison staff and Bishop declare Seed dead and bury him alive in the prison cemetery. A few hours later, Seed digs his way out of his grave and returns to the prison, where he kills the executioner, doctor, and warden before swimming back to the mainland. The next day, while investigating the massacre, Bishop realizes Seed was responsible when he discovers the serial killer's empty cemetery plot.Over the course of several months Seed kills dozens of people, with one long shot showing him beating a bound woman with a lumberjack's axe for five straight minutes. One day, a videotape showing Bishop's house is sent to the detective's office. Knowing this means Seed is going to go after his family, Bishop races home, finding his wife, Sandy, and daughter, Emily, gone, and the four officers charged with guarding the house dismembered in the bathroom.Driving to Seed's old residence, Bishop is lured into a basement room containing a television and a video camera, and locked inside. The television turns on, and depicts Seed with Sandy and Emily. Emily informs Bishop that Seed wants Bishop to shoot himself. When Bishop hesitates, Seed kills Sandy with a nail gun, prompting Bishop into shooting himself in the head, believing that doing so will make Seed release his daughter. Instead, Seed takes the daughter to the room containing her father's corpse, and locks her in it. As Emily sobs for her parents, the film ends., Question: What does Seed use to kill Sandy?

A young Banjo Paterson, who later went on to write the iconic Australian bush ballad \\"Waltzing Matilda\\", was among the pitch invaders. Of the 10,000 spectators, up to 2,000 \\"participated in the disorder\\". Coulthard was jostled and Lord Harris, who had returned to the field to support Coulthard, was struck by a whip or stick but was not hurt. Hornby, a keen amateur boxer who had been offered the English captaincy before stepping aside for Harris, grabbed his captain's assailant and \\"conveyed his prisoner to the pavilion in triumph\\"; it was later said that he had caught the wrong man. Hornby was also attacked and almost lost the shirt off his back. Emmett and Ulyett each took a stump for protection and escorted Lord Harris off, assisted by some members. In the meantime, the crowd anger grew and there was mounting fear that the riot would intensify, due to speculation that the crowd would try to free Hornby's captive. However, there was only jostling as the players were evacuated into the pavilion, and the injuries were limited to minor cuts and bruises. An English naval captain who was at the ground had his top hat pulled over his eyes and was verbally abused by some spectators. After 30 minutes, the field was cleared.When the ground was finally cleared Gregory insisted, according to Harris, that Coulthard be replaced. When Harris would not agree, Gregory said, \\"Then the game is at an end\\". Harris asked Barton whether he could claim the match on a forfeit. Barton replied \\"I will give it to you in two minutes if the batsmen don't return\\". Harris then asked Barton to speak with Gregory to ascertain his intentions.

Please answer the following question: Given the fact that:  The gravitational force between two objects decreases as the objects move further apart.  Answer the question:   What is the gravitational effect on an object that is far from Earth by Earth high or low? A:","output":"The gravitational effect on an object that is far from Earth by Earth high or low can be analyzed through the principle of gravitational force, which is described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. According to this law, the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, the gravitational force (F) is given by: F = (G * m1 * m2) / r^2 where: - G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) - m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects (in this case, Earth and the object) - r is the distance between the centers of the two objects When the object is at a high distance (far) from Earth, the value of r will be large, and as a result, the gravitational force (F) will be lower. On the other hand, when the object is close to Earth (low distance), the value of r will be smaller, and thus the gravitational force (F) acting on the object will be higher. In summary, the gravitational effect on an object that is far from Earth (high distance) will be lower, and the effect will be higher when the object is closer to Earth (low distance). It is important to note that the gravitational force never becomes zero, but it keeps decreasing with increasing distance between the objects."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, I'm going to tell you how to take care of your plants by doing something called \\"pruning.\\" Pruning means cutting off some parts of the plant to help it grow better and stay healthy. So grab your kid-safe scissors and let's learn how to do this together! 1. Look for Extra Stems First, we are going to look for what we call \\"secondary stems.\\" These are like the extra arms of the plant that grow really close to the ground. If your plant is all grown up (or \\"mature\\"), you might see two or three of these extra stems. 2. Give the Seed Pods a Haircut Next, we want to find the seed pod branches. Seed pods are like little houses that the plant's seeds live in. The branches holding these seed pods might have some extra, unnecessary parts at their tops. So, just like you get a haircut, we are going to give these branches a little snip at the top. 3. Remove the Unhealthy Parts Sometimes, some parts of our plants get sick or don't look good. These are usually the dead or diseased branches. It's important to help your plant stay healthy by gently cutting away these parts. 4. Say Goodbye to Thin Branches Now, look for thin, weak branches that we call \\"wispy branches.\\" These branches don't help the plant grow very well, so we want to remove them by cutting them off. 5. Stop Branches from Rubbing Against Each Other You know how when you and your friends play \\"London Bridge,\\" you hold hands? Well, sometimes branches do that too, but it's not very good for your plant. We need to cut off the branches that are rubbing against the main stem of the plant. That way, they won't give your plant boo-boos. 6. Give Your Plant a Fresh Start Lastly, we'll do what's called \\"restarting\\" your plant. This doesn't mean starting all over. It just means we're going to help your plant feel like new again! How? By pruning off one-third of the plant. But don't do this all at once! Help your plant restart by doing this over a few different times, like over a few seasons. And that's it! Great job, little gardener! Now your plant should be all set to grow big and strong. Remember, taking care of plants is a fun and important job, so keep practicing and you'll be a plant pro in no time!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose third Benhardt play was La Tosca? , can you please find it?   The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti.  Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini.  One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand...

It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.  - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology.  - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.  - Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it be a business, a not-for-profit organization, or government body. Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees or volunteers to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources. The term \\"management\\" may also refer to the people who manage an organization.  - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America.  - A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of \\"breeds\\" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset.  - <onlyinclude> Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. (Veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition.)</onlyinclude>  - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a \\"system of money\\" (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation. Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance.  - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city.  - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.  - In economics, products can be classified into goods and services. Goods are items that are tangible, such as books, pens, salt, shoes, hats and folders. Services are activities provided by other people, such as doctors, lawn care workers, dentists, barbers, waiters, or online servers. According to economic theory, consumption of goods and services is assumed to provide utility (satisfaction) to the consumer or end-user, although businesses also consume goods and services in the course of producing other goods and services.  - Port-Margot is a commune in the Borgne Arrondissement, in the Nord Department of Haiti. It has 36,937 inhabitants.  - The Caribbean Sea is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere. It is bounded by Mexico and Central America to the west and south west, to the north by the Greater Antilles starting with Cuba, to the east by the Lesser Antilles, and to the south by the north coast of South America.  - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene.  - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion).  - The history of agriculture records the domestication of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin.  - A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and anaerobic digestion, rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter. Biofuels can be derived directly from plants, or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes. Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation, such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of biomass (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels.  - Borgne is an arrondissement in the Nord Department of Haiti. It has 83,823 inhabitants.

It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the tenth most populous island in the world.  - Medicinal plants have been identified and used throughout human history. Plants make many chemical compounds that are for biological functions, including defence against insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total. Chemical compounds in plants mediate their effect on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to have beneficial pharmacology, but also gives them the same potential as conventional pharmaceutical drugs to cause harmful side effects. Moreover, plant material comes with a variety of compounds which may have undesired effects, though these can be reduced by processing.  - An economy (From Greek   \\"household\\" and o  \\"manage\\") is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and consumption of goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency, but monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic domain.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Haiti , officially the Republic of Haiti, is a sovereign state located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea.

Satellite view of Borgne  - Monoculture is the agricultural practice of producing or growing a single crop, plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time. Polyculture, where more than one crop is grown in the same space at the same time, is the alternative to monoculture. Monoculture is widely used in both industrial farming and organic farming and has allowed increased efficiency in planting and harvest.   - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market.  - A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea.   - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.  - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\"  - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism.  - Fond La Grange is a village near Borgne, Haiti.

They both want to know how long it takes for marijuana, which is also called weed, to leave your body. Now, think of your body like a magical toy box. When you put a toy (in this case, marijuana) inside the box, it takes some time for it to disappear. It doesn't go away all at once, but after a while, the magical box makes the toy harder and harder to find. For marijuana, our body may take a few days to a month to make it all go away. It depends on how much of the toy was put into the box and how the box works for each person.

GOP All but Ready to Mourn Loss of Staten Island NEW YORK -- For almost three decades, the congressional seat that includes Staten Island and a slice of Brooklyn has been a reliably Republican redoubt, the last conservative bastion in a city that is so overwhelmingly left-leaning and Democratic that it has become synonymous with \\"liberal\\" and \\"elite.\\" But after a series of twists and turns that shocked even jaded New Yorkers, the 13th Congressional District seat is now rated by Democrats nationally as their surest bet for a pickup in November. And stunned Republicans are left lamenting how the once safe district has become for them the Unlucky 13th. \\"This is going Democratic -- I don't think there's any question about that,\\" said former borough president Guy Molinari, the dean of Staten Island Republicans. He held the congressional seat for nine years himself before handing it over to his daughter, Susan Molinari. \\"It's sad losing this seat,\\" he said. \\"It's bad for the city.\\" Democrats are banking heavily on City Councilman Michael McMahon, who won the Democratic primary and has been endorsed by Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer, as well as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I). Loss of the 13th District seat would only add to the woes of the Republican Party statewide, which was once dominated by figures such as Nelson Rockefeller and Alfonse D'Amato but now seems headed for extinction. Democrats hold the governor's office, both U.S. Senate seats, and the State Assembly, and they are within striking distance of taking control of the state Senate in November. Only six of the state's 29 members of Congress are Republican, and Democrats are eyeing two seats as prime targets: the 13th and the 29th District seat of Rep. John R. \\"Randy\\" Kuhl Jr. in Western New York. The GOP's troubles are so bad that many Republicans are openly pleading with former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to get into the governor's race in 2010, if for no other reason than to try to resuscitate the state party. (Giuliani has been campaigning for Sen. John McCain for president and has made no statement about his plans). The implosion in Staten Island began in May, when popular Republican Rep. Vito J. Fossella, who has held the seat since 1997, was arrested in Virginia for drunken driving, and it was discovered he had a mistress and an out-of-wedlock child. He announced he would not seek reelection. To replace Fossella, the Staten Island Republican establishment settled on Francis H. Powers, a retired Wall Street executive and major GOP donor. But in late June, Powers died of a heart attack. Molinari said he had met with Powers two days earlier, and \\"we spent most of the time talking about his health.\\" One by one over the summer, various Republican figures declined to run for the seat, perhaps fearing a Democratic landslide in New York during a presidential-election year with an unpopular representative of the party in the White House. With Republicans unable to find a strong contender, former state assemblyman Robert Straniere stepped forward -- much to the chagrin of party leaders. Straniere served 24 years in the legislature in Albany but was dogged much of that time by questions about his tangled personal finances, bad real estate deals and failed business ventures, most recently a high-end hot dog restaurant in Manhattan that he shut down in July after only a year. Straniere won a bitter primary against cardiologist Jamshad Wyne after a campaign that included accusations that Wyne was using the nickname \\"Jim\\" to conceal his Pakistani and Muslim origins. The battle was so ugly that Wyne later quit the Republican Party and his job as party finance chief for Staten Island, claiming he was denied the nomination because of racism. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article talks about a place called Staten Island in New York. For a long time, the people in charge of Staten Island were from a group called the Republicans. But now, it looks like the Democrats, another group, might be able to take over. The Republicans are sad because they are losing their spot in Staten Island, and it is causing some problems for their team. There have been some surprising events that led to this change, like a popular person from the Republican team deciding not to run for re-election.

The answer is:","output":"The Servants were a prominent British band, emerging from the vibrant indie art rock scene of the mid-1985 and active until 1991. They found a niche in the progressive music landscape, cultivating a dedicated fan base that revered their unique style and musical prowess. Operating under the imprint of the Cherry Red Captured Tracks label, The Servants were based in the United Kingdom and featured David Westlake and Luke Haines in their lineup. Both of these members played a significant part in shaping the band's identity and contributed heartily to its body of work. David Westlake is primarily known as the primary impresario of The Servants, offering both deft musician skills coupled with a keen sense of artistic direction. Known for his deep insights into the indie art rock genre, Westlake brought a unique blend of sophistication and raw energy to the band's music. He was integral to crafting the band's distinct sense of style and aesthetic, setting them apart in a thriving and competitive music scene. Similarly, Luke Haines played a significant role in The Servants' trajectory, bringing his distinctive musical attributes to the table. His collaborative synergy with Westlake created a signature sound that helped define the band's musical character. Their music was a tasteful concoction of indie rock, underscored with elements of art rock — a genre known for challenging the norms of the popular music of the time by experimenting with various musical forms and rich atmospheric arrangements. The Servants were under the professional management of the Cherry Red Captured Tracks label. As a label known for housing adventurous and pioneering indie artists, it undoubtedly offered the right platform for The Servants. They took advantage of this with their unique brand of music and cultural resonance, creating a sound worthy of their label’s reputation. The band's official website, www.lostsheep.com/davidwestlake, hosts exclusive content that provides a deeper dive into their musical journey, including behind-the-scenes material, recorded performances, interviews, and other essential elements that offer an intimate snapshot into their artistic evolution. Unfortunately, though the band ceased to be active by 1991, their legacy persists. They left behind an impressionable music catalog revered by fans and critics alike. The Servants made a considerable impact during their active years, influencing the indie art rock genre and imparting their innovative spirit to their contemporaries and the bands that would come after them. The band's representation is perhaps best encapsulated in an image simply referred to as \\"The Servants.png.\\" This visual piece can be found on various digital platforms, embodying the band's vibe and legacy, showcasing the group’s style reflective of their artistic journey and serving as an appropriate reminder of the band's profound influence on the global indie art genre. In conclusion, The Servants were a band born of the United Kingdom's indie art rock scene, active between 1985 and 1991. While their journey may have been relatively short-lived, their significant influence and standout performances continue to resonate in the art rock scene even decades later. Through their innovation and fearless explorations of musical form, The Servants have left a long-lasting mark on the musical landscape, and their legacy continues to inspire."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both of them are trying to change their skin complexion to help their appearances at the competition. Robin begins exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week. Samantha decides not to use any UV light and instead just uses lotion to help her skin.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who will produce lower amounts of melanin?  Hint: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Answer:","output":"Samantha will produce lower amounts of melanin compared to Robin. This is because melanin production is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light. Since Robin is exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week, her melanocytes will produce more melanin in response to this increased exposure. On the other hand, Samantha is not using any UV light and is only relying on lotion for her skin, so her melanin production will not be stimulated to the same extent as Robin's."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the article and select the best answer. Article: We all enjoy the beautiful show of color1s as leaves change each autumn. But did you ever wonder how and why this happens? To answer the question, first you have to understand what leaves are and what they do. Leaves are nature's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots. And they take a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into glucose  . Glucose is a kind of sugar. Plants use glucose as food for energy and as a building block for growing. The way plants turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar is called photosynthesis  . That means, \\"putting together with light\\". A chemical called chlorophyll   helps photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color1. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter. This is how trees \\"know\\" to begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. Trees rest during this time and live off the food they stored during the summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. As the bright green fades away, we begin to see yellow and orange leaves. Small amounts of these color1s have been in the leaves all along. We just can't see them in the summer, because they are covered up by the green chlorophyll. The bright reds and yellows we see in leaves are made mostly in autumn. In some trees, like maples, glucose is caught in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn turn this glucose into a red color1. The brown color1 of trees like oaks   is made from waste left in the leaves. It is the mixture of all these things that makes the beautiful color1s we enjoy during autumn. Question: What's the author's purpose of writing the passage? Options: A: To explain the process of trees' photosynthesis. B: To encourage readers to protect the environment. C: To analyze the reasons why leaves change color1s. D: To help readers understand what leaves and trees are.","output":"C: To analyze the reasons why leaves change colors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is a sentence that describe this data?","output":"\\"The Vaults\\" is a restaurant that primarily serves fast food. This dining establishment, denoted by its unique name \\"The Vaults,\\" distinguishes itself in the diverse world of eateries as a place where consumers can experience the category of dining known as \\"restaurant\\"- tier service. Contrary to an informal takeaway or a distinguished fine dining experience, a restaurant typically offers a balanced environment where patrons can savour their meals in a more laid-back and relaxed setting, although in some cases, a touch of formality might be added depending on the overall ambiance and concept.  As for its culinary offering, \\"The Vaults\\" positions itself in the fast food sector. Here’s where the establishment differentiates itself from the common perception of a restaurant offering an extensive array of delicacies spanning several cuisines. Instead, it chooses to focus on fast food – a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale and with a strong priority placed on \\"speed of service\\" versus other relevant factors involved in culinary science. This food is optimized to be quick to prepare and serve, hence the term \\"fast.\\" It may be pre-heated, pre-cooked to a certain extent, kept hot, or delivered as a ready-to-eat meal.  The fast-food cuisine specialization by \\"The Vaults\\" highlights their target audience to primarily be individuals seeking quicker meal solutions. This could encompass a range of customers from working professionals on a lunch break, families seeking a convenient dining experience, to young adults looking for a speedy and satisfying meal. Fast food, in \\"The Vaults,\\" may manifest in a multitude of forms such as hamburgers, fries, pizzas, hot dogs, sandwiches, fried chicken, nuggets, or any food that can be served to the customer quickly after ordering. Finally, one should note that while emphasizing speed and convenience, \\"The Vaults\\" as a fast-food restaurant, might also strive to ensure a balance in providing quality food, maintaining an appealing ambiance, and offering satisfactory customer service. In a nutshell, \\"The Vaults\\" portrays an easily-accessible, quick-service restaurant for patrons who seek to relish fast food dining in a comfortable gradient of the restaurant-level dining experience."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: MSG (monosodium glutamate) is a food additive  , which has been widely used by many food factories all over the world since it appeared first in Japan in 1909. MSG is a _ that is added to some food to improve its original   taste and colour. It is used in foods around the world such as cakes, bread, frozen meats, fish and vegetables. In the beginning, people thought MSG was safe just like salt and sugar. However, in 1968 some people reported they seemed to have bad reactions   to MSG after having had a meal at a restaurant. They included headaches and quick heartbeat  . It was also reported that MSG excited a person's brain and caused his death in Japan. Scientists think that MSG may lead to many neurological disorders  . In mice studies done by a university, the evidence showed the mice didn't want to eat the food including MSG. Today many food companies \\"hide\\" MSG on food labels   by using different names. If you see \\"natural flavorings\\", \\"hydrolyzed protein\\" and \\"spices\\" in a food label, you are probably seeing a hidden way to \\"report\\" MSG in a food label. Every time we have a meal in a restaurant, we always feel the food very delicious to taste, but sometimes it is dangerous for our health because some poisonous food additives have been added to the food.

Title: Westworld Movie plot: It is sometime in the near future, in a fictional high-tech adult amusement park called Delos. The park is divided into three zones: WesternWorld, MedievalWorld and RomanWorld. The entertainment in all three areas consists primarily of interaction by the guests with androids programmed to act in character (the Old West, medieval Europe, and pre-Christian Rome, respectively). The androids are indistinguishable from human beings, apart from minor flaws in their hands, and guests are encouraged to indulge in any fantasy, including killing the androids. The androids are programmed to respond positively to guest requests, specifically including requests for sex. Delos's guests pay 1,000 a day for the experience.Peter Martin (Benjamin) a first-timer and his friend John Blane (Brolin), who has visited previously, come to the WesternWorld zone, where one of the main attractions is the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner), a robot programmed to start duels. Thanks to its programming, humans can always outdraw the Gunslinger and kill it. The guns issued to the guests also have temperature sensors that prevent them from firing at each other or anything else living but allow them to 'kill' the room-temperature androids.Gradually, the technicians running Delos begin to notice problems with the androids. In what may be the first mention of the concept of a computer virus in a film, the technical staff describe inexplicable problems and breakdowns spreading \\"like a disease\\" between the machines, first in one area of the park and then on to the others. First, the robots in MedievalWorld begin suffering an inexplicable number of systemic failures. Then, a robot rattlesnake strikes Blane.

Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the only child of  Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns? ?  Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher...

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether the Head is used for the Tail or not. The usage describes everyday affordances or uses of objects and includes both typical and atypical uses. For example, a popcorn bucket can typically be used to hold popcorn, but it could also serve as a hat in atypical situations. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action.

As he zooms in, the dog, a jovial golden retriever, playfully comes closer to the small girl, wagging its tail excitedly and sharing in her infectious laughter. The small girl, clad in a pair of overalls and her sun-kissed brown hair tied up in a messy ponytail, takes a brief pause from her mopping and glances over at the dog with eyes full of innocence and curiosity. For a moment, she forgets about washing the floor, as she wraps her small arms around the gentle giant, embracing it with love and appreciation. The camera man pans the lens over to the stately house in the background, appearing to have been recently painted in a warm coral hue, with contrasting white shutters framing each window, seemingly inviting, idyllic for a family portrait. The camera captures the sunbeams streaming through the lush trees, creating a kaleidoscope of dancing shadows along the garden path leading to the main entrance of the house. Beautifully manicured flowerbeds filled with vibrant blossoms spread their perfume into the air, giving life and color to the scene's surroundings. As the camera man continues to capture these tender moments, he realizes the significance of what he is filming. This is not a mere chore for the small girl, nor a simple task on this picturesque day; it is a testament to the love and life of the family that inhabits this serene haven. The lens moves back to focus on the girl, who has now returned to her work, but not without once again enjoying the company of her beloved canine companion, who playfully chases the mop and barks with joy, joining her in completing the task at hand. For the camera man, this footage serves as a living reminder that in a world full of noise and chaos, there exists a small pocket of serenity and happiness to cherish, a family bound together by love and responsibility, shared between humans and animals alike, an interconnected circle of warmth and harmony, manifested in the seemingly mundane yet inexplicably profound task of washing the floor on a sunny afternoon. As the camera fades, the house, dog, and girl remain etched into memory—a symbol of unity, contentment, and heartfelt simplicity amid myriad complexities. A small girl with a mop, accompanied by her loyal canine friend, becomes a canvas on which the camera man weaves his poetic narrative, effortlessly transcending boundaries, turning the mundane into the magical, and creating a mosaic of memories that shall stand the test of time. In this ever-changing world, the photographer steps back and smiles, knowing that even on a simple day such as this, life is teeming with immeasurable beauty, worthy of being captured and cherished forever.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Blood cells tend to degrade quickly, and earlier scans for blood within Oetzi's body turned up nothing. Now a             study in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface  shows that Oetzi's remarkable preservation extends even to the blood he shed shortly before dying. The find represents by far the oldest red blood cells ever observed. It is just the latest chapter in what could be described as the world's oldest murder mystery. Since Oetzi was first found by hikers with an arrow buried in his back, experts have determined that he died from his wounds and what his last meal was. There has been extensive debate as to whether he fell where he died or was buried there by others. In February, Albert Zink and colleagues at the Eurac Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy   . An earlier study by the group,             published in the Lancet , showed that a wound on Oetzi's hand contained haemoglobin, a protein found in blood - but it had long been presumed that red blood cells' delicate nature would have precluded their preservation. Prof Zink and his colleagues collaborated with researchers at the Center for Smart Interfaces at the University of Darmstadt in Germany to apply what is known as atomic force microscopy to thin slices of tissue taken from an area surrounding the arrow wound. The technique works using a tiny metal tip with a point just a few atoms across, dragged along the surface of a sample. The tip's movement is tracked, and results in a 3-D map at extraordinary resolution. The team found that the sample from Oetzi contained structures with a tell-tale \\"doughnut\\" shape, just as red blood cells have. To ensure the structures were preserved cells and not contamination of some kind, they confirmed the find using a laser-based technique called Raman spectroscopy - those results also indicated the presence of haemoglobin and the clot-associated protein fibrin. That, Prof Zink explained, seems to solve one of the elements of the murder mystery. \\"Because fibrin is present in fresh wounds and then degrades, the theory that Oetzi died some days after he had been injured by the arrow, as had once been mooted, can no longer be upheld,\\" he said. The team also suggest that their methods may prove to be of use in modern-day forensics studies, in which the exact age of blood samples is difficult to determine.

The girls' name Vanessa was invented by which 18th century Anglo-Irish writer?","output":"The girls' name Vanessa was invented by the 18th century Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift. Swift is considered one of the greatest satirists in the English language, known for his works like \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" \\"A Tale of a Tub,\\" and \\"A Modest Proposal.\\" He was born on November 30, 1667, in Dublin, Ireland, and died on October 19, 1745. The name Vanessa came about as a result of the relationship between Jonathan Swift and Esther Vanhomrigh. Esther Vanhomrigh was the daughter of a Dutch merchant who settled in Ireland. She became infatuated with Swift, who was more than 20 years her senior, after he became her tutor in the early 1700s. They developed an intense friendship, and Swift would often send her letters under the pseudonym Cadenus, an anagram of Decanus, which means \\"Dean,\\" a title Swift held at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. Jonathan Swift created the name Vanessa by merging \\"Van\\" from Esther's last name, \\"Vanhomrigh,\\" and \\"Essa,\\" a pet form of her first name, \\"Esther\\". He used this name when referring to her in their private correspondence and in the poem \\"Cadenus and Vanessa,\\" which was published after both of their deaths. The poem chronicles the friendship between Cadenus (Swift) and a young woman named Vanessa (Esther Vanhomrigh). It is believed that their friendship was unlikely to have been a romantic one, at least on Swift's part, given his connection with another woman named Esther, Esther Johnson, who was known as \\"Stella.\\" Swift and Stella shared a close friendship, as well as rumors of a secret marriage, throughout their lives. Historically, the name Vanessa became relatively well-known after Swift's creation, and its usage grew more widespread over the centuries. Vanessa is now a common name in many countries and languages, taking on various forms and pronunciations. The invention of the name Vanessa by Jonathan Swift is a fascinating example of how a creative mind can leave a lasting impact on the world, even through something as seemingly simple as a name."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Disappointing Superhero As a major fan of superhero movies, I eagerly awaited the release of \\"Disappointing Superhero\\", but I must admit, this movie did not live up to the expectations set by its marketing campaign. I will lay out the reasons for my negative review step by step. 1. Poor Character Development: One of the key elements of a successful superhero movie is strong, relatable characters. Unfortunately, \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" failed in this aspect. The protagonist's backstory lacked depth, and it was hard to understand the motivations behind their actions. The supporting characters were equally disappointing, with very little effort put into making them memorable or significant to the plot. 2. Underwhelming Visual Effects: A good superhero movie needs breathtaking visual effects to keep the audience engaged. However, the CGI and special effects in \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" were subpar and detracted from the overall experience. In some scenes, the green screen was glaringly obvious, and the lack of attention to detail took me out of the immersive world the creators were trying to build. 3. Predictable Storyline: The plot of \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" was formulaic and unoriginal. From the beginning, it was easy to foresee the twists and turns the story would take. This predictability made it impossible to feel genuinely invested in the narrative. Even worse, the third act felt rushed, leaving a lot of loose ends untied and giving no satisfying conclusion to the story. 4. Lackluster Villain: The antagonist in \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" was one-dimensional and failed to pose a significant threat to the hero. They were easily defeated and even seemed to lack motivation for their evil endeavors. It's difficult for a viewer to feel the tension and fear that should come from a powerful adversary when the villain is written so weakly. 5. Subpar Acting: The performances from the lead actors felt forced and wooden, which ultimately made it difficult to identify with or care about the characters. It seemed as if the actors were more focused on delivering punchlines rather than delving into the emotional layers of their roles. In conclusion, \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" is a letdown for fans of the genre. Despite its enticing premise and potential for greatness, the movie suffers from weak character development, poor visual effects, a predictable plot, a forgettable villain, and subpar performances from the cast. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this film to anyone in search of an engaging and immersive superhero experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the coming weeks, Congress will attempt to forge a health care bill from proposals developed by five House and Senate committees. The final bill will likely include a mandate that most Americans buy health insurance, subsidies for the purchase of insurance and bans on denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The bill may also include a \\"public option,\\" government insurance that would compete with private insurance. The underlying presumption behind this legislation is that government health insurance should be expanded to cover the uninsured. This presumption is wrong. Government should not subsidize health insurance -- for the uninsured, the poor, the elderly or anyone else -- or regulate health insurance markets. Here's why. Subsidizing health insurance means that patients and doctors are insulated from the costs of health care, so they utilize too much -- often in the form of unnecessary tests or medical procedures whose value hasn't been proven. This excess demand, along with technological progress, means rapidly growing deficits, so governments limit reimbursements to health providers or ration care. This kills innovation and creates its own inequities. The taxes necessary to fund subsidies are a drag on economic growth. The reason the Obama administration and congressional Democrats are seeking to cover the uninsured is that health insurance is expensive. Without government support, many people could not afford health insurance. The conventional wisdom is that government should therefore subsidize health insurance for those who cannot afford it. This confuses two issues: whether government should help the poor, and how government should help the poor. If society wants everyone to have health insurance, the obvious approach is to give the poor enough money so that individuals can purchase on their own. Just because people want government to help the poor doesn't require it to pay for specific kinds of goods. If some people do not purchase insurance and then become ill, they would have to rely on private charity. Now one possible objection to designing anti-poverty programs in this way -- cash transfers, but no subsidies for health insurance -- is that it would require a lot of cash. That is not a convincing objection. Health insurance is just as expensive if provided as a separate benefit. The cash approach makes clear just how much money is involved, but it does not increase the amount. The other possible objection to the cash transfer approach holds that, if left unregulated, private health insurers would deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Thus, some people might get no health insurance at all. This outcome is unlikely, however, assuming health insurance is unregulated. In that case, insurers would set higher premiums for the unhealthy, but they would cover anyone willing to pay a sufficiently high price. Thus, the question is whether society should compensate those who face higher prices because of their health status? The answer is no. Advocates for such compensation would suggest that it is basic fairness for society to insure people against the bad luck of being born with lousy genes. Many differences in health status, however, arise from behavior: heart disease from overeating, lung cancer from smoking, and cirrhosis from drinking, to name a few. If society compensates everyone for differences in their health status, it is often rewarding unhealthy behavior, perhaps even encouraging it. In addition, it is logical for society to treat the differences in financial well-being due to health in the same way it treats differences due to IQ, athletic ability, race, country of origin, family background, and so on. These and other factors mean that some people, through no fault of their own, face hard financial circumstances, whether because of their ability to earn income or because of the higher prices they face for certain goods, such as health insurance. Yet if society tried to equalize all differences resulting from, say, IQ, it would kill the incentive to work hard and destroy the economy's productive capacity. Thus, most people believe society should reduce these differences -- by helping the poor -- but most also recognize that society should not attempt to eliminate all differences. This same tradeoff -- between helping the least fortunate and promoting an efficient economy -- applies in the case of health insurance. A reasonable balance is for government to provide a social safety net that protects the poor and allows them to purchase some health insurance on their own. An alternative is to provide health insurance vouchers, but only to the poorest segment of society. Guaranteeing health insurance for everyone is too costly, and it means worse health care for everyone. That is why Obamacare, and existing subsidies for health insurance, are treatments that are worse than the disease. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Miron. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. The underlying presumption behind the proposed health care bill is that government health insurance should be expanded to cover the uninsured, which the author argues is wrong. 2. Subsidizing health insurance can lead to overutilization of medical services, increasing deficits and hindering innovation while also creating inequities. 3. The author suggests that instead of subsidizing health insurance, the government should provide cash transfers to the poor, allowing them to purchase insurance themselves. 4. Unregulated private health insurers are more likely to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions at higher premiums, as opposed to denying coverage altogether. 5. Equalizing all financial differences due to factors like health status, IQ, or background would destroy economic incentives and productivity. Instead, the author proposes providing a basic social safety net or health insurance vouchers for the poorest segment of society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Todd McHugh doesn't think he is a hero, but police say the California teenager probably saved a mother and her two young children from serious injury or death last month. He pulled them out of their car, stuck on light-rail tracks in Folsom, California, about 90 seconds before a train smashed into it. McHugh, 17, was northbound on his way to meet friends when the silver car in front of him turned off the road, went into a ditch and jolted  to a stop on the tracks. McHugh jumped out of his vehicle and went to help. The driver, a woman who police say had fallen asleep, was behind the wheel and dazed. Her two daughters aged 7 and 10, were in the back seat, buckled  in. McHugh took the woman's hand and helped her from the car. She unbuckled the kids. Another driver who had pulled over to help shouted that a train was coming, McHugh recalled. Police said the other man ran along the tracks and tried to wave down the train. It was dark and there was a bend in the tracks. The train operator probably never saw him. McHugh said the driver applied the brakes, but the train was still going fast when it came up on them. The woman, her daughters and McHugh took shelter behind his truck as the train smashed into their car, dragging it down the tracks, the teenager said. The woman's car was destroyed. Officials said the train was damaged. But none of the crew and four passengers were injured. Police said the outcome could have been far worse: \\"Had she sat there for another minute or two, she and her daughters could have been in that vehicle when the train struck it, and they could have been severely injured or killed.\\" McHugh said he \\"didn't do anything anyone else wouldn't have done.\\" Question: What can we infer from the passage? Answer: Answer:","output":"We can infer from the passage that Todd McHugh's quick thinking and actions likely prevented a mother and her two young children from sustaining severe injuries or even death when their car was stuck on light-rail tracks. Had he not intervened, the situation could have had a far worse outcome.

Question: How may I be feeling right now ?","output":"Based on the information provided, it seems like you might be experiencing a combination of emotions. First of all, your use of the phrase \\"don't let the bad things get to me\\" implies that you might be feeling stressed or challenged by certain negative aspects in your life. This could be anything from personal issues to work/school-related stresses. Working hard at school amplifies this inference because it suggests you are under academic pressure. This could be making you feel hard-pressed, anxious, or possibly overwhelmed. Furthermore, your comment about \\"ups and downs, old moods and new humbling heights\\" suggest a fluctuation in your emotional state. It indicates you might have been experiencing feelings of melancholy or nostalgia, possibly linked to the 'old moods.' At the same time, 'new humbling heights' might suggest moments of accomplishment, joy, or optimism. Encountering 'new heights' means you are achieving or experiencing new things which may inspire pride or self-fulfillment, but the fact that these are 'humbling' suggests that they also create a feeling of gratitude or perspective. Your reference to keeping 'things light and easy. like Mexico' indicates a desire for relaxation or a need to escape from stress, likely caused by your academic commitments or other burdens. You seem to associate Mexico with positive emotions, possibly because of its reputation for sunny weather, relaxing beaches, or perhaps personal positive experiences/memory associated with it. In summary, you are seemingly going through an emotional roller coaster ride right now, experiencing stress possibly from academic requirements, a certain degree of nostalgia or melancholy linked to 'old moods,' and momentary pleasures and optimism symbolised by 'new humbling heights.' You also appear to seek relaxation or lightness, as indicated by your comment about Mexico. It’s essential to remember that it's normal for emotions to fluctuate, especially during challenging times. Using relaxation techniques, seeking support from friends or family, and taking time for self-care can all help manage these emotions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He chases them and manages to click photos of the robbers. When he tries to escape, he is stopped by a young woman Renuka 'Renu' (Karthika Nair) who assumes he is the culprit and helps the robbers to take his camera. However, he is able to secure the memory card of the camera. The police catch him, and to prove that he is a press photographer, he shows the photos to them, who identify everyone except the gang leader (whose face is covered by a mask). At his office, he again meets Renuka, who has newly joined as Article Editor. Saraswathi 'Saro' (Piaa Bajpai) also works in his office and has feelings for Ashwin, who does not reciprocate. Settled in her new job, Renuka writes a cover story about a politician Aalavandhan (Kota Srinivasa Rao), describing his attempt to marry a minor. Enraged by this, Aalavandhan barges into the newspaper office and shouts at Renuka. The audio recording of her interview disappears (courtesy Aalavandhan), and she is fired from her job for falsified reporting. Ashwin later risks his life to capture the pictures of Aalavandhan who actually engages in child marriage in a temple at midnight. Later the story with the photos is printed in their newspaper and this makes Renuka to fall in love with Ashwin, which the latter reciprocates. Saro is initially jealous of the love between Ashwin and Renuka, but later accepts it and gets over Ashwin.

Olympic sports Olympic sports are sports contested in the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. The 2016 Summer Olympics included 28 sports, with five additional sports due to be added to the 2020 Summer Olympics. The 2014 Winter Olympics included seven sports. The number and kinds of events may change slightly from one Olympiad to another. Each Olympic sport is represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation (IF). The International Olympic Committee (IOC) establishes a hierarchy of sports, disciplines, and events. According to this hierarchy, the Olympic sports can be subdivided into multiple disciplines, which are often assumed to be distinct sports. Examples include swimming and water polo (disciplines of aquatics, represented by the International Swimming Federation), or figure skating and speed skating (disciplines of skating, represented by the International Skating Union). In their turn, disciplines can be subdivided into events, for which medals are actually awarded. A sport or discipline is included in the Olympic program if the IOC determines it is widely practiced around the world, that is, the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sport's prevalence. The IOC's requirements reflect participation in the Olympic Games as well--more stringent toward men (as they are represented in higher numbers) and summer sports (as more nations compete in the Summer Olympics). Is this statement correct \\"does the summer olympics have more sports than the winter olympics\\"?","output":"Yes, that's right! The Summer Olympics have more sports than the Winter Olympics.

Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What two compositions did Holst write in 1906? ?  Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which...

This earthquake ruptured at least two imbricate structures in Longmen Shan Fault System, i.e. the Beichuan Fault and the Guanxian–Anxian Fault. In the epicentral area, the average slip in Beichuan Fault was about 3.5 metres (11 ft) vertical, 3.5 metres (11 ft) horizontal-parallel to the fault, and 4.8 metres (16 ft) horizontal-perpendicular to the fault. In the area about 30 kilometres (19 mi) northeast of the epicenter, the surface slip on Beichuan Fault was almost purely dextral strike-slip up to about 3 metres (9.8 ft), while the average slip in Guanxian–Anxian Fault was about 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) vertical and 2.3 metres (7 ft 7 in) horizontal. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What was the horizontal slippage in the Beichuan Fault at the epicenter?","output":"The horizontal slippage in the Beichuan Fault at the epicenter can be calculated by considering both components of the horizontal slip: parallel and perpendicular to the fault. As mentioned, the horizontal-parallel slip was 3.5 meters (11 ft), and the horizontal-perpendicular slip was 4.8 meters (16 ft). To find the total horizontal slip, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: Total horizontal slip = √(horizontal-parallel slip² + horizontal-perpendicular slip²) Total horizontal slip = √(3.5² + 4.8²) Total horizontal slip = √(12.25 + 23.04) Total horizontal slip = √(35.29) Total horizontal slip ≈ 5.94 meters.

The statement mainly provides information about Yugoslavia's action towards foreign visitors and visa requirements during that time. To answer the original question, we need to delve into the historical background of Josip Broz Tito's involvement in Arab-Israeli peace processes. Tito, a prominent political leader and the leader of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, actively participated in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), an international organization that was neither aligned with or against any major power bloc and aimed to ensure national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of non-aligned member countries. The primary goal of NAM was to promote peace, cooperation, and global development. Tito's engagement in Arab-Israeli peace processes was inherently connected to his role as one of the NAM leaders. Although there is no precise date or year when Tito first started working on the Arab-Israeli peace process, the search for peace and justice in the Middle East became one of NAM's priorities during the 1960s, and materials point to the active role Yugoslavia played in that decade. Tito managed to maintain good relations with both Arab countries and Israel throughout the 1950s, and his policy of non-alignment allowed him the opportunity to mediate the Arab-Israeli conflict to some extent. During the 1960s, Tito's efforts to mediate the conflict were hampered by the ongoing tensions and wars in the region, but he still managed to maintain diplomatic relations with both sides. More specifically, in 1967, Tito was one of the main driving forces behind the NAM's decision to convene an emergency conference of NAM Foreign Ministers in Belgrade concerning the Arab-Israeli war. Tito's efforts to bring together the foreign ministers of NAM countries to support peace and condemn Israel's aggression marked a significant moment in his involvement in Arab-Israeli peace processes. In summary, although there is no specific year when Tito began working on Arab-Israeli peace processes, his involvement and efforts to promote peace and justice in the Middle East through Non-Aligned Movement became more visible during the 1960s. The statement about Yugoslavia opening its borders to foreign visitors in 1967 does not address Tito's work in Arab-Israeli peace processes directly and does not provide a correct answer to the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Ask a trusted friend, family member, or neighbor to keep an eye out on your home while you’re away. It is absolutely essential that you trust this person and know that they will follow through with checking in.  A next door neighbor is a convenient person to monitor your home since they are the most likely person to notice any unusual situations. Do not sacrifice convenience for trust. If you do not feel completely comfortable asking your next door neighbor to check on your home, ask a close friend or family member. Remember to return the favor and offer to do the same for them when they are on vacation. Overgrown lawns or driveways full of snow are surefire giveaways that the homeowner isn’t at home.  Be mindful of your friend’s time and offer compensation for these chores. For example, if the neighbor that you’ve asked to keep an eye on things has a teenage son or daughter, offer to pay their child to complete these tasks. Always return the favor and offer to do the same when they go away on vacation. Interior lights signal that someone is at home but leaving your lights on all the time while you are away is not cost effective. A programmable light switch will turn on select lights at a certain time and then turn them off. This saves money, is energy efficient, and is a useful deterrent. An intruder who is watching your home closely may notice that the lights go on and off at certain times every day. Set a schedule for your timers that varies day by day. Never post on social media that you are leaving for a vacation. Avoid posting pictures from your vacation while you are still away, checking in at the airport or your vacation destination, or updating your friends about your vacation. Internet safety is extremely important. Many burglars learn about their potential victims through social media when they post that they will be away, how long they’ll be away, and where they’re going. Notify the post office that you will be away so they do not leave mail and packages at your door. You can also ask your neighbor to collect your mail for you if you prefer not to stop your mail altogether. Avoid scheduling deliveries, like those for online shopping, for times when you are away. Packages that are left outside your front door are easily stolen and alert others that you are out of town. This applies to your curtains, your blinds, or shutters that cover your windows. If you typically leave your blinds open during the day, consider leaving them open when you are away. Noticeable changes can alert others that you aren’t home, like if your curtains are pulled shut for two weeks straight when they are normally open. Summary:","output":"The article discusses the importance of having a trusted friend, family member, or neighbor monitor your home while you're away, maintaining the appearance of being at home, using programmable light switches, practicing internet safety by not sharing vacation details on social media, managing mail and deliveries, and keeping consistent window coverings to prevent burglars from targeting your home during your absence."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"When patching a hole in drywall, you need to mud and tape the seams to make the wall smooth and strong again. Let me explain it in a simple way like I am talking to a five-year-old: 1. First, you need some mud, which is like thick, creamy stuff that helps stick things together. You'll also need tape, which is like a special kind of paper that helps cover the seams. 2. Start by applying the mud around the edges of the hole with a special tool called a \\"putty knife.\\" It's like a little spatula you use to spread the mud smoothly. 3. Then, you put the tape over the mud, making sure it covers the entire seam where the new piece of drywall meets the old one. This tape will help keep everything together and hide the seam. 4. Now you need to add more mud over the tape. This time, use a bigger putty knife to spread the mud so it covers a larger area and blends in with the rest of the wall. Be sure to keep it smooth! 5. Let the mud dry for some time. It might take a day to dry completely. Once it's dry, you might need to add more mud and make it smoother. 6. When the mud is completely dry, you can use a special paper called \\"sanding paper\\" to make it all nice and smooth. Then, you can paint it, and you won't even be able to see where the hole was! Remember to be patient and take your time to make it look perfect!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Options: - dribbling - full of air - bouncing around court - punctured - round  Explain why a human would choose \\"round\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human is likely to choose \\"round\\" as the answer to the question because it is the only option that accurately reflects the nature of the ball and rim involved in the process of rebounding in basketball. In this context, \\"round\\" pertains to their physical shape, which plays a significant role in making the prediction of a rebound difficult. Let's examine each option to get a better understanding of why \\"round\\" would be the most suitable answer: - Dribbling: Dribbling is an action performed by the players to move the ball across the court while complying with the rules of the game. It is not the inherent nature of the ball or rim and does not relate directly to predicting a rebound. - Full of air: Although a basketball does contain air to maintain its bounce and functionality, this characteristic is not directly responsible for the unpredictability of rebounds. Both the ball and rim need to be considered, and this option only pertains to the ball. - Bouncing around the court: This phrase might describe the general behavior of the basketball during gameplay, but again, it does not specifically address the ball and rim's characteristics that make rebounds hard to predict. - Punctured: A punctured ball would not even be suitable for playing. Moreover, it does not provide any information about the rim's features. This option is not relevant to the question. - Round: A round ball and rim are intrinsic attributes that contribute to the difficulty of predicting rebounds in basketball. The round nature of these components creates various angles that the ball may contact the rim, resulting in an unpredictable path or trajectory. Additionally, the ball's surface and elasticity may cause it to bounce in different directions when striking different parts of the rim. These variabilities make it challenging for players to anticipate a rebound accurately. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"round\\" as the answer to the question because it is the only option that addresses the physical characteristics of both the ball and the rim, which are the critical factors contributing to the difficulty of predicting rebounds in basketball. The round shape and resulting interactions between the ball and the rim lead to the unpredictable nature of rebounds, setting this option apart from the others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Spitzer call girl: ADA was my pimp After hooking for the city’s two most famous madams, turncoat call girl Rebecca Woodard says she suddenly found herself with a new pimp — the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. The pricey prostitute claims in her new tell-all tome that prosecutors forced her to continue to turn tricks after she agreed to wear a wire to help snare “Hockey Mom Madam” Anna Gristina in 2008. “They wanted me to keep breaking the law so they could get more information,” writes Woodard, 37, who also detailed her rough sex-for-hire with disgraced ex-Gov. Eliot Spitzer. “They encouraged me to keep working for Anna as a call girl,” she writes of her covert gig. “It was like sex slavery at the behest of the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. “The ADA told me to work in order to garner information for him and then turn over to his office the money and any gifts that clients gave me. I actually did this,” she writes. “Technically, this ADA was my pimp.” The Post first revealed steamy details of Woodard’s book, “Call Girl Confidential,’’ written as Rebecca Kade, including claims she serviced a violent Spitzer, who grabbed her by the throat and choked her. While servicing Spitzer, Woodard was working for madam Kristin Davis. The DA’s office approached Woodard to go undercover after Davis was busted in 2008 and Woodard had already begun working for Gristina, who had sexy glamour shots taken of her and other girls to entice high-rolling johns. Woodard does not name the ADA, who was working under former DA Robert Morgenthau when the secret probe was launched, but gave several clues to his identity. Sources with knowledge of the investigation confirmed to The Post that she is referring to former ADA Mark Crooks, who worked the Official Corruption Unit under Morgenthau and his successor, Cy Vance, until taking a job as an assistant federal prosecutor in Maryland. “I highly doubt District Attorney Morgenthau was aware of the ADA’s shenanigans,” Woodard writes. “God knows if somebody pocketed the money [earned through the prostitution]. [And] this cowboy still has a job in law enforcement, in another state, at an even higher level” as “an assistant US attorney.” A spokesman for the Manhattan DA’s office declined comment. Crooks did not return messages left at his Maryland home. Woodard’s book paints her DA handlers as bumbling fools when it came to surveillance. At one point, Woodard was being prepped to record Gristina’s “money man,” accountant Jonas Gayer, during a meeting at his East Side apartment, and prosecutors wanted to run the wire around her waist and up her chest. “ ‘Are you kidding me?’ I nearly screamed,” Woodward writes. “ ‘It’s not going to work to wire my body, because the very first thing he’s going to do is feel me up.’ ” Prosecutors wound up buying her a 1,000 Chanel bag to hide the wiretap transmitter. Woodard — who claims she was raking in as much as 24,000 for some jobs — says she didn’t tell prosecutors about all her gigs. “Obviously, if I did this with every client I saw, I would have been broke, so I didn’t tell him about everybody,” she writes. After one particularly close call while wearing a wire to record Gristina and suspecting the madam was on to her, Woodward writes that she wanted out. “The ADA stared at me, and his face was turning red,” Woodard recounts. “He stormed out of the room . . . I never heard from him again.” Woodward finally landed a public defender, former prosecutor Seema Iyer, who was “flabbergasted” to hear how the ADA acted, Woodard claims. “[Iyer] made big trouble and said I could bring a lawsuit against the city,’’ she writes. But all of Woodard’s undercover work was for naught, she says. After the ADA left the office and another took over the case, “The new ADA said that all the work I did under the first ADA was thrown out because it would be inadmissable in court.” She writes that she was asked again to wear a wire, with prosecutors saying they’d arrest her for prostitution if she didn’t. “It was blackmail,” she writes. “I felt like he was trying to intimidate me into going back to work for them under these threats.’’ In 2011, she agreed to meet with another ADA, Gristina prosecutor Charlie Linehan, just “to talk,’’ she says. Linehan asked Woodard to wear a wire to help snare a rich financier who “had once asked me to procure a young boy for him,” Woodard writes. The man was “high-profile on Wall Street, in Davos, on Paternoster Square [and] had an image to protect in Manhattan and the Hamptons.’’ Linehan pressed her to threaten him that she’d “go to the media with the story that he got a b—job from an 11-year-old kid.” Woodard ambushed the man in his workplace lobby — but couldn’t get him to say anything damning.

In her tell-all book, \\"Call Girl Confidential\\", Woodard details her experiences with well-known clients such as former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer and her undercover work for the DA's office.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"A single answer ('A. no' or 'B. yes') cannot adequately address the two distinct questions presented, as each requires a different and detailed response. Therefore, the answer to whether these two questions would have the same answer is no. Below I provide detailed answers to each question. Question 1: Baby and honey? The terms \\"baby\\" and \\"honey\\" can both be used as terms of endearment, and their meanings are context-dependent. In this context: \\"Baby\\" typically refers to a very young child, usually a human infant (less than a year old). The term can also be used to describe the offspring of certain animals, usually mammals, such as puppies, kittens, or calves. \\"Honey\\" is a sweet food substance made by bees from the nectar of flowers. Bees store honey in a network of hexagonal beeswax cells called a honeycomb. Humans have harvested honey for thousands of years, as it is a natural sweetener and has other uses, such as in baking, cooking, and even as a natural remedy for certain ailments. In the context of terms of endearment, both \\"baby\\" and \\"honey\\" are often used to express affection or love towards a romantic partner or a very close friend or family member. These terms are usually used informally in conversation and are meant to convey warmth and closeness. Question 2: I want to study for about 8 to 10 hours, but my mind tells me to play. What to do, and it's my class 10th ICSE board examination? Balancing study and play during the exam preparation period is important for maintaining your mental well-being and academic success. Here are some tips to help you manage your time and focus effectively: 1. Create a study schedule: Set specific study hours each day and allocate time for each subject. Break down the time into smaller study intervals (e.g., 1-hour slots) and assign achievable goals for each interval. Include breaks and recreational activities in your schedule to avoid burnout. 2. Prioritize subjects: Identify areas or subjects where you need extra focus and allocate more time to cover those topics. Start with difficult topics and progress to easier ones to gain momentum and confidence. 3. Use a timer: Use a timer to help you stay on track with your study intervals. When the timer goes off, switch to a short break or a brief period of play, exercise, or relaxation. This will help refresh and reset your mind for the next study session. 4. Minimize distractions: Turn off or silence electronic devices that might distract you. Find a quiet and comfortable study space, and let your friends and family know when you are studying so they can help you stay focused. 5. Set playtime limits: Enjoy recreational activities in moderation by setting time limits. Engaging in physical or creative activities can actually help relieve stress and improve your cognitive abilities, but remember to stick to your planned schedule. 6. Stay organized: Keep your study materials and notes organized to facilitate effective learning. Maintain a daily or weekly to-do list to help you keep track of your progress. 7. Take care of yourself: Prioritize your physical and mental well-being by getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and engaging in physical activity regularly. 8. Seek support: Reach out to classmates, teachers, or tutors for study assistance or encouragement when needed. This will help expand your knowledge and improve your learning experience. By incorporating these tips, you can strike a balance between study and play while ensuring that you give your best effort to your class 10th ICSE board examination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The Slashdot effect, also known as slashdotting, occurs when a popular website links to a smaller website, causing a massive increase in traffic, the effect has been associated with other websites or metablogs such as Fark, a community website created by who, that allows members to comment on a daily batch of news articles, and other items from various website? Answer:","output":"The Slashdot Effect, often referred to as \\"slashdotting,\\" is a phenomenon that occurs when a highly popular website, such as Slashdot, links to a smaller or less-known website. This action results in a sudden and massive increase in traffic to the smaller website. The subsequent surge in visitors can cause the site to become slow, unresponsive, or even crash due to the unforeseen load on its servers. The term \\"Slashdot Effect\\" was coined after Slashdot, a technology-driven news website that gained prominence in the late 90s, and early 2000s for featuring and discussing various topics related to science, technology, and programming. Although the term is linked to Slashdot, similar effects have been observed with traffic surges resulting from links on other popular websites or metablogs. One such website is Fark, a community-driven news aggregator that focuses on offering its members a daily collection of news articles, current events, and other interesting content from various websites across the internet. Fark was created by Drew Curtis in 1999. This online platform curates the news submitted by its users and then allows the community to engage in discussions, share thoughts, and post comments on the featured content. Fark has a dedicated user base, with many members visiting the site on a daily basis to keep up to date with the latest happenings and join in on the active conversations. Fark's popularity has made it a prime candidate for causing traffic surges to smaller websites when it links to them. When this happens, the website receiving the surge in traffic may experience the same consequences observed in the Slashdot Effect, such as slow loading times or potential server crashes. In conclusion, the Slashdot Effect, or \\"slashdotting,\\" is a phenomenon where a smaller website experiences a significant increase in traffic after being linked by a popular site like Slashdot or Fark. Fark, a community-driven news aggregator that allows members to discuss various news articles and other items of interest, was created by Drew Curtis in 1999. Similar to Slashdot, Fark's popularity can lead to a significant effect on smaller websites when they are linked, causing challenges for those sites in handling the unexpected influx of visitors."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 –  7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.

What might be the first step of the process?","output":"The first step of the virus infection process is the entry of the virus into the human or animal body. This usually occurs through one of the following routes: 1. Respiratory transmission: In this mode of transmission, the virus is present in tiny droplets expelled when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. These droplets can be inhaled by another person, allowing the virus to enter the respiratory system. For example, the influenza virus and the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic primarily spread through respiratory transmission. 2. Direct contact: Viruses can also be transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual. For example, viruses causing skin infections like herpes simplex virus can transmit via direct contact. 3. Indirect contact: In this case, viruses are present on contaminated surfaces or objects (called fomites), which can be touched by another person. This contaminated surface can later come into contact with a person's eyes, mouth, or nose, and thereby facilitate viral entry. 4. Vector-borne transmission: In some cases, viruses are transmitted to humans or animals by a vector, which is typically a blood-sucking insect, such as a mosquito. For example, the Zika virus and dengue virus are transmitted by the Aedes mosquito vector. 5. Fecal-oral transmission: Some viruses can survive in an infected person's feces and contaminate food or water supplies. If another person ingests the contaminated substance, the virus can enter their body via the digestive system. Examples include norovirus, which causes gastroenteritis, and hepatitis A virus, which can cause liver disease. 6. Bloodborne transmission: Viruses can also enter the body through contact with infected blood, semen, vaginal fluids, or other bodily fluids. This can happen through shared needles, during medical procedures, or sexual contact. Examples include HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses. Once the virus gains entry into the body through any of these transmission routes, it begins the infection process by targeting the specific cells or tissues it is equipped to infect. For instance, respiratory viruses attach to cells lining the respiratory tract, while gastrointestinal viruses infect the cells of the digestive tract. The virus then binds to specific receptors on the cell's surface, using viral surface proteins like spikes or glycoproteins, which allow it to gain entry by fusing with the cell membrane or by being engulfed by the cell. After entering a cell, the virus hijacks the host cell's machinery to replicate its genetic material, produce viral proteins, and assemble new virus particles. Once a sufficient number of virus particles have been produced, they are either released back into the surrounding environment, where they can infect nearby cells or tissues, or enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system to distribute throughout the body and reach other target organs. As the viral infection progresses and spreads, the host's immune system responds by activating various defense mechanisms, including the production of antibodies and the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection. These immune responses help to eliminate the virus, although they can also contribute to the symptoms and tissue damage associated with viral illnesses. In some cases, the immune response fails to control the infection, resulting in severe or even fatal outcomes. However, in many cases, the immune system successfully clears the virus from the body, leading to recovery and the establishment of immunity to future infections."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices:  - the debris bowl  - the flow bowl  - the land bowl  - the dust bowl  A: The answer is:","output":"The Dust Bowl The Dust Bowl was a severe environmental and agricultural disaster that took place during the 1930s in the central United States, specifically the Great Plains region. This devastating event taught people that soil could be lost through plowing and growing crops, which led to widespread soil erosion. As a consequence, new methods and practices were developed and encouraged to prevent further soil erosion and land degradation in the future. The Dust Bowl was caused by a combination of factors, including drought, inappropriate farming practices (such as deep plowing), and economic depression. The severe drought during the 1930s led to a lack of moisture in the soil, making it much more susceptible to wind erosion. Additionally, deep plowing of the native grasses, which helped to hold the soil together, left the topsoil exposed and vulnerable to being blown away by strong winds. As massive dust storms began to roll across the Great Plains, millions of tons of precious topsoil were lost, leading to severe agricultural, economic, and environmental consequences. Crop yields plummeted, and many farmers were forced to abandon their lands and migrate in search of better opportunities. This mass exodus of families during the Dust Bowl era, famously depicted in John Steinbeck's novel \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" deeply affected rural communities throughout the affected region. The Dust Bowl prompted the U.S. government and agronomists to take action in the hopes of preventing such a catastrophe from happening again. New farming practices and methods were developed and promoted to help prevent soil erosion and conserve the land. These included contour plowing, crop rotation, planting cover crops, and using windbreaks (rows of trees) to reduce wind speeds and protect the soil. The establishment of the Soil Conservation Service (now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service) in 1935 was a direct response to the Dust Bowl, and this agency continues to work today to help farmers and landowners implement sustainable land management practices."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In a very strange experiment by Andy Warhol, Empire is literally one continuous shot of New York's Empire State Building for eight hours and five minutes.

Article: Truman Capote's cremated remains invited to attend 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' Broadway premier      Producers wanted to fly the ashes in from Los Angeles to attend the March 20 opening party            Joanna Carson, former wife of comedian Johnny Carson, still keeps the remains in the Bel Air bedroom where the writer died in 1984      Broadway producers who want big stars at their premier usually want ones with a pulse.            But the folks who put Truman Capote’s Breakfast at Tiffany’s on Broadway wanted the late author cremated remains at the play premier’s after party, since Capote himself couldn't make it.            They even went so far as to offer the ashes—and their owner—a flight from Los Angeles to New York for the show.      Odd guest: In honor of the late writer, producers of Broadway's 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' tried to fly Truman Capote's ashes in for their New York premier      A source of the New York Post confirmed the bizarre offer.            ‘We did try to get him here,’ the source said. ‘We thought it would have been poignant for the entire company.’            Former wife of Johnny Carson, Joanne Carson, keeps the In Cold Blood author’s remains in the Bel Air bedroom where he died in 1984.            The two were close friends up until his death and Carson has seen the ashes argued over, stolen, returned, and nearly stolen again over the years.      Old friends: Joanne Carson (here with then husband Johnny in 1969) possesses Capote's remains in her Bel Air home      The ashes were famously boosted during Carson’s 1988 Halloween party, along with 200,000 worth of jewelry.            However, they were mysteriously returned shortly thereafter.      That’s when Capote’s longtime partner questioned whether the ashes were those of his dead lover at all.            Someone again attempted to steal the remains at a showing put on by Carson of the play Tru, which is adapted from Capote’s works.      Broadway turn: The beloved book was first a film starring Audrey Hepburn (right) as Holly Golightly and saw its big stage debut March 20 with actress Emilia Clarke (left) in the role            It was the history of theft that doomed Capote's post-mortem trip to the theater, or so says the Post's source.      ' Ultimately, the risk of theft was just too high.'            In spite of the drama surrounding them, Carson has referred to her cremated friend’s remain as ‘her sanity’ over the years.            And Carson claims Capote always wanted to see ‘Holly Golightly open on Broadway.’       ||||| Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)      For the “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” opening on Broadway this week, the production tried to bring in one secret surprise guest: the ashes of late author Truman Capote.      Reps for the show — starring “Game of Thrones” star Emilia Clarke, and based on Capote’s 1958 novella — even offered complimentary first-class round-trip airfare for the ashes and their owner, Johnny Carson’s ex Joanne Carson, to travel from Bel Air to New York and appear at an Edison Ballroom after-party.      But given people’s past predilection for trying to steal Capote’s remains, it was too risky.      “[Joanne] Carson was Capote’s closest confidante in his later years,” said a source, “and she keeps a portion of his cremated remains in an urn in her Bel Air home, in the room in which he died in 1984.”      The ashes were infamously stolen from Carson’s house during a 1988 Halloween party — along with 200,000 in jewels — and then the remains were just as mysteriously returned in the middle of the night. Meanwhile, Capote’s late, longtime lover Jack Dunphy openly disputed whether the ashes Carson kept were even Capote’s at all.      Adding to the intrigue, the same ashes were the target of another thief years later, when Carson brought them to a bash she hosted for a play about Capote, “Tru.” That culprit, says a source, was caught “before he could make it out the door” with a piece of the acclaimed novelist.      “We did try to get him here,” confirmed a “Breakfast” rep of Capote’s ashes. “Joanne says he always wanted to [see] Holly Golightly open on Broadway, and we thought it would have been poignant for the entire company. I think ultimately the risk of theft was just too high, but he was certainly there in spirit.”      Joanne has said of Capote, “His ashes were my sanity for . . . years. Truman often referred to me as his very own Holly Golightly come to life. He always told me you could be anything you wanted but, whatever happens, never be boring.”      The star-studded black-and-white-themed after-party for “Breakfast” was hosted by Debbie Harry and Interview magazine. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Broadway producers wanted Truman Capote's cremated remains to attend the premier of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" offering a flight from Los Angeles to New York for the ashes and their owner, Joanne Carson.

Hip abductor machines provide resistance as you work muscles pivotal to healthy hips. Sit so that your feet are on the foot rests and knee pads are outside of your legs. Use your strength to push the pads from a closed to an open position, away from your body. Bring the weight slowly back to a stop. Do this in sets of ten at a manageable weight. Be sure to emphasize good form. Weights too high or too many reps can lead to injury. Gyms may have machines that slightly vary. If you have any questions about how to use a hip abductor machine, ask a gym employee for help. Jogging is great for overall health but can cause wear and tear to your joints, especially knees, hips, and ankles. Use cardio machines at the gym to get the same benefits of cardio, without all the problems.  Use an elliptical machine. This is a low impact exercise that will increase the range of motion in your hips. Simply follow the instructions and start striding at a comfortable resistance level. This will promote the same range of motion as jogging without the impact of hitting the ground. Stationary bikes are among the best exercise options for hip problems. They're great for increasing your range of motion, keeping joints mobile, and building up strength as you progress to longer, more difficult workouts. Tread climbers work much like walking. You will have to stretch your hips to maintain a natural walking stride. Similarly, a stair climber will stretch and strengthen your hips muscles. The incline of the stair climber will force you to stretch and stabilize your muscles. Both of these should be done with caution and after consultation with your doctor or physical therapist. Cardio and machines are great but there are few strength training equivalents to free weights. Weight training can be a little more difficult than other strengthening exercises, but if done properly and safely yields great results.  Use bench step up exercises to build strength. Find a dumbbell weight that you are comfortable with. Hold a dumbbell in each hand down to your side. Stand in front of a bench lengthwise. Step up with your right foot, holding your left leg to the side. Hold for three seconds then repeat with the other foot. Bent knee deadlifts get the benefits of the Olympic dead lift without the same strain. Again, find a light dumbbell and hold one in each hand. Stand with your feet shoulder length apart, holding each dumbbell with your palms facing in. Keeping your head up, shoulders back and knees slightly bent, bend forward slightly, lowering the dumbbells along your legs. Keep your body weight above your heels and slowly return to a starting position. Use dumbbell lunges to stretch your hips. Keep a dumbbell in each hand and stand upright. Step forward with your right foot, keeping your left leg stationary behind. Lower your upper body down while maintaining your balance. Using the heel of your forward foot, return to your starting position.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.  I am facing a new situation today: Steve and Chris sit down at a new cafe that just opened up in town after hearing rave reviews of it at work. They look at the menus trying to decide what to order when a waiter shows up and asks if they would like anything to drink. Steve says he would like a glass of water that has molecules far apart. Chris orders water with molecules closer together. The waiter looks at them with a rather confused look and asks them to please elaborate.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Whose cup of water is more dense?

Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

It's a sport fueled by passion, discipline, and a burning desire to be the best. For some athletes, success is often measured by wins and losses, but for one man - Carlos Condit - it goes beyond that. The \\"Natural Born Killer\\" has made an indelible mark on the MMA landscape with his relentless fighting style and unyielding spirit. In this article, we will explore Condit's unique outlook on the sport and his remarkable journey thus far. Born on April 26, 1984, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Carlos Condit was introduced to MMA at a young age. His father, Brian, was a well-respected figure in the combat sports community and served as a guiding force in his son's development. Learning from various martial arts styles, including kickboxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and wrestling, Condit cultivated a diverse skill set that would come to define his career.  Although his journey to professional fighting began in 2002, it wasn't until his performance in the now-defunct World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC) that he truly made a name for himself. Possessing incredible striking, submission skills, and impressive takedown defense, Condit quickly became a fan favorite. This led him to capture the WEC Welterweight Championship in 2007 - a victory that would propel him into the larger UFC organization. Within the UFC, Condit continued to impress, etching his name in the annals of the promotion's history with jaw-dropping performances against the likes of Martin Kampmann, Dan Hardy, and Dong Hyun Kim. In one of the most memorable fights of his career, Condit defeated Nick Diaz for the interim UFC Welterweight Championship in 2012. Despite his success, it was during this time that Condit's philosophy on the sport truly took form. \\"I started to realize that victories and losses were just moments in time,\\" Condit explains. \\"Yes, they define your career in some ways, but they don't have to define your self-worth as a competitor or as a person.\\" This outlook was tested when the Albuquerque native faced a series of setbacks in the form of injuries and closely contested losses. However, instead of allowing these adversities to deter him, Condit channeled them as motivation and gained invaluable insights about himself and the sport he loves. \\"I learned that you can't get too attached to the outcome,\\" he says. \\"It's the journey and the process that truly matter. You have to see the bigger picture and continuously work on evolving yourself - both inside and outside the cage.\\" This mentality has allowed Condit to approach his fights with a different perspective - one that focuses on the enjoyment, growth, and learning that comes from competition. Consequently, it has also endearingly solidified him as a revered figure within the MMA community. As Condit enters the twilight of his career, his long-standing relationship with the sport has reaped a wealth of personal growth, as well as legions of loyal fans. An embodiment of resilience and determination, the Natural Born Killer has left an undeniable impact on the hearts and minds of those who have followed his remarkable journey.  In the end, Carlos Condit's lasting legacy in MMA will not solely be based on the number of wins or losses on his record. What will endure is the undeniable spirit, the passion for the sport, and the unwavering perseverance he displayed throughout his iconic career. And, in doing so, he has beautifully demonstrated that, sometimes, it's not all about winning or losing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Consulting detective Sherlock Holmes fakes his own death in Scotland in order to investigate a number of bizarre apparent suicides that he is convinced are part of an elaborate plot by \\"a female Moriarty\\". Returning to his assistant Watson in secret, Holmes notes that all the victims were wealthy gamblers, so disguised as \\"Rajni Singh\\", a distinguished Indian officer, he stalks London's gaming clubs. It is not long before he encounters the villain of the piece, Adrea  Spedding. Holmes discovers that she seeks out men short of money, persuades them to pawn their life insurance policies with her accomplices, then kills them. Holmes sets himself up as her next victim, discovering that she uses the deadly spider, Lycosa Carnivora, whose venom causes such excruciating pain that the victims kill themselves. Holmes also finds the footprint of a child nearby. Searching for evidence Holmes and Watson visit eminent arachnologist Matthew Ordway, who may have supplied the deadly creatures. Holmes soon realizes that the man he is speaking to is an impostor, but the villain makes his escape. Searching the premises, Holmes finds the corpse of the real Ordway, as well as his journals, which allude to something or someone from Central Africa immune to the spider venom. This baffles Holmes until he finds the model skeleton of a child. However, Dr. Watson points out that the relation of the skull and the circumference of the chest prove it is not a child, and Holmes deduces that the Central African thing described in the journal is a pygmy. Holmes and Watson continue their investigations at a nearby fairground, where Holmes allows himself to fall into the clutches of Spedding and her gang. Bound and gagged, Holmes is tied behind a moving target in a shooting gallery, at which Lestrade and Watson take pot shots with a  .22 rifle.

His business partner, Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) enters and walks partially upstairs when he is hailed by Jarrod. He tells Jarrod he's there to study the account books. They have a philosophical difference between their approaches to business. Jarrod proposes a buyout arrangement, and Burke either eager or desperate for the money agrees in principle. A potential investor is scheduled to see Jarrod that very evening.Bruce Allison (Phillip Tonge) and Sidney Wallace (Paul Cavanagh) arrive and are given a brief tour of the wax museum. Wallace is impressed, but Jarrod explains that he's never satisfied with certain aspects of the finished products. Wallace explains he's going to Egypt for three months, so no decision on investment can take place prior to his return. Allison and Wallace depart. Burke was eavesdropping from the upstairs room and heard everything. He is impatient for a financial settlement and proposes an insurance fire. The place is insured for 25,000--12,500 each. Jarrod is horrified by the proposal, and opposes it categorically. Burke lights the Marie Antoinette wax figure's dress with a match. It starts a fire that Jarrod quickly extinguishes. Burke starts a few more fires, with Jarrod quickly working to save his wax figures. Burke and Jarrod fight, and at one point Jarrod is knocked out. Burke douses the workroom and display area with a flammable liquid and turns on the gas light spigots. He goes upstairs as the place begins to catch fire. He returns to the workroom and continues his fight with the now revived Jarrod. Jarrod works desperately with buckets of water to douse the fire, but it is a losing battle. He is knocked out again by Burke and left... My question: Who is Henry Jarrod's business partner? Answer:","output":"Henry Jarrod's business partner in the House of Wax movie plot is Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which team had people with crescent shaped cells in their blood?  Doctor Jones studied two teams of workers. Team one had healthy people with normal red blood cell levels, but team two had people with sickle-cell anemia. the differences in health parameters were amazing and obvious.  Hint: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.

Options: - Fill a bowl with apple cider vinegar and a bit of water. The vinegar will attract them and the water will kill them. - Fill a bowl with apple cider vinegar and a bit of soap. The vinegar will attract them and the soap will kill them.","output":"The second option is the better one because it makes more sense. Fruit flies are attracted to the apple cider vinegar because it smells like yummy, rotting fruit, which they love. But just vinegar and water won't kill them - they might be able to just float there or fly away when they're done.  On the other hand, adding a bit of soap to the vinegar changes the game. Soap reduces the surface tension of the water and vinegar mixture. Surface tension is like a magic invisible blanket that normally lets bugs walk on water without falling in. When the soap is added, the magic blanket disappears. So, when the fruit flies land on the yummy vinegar, they would sink into the liquid because there is no surface tension to support them, and they'd drown. Therefore, the latter option is more effective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was appointed as chief engraver in 1844? is inside the article: James Barton Longacre (August 11, 1794 – January 1, 1869) was an American portraitist and engraver, and the fourth Chief Engraver of the United States Mint from 1844 until his death. Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm.  He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre.  Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained.  Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece.  In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.  Longacre's coins are generally well-regarded today, although they have been criticized for lack of artistic..., can you guess it ?

I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me. We’re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day. But I look back now on this “prank” and I realize that she was kind of…wrong. Sure if the instructions are short like 15 steps it might be good to glance through before you start. But what about a whole load of instructions? Who the hell is going to read through the instructions for how to build their Death Star LEGO set before even starting to build it.

Avoid tomatoes with bug spots, bruises and other damage.","output":"The most logical next event after selecting your tomatoes would be to prepare them for freezing. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you freeze tomatoes successfully: Step 1: Clean the tomatoes Before freezing, it is essential to clean your tomatoes thoroughly to remove any dirt, bacteria, or residue. Gently wash the tomatoes under running water and use a soft cloth or vegetable brush if necessary. After washing, dry them completely with a clean towel or paper towel to remove excess moisture. Step 2: Blanch the tomatoes (optional) Blanching is the process of boiling tomatoes for a short period followed by an immediate transfer to an ice-water bath. This step helps in making it easier to peel the skin off once they are frozen. To blanch tomatoes, follow the steps below: 1. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. 2. Cut a small \\"X\\" at the bottom of each tomato using a sharp knife. This will facilitate the peeling process after blanching. 3. Place the tomatoes in the boiling water for 30-60 seconds or until the skin starts to loosen. 4. Use a slotted spoon to quickly transfer the tomatoes to an ice water bath to halt the cooking process. 5. Once cooled, gently peel the skin off the tomatoes. If you prefer to leave the skin on, you can skip the blanching process. Step 3: Remove stems and core the tomatoes Using a small, sharp knife, carefully cut out the stem and core from the top of each tomato. This step ensures the removal of the tough and undesirable portions of the tomato. Step 4: Cut the tomatoes (optional) Depending on your preference and intended use, you can choose to freeze the tomatoes whole, halved, quartered, or chopped. Cut the tomatoes in the desired size and shape, and make sure to remove any excess seeds and juice. If you plan on using the tomatoes primarily for sauces or stews, you may consider crushing or pureeing them. Step 5: Arrange tomatoes on a baking sheet To prevent the tomatoes from sticking together when frozen, spread them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat in a single layer. Make sure the tomatoes are not touching to allow for even freezing. Step 6: Pre-freeze the tomatoes Place the baking sheet with tomatoes in the freezer for a few hours or until they are firm and solid. This process is known as flash freezing and helps in maintaining the quality and texture of tomatoes when defrosting. Step 7: Transfer to airtight containers or freezer bags Once the tomatoes have been pre-frozen, transfer them to airtight containers or heavy-duty freezer bags. Label the bags with the date, type of tomato, and any other relevant information. Ensure you squeeze out any excess air to prevent freezer burn and to save space. Step 8: Store in the freezer Place the airtight containers or freezer bags in the freezer. Frozen tomatoes can be stored for up to six months to a year, although it is recommended to use them within six months for optimal quality and flavor. Now your tomatoes are ready to be frozen and used in a variety of dishes in the future. Remember, when defrosting and using the tomatoes, they may no longer have the firm texture that they had before freezing. Thus, frozen tomatoes are best used in cooked dishes such as sauces, stews, soups, or casseroles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

An SUV had gone off the road,down a hill, and collided with a tree. When we heard the wreck, I remembered to say \\"call 911\\". My family was the first on the scene. Nick, my son, was on the cell phone with 911. He saw a friend who was a victim in the crash who was a 15 years old girl who was badly disfigured and had died instantly. It was a terrible scene. There had been six people in the truck, all between 15 and 17 years old. My husband and I checked all the victims, and I picked one who was conscious and stayed with him. I talked with him and had him lay on the ground. When I asked him if he was hurt, he said he was sore all over. When help arrived, they asked me to stay and continue working with them. I did as Debbie Romine, .my instructor, said in class, and did what they wanted. They even said thank you before they left.

It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

So, we can write this information as an equation:   (A - 5) + (B - 5) = 15 * 2 - Currently, the average age of A, B, and C is 20 years. So, we can write this information as another equation:   A + B + C = 20 * 3 Step 3: Solve the equations to get the variables' values. Solve the first equation for (A - 5) + (B - 5) = 15 * 2:   A - 5 + B - 5 = 30   A + B = 30 + 5 + 5   A + B = 40 Since we know A + B = 40, we can substitute this value into the second equation A + B + C = 20 * 3:   40 + C = 60   C = 60 - 40   C = 20 Step 4: Calculate the age of C after 14 years. Now that we know the present age of C is 20, we can calculate how old C will be after 14 years.   The future age of C = Present age of C + 14 years   The future age of C = 20 + 14   The future age of C = 34 Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.

Consider whether you want to leave property to your heirs through a trust.  Because the trust is revocable, you can change your mind at any time (unless you become incapacitated). The only cost you will incur is the cost of retitling property back to your own name. Realize that the mortgage follows the property into the trust. Your ownership interest in any business is probably quite valuable. You should consider leaving those interests to people in your revocable trust. For example, you might leave the following:  You can transfer the assets and business name of a sole proprietorship to the revocable trust. You might be able transfer your ownership interest in a partnership to the trust, although you should check the partnership document first. Some partnership documents limit your ability to make this transfer. You might also be able to transfer shares in a closely held company to your revocable trust. You may also be able to transfer your ownership interest in a limited liability company, though you will need other owners to agree. A trust can own business property but cannot operate a business. If the business interests to be transferred are S corporation shares, care must be taken not to violate the ownership rules for S status. You can also add different financial accounts to your revocable trust. Once you include the account in the trust, the trust owns the assets in the account.

Write an article based on this summary: – Today is World TB Day, and its arrival is met with some gloomy new estimates about the presence of tuberculosis among the world's kids. A study published in Lancet has found that as many as 1 million children under age 15 are hit with TB each year, reports the Wall Street Journal. That's double the previously established estimate, and some two-thirds of all cases go undiagnosed. The Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School researchers were also able to for the first time put a number on the instances of what Reuters terms a \\"drug-resistant 'superbug' strain\\" of TB: MDR-TB. As many as 32,000 kids across the globe become sick with that form each year. Reuters notes that researchers have historically focused more on TB in adults, for a duo of reasons: Adults are more likely to pass on the disease; and the diagnosis methods used on adults don't always work on kids, in part because up to 30% of children who develop TB do so somewhere other than their lungs. But the attention is shifting to children in part because of what they can reveal about the transmission of the disease among adults: TB develops much more rapidly in children, signalling the presence of the disease in their adult family members or community. \\"These 1 million children are missed opportunities for preventing TB every year,\\" says the co-senior author of the study.","output":"Title: World TB Day Sheds Light on Alarming Increase of Tuberculosis Among Children Introduction World Tuberculosis (TB) Day is a poignant reminder of the ongoing battle against this deadly disease. This year, the day is marked by some disheartening new findings on the prevalence of TB among children. According to a study published in Lancet, as many as 1 million children under the age of 15 are affected by TB each year. This figure is double the previously estimated number and highlights the fact that nearly two-thirds of all cases go undiagnosed. 1. The Situation Researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School have brought to light the concerning issue of undiagnosed TB in children, revealing that many are suffering from the disease worldwide. In addition, the study has identified the presence of a drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis known as MDR-TB, which affects over 32,000 children every year. 2. Reasons for Underdiagnosis Historically, researchers have primarily focused on TB in adults for two main reasons: adults are more likely to transmit the disease, and diagnostic methods used for adults are not always effective for children. This is because up to 30% of children who develop tuberculosis do so in areas other than their lungs, making diagnosis more difficult. 3. Changing Focus Now, attention is shifting towards children as they can reveal important insights about the transmission of TB among adults. Tuberculosis develops much more rapidly in children, which often signals the presence of the disease in their adult family members or community. By focusing on children, researchers hope to shed light on how the disease is transmitted in adults and ultimately curtail the spread of TB. 4. Prevention and Opportunities With the discovery that 1 million children are affected by tuberculosis each year, researchers emphasize the missed opportunities for prevention. By identifying and treating the disease in children, it can not only help them recover but also hinder the disease's transmission to their adult family members and the community. Conclusion The findings in the Lancet study underscore the importance of addressing tuberculosis in children, both for the youngsters' health and to better understand the transmission of the disease among adults. As World TB Day approaches, it is crucial to recognize these revelations and make a concerted effort to diagnose, treat, and prevent the spread of tuberculosis in children worldwide."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: Title: Seriously - Best I've Ever Owned Review: Every winter I normally have to buy a new pair of slippers, and I'm never quite happy with them.I just got these tamarac's last night and I don't want to take them off, they are seriously the best slippers ever.I'm in the middle of a busy day at work and I'm actually taking the time to share just how much I like them.I think the reports of the sizing issues are a bit exaggerated though. I wear a US10 tennis shoe and from all the reports this slipper runs small so I went with an 11 - I should have stuck with a 10.I know this is silly, but I'm picky about my slippers - these are easy on/off, perfectly padded, perfectly breathable, quality made, although they do make a bit of noise when you walk on hardwoods (sound like clogs b/c they are clogs).It's weird I feel this way about a pair of slippers. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review is positive. The user expresses their satisfaction with the Tamarac slippers and claims they are \\"the best slippers ever.\\" They also mention liking various aspects of the slippers, such as the ease of putting them on and taking them off, the padding, breathability, and quality.

Gently shaking his head and shrugging his shoulders, he said, \\"You don't say!\\" \\"You don't say!\\" I was puzzled. I thought, perhaps this is not a proper topic. \\"Well, I'd better change the topic.\\" So I said to him, \\"Well, shall we talk about the Great Wall? By the way, have you ever been there?\\" \\"Certainly, everyone back home will laugh at me if I leave China without seeing it. It was wonderful.\\" He was deep in thought when I began to talk like a tourist guide. \\"The Great Wall is one of the wonders in the world. We are very proud of it\\".

Answer the following question: Information:  - The Wrays, also known as The Wray Brothers Band, were an American country music group from Oregon composed of Bubba Wray, Jim Covert, Lynn Phillips and Joe Dale Cleghorn. Following two independent singles, The Wrays released a pair of singles on Mercury Records in the 1980s. Their highest charing single, \\"You Lay a Lotta Love on Me,\\" reached the Top 50 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Singles chart in 1987. After The Wrays broke up, lead singer Bubba Wray launched a successful solo career as Collin Raye.  - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\".   - Tom Shapiro (born in Kansas City, Missouri) is an American songwriter and occasional record producer, known primarily for his work in country music. To date, he holds four Country Songwriter of the Year awards from Broadcast Music Incorporated, as well as the Songwriter of the Decade award from the Nashville Songwriters Association International. He has also written more than fifty Top Ten hits, including twenty-six Number Ones.  - Johnny Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932  September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor, and author. He was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.  - \\"Somebody Else's Moon\\" is a song written by Tom Shapiro and Paul Nelson, and recorded by American country music singer Collin Raye. It was released in March 1993 as the third single from his album, \\"In This Life.\\" The song reached the Top 5 on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart and peaked at number 11 on the Canadian \\"RPM\\" Country Tracks chart.  - The word Dobro is, in popular usage, the generic term for a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins.  - In This Life is the second studio album released by country music artist Collin Raye . Its title track was Raye 's second Number One hit ; \`\` That Was a River '' , \`\` Somebody Else 's Moon '' and \`\` I Want You Bad ( And That Ai n't Good ) '' were also released as singles . \`\` Big River '' is a cover of a Johnny Cash song , while \`\` Let It Be Me '' is a cover of a pop standard originally recorded by Betty Everett and Jerry Butler .  - Floyd Elliot Wray (born August 22, 1960) is an American country music singer, known professionally as Collin Raye, and previously as Bubba Wray. Under the latter name, he recorded as a member of the band The Wrays between 1983 and 1987. He made his solo debut in 1991 as Collin Raye with the album \\"All I Can Be\\", which produced his first Number One hit in \\"Love, Me\\". \\"All I Can Be\\" was the first of four consecutive albums released by Raye to achieve platinum certification in the United States for sales of one million copies each. Raye maintained several Top Ten hits throughout the rest of the decade and into 2000. 2001's \\"Can't Back Down\\" was his first album that did not produce a Top 40 country hit, and he was dropped by his record label soon afterward. He did not record another studio album until 2005's \\"Twenty Years and Change\\", released on an independent label.  - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music.  - Twenty Years and Change is the eighth studio album, released in 2005, by country music artist Collin Raye. His first studio album in 3 years, it produced the singles \\"I Know That's Right\\" and \\"Hurricane Jane\\", neither of which charted.  - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - All I Can Be is the debut studio album of American country music artist Collin Raye. It features the hit singles \\"All I Can Be (Is a Sweet Memory)\\" (originally recorded by Conway Twitty as \\"All I Can Be Is a Sweet Memory\\" on his 1985 album \\"Chasin' Rainbows\\"), \\"Love, Me\\" (Raye's first #1 on the \\"Billboard\\" country charts), and \\"Every Second\\". The final track, \\"If I Were You\\", is a different song than the song of the same name recorded on Raye's 1994 album \\"Extremes\\". \\"Any Ole Stretch of Blacktop\\" was later recorded by Shenandoah as a new track for their 1992  \\"Greatest Hits\\" album.  - \\"Love, Me\\" is a song written by Skip Ewing and Max T. Barnes, and recorded by American country music artist Collin Raye. It was released in October 1991 as the second single from the album \\"All I Can Be\\". In January 1992, the single became Raye's first Number One single on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts; the same year, the song received a Song of the Year nomination from the Country Music Association. The single has been cited as a popular choice for funerals.  - \\"That Was A River\\" is a song written by Susan Longacre and Rick Giles, and recorded by American country music singer Collin Raye that peaked at number 4 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. It was released in July 1993 as the fourth and final single from his CD \\"In This Life.\\"  - Rockabilly is one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music, dating back to the early 1950s in the United States, especially the South. As a genre it blends the sound of Western musical styles such as country with that of rhythm and blues, leading to what is considered \\"classic\\" rock and roll. Some have also described it as a blend of bluegrass with rock and roll. The term \\"rockabilly\\" itself is a portmanteau of \\"rock\\" (from \\"rock 'n' roll\\") and \\"hillbilly\\", the latter a reference to the country music (often called \\"hillbilly music\\" in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie woogie, jump blues, and electric blues.  - Can't Back Down is the seventh studio album released by country music artist Collin Raye. It was also his last album for Epic Records, and the first album of his career not to produce any Top 40 country hits. \\"Ain't Nobody Gonna Take That from Me\\", the first single, reached #43 on the Hot Country Songs charts. \\"What I Need\\", the second single, failed to chart.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - Betty Everett (November 23, 1939  August 19, 2001) was an American soul singer and pianist, best known for her biggest hit single, the million-selling \\"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\\".  - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication.

As the girls tour the factory, they see a number of very lifelike dolls stored in glass canisters locked in a display case on the wall. These are part of Mr. Franzâs special collection. Sally Reynolds (June Kenney) answers a newspaper advertisement for a secretary; Franz's previous one has mysteriously vanished. Although she is concerned about his obsession with his dolls, she reluctantly agrees to take the job.

The hecklers then marched out of the theater in Hamilton as the 77-year-old comedian asked his audience not to react. Cosby is facing growing sexual assault allegations from more than 15 women, with some claims dating back decades. He has denied the allegations through his lawyer, has never been charged and has never publicly spoken of them publicly. The walk-out during Friday's show came a day after a man at Cosby's performance in London, Ontario, called the comedian 'a rapist'. Scroll down for video.

Warning: A sign posted outside of the Hamilton Place Theatre ahead ofBill Cosby's show. Scores of demonstrators brave the cold to protest against a show by Bill Cosby on Friday night. It also took place just minutes after Cosby acknowledged the controversy that has followed him on the tour, with protesters camping outside the venues with sandwich boards. 'Whatever happens here tonight if there's some sort of outburst, we just have to remain calm and things will be taken care of. It oughtn't last that long,' he told the audience. 'I want to thank all of you here tonight because you stayed with what you believed in.' An announcement at the start of the show warned the audience there might be attempts to disrupt the show and urged ticket holders to remain calm until the matter 'is resolved'. Security at the venue was tight — bags were searched and police officers and private security guards were posted along the aisles of the theatre. The three shows in Canada were Cosby's first since November when he had a string of performances canceled over the accusations. Many protesters took aim at the venues that agreed to let Cosby perform in light of the scandal plaguing him. Touch down: Bill Cosby gets off his private jet and arrives in Hamilton, Canada, on Friday afternoon. Cold arrival: Cosby landed in Hamilton a few hours before the performance, which was his last of three. During a rare moment in Thursday night's show at the same venue, Cosby alluded to his sexual assault scandal. As he saw a woman getting up from the front row of the theater, Cosby asked where she was going. She said she was getting a drink and politely asked if he wanted her to bring anything back for him,  according to National Post reporter Richard Warnica who attended the event. He said no, that he had his own bottle of water and then said 'You have to be careful drinking around me.' The statement refers to a theme in several of his accusers' stories - that he drugged their drinks before raping them. Warnica says the crowd erupted in loud gasps, but that their shock soon turned to support as they laughed and gave a round of applause for the comment. Thursday night's show was the second in a three-stop comedy tour of Canada. Both nights have been the subject of protests outside the venues, as ticket-holders were heckled by demonstrators holding signs like 'rape is not joke'. Both of Cosby's show s in Canada have been the subject of protests this week. Above, some of the demonstrators outside of his show Thursday night. Before the show started, Warnica tweeted a photo of a piece of paper handed out to those walking into venue Budweiser Gardens. The slip of paper warns 'disruptive behavior will not be tolerated and will result in removal, possible legal action and banning from the venue'. One man was kicked out of Thursday night's event for yelling 'you are a rapist'. Dale Carruthers, a journalist who tried to film the man being escorted out by security, was also kicked out. Cosby's publicist later confirmed the heckler in a statement, describing the situation as 'one outburst' in a crowd of 'loyal, patient and courageous' fans. The statement ends with Cosby saying 'I'm far from finished'. Warnica says that while the venue was not full, it was far from empty and the crowd seemed to enjoy Cosby's performance. He received a standing ovation for a second night in a row. Heckled: Canadians attending both events in Kitchener and London have been heckled by the crowds demonstrating outside the event.

Keep in mind that the trial will have all of the same “parts,” regardless of whether you are in front of a judge or a jury. The “opening statement” is a type of speech given at the start of trial. It is your first opportunity to introduce yourself and your case. If you filed the lawsuit (and therefore are the plaintiff), you will give your opening statement first, followed by the defendant.   In your opening statement, you should give an overview of what your case is about and what your evidence will prove. You should begin proving your case by telling the jury what evidence is in your favor and what happened to you. Keep in mind that you cannot state your own opinions in an opening statement, and if you do so you could be reprimanded by the judge. During the presentation of the case, you will call your own witnesses, and “examine” them (this is called direct examination). You will also have the opportunity to ask questions of your opponent’s witnesses (this is called cross examination). To prepare for calling and examining your witnesses, make sure that they all agree to be present at the trial.  For direct examination, you should prepare a notebook with an outline of what you want to ask the witnesses. Ask questions that will encourage the witnesses to talk, instead of “yes” and “no” questions. To get comfortable with questioning witnesses, you can meet with them to practice beforehand. For cross examination, realize that you probably won’t get that much useful information, and limit or completely forgo examining the opposing witnesses. Only cross examine the opposing witnesses if you can get evidence from them that supports your version of events or discredits their trustworthiness as a witness. Always be kind and polite to any witnesses, even during cross examination. Arguing with or badgering a witness (even an opposing witness) looks bad to the jury, and could get you in trouble with the judge. A closing argument is delivered at the end of a trial, after all of the evidence has been presented and all witnesses have been called. A closing argument is the last chance you will have to address the judge or the jury.   Closing arguments are usually between 10 and 20 minutes, but, if the case is extremely complicated, they can be much longer, in some cases up to one hour. Unlike an opening statement, which can be written well in advance of the trial, a closing argument will be based on the events of the trial, so to prepare an effective closing argument, make sure that you take notes throughout the trial. To see in-depth information about preparing a closing argument, visit wikiHow’s guide on writing a closing argument. Even after the trial has ended, the losing party can appeal the loss to a higher court. An appeal is a request to a higher court to review and overturn the decision of a lower court. In federal court, appeals are heard by the United States Court of Appeals. In state court systems, the appeals courts go by various names. If you think you might want to appeal the decision in your case, make sure you understand the following:   How appeals are decided: generally, the courts of appeal do not want to tell the trial judge that he made the wrong decision, or “overrule” that decision. Therefore, an appeals court will usually only overturn the decision of a lower court if the lower court made a significant error of law.What a “significant error of law” is will be completely different depending on each particular case. What evidence you can present: The courts of appeals do not look at any new evidence that may have been discovered after the case was decided (either by the judge or the jury). Instead, the court will look at the documents from the case, a “brief” by both parties discussing why each one believes that they have the correct view, and in some cases, will listen to both parties argue your case in front of the court (this is referred to as “oral argument). The consequences of an unsuccessful appeal: if a party unsuccessfully appeal the court’s order, the higher court will “affirm” the lower court’s ruling (or the jury’s), and the current judgment will stand.

What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is all about trials and the different things that can happen during them. It shares that a trial can be decided by either a judge or a jury, and the people involved will usually choose which one. It's sometimes better to have a judge decide if you're representing yourself because it can be less formal, and you won't have to worry about what a jury thinks of you. But a jury might be better if your case is emotional and you think they might feel sympathy for you. The article also explains what an \\"opening statement\\" is. It's a kind of speech given at the start of the trial to explain what the case is about and what the evidence will show. After this, both sides get to ask questions to witnesses to prove their point. Preparation and respect towards witnesses is very important. A \\"closing argument\\" is another speech made once all the evidence has been shown and all the witnesses have talked. It's the last chance to convince the judge or jury. Lastly, the article talks about appeals. After a trial, the person who loses can ask a higher court to look at the case again. But the article warns that this can be hard because the higher court usually only changes the decision if a big mistake was made. And, they don't look at any new evidence but just the documents from the case. If the appeal doesn't work, then the original decision stands."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Five months after showing up in a San Diego-area emergency room without any recollection of her name, age, family, or friends, a woman who calls herself “Sam” finally has an identity. NBC 7's Steven Luke has the details. (Published Wednesday, July 1, 2015)      Five months after showing up in a San Diego-area emergency room without any recollection of her name, age, family, or friends, a woman who calls herself “Sam” has finally rediscovered who she is as she continues to battle cancer.      Ashley Manetta, 53, never married and has sisters in Colorado and Maryland. She was born in Pennsylvania, lived in Flagstaff, Arizona, and several years ago found her way to Southern California, where she lived in La Jolla, Vista, and Carlsbad.      The woman’s plight captured attention worldwide after NBC 7's post went viral with a Facebook reach of 21.2 million people as of Wednesday afternoon. Facebook users shared the post nearly 200,000 times, leading to thousands of tips and suggestions.      Manetta’s nephew watched the NBC 7 story online and immediately called his mom to tell her about the mystery woman: Aunt Ashley.      The FBI took the tip to Manetta and her friend Debbie Rough, her nurse from Tri City Medical Center in Oceanside, who championed the initial search for relatives. The phone call led to tears and details of her forgotten past.      “It was extremely emotional. We were all sobbing. They’re so sorry I had to go through what I did during this time without them,” Manetta said.      The FBI did not officially confirm Manetta's identity, but investigators felt comfortable with the information they've provided to help facilitate a reunion. Manetta's family did not provide independent verification of her identity.      Woman With Amnesia, Cancer Searches for Identity      NBC 7's Steven Luke reports on a woman found in Carlsbad with a rare form of amnesia and Stage 3 ovarian cancer. Her story has been shared all around the world. (Published Tuesday, June 30, 2015)      Carlsbad firefighters responded to an emergency call on February 1 and found her in dire shape. Her blood pressure was so low she was barely conscious. She couldn’t tell paramedics anything about herself.      Doctors at Tri City Medical Center diagnosed her with ovarian cancer, telling her the antibodies from the tumor possibly caused “retrograde amnesia.\\"      Carlsbad police and the FBI got involved in an effort to help identify her. They said more pressing responsibilities kept them from devoting the many hours needed to solve the case.      Searches of their fingerprint database turned up empty.      “He [the FBI agent] said you must be a good girl, otherwise we’d have records of you,” Manetta said.      FBI agents posted Manetta’s picture and story to the Interpol website in an effort to attract global attention.      She spoke with an English or Australian accent and had vivid dreams about time spent in Perth.      \\"Apparently I have a long time of visiting Australia for extended trips. I’ve been going there throughout my life,” Manetta said. The family lost track of her in 2013, around the same time she showed up in Southern California and attended St. Patrick Catholic Church in Carlsbad.      Mystery Woman Update: Carlsbad Woman Recalls Meeting \\"Sam\\"      NBC 7's Steven Luke has new information about a mystery woman with cancer who showed up in a Carlsbad hospital, unable to remember her name or past. (Published Wednesday, July 1, 2015)      The FBI said NBC 7’s Facebook post and subsequent stories generated numerous tips, which helped put the pieces of the puzzle together.      Manetta plans to fly back to Maryland and live with one of her older sisters.      “She was just telling me she has a four-bedroom, large house and a lovely king-size bed waiting for me.\\"      Manetta thanks the millions of people around the world who watched her story and prayed and tried to help with leads and suggestions.      The story has seemed almost too remarkable to be true.      The FBI can’t confirm or deny the circumstances, but feels comfortable with the information they’ve provided to help facilitate a reunion.      Manetta’s close friends and the nurse who championed her story call her a genuine and sweet human being.      They believe she has the genuine faith in God which was the first thing she remembers feeling in the emergency room.      “I had peace where there should be none and I believed He would bring me back together with people that that were family and I trusted Him,\\" she said.      Ashley Manetta will need to continue with chemotherapy to treat the aggressive cancer, but with family and faith she says “she knows where she is going” and now, finally, where she came from too. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Thousands of people tried to help \\"Sam\\" solve the mystery of her identity      A woman whose case sparked a social media hunt after she was found on a US street with amnesia has been identified by her family.      \\"Sam\\", as she was known by thousands following her story, has been named as Ashley Menatta, 53, of California.      About five months ago she was found in Carlsbad, Southern California, unwell and with no memory of who she was.      Her nephew identified her from a US NBC 7 television show about her, according to NBC 7 and Sam's Facebook page.      He called his mother who then alerted the authorities.      NBC 7 says Ashley Menatta was born in Pennsylvania and had lived in Flagstaff, Arizona. Several years ago, she moved to Southern California where she lived in La Jolla, Vista and Carlsbad.      She reportedly loved travelling and never married. Her sisters, in Colorado and Maryland, are said to have lost track of her in 2013.      Ms Menatta described an \\"extremely emotional\\" reunion with her family. \\"We were all sobbing,\\" she said. \\"They're so sorry I had to go through what I did during this time without them.\\"      'Great news'      Ms Menatta was found \\"barely conscious\\" by emergency services in Carlsbad in February this year.      She told reporters she had been diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer after the authorities found her, and doctors removed a tumour the size of a volleyball.      Doctors told her she was likely suffering from \\"retrograde amnesia\\" - a type of memory-loss brought on during the onset of a disease.      Her slight Australian accent led many people, including US authorities, to suspect she may originally have been from Australia.      She also had strong memories of swimming at a beach in Perth, in Western Australia, and visiting other Australian holiday spots.      Australian consular officials had offered assistance in solving her case.      Her Facebook page, set up with assistance from a former nurse who got involved in the case, said prayers had been answered.      \\"Well, we have some great news,\\" the post said.      \\"'Sam' (Ashley is her name) and I want to thank you all who have been sharing, searching, emailing, posting, private messaging, calling, texting, twittering, NBC Channel 7 in San Diego, Australian News, England News, police, Missing Australians, Australian Missing Persons Register, FBI, interpol, and everyone else!!!!      \\"We could not have done this with out all of your help!\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A woman named Ashley Manetta was found in California without any memory of who she was.

It is a religious text primarily consisting of two parts, the Old Testament and the New Testament, which are sacred scriptures in Christianity. The Bible has been translated into numerous languages and has been widely distributed around the world over centuries. The Old Testament, also known as the Hebrew Bible, contains the sacred texts of Judaism and covers the history of the Israelites and their covenant with God. It is a collection of 39 books that consists of various types of literature, including history, law, poetry, wisdom literature, and prophecy. Some of the most well-known books in the Old Testament include Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Psalms, Proverbs, and Isaiah. The New Testament, on the other hand, is a collection of 27 books that primarily focus on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and the early history of Christianity. It consists of various types of literature, such as narratives (Gospels), letters (epistles), and prophecy (Revelation). Key books in the New Testament include Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, Corinthians, and Revelation. The Bible has had a profound impact on world history, shaping culture, philosophy, politics, art, and literature. In addition, it has played a vital role in the development of Western civilization and the establishment of Christianity as one of the world's major religions. Due to its religious significance, widespread availability, and the fact that it has been translated into over 700 languages, the Bible is considered the best-selling book of all time. Conservative estimates suggest that over 5 billion copies have been sold, while some sources claim that the number may be significantly higher.

He rides into Rio Arriba, where four men, Alfonso Parral (Lee Van Cleef), Bill Zachary (Stephen Boyd), Ed Taylor (Albert Salmi) and Lujan (Henry Silva), are in jail awaiting execution. Sheriff Eloy Sanchez (Herbert Rudley) allows Douglas to see the men. In town, Douglas meets Josefa Velarde (Joan Collins) whom he met five years previously in New Orleans. She has been looking after her late father's ranch. Douglas reveals he has a daughter (Maria Garcia Fletcher). Other townspeople include Gus Steimmetz, his daughter Emma (Kathleen Gallant) and her fiance (Barry Coe). The executioner, Simms, arrives, and aside from a brief drink with Douglas, seems to show little interest in socializing or advance planning for his task. Simms holds off until the town is at church, then, while pretending to evaluate the men he is to hang, stabs the sheriff in the back. The sheriff shoots and kills Simms, but the inmates leave the sheriff unconscious, escape and take Emma as a hostage. The wounded sheriff comes into the church with the news that the prisoners have escaped. A posse rides out immediately, but Douglas waits until morning. The posse is held up at a pass when one of the four fugitives stays behind to cover the pass. Douglas catches up and corners Parral, who pleads for his life. Douglas kills him, then ropes another outlaw, Taylor, by the feet and hangs him upside-down from a tree. The two remaining fugitives reach the house of John Butler (Gene Evans), a prospector and Douglas's neighbor. Zachary kills Butler, after which Lujan steals a sack of coins Butler had. They see riders approaching and flee, leaving Emma behind. It turn out to be Josefa and Douglas, coming from different directions.

The second sentence is an action taken by the girl, as a result of meeting her favorite actor. So, in this context, the second sentence is an effect of the first one. Therefore, the answer is 'effect'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Read this: Incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared with other types of lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs.

The family of a blind stroke patient who died from pneumonia after being left outside in the pouring rain by bungling hospital nurses has received a payout from the NHS. Frank Kelly, 79, was wearing just his pyjamas when nurses 'lost him' and he was left in a car park outside Worcestershire Royal Hospital in December 2010. The retired farmer developed pneumonia and died three months later. His family have now received an undisclosed payout from the NHS after reaching an out-of-court settlement . Poor treatment: Frank Kelly, 79, died of pneumonia three months after nurses left him outside Worcester Royal Hospital wearing just pyjamas in the rain. Apology: Worcestershire Royal Hospital has apologised for Mr Kelly's poor treatment during his five-month stay at the hospital and his family has received an undisclosed payout from the NHS. They also received an apology after it emerged the incident was just one in a catalogue of errors during Mr Kelly's five-month stay at the hospital. The retired farmer was admitted to Worcestershire Royal Hospital in November 2010 after suffering a second stroke which left him blind. But the family soon took up a 24-hour rota at his bedside after being shocked by the 'appalling' care he received from doctors and nurses. On one visit to the hospital, Frank's son Martin, 51, found his father stood in the middle of the car park wearing nothing but his sodden pyjamas on a rainy day in December 2010. It later emerged he had wandered into the car park after the nurses who were moving him to a new ward lost him. Care: The family of Mr Kelly,. pictured being shaved by his son Matthew while in hospital, say staff were too busy to acre for their father and frequently failed to feed him. Dinner time: Mr Kelly's family visited him every day to feed him after being shocked at the 'appalling' care at Worcestershire Royal Hospital. Martin said: 'When I turned up to see my dad in the car park, I was stunned, I couldn't believe it. 'I stopped the car, raced over and told him I was there. 'It's so sad to think that he worked his whole life and when it came to it, he couldn't even get decent hospital care. 'We all believe that with better care we could have had dad home again.' In February 2011, just a few months after being left in the car park in the middle of winter, Frank died. Frank Kelly was admitted to the hospital in November 2010 after suffering a second stroke. Martin, from St John's in Worcester,. yesterday said the incident was part of a long-running series of. mistreatment that bordered on 'cruelty' and a breach of his human. rights. Martin and the rest of his family received a financial settlement from the hospital after one of Frank's own medical team advised them to take action. Martin added: 'He was not fed properly, they didn't seem to realise that he was blind. We had to take in food every day. 'He was dehydrated all the time and the communication on the wards was just appalling. We were begging for help but he was never given a chance. 'The hospital has admitted a total failure of care and that dad had an awful slice of the cake. 'We didn't do this for any financial reasons, we did it to try and highlight the failings and ensure this sort of thing does not happen to anyone else. 'We have been told it is improving but we are not convinced and we do fear what sort of care we would get if we were ever unfortunate enough to need them again.' He added that the health system had 'too many managers in suits' at the expense of nurses devoted to care. In a letter to Frank's widow Anne, 78, Chief executive Penny Venables said: 'I am acutely conscious that these improvements came too late to positively influence your father's experience and that is a matter of deep regret. 'I can fully understand how angry and frustrated you must have felt about the care he received at the time and how painful it must have been for you to witness his suffering. 'I have taken their concerns extremely seriously and am determined that standards across the trust will continue to be raised. Let down: Members of the Kelly family, from left are brothers Martin, Brian, Matthew and Frank's widow Anne, with their letter of apology from the health authority. 'Everyone is committed to providing the highest quality care for all patients and striving to continuously improve the care we offer.' Ms Venables added: 'I have met with Mr Kelly’s family to discuss with them the concerns that they have raised.  I have also written to them to apologise for the care he was given. 'I have taken their concerns extremely seriously and am determined that standards across the Trust will continue to be raised. 'Everyone at Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust is committed to providing the highest quality care for all patients and striving to continuously improve the care we offer.

She had been ill for almost two years, and I didn't cry when she died, or at her funeral, but on that first Mother's Day without her. On that day, I realized that this person I loved and depended on was gone forever. She still lives in family memories, in the thoughts of her friends and co-workers, in the values she had instilled  in her children, and in the lovely flower gardens that she had so carefully tended. She loved her gladioli and irises. Each fall she would dig the bulbs out of the soil and carefully wrap them in paper. The bulbs would be stored until the following spring when they would be replanted. It seemed like a lot of effort to me, but each year her flower garden was more glorious than the year before. She put the same hard work into caring for her family, instilling in her children a sense of justice and fair play, compassion, and strong moral values so that we blossomed. Share anecdotes about your mother's life at your Mother's Day party. Too often, we avoid speaking of those loved ones who have passed away, fearful that we will unearth sad feelings.

Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.  Story: Albert is a scientist who travels the planet looking for new species to discover and analyze. While on a safari in Australia, Albert discovered two new species of live-bearing tetrapods.

You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.

A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC.

Here are possible answers to this question: - practice - skill - thief - dexterity - knowledge of music  I believe the correct choice is \\"dexterity\\", here's why:","output":"Dexterity is the most suitable answer among the given options in the context of someone fiddling with something, and there are several reasons that support this choice. Dexterity refers to the ability to skillfully and gracefully use one's hands to perform intricate tasks requiring fine motor skills. Such tasks may include playing a musical instrument, lock-picking, engaging in art or craftsmanship, or even manipulating small objects for various purposes. To elaborate further, let's analyze the other possible choices individually: 1. Practice: While practice is essential for improving and mastering specific skills, it is not an inherent attribute that individuals possess. In this context, practice refers to the act of repeatedly performing a task rather than a skill that someone might have. Therefore, it does not adequately describe the ability of someone who is fiddling with something. 2. Skill: While skill could be an appropriate term in some situations, it is a broad and general term. In the context of someone fiddling with something, the term \\"skill\\" lacks specificity and does not convey the level of detail needed to explain the ability at hand. Dexterity, on the other hand, precisely pinpoints the use of fine motor skills and adroitness in the scenario given. 3. Thief: Although thieves are commonly depicted as skilled and dexterous individuals in pop culture, the act of fiddling with something does not necessarily indicate criminal intent. Therefore, \\"thief\\" would be an inaccurate assumption to make in this case. Dexterity is the more fitting option as it is an inherent skill and does not assume the individual's motive. 4. Knowledge of music: Fiddling with something might not always relate to music, and it is essential not to limit the context only to musical scenarios. While skilled musicians often exhibit great dexterity, particularly when playing stringed instruments like violins and fiddles, the term \\"knowledge of music\\" does not encompass the broader range of possibilities involving dexterity and fine motor skills. It would be an unfair assumption to label someone who is fiddling with something as a musician solely based on their actions. In conclusion, the term \\"dexterity\\" is the most accurate answer among the given choices, as it captures the essence of an individual's abilities to perform intricate tasks with their hands. This term does not limit the context to musicians or thieves and applies to a wide range of situations where skilled manipulation of small objects or intricate tasks is involved. Hence, choosing \\"dexterity\\" is the most logical and encompassing option in this case."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Musa Kayairanga says he exchanges information with doctors as far away as Canada. He also says the computer has improved his knowledge of using plants to treat diseases. Many people in rural areas are now able to communicate with the rest of the world. This is one example of how technology is changing life in developing countries.  Andrew Burns is an economist at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. He led a recent study of technology in developing countries. The study found that technology has spread faster in such countries than in rich nations. It also found that technological progress has helped raise wages in developing countries. And it reduced the percentage of people living in extreme poverty from twenty-nine percent in 1990 to eighteen percent in 2004.  Progress in communications technology has aided the growth of call centers in developing countries. Call centers are offices where most telephone calls for a business can be answered. For example, a woman in the United States who calls her computer company about a problem might speak with someone in India or Pakistan.  Call centers serve businesses in local and international markets. And they have added to economic growth by providing well-paid jobs and new skills for workers who might not have had such employment.

Article: Animals are a favorite subject of many photographers. Cats, dogs, and other pets top the list, followed by zoo animals. However, because it's hard to get them to sit still and \\"perform on command,\\" some professional photographers refuse to photograph pets.               One way to get an appealing portrait of a cat or dog is to hold a biscuit or treat above the camera. The animal's longing look toward the food will be captured by the camera, but the treat won't appear in the picture because it's out of the camera's range. When you show the picture to your friends afterwards, they'll be impressed by your pet's loving expression. If you are using fast film, you can take some good, quick shots of a pet by simply snapping a picture right after calling its name. You'll get a different expression from your pet using this technique. Depending on your pet's mood, the picture will capture an interested, curious expression or possibly a look of annoyance, especially if you've awakened it from a nap. Taking pictures of zoo animals requires a little more patience. After all, you can't wake up a lion! You may have to wait for a while until the animal does something interesting or moves into a position for you to get a good shot. When photographing zoo animals, don't get too close to the cages, and never tap on the glass or throw things between the bars of a cage.

Background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  Paragraph: Two plants of the same type are growing near the outskirts of the Jorah forest. The first plant, colored red, is healthy and has no fungus on it.

(CNN) -- The former head of an Air Force sexual assault prevention program was acquitted Wednesday of an assault charge stemming from an incident in Arlington, Virginia, last spring, his lawyer confirmed to CNN. Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, 42, was arrested in May and accused of grabbing a woman's buttocks and breasts in a parking lot in Arlington County, not far from the Pentagon. A police report said the unidentified woman fought off her assailant, who appeared intoxicated. Krusinski was initially charged with sexual battery, but prosecutors later changed that charge to assault and battery, according to CNN affiliate WJLA. He was removed from that post after his arrest, which came two days before the","output":"Pentagon released a report stating that there has been an increase in sexual assault cases in the military. The trial of Krusinski quickly gained national attention, becoming emblematic of the bigger, systemic issue of handling sexual assault cases within the United States military. During the trial, Krusinski maintained his innocence, with his defense team arguing that it was a case of mistaken identity, that the woman had misjudged the situation, and that the defendant was not even at the scene of the crime. The prosecutors, on the other hand, brought forward a number of witnesses who testified against Krusinski, including the victim, several bystanders, and those who had been at the bar with him that night. They also presented surveillance footage that placed Krusinski near the scene. Despite the evidences presented by the prosecution, the twelve-member jury found Lt. Col. Krusinski not guilty of the assault charge. The verdict sparked controversy and outrage among the public, particularly with advocates for the rights of sexual assault victims. Many expressed frustration that Krusinski's acquittal only seemed to further emphasize the pervasive issues relating to sexual assault within the military and the presumed culture of impunity. In response to Krusinski's arrest and the widespread public outcry, the Department of Defense amped up its efforts to address the issue of sexual assault in the military. The Secretary of Defense at that time announced new measures, including requiring a higher level of review and oversight for all sexual assault and harassment cases, as well as increasing resources for victims. Furthermore, the Krusinski case led to several bills being introduced in Congress aiming to modify how sexual assault cases in the military are handled. One such bill proposed to remove these cases from the military chain of command and instead have them handled by independent military prosecutors. Although this specific bill failed to pass, it sparked much-needed dialogue, and other legislative measures were eventually put into place to help reshape the military's approach to sexual assault cases. In the years following Krusinski's acquittal, the Department of Defense continued to implement changes designed to prevent sexual assault and provide better support for victims within the military. This included increasing the number of sexual assault prevention and response personnel and improving education and training programs within the military. While many argue that significant work still must be done to address the issue of sexual assault in the military, Krusinski's case played a pivotal role in highlighting the severity of the problem and stimulating crucial changes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He found that all body cells are not equal in size - some are large and some are small. He labeled the large cells as class A cells. Then he labeled the small cells as class B cells. He is now prepared to find the differences between them.  But I can use this background: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli .  What is an answer for this question: Which cell might not have microvilli as a feature, class A or class B? A:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided step by step: 1. Mike is studying biology and has classified cells into two categories: class A (large cells) and class B (small cells). 2. As a cell grows, its volume increases faster than its surface area, which can limit the nutrient intake. 3. Large cells (class A) have ways to deal with size challenges, such as growing more nuclei and having cell protrusions. 4. Cell protrusions, like microvilli, increase the surface area for transport of materials into or out of the cell. 5. Microvilli are found in cells lining the small intestine for nutrient absorption. Given these points, we can conclude that class A cells (large cells) might have microvilli as a feature to help deal with their size-related challenges, such as an increased need for nutrient intake through an expanded surface area. On the other hand, class B cells (small cells) might not have microvilli since they are not as large and, consequently, may not face the same size-related challenges.

Wilson was born on November 26, 1895, in East Dorset, Vermont, the son of Emily (nee Griffith) and Gilman Barrows Wilson. He was born at his parents' home and business, the Mount Aeolus Inn and Tavern. His paternal grandfather, William C. Wilson, was also an alcoholic. William C. Wilson decided to stop drinking alcohol immediately after having a \\"religious experience\\" when he was under the influence of psilocybin  ( sy-l@-SY-bin) during a \\"soul searching\\" hike on Mount Aeolus. Wilson met his wife Lois Burnham during the summer of 1913, while sailing on Vermont's Emerald Lake; two years later the couple became engaged. He entered Norwich University, but depression and panic attacks forced him to leave during his second semester. The next year he returned, but was soon suspended with a group of students involved in a hazing incident. Because no one would take responsibility, and no one would identify the perpetrators, the entire class was punished.  The June 1916 incursion into the U.S. by Pancho Villa resulted in Wilson's class being mobilized as part of the Vermont National Guard and he was reinstated to serve. The following year he was commissioned as an artillery officer. During military training in Massachusetts, the young officers were often invited to dinner by the locals, and Wilson had his first drink, a glass of beer, to little effect. A few weeks later at another dinner party, Wilson drank some Bronx cocktails, and felt at ease with the guests and liberated from his awkward shyness; \\"I had found the elixir of life,\\" he wrote. \\"Even that first evening I got thoroughly drunk, and within the next time or two I passed out completely. But as everyone drank hard, not too much was made of that.\\"  Wilson married Lois on January 24, 1918, just before he left to serve in World War I as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Coast Artillery. After his military service, Wilson returned to live with his wife in New York. He failed to graduate from law school because he was too drunk to pick up his diploma. Wilson became a stock speculator and had success traveling the country with his wife, evaluating companies for potential investors. (During these trips Lois had a hidden agenda: she hoped the travel would keep Wilson from drinking.) However, Wilson's constant drinking made business impossible and ruined his reputation.  In 1933 Wilson was committed to the Charles B. Towns Hospital for Drug and Alcohol Addictions in New York City four times under the care of Dr. William D. Silkworth. Silkworth's theory was that alcoholism was a matter of both physical and mental control: a craving, the manifestation of a physical allergy (the physical inability to stop drinking once started) and an obsession of the mind (to take the first drink). Wilson gained hope from Silkworth's assertion that alcoholism was a medical condition rather than a moral failing, but even that knowledge could not help him. He was eventually told that he would either die from his alcoholism or have to be locked up permanently due to Wernicke encephalopathy (commonly referred to as \\"wet brain\\").

She sweetens the deal with a 25,000 bonus for solving the case. Of course this comes contingent that The Globe gets the exclusive story. Gentry takes the case and begins the investigation of the murder with Weston in tow. When at the club, Gentry encounters a waitress, Marlene (Hedda Lubin), whose obnoxiousness rivals his. He gets through her to speak to another stripper and gets his first suspect, Joseph Carter. Soon, another stripper, Candy Cane, gets murdered and Gentry expands his suspect list to Grout (Ray Sager), an unstable veteran who takes pride in crushing the heads of corpses he found when on the battlefields of Vietnam. He relieves tension by drawing faces on squashes and tomatoes and then crushing them with his bare hands. Gentry also suspects the leader of a radical feminist group that riots in the strip club, carrying banners with catchy phrases like \\"Lewd is Crude\\", \\"Quit with Tit\\" and \\"Women Right On!\\". Pickles, another stripper, is murdered and has her buttocks mutilated with a meat tenderizer hammer before having it salt and peppered. A badge with \\"Women Right On!\\" is found at the scene. Meanwhile, Gentry buys Weston many drinks to keep her drunk and out of his way. During one of Weston's drunken episodes she admits she's attracted to Gentry. Gentry ignores this and concentrates on the case. His investigation takes him to the owner of the strip clubs in town, Mr. Marzdone Mobilie (Henny Youngman). Gentry then coerces Mobilie into holding an amateur stripper contest with a 1,000 prize, which also works as the beginning of a plan for Gentry's trap.

The follow-up to Supernatural came three years later and was highly anticipated by international media and fans alike. On October 22, 2002, Shaman was released worldwide. Although it initially sold briskly (298,973 copies in the US in its first week) and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, the album's appeal quickly wore off and it soon slid down the charts. Despite this, it went on to sell 2x platinum in the US, and achieved platinum status in several other countries including Australia. The first single released from the album, \\"The Game of Love\\", which featured vocals from Michelle Branch, debuted at number 5 on the Hot 100. The album's next four singles failed to chart in most countries, but the final single, \\"Why Don't You & I\\", featuring the vocals of Alex Band, reached number 8 on the Hot 100. Musically, the album was a return to a more conventional sound for the group, with a mainly Latin rock-based sound.  With their renewed appeal worn off, another three-year wait saw the release of 2005's All That I Am. The album debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 but fared worse internationally, and quickly lost appeal. The album, a continuation of the Latin-rock influenced sound of Shaman, achieved gold certification in the US. A five-year break from recording saw the release of another studio album, 2010's Guitar Heaven. Musically it was a drastic change for the band, with a far heavier sound at its core and strong heavy metal influences. It debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200 but marked another decline for the band, failing to achieve gold status.  In 2012 the group released Shape Shifter, which returned to the conventional Latin rock sound and was completely album-oriented, as no singles were released from it. It debuted at number 16 on the Billboard 200. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did their music change in any other ways","output":"Yes, their music changed in several ways over the years. As mentioned in the text, \\"Musically, the album (Shaman) was a return to a more conventional sound for the group, with a mainly Latin rock-based sound.\\" Additionally, in 2010's Guitar Heaven, the band had \\"a drastic change, with a far heavier sound at its core and strong heavy metal influences.\\" Thus, their music did change in various ways throughout their career."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Researchers found that over an average of 12 weeks, people having a highprotein diet lost about 1.8 extra pounds, and more body fat, than those having a standard-protein diet. Wycherley from the University of South\\" Australia in Adelaide, the lead author on the study says it's possible that the body may spend more energy and bum more calories while dealing with protein, compared to carbohydrates. Another explanation for the link his team observed is that eating protein helps preserve muscle mass and muscle mass bums more calories, even when the body is resting, than other types of mass. He says people in the studies tend to get protein from a variety of animal and vegetable sources. Vegetable sources of protein include beans. It is not obvious why a higher protein-to-carbohydrate ratio might help people lose more pounds----and one obesity researcher not involved in the new analysis questioned whether the trials were strong enough to make that conclusion. \\"The studies are generally far too short to tell effect,\\" Dr. James Levine from the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, told Reuters Health in an e-mail.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care.

I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’.

Article: There are a number of situations in which you should file an auto insurance claim.  The most common type of situation in which you’d need to file an insurance claim is when your car is involved in an auto accident.  However, you should also file a claim if your car is vandalized or stolen. The explanation and fine print of car insurance policies appear to be long-winded and often seem extremely complicated.  The best thing to do before proceeding too deeply into the insurance claims process is to read and re-read your policy.  You’ll then understand the intricacies of what your own personal responsibility is in the event of an accident or other automotive mishap, and what your insurance company's responsibility is in such an incident. You might need to pay a deductible -- a fee to help cover the costs of the accident -- if you’re found to be at fault.  If you’re not at fault, your insurance company might be able to help you recover the deductible from the driver who is at fault. Your insurance company’s number should be on the front of your insurance card.  You might also be able to find it among your insurance policy documents or on the insurance company’s website.  Contact the insurance company as soon as possible so you can find out what their specific claims process entails. Many insurance companies have online portals where you can file a claim, upload relevant documents, and check the status of your claim.  Ask your insurance company about such an option.

History of India Kadamba (345 – 525 CE) was an ancient royal dynasty of Karnataka, India that ruled northern Karnataka and the Konkan from Banavasi in present-day Uttara Kannada district. At the peak of their power under King Kakushtavarma, the Kadambas of Banavasi ruled large parts of modern Karnataka state. The dynasty was founded by Mayurasharma in 345 CE which at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions, an indication to which is provided by the titles and epithets assumed by its rulers. King Mayurasharma defeated the armies of Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with help of some native tribes. The Kadamba fame reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma, a notable ruler with whom even the kings of Gupta Dynasty of northern India cultivated marital alliances. The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy. The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires, for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties known as the Kadambas of Goa, Kadambas of Halasi and Kadambas of Hangal.

Brett was surprised by the existence of bonsai trees.; (b). Benjamin was surprised by the existence of bonsai trees.;","output":"Brett traveled to few countries while Benjamin was cosmopolitan, so it is more likely that (a) Brett was surprised by the existence of bonsai trees. The contrast between Brett and Benjamin indicates that Benjamin has been exposed to a wider range of cultures and experiences than Brett, due to his cosmopolitan nature. This distinction creates a probability that Benjamin has already encountered the concept of bonsai trees and is therefore not as likely to be surprised by their existence. Bonsai is an ancient Japanese art form that focuses on cultivating and nurturing small trees in containers, allowing the aesthetic beauty and essence of a natural landscape to be captured within a small space. Bonsai is an integral part of Japanese culture and has been practiced for over a thousand years. Due to its age and popularity within the country, it is logical to assume that someone with a cosmopolitan background like Benjamin would have come across this art form during his travels or studies. On the other hand, Brett, who has only traveled to a few countries and has seemingly been subject to a less diverse range of cultural experiences, would be more likely to encounter new concepts and ideas that would surprise him. In this particular case, Brett's limited exposure might not have prepared him for the intricacies and beauty of bonsai trees, leading him to be amazed by their existence. Furthermore, Benjamin's cosmopolitan background would imply a sophisticated and discerning taste, making it more probable that he would be aware of and appreciate the subtle nuances of bonsai cultivation. As a cosmopolitan individual, Benjamin would have interacted with various people from different countries and absorbed a wealth of knowledge about world cultures. It is less likely that traditional cultural practices like bonsai would be unfamiliar to him. In conclusion, considering Brett's limited travels and Benjamin's cosmopolitan background, it can reasonably be assumed that Brett would be more likely to be surprised by the existence of bonsai trees. This highlights the importance of exposure to different cultures and traditions, as it broadens an individual's understanding of the world and contributes to greater personal growth and development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What band is Black Francis the frontman for?  Following their 2004 reunion, the Pixies felt that recording a new song would \\"break the ice\\" between band members after their acrimonious split in 1993. As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour, DreamWorks contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of Shrek 2. The band agreed, and frontman Black Francis and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children. Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while, and since her band The Breeders were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies. The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a \\"poppier, more kid-friendly thing,\\" and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two—in the previous two Pixies studio albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991), Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split. However, the two appeared at the time to have resolved their differences: Francis praised \\"Bam Thwok,\\" as \\"a really good song.\\" despite joking in interviews about how he planned to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a hypothetical new album. However, Deal eventually left the band in June 2013, before the release of the band's next album, Indie Cindy.

In both instances, it represents the act of utilizing or employing something, specifically an object or an action, for a particular purpose or in a particular context. In the first sentence, \\"The use of torture has been condemned by the United Nations,\\" the word \\"use\\" refers to the act of employing torture as a method or practice. The context reveals that the United Nations has condemned this specific use, meaning that they disapprove of employing torture for any reason. In the second sentence, \\"He warned against the use of narcotic drugs,\\" the word \\"use\\" once again refers to the act of utilizing or employing something, in this case, narcotic drugs. The person is warning against engaging in the consumption or application of narcotic drugs, which may have potential negative consequences or be a risky behavior. In both sentences, the word \\"use\\" plays a crucial role in illustrating the idea that utilizing or employing the mentioned actions (torture and narcotic drugs) is not advocated by the respective parties (the United Nations and the individual who provides a warning). By employing the word \\"use\\" in these contexts, the sentences showcase that the main focus is not necessarily on the objects themselves (torture or narcotic drugs), but rather the manner in which they are being employed and their potential consequences. Additionally, both sentences implicitly advocate for alternatives to the harmful acts mentioned, further highlighting the shared implication of the word \\"use\\" in these two instances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a novel that is probably more talked about than read. People think: \\"It's such a big book! It has such a serious theme!\\" The feeling that they are going to be taught a long, hard lesson often puts readers off. But really, War and Peace (1869), which tells the stories of five upper-class families in Russia at the time of the 1812 French invasion, is not to be missed. Reading this novel is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences, like climbing the Great Wall: You will regret it if you do not try. Earlier this month, USA Today reported that a six-episode   War and Peace miniseries   produced by the BBC would air next year. With a complex plot and so many characters, readers unfamiliar with the work might be most interested in the characters from the financially-troubled Rostov family of Moscow. Count Rostov has four teenage children. Natasha is in love with Boris Drubetskoy, who is about to become an army officer. Nikolai Ilyich loves the poor Sonya, a ward   of the family, but his family is not happy with their relationship. The proud Vera is about to start a happy marriage with a German-Russian officer. The youngest Rostov is the 9-year-old Petya, who, like his brother Nikolai, has his heart set on fighting for his country. The lives of all are about to be changed by the upcoming great war that involves many other major characters of War and Peace, such as Prince Andrei, who goes into a military career partly in order to get away from his unhappy marriage to the socialite   Lise. The novel has a great reputation among many kinds of writers and millions of readers. US writer Ernest Hemingway wrote: \\"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did.\\" A comment by the great 20th-century Russian short-story writer Isaak Babel shows the rich sense of history that Tolstoy's work conveys. \\"If the world itself could write, it would write like Tolstoy,\\" Babel commented. Why do people prefer to talk about the novel rather than read it? A) The story is directly related to their daily life. B) The story is too long and has too serious a theme. C) They often get confused with the complex relationship. D) They can understand the story through shared ideas.

Do these mean the same? She was selected in the 20th round of the 2012 WNBA Draft ( second total ) by Minnesota Lynx . It was selected in the second round of the WNBA draft 2012 ( 20th overall ) by Minnesota Lynx .","output":"Although both sentences revolve around the selection process that took place in the 2012 WNBA Draft and the Minnesota Lynx making the selection, the two sentences have minor differences in their structure and meaning. Let's analyze each of them. 1. She was selected in the 20th round of the 2012 WNBA Draft (second total) by Minnesota Lynx. In this sentence, the main focus is on the 20th round of the draft. It is clear that the person being referred to (presumably a female player) was selected during the 20th round. However, there is a bit of confusion with the inclusion of \\"second total\\" in parentheses. This part seems to suggest that she was the second overall pick in the entire draft, but that does not seem to fit coherently with the \\"20th round of the 2012 WNBA Draft\\" premise. The possible meanings could be: - She was the second overall pick made by Minnesota Lynx. - There is an error in the sentence, and it should actually refer to the second round and not the 20th round. 2. It was selected in the second round of the WNBA draft 2012 (20th overall) by Minnesota Lynx. In this sentence, the focus is on the second round of the 2012 WNBA draft. The person being referred to is selected in the second round, and it is clear that they were the 20th overall pick in the draft. However, the sentence uses the pronoun \\"it\\" instead of \\"she,\\" which is ambiguous and somewhat dehumanizing when referring to a person (assuming it is a player in this case). This might be a typing error or simply an oversight on the part of the author. In conclusion, the sentences do not mean precisely the same thing. The first sentence seems to have some inconsistencies with the round and overall pick information, and the second sentence contains an inappropriate pronoun. If we were to rewrite both sentences to make them more accurate, they might look like this: 1. She was selected in the second round of the 2012 WNBA Draft (20th overall) by Minnesota Lynx. 2. She was selected in the second round of the WNBA draft 2012 (20th overall) by Minnesota Lynx. The corrected sentences now express the same meaning: a female player was selected during the second round of the 2012 WNBA Draft as the 20th overall pick by the Minnesota Lynx."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Milan also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century. In the St Aquilinus Chapel of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of Elijah; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors, naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion. The surviving apse mosaic of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century, although it was restored many times later.

South Asia is bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean and on land (clockwise, from west) by West Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia.  - Shia (\\"Shah\\", from \\"Shatu Al\\", followers of Ali) is a branch of Islam which holds that the Islamic prophet Muhammad designated Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor (Imam). Shia Islam primarily contrasts with Sunni Islam, whose adherents believe that Muhammad did not appoint a successor. Instead they consider Abu Bakr (who was appointed Caliph through a Shura, i.e. consensus) to be the correct Caliph.  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west.

Their religion, \\"Yazidism\\" is linked to ancient Mesopotamian religions and combines aspects of Zoroastrianism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Yazidis who marry non-Yazidis are automatically considered to be converted to the religion of their spouse and therefore are not permitted to call themselves Yazidis. They live primarily in the Nineveh Province of Iraq. Additional communities in Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have been in decline since the 1990s as a result of significant migration to Europe, especially to Germany. The Yazidis' cultural practices are observably Kurdish, and almost all speak Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish).

It is contrasted with \\"taqlid\\" (imitation, conformity to legal precedent). According to classical Sunni theory, \\"ijtihad\\" requires expertise in the Arabic language, theology, revealed texts, and principles of jurisprudence (\\"usul al-fiqh\\"),  and is not employed where authentic and authoritative texts (Qur'an and ahadith) are considered unambiguous with regard to the question, or where there is an existing scholarly consensus (\\"ijma\\"). Ijtihad is considered to be a religious duty for those qualified to perform it. An Islamic scholar who is qualified to perform \\"ijtihad\\" is called a \\"mujtahid\\".  - Ayatollah Allama Hussain Bakhsh Jarra was a prominent Shia scholar from Punjab , Pakistan .

Summarize this article: Traditionally, biryani is cooked in an Indian cooking pot called a biryani handi, but any thick bottom pot will work just fine. A non-stick pot/handi works best. Spread the chicken so each piece of chicken is touching the bottom and/or sides of the pot. This will help ensure that each piece of chicken gets cooked thoroughly. The rice that you cooked earlier is now ready to be added to the chicken. Create a layer of rice, adding about half of the rice on top of the chicken.  With your perforated spoon, pack the rice firmly into the pot. It is okay if some water comes along with the rice, it will help things cook with the steam. On top of the rice, sprinkle on fried onions(approximately 2 tbsp), chopped coriander leaves(approximately 1tbsp), and mint leaves (approximately 8-10). You can also sprinkle on cashew or golden raisins, but these are optional. This is the second, and final layer of rice you will be adding to the biryani. Once the rest of the rest is spread evenly, add on the rest of the brown onions (approximately 1 tbsp), a little bit more coriander leaves (approximately 1/2 tbsp), mint leaves (3-5), the saffron milk mixture, and approximately 6 tbsp of ghee. An alternative and optional topping is adding some rose water. Just add about 1/2 a capful, and sprinkle it over the top of the biryani. Roll the chapati dough into long pieces and put the dough on the edges of the pot's upside down lid. You add the chapati dough to the edges of the lid, so when you turn the lid right side up, the dough seals the pot so the chicken and rice can steam cook together.  Press lightly but firmly to make sure the lid is secure and tight. You can add a weight to the lid to ensure that it stays sealed, but usually if you use the dough, it is sealed good enough. Keep the biryani cooking for about 5-10 on high flame. Then, take the pot off the flame, put a cooking plate on the flame, and place the pot back on the flame with the cooking plate.  This is the safest method to cook the biryani and make sure the biryani doesn't burn because of the direct contact with the heat.  After about 35 switch off the flame, but don't open the biryani yet. Let the biryani sit for another 10 minutes. The dough will be a little cooked and hardened, but crack through it, and take of the top to check the biryani.  A lot of steam will come out so be careful not to burn yourself. Slowly stick a large spoon on the inside side of the hand and lift to get the bottom layers of the rice out. Then, as you work your way down, bring up a piece of chicken. The pieces of chicken should have a brown coloring. Usually, biryani is eaten with your hands, and is served with raita, a cold, refreshing, yogurt condiment.","output":"This article tells about how to cook a yummy dish called biryani. First, you need a special pot and spread chicken at the bottom. Then, you add cooked rice on top of the chicken. You also add special ingredients like fried onions, coriander leaves, and mint leaves.

Does it follow that \\"The caves are beautiful, especially at night.\\"?","output":"To determine if the statement \\"The caves are beautiful, especially at night.\\" follows from the provided description, let's evaluate each part of the statement step-by-step. Step 1: Assess the statement's relevance to the description The statement is related to the caves mentioned in the description, so it is relevant in that context. Step 2: Analyze the claim that the caves are beautiful The description does not explicitly mention the beauty of the caves but emphasizes the enjoyment children will get from visiting them, especially after being exposed to a lot of art and architecture. One could infer that the caves are beautiful from the presence of stalactites and stalagmites, which are often considered to be visually appealing. However, this assumption is not explicitly stated in the description.  Step 3: Examine the assertion that the caves are especially beautiful at night The description does not mention anything about the visual appeal of the caves at night. Therefore, this part of the statement doesn't follow from the provided description. Conclusion: While it is possible to infer that the caves are beautiful due to the presence of stalactites and stalagmites, there is no evidence to support the statement that they are especially beautiful at night.

For some people waking up in the middle of the night is a terrible thing. But for my mother-in-law, that time is a gift. At 87, she is getting the education she never had by working her way through great literature. She has now read close to 100 books, including every single novel by Anthony Trollope, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, Edith Wharton, Henry James and Thomas Mann. My mother-in-law discusses her passion with the enthusiasm of a young girl, although she can also be a very tough critic, writing \\"VG' for \\" very good\\" in the margins next to her favorites. So far, only a handful of books have received the top prize. Born in Ridgefield, Conn, Dorothy was the youngest daughter of an Italian gardener. She taught herself English by reading The New York Times. Eager to come to Manhattan, she became a nurse, married a dentist and spent the next several decades keeping the house and raising a family. In her later years, she put her nursing skills to good use by taking care of my father-in-law, who had lung cancer. There were many trips to the emergency room in the middle of the night and then a long hospital stay. She stayed awake to watch over him for 15 hours a day. Always a light sleeper, she developed sleeplessness as a result of the stress. It worsened after he died. Deeply sad and lonely for the first time in her life, she began waking up around 2am. Julian and Sylvia, the elderly couple next door suggest she read literature. And so Julian, a great lover of literature, became her \\"professor\\", providing books from his large library. Suddenly turned onto a world of amazing characters. Question: Why is Dorothy considered a tough critic? Options: A: Because no books are inspiring enough in her eyes.

Given the question: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:  Gary and Joe are two farmers. Joe's  farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops.  Which farmer didn't reduce nutrient runoff from his farm? The answer is:","output":"Joe is the farmer who didn't reduce nutrient runoff from his farm. Joe's farm has depleted soil, and he has not implemented agroforestry practices or grown cover crops. In contrast, Gary started agroforestry a few years back and grows cover crops, helping to stabilize the soil, prevent erosion, and reduce nutrient runoff."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Colors are typically broadcast using a (10-bits per channel) YUV color space but, depending on the underlying image generating technologies of the receiver, are then subsequently converted to a RGB color space using standardized algorithms. When transmitted directly through the Internet, the colors are typically pre-converted to 8-bit RGB channels for additional storage savings with the assumption that it will only be viewed only on a (sRGB) computer screen. As an added benefit to the original broadcasters, the losses of the pre-conversion essentially make these files unsuitable for professional TV re-broadcasting. What assumption is made with colors being transmitted over the internet?","output":"The assumption made with colors being transmitted over the internet is that the content will primarily be viewed on a standard RGB (sRGB) computer screen. This assumption leads to a pre-conversion of colors from the original 10-bit YUV color space used in HDTV broadcasting to a reduced 8-bit RGB color space. The pre-conversion process results in additional storage savings, allowing for easier transmission and streaming over the internet. However, it should be noted that this pre-conversion could lead to some loss of color information, which may potentially reduce the overall color quality when compared to the original broadcast signal. As a consequence, these pre-converted files might be considered unsuitable for professional TV re-broadcasting because of their reduced color quality and depth. Nevertheless, this color pre-conversion is generally accepted for internet-based transmissions, given that most users view content on sRGB computer screens which have lower display capabilities compared to professional HDTV equipment."},{"instruction":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Given the question: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.

They were the supposed sons of Rhea Silvia, who was a Vestal Virgin, and the god Mars. According to the story, after being abandoned by their parents, they were rescued by a she-wolf, who nursed and cared for them until they were found by a shepherd named Faustulus. The she-wolf, known as Lupa, had saved the infants by providing them with nourishment, which was her own milk. Legend has it that when the twins were left to die in a basket along the Tiber River, it was Lupa who found them and began to nurse them, allowing the infants to grow strong and eventually fulfill their destinies.

Everything is banned by the Great Firewall,\\" says Sherman So, co-author of \\"Red Wired: China's Internet Revolution.\\" Sherman So, author of \\"Red Wired,\\" talks about China's online habits and Internet culture. With 338 million Internet users in June 2009, according to the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), China is no longer a niche market of the online industry. Chinese is the second most common language on the Internet, according to The Economist, and quickly gaining ground on English. As the former technology writer for Hong Kong's daily English-language newspaper, South China Morning Post, So has been following closely China's exponential Internet developments over the past decade. Another recurring factor of success among Chinese Internet start-ups is their founders' extensive experience working in","output":"Silicon Valley before returning to their homeland. These founders bring the technological progress they’ve witnessed overseas, along with mindset and strategies that often draw heavily from the Silicon Valley ethos. This influence is reflected in many of the more successful Chinese start-ups, many of which have founders with extensive work histories within institutions like Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft. Their collective experience in running highly successful tech companies has significantly influenced the trajectory of China's internet revolution. The exported Silicon Valley experience has not only brought about a technological leap, it has also triggered cultural changes among Chinese internet users and resulted in new behavioral trends. The start-ups tapping into this are effectively translating this knowledge into their business strategies, creating unique value propositions catered specifically for the Chinese market. Many of these entrepreneurs studied and worked in the United States, where they gained first-hand knowledge about successful business practices, user experience design, and advanced technology-implementing strategies. Let's look at a few examples. Firstly, Robin Li, the co-founder of Baidu, China's largest search engine. Before establishing Baidu, Li worked for two Silicon Valley companies: IDD Information & Dow Jones. Through his experience, he got to understand how search engines work and saw the potential for this type of service in China. With this knowledge, he was able to successfully tailor Baidu's search engine algorithms to the unique needs of Chinese internet users, successfully outperforming even Google in the local market. Another key figure is Pony Ma, founder and CEO of Tencent Holdings Limited, one of the largest internet companies in China. Before founding Tencent, Ma also worked in the technology sector in Silicon Valley. Using his experience, he managed to develop one of China's most popular social messaging apps, WeChat, which has become integral in the lives of millions of Chinese daily. Many other founders with similar backgrounds are visible within the landscape of Chinese tech start-ups, from the ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing's founder Cheng Wei to JD.com's Richard Liu Qiangdong. Coupled with China's robust manufacturing capabilities and the government's aggressive push for the development of advanced technologies, Silicon Valley-trained professionals heading Chinese start-ups have managed to spearhead a digital revolution, transforming China from a country known for Internet censorship to a global technological innovator in the online industry. These knowledgeable and highly-trained founders have had a profound influence on the strategies and success of numerous Chinese Internet start-ups. Their extensive experience in Silicon Valley, the global tech hub, has provided them with a unique perspective on tech innovation and entrepreneurial strategy that they bring back to China and leverage to tailor their internet services to the local needs and trends. This has helped to mobilize an internet revolution in China that is high-speed, dynamic, and highly-responsive to user demands."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What year did the republic that experienced famine and political repression population levels restore to pre-World War II levels?  A part of Belarus under Russian rule emerged as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR) in 1919. Soon thereafter it merged to form the Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. The contested lands were divided between Poland and the Soviet Union after the war ended in 1921, and the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922. The western part of modern Belarus remained part of Poland.In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet agricultural and economic policies, including collectivization and five-year plans for the national economy, led to famine and political repression. In 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Poland, marking the beginning of World War II. The Soviets invaded and annexed much of eastern Poland, which had been part of the country since the Peace of Riga two decades earlier. Much of the northern section of this area was added to the Byelorussian SSR, and now constitutes West Belarus. The Soviet-controlled Byelorussian People's Council officially took control of the territories, whose populations consisted of a mixture of Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Jews, on 28 October 1939 in Białystok. Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. The Brest Fortress, which had been annexed in 1939, at this time was subjected to one of the most destructive onslaughts that happened during the war. Statistically, the Byelorussian SSR was the hardest-hit Soviet republic in World War II; it remained in Nazi hands until 1944. During that time, Germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic, 85% of the republic's industry, and more than one million buildings. The Nazi Generalplan Ost called for the extermination, expulsion or enslavement of most or all Belarusians for the purpose of providing more living space in the East for Germans.Casualties were estimated to be between 2 and 3 million (about a quarter to one-third of the total population), while the Jewish population of Belarus was devastated during the Holocaust and never...

The sessions were interrupted by the escalating disagreement between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had the rights to the Pink Floyd name. O'Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued Waters for £25,000 of back-commission. In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions since 1973), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to \\"the new Pink Floyd project\\". He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour's team responded by issuing a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist; however, Gilmour told a Sunday Times reporter: \\"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him, no one else has claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them. Anybody who does is extremely arrogant.\\"Waters twice visited Astoria, and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin; Ezrin later suggested that he was being \\"checked out\\".

What are the most important words in the following sentence: A hot dog and french fries served in a car tray","output":"The most important words in the sentence \\"A hot dog and french fries served in a car tray\\" are: 1. Hot dog: This is a key noun in the sentence, as it identifies the main food item being discussed. A hot dog is a common and popular food item consisting of a sausage (usually made from a mixture of meat, such as pork or beef) that is cooked and placed inside a sliced bun. Hot dogs are often garnished with various condiments, such as mustard, ketchup, onions, mayonnaise, relish, or sauerkraut, which add flavor and depth to the dish. This classic American fast food is often associated with street vendors, picnics, and sporting events. 2. French fries: This is another important noun in the sentence as it identifies the second food item being discussed. French fries are a popular snack made by cutting potatoes into long, thin strips, deep-frying them until they're crispy, and then seasoning them with salt. While the name suggests that this food originated in France, it's widely believed that french fries were actually first created in Belgium. Often served as a side dish with various types of sandwiches, burgers, and other fast-food items, french fries are generally consumed with ketchup or mayonnaise, although they can also be enjoyed with a variety of other toppings and condiments. 3. Served: This verb is crucial in the sentence, as it indicates the action and intent to provide the hot dog and french fries. The word implies that someone is giving or presenting the food items to the recipient, whether it be at a restaurant, a food stall, or any other setting. \\"Served\\" sets the scene and allows the reader to understand better the context in which the hot dog and french fries are being provided. 4. Car tray: This compound noun is essential, as it specifies the location or setting where the food items (hot dog and french fries) are being served. A car tray, usually found in drive-in theaters or diners, is a convenient device that attaches to a car's door or window and serves as a small table for holding food and drinks. This allows customers to enjoy their meals comfortably in their vehicle without the need for a traditional restaurant table. The mention of the car tray helps evoke an atmosphere of convenience, casual dining, and a nostalgic ambiance, as drive-ins and car trays were widespread in the mid-20th century. In summary, the most important words in the sentence are \\"hot dog,\\" \\"french fries,\\" \\"served,\\" and \\"car tray,\\" as they form the foundation of the scene and convey the crucial information about the food items being discussed and the context in which they're being served."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After eating foods high in salt most of their lives, how are people most likely to be (statistically speaking): Options: - Fans of macaroni and cheese. - Overweight or obese. - not enough information - University researchers. Answer:","output":"Based on the information presented in the context, the correct option is: Overweight or obese. This is because the text explains that the Western food environment, which is heavy in highly processed foods full of salt, sugar, and fat, plays a significant role in weight gain. The text mentions that most salt is added during the manufacturing process, increasing the palatability of foods. The combination of salt and fat is said to promote passive over-consumption of foods, resulting in increased overall caloric intake, uncontrolled eating, and overweight, particularly in children. A research study discussed in the text observed that the participants consumed 11% more calories when the meals were high in salt, regardless of fat content. Therefore, people who have been eating high-salt foods most of their lives are most likely to be overweight or obese, statistically speaking. The other options (being fans of macaroni and cheese, being University researchers, or not having enough information) are not directly supported by the text in relation to the long-term effects of high-salt diets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: An electric generator is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in Figure below . In a generator, some form of energy is applied to turn a shaft. This causes a coil of wire to rotate between opposite poles of a magnet. Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic field, electric current is generated in the wire. If the diagram in Figure below looks familiar to you, that’s because a generator is an electric motor in reverse. Look back at the electric motor in Figure above . If you were to mechanically turn the shaft of the motor (instead of using electromagnetism to turn it), the motor would generate electricity just like an electric generator. You can learn how to make a very simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below. Making your own generator will help you understand how a generator works.  and the situation: A windmill is used to power a nearby house. On days when there is almost no wind the house runs very low on power. But on days when there is a lot of wind, such as during a storm the reserve batteries for the house are able to charge to full.  Answer the following question: Will the amount of energy generated by the windmill increase or decrease if it is turning faster than normal? Answer:","output":"The amount of energy generated by the windmill will increase if it is turning faster than normal. Step 1: Understand that the windmill's main function is to convert wind energy (kinetic energy) into mechanical energy by rotating its blades due to the wind force. Step 2: The mechanical energy generated by the rotating blades is then used to turn the shaft of an electric generator. Step 3: In the electric generator, the rotating shaft causes the coil of wire to rotate between the opposite poles of a magnet, generating electric current in the wire through electromagnetic induction. Step 4: When the windmill turns faster than normal due to strong winds or storms, this increases the windmill's mechanical energy output as more kinetic energy is being converted into mechanical energy. Step 5: More mechanical energy then results in the generator's rotating shaft and coil of wire spinning faster, which in turn generates more electric current. Step 6: As a result, more electric current is generated when the windmill turns faster, leading to an increase in the amount of energy generated by the windmill. In conclusion, the energy generated by the windmill will increase if it is turning faster than normal due to the greater mechanical energy derived from the faster rotation of the blades, which subsequently boosts electric current generation in the electric generator."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many percent of people were not African American?","output":"Title: How Many Percent of People Were Not African-American? Hello little friend! Today, we are going to talk about what percentage of people are not African-American. Firstly, let's learn what African-American means. African-Americans are people whose ancestors come from Africa, and they live in the United States of America. Now, we want to find out how many people in the world are not belonging to this group. To do this, let's imagine all the people living on Earth as a big cake! Yummy, right? Now imagine that a small slice of this cake represents the African-American people. To know how many people are not African-American, we have to look at the rest of the cake, which includes everybody else. According to some information from the big people who study these things, about 13 percent of the population in the United States are African-American. But remember, we want to find out the percentage for the whole world, not just the United States. In the whole wide world, there are around 7.9 billion people. Out of these, around 44 million are African-American. So, the African-American people make up a very small slice of our big cake, which is only about 0.56 percent. That's just a little more than half a piece out of 100 pieces of cake! Now, we can find out how many people are not African-American. To do that, we take the entire cake, which represents 100 percent, and remove the small slice for African-American people. So, 100 percent minus 0.56 percent equals 99.44 percent.  And there you go! Around 99.44 percent of people in the world are not African-American. That means that, out of 100 people, about 99 of them will not be African-American, and only a little more than half a person will be African-American. But remember, this is just an estimation, as the population is constantly changing and growing every day. I hope this helps you to understand the percentage of people who are not African-American in the world. The important thing to remember is that people around the world are very diverse, which means we are all different and unique in our own ways! Isn't that amazing?"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Answer the following question: The play was nearly starting, everybody took their seat in the what? - show - in cinema - theatre - bench - martorell  The best answer is Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"The play was nearly starting, everybody took their seat in the what?\\" is \\"theatre.\\"  A theatre is a building or an area typically designated for the performance of plays, musicals, or other dramatic works. Theatres usually contain a stage where actors, singers, and other performers of various disciplines will come together to tell a story or express a narrative through their art. The stage may include sets and props, for enhancing the experience and providing a vivid atmosphere for the audience to immerse themselves in. Theatrical performances have been a popular form of entertainment for centuries, originating from ancient Greece. The audiences attending plays or performances would sit in designated seats or spaces, commonly known as the auditorium. The auditorium is allocated for the audience to observe the performance and is designed in a way that aligns the seating arrangement, ensuring each attendee has a clear view of the stage. The seats within a theatre are usually arranged in rows, sometimes with additional structures such as balconies, boxes, or gallery areas to accommodate larger audiences. To ensure that the audience can fully appreciate the production, the acoustics and lighting are specifically tailored to enhance and amplify both the performance and the theatre-going experience. The other suggestions mentioned, such as the show, cinema, bench, and Martorell, are not as accurate or relevant responses for the context provided in the question. A show is the actual performance or production being put on, as opposed to the location where it takes place. A cinema, while a venue for entertainment, is specific to showing movies or films and not plays. A bench is a seating structure, but it doesn't accurately represent the space where a play would occur. Finally, Martorell is a town in Catalonia, Spain, and has no specific relevance to the context of theatre or seating provided in the question.

Article: Story highlights Teenager dies after being bitten multiple times by a snake      Activists in Nepal are campaigning against the continued use of menstruation huts      New Delhi (CNN) A teenage girl in Nepal has died after she was bitten by a snake while banished to a cowshed during a menstruation ritual that sees young women separated from their families and made to sleep alone.      The victim, 19-year-old Tulasi Shahi, from western Nepal's Dailekh district, was taking part in chhaupadi, a common practice in the west of the country in which women, considered unclean during menstruation, are sequestered for the extent of their periods.      It's a ritual that Shahi had likely endured many times before, but on Thursday night, alone on the floor of her uncle's cowshed, the teenager was bitten by a poisonous snake. \\"Twice, on her head and leg,\\" the local district mayor Surya Bahadur Shahi told CNN.      Shahi's family members initially attempted to treat her using home remedies, before later taking her to a local health center, which did not stock the anti-venom medicines needed.      The monsoon rains had flooded the region's mountainous roads, making the three-hour journey to the nearest hospital all but impossible.

Many communities in Nepal view menstruating women as impure and in some remote areas they are forced to sleep in a hut away from the home during their periods, a practice known as chhaupadi.      Tulasi Shahi was bitten twice by a venomous snake and died on Friday morning in western Dailekh district, local mayor Surya Bahadur Shahi said.      “She survived for seven hours after the snake bite but died because medical treatment was delayed,” said Shahi.      According to local media, her family took her to the village shaman, or witch doctor, for treatment instead of taking her to a hospital.      Local police confirmed that a girl had died but were unable to provide further details on the cause.      Chhaupadi is linked to Hinduism and considers women untouchable when they menstruate, as well as after child birth.      They are banished from the home - barred from touching food, religious icons, cattle and men - and forced to sleep in basic huts known as chhau goth.      Two women died in late 2016 in separate incidents while following the ritual - one of smoke inhalation after she lit a fire for warmth, while the other death was unexplained.      Rights activists say many other deaths likely go unreported.      Chhaupadi was banned a decade ago but is still followed in parts of Nepal, particularly in remote western districts.      Proposed legislation that would criminalise the practice and make it an imprisonable offence to force women to follow the ritual is currently pending in parliament.      Some communities believe they will suffer misfortune such as a natural disaster if women and girls are not sent into isolation when they menstruate. They are also not permitted to drink milk and are given less food to eat during their period.      Activists say the government’s response to stamp out practices such as the Chhaupadi system and child marriage in the Himalayan nation has been inadequate. But officials say they are battling age-old attitudes that cannot be changed overnight.      “We have launched different schemes but quickly removing practices that are deep-rooted in the society is difficult,” said Binita Bhattarai, an official from the women and child      welfare ministry.      “Changing mindsets and social attitudes is a time-taking process.”                         ||||| An 18-year-old girl has died in Nepal after she was bitten by a snake while banished to a shed because she was menstruating, under an ancient practice that has been banned for more than a decade, officials said.

This month was no different. She slept there on wooden boards laid on the ground, in keeping with a tradition known as chhaupadi that sequesters menstruating women from their families.      But while she was in the hut on Thursday night, Ms. Shahi, 18, was bitten by a poisonous snake. Her mother took her to a shaman, but he could not cure her. Then she was taken to a health clinic, but workers did not have the antivenom medicine she needed, her family said.      Ms. Shahi died early Friday morning.      “If she was given proper treatment, she would have survived,” said Kamala Shahi, a cousin of Ms. Shahi’s who works at a government health post. “She died because of superstition.”      The Supreme Court of Nepal ordered an end to chhaupadi, which is linked to Hinduism, in 2005. But it is still practiced in many of Nepal’s isolated villages, particularly in the west. A bill is pending in Parliament to formally criminalize the practice. Many people in rural villages believe that menstruating women are impure and can bring bad luck on a household. Under the chhaupadi tradition, the women are kept from taking part in normal family activities and social gatherings or from entering houses, kitchens and temples. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Tragedy has struck in Nepal after a teenage girl participating in the controversial chhaupadi menstruation ritual died from a snake bite.

Definition: Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage. Input: Gene expression signatures can provide an unbiased view into the molecular changes underlying biologically and medically interesting phenotypes. We therefore initiated this study to identify signatures that would be of utility in studying rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We used microarray profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 30 RA patients to assess the effect of different biologic agent (biologics) treatments and to quantify the degree of a type-I interferon (IFN) signature in these patients. A numeric score was derived for the quantification step and applied to patients with RA. To further characterize the IFN response in our cohort, we employed type-I IFN treatment of PBMCs in vitro and in reporter assays. Profiling identified a subset of RA patients with upregulation of type-I IFN-regulated transcripts, thereby corroborating previous reports showing RA to be heterogeneous for an IFN component. A comparison of individuals currently untreated with a biologic with those treated with infliximab, tocilizumab, or abatacept suggested that each biologic induces a specific gene signature in PBMCs. It is possible to observe signs of type-I IFN pathway activation in a subset of clinically active RA patients without C-reactive protein elevation. Furthermore, biologics-specific gene signatures in patients with RA indicate that looking for a biologic-specific response pattern may be a potential future tool for predicting individual patient response.

In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century. Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241, 1259, and 1287.\\"?

Here are possible answers to this question: - relaxation - enjoying - arguments - going abroad - spending money  I believe the correct choice is \\"arguments\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"Arguments are the most likely outcome when a couple disagrees on aspects of planning a vacation, and there are several reasons for this. Firstly, planning a vacation is an important decision as it involves a substantial amount of time, effort, and resources. Couples usually have high expectations for this experience, which can lead to conflict when both parties cannot agree on certain aspects. The anticipation and excitement of going on a vacation can heighten emotions, causing disagreements to escalate into arguments more easily. Secondly, vacations often require joint decision-making and compromise, which can be difficult for couples who have different preferences and priorities. Finding a balance that satisfies the needs and desires of both individuals can be challenging, leading to arguments as they navigate accommodations, activities, budget, and more. For instance, one partner may prioritize relaxation and prefer a beach getaway, while the other may be looking for a more adventurous vacation that involves hiking and exploring. Additionally, one person may put more emphasis on luxurious accommodations, while the other may prioritize experiences and allocate more resources towards excursions and activities. These differences in preference can result in tension and disagreement if both parties cannot find common ground. Financial considerations can also contribute to arguments, as a vacation often involves significant expenditure. Money can be a sensitive subject for many couples, and disagreements about budgets and financial priorities are not uncommon. Moreover, when one partner wants to splurge on an expensive destination or activity, the other may feel the need to cut back on expenses elsewhere, causing frustration and potential arguments. Furthermore, many couples face the added challenge of coordinating their schedules and aligning their time off from work or other commitments. This can lead to disagreements about the ideal duration, timing, or destination for their vacation. For example, one partner may prefer a shorter, more action-packed vacation, while the other is looking forward to a longer, leisurely break. In summary, the process of planning a vacation can lead to arguments between a couple when they disagree due to the importance of the experience, differing preferences and priorities, financial considerations, and logistical challenges. It is important for couples to communicate, listen to each other, and be willing to compromise in order to plan a vacation that caters to the needs and desires of both individuals, ultimately resulting in a positive outcome like relaxation and enjoyment, rather than conflict and stress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: In a fictional country in a highly mountainous region of Europe, a motley group of travelers is delayed by an avalanche that has blocked the railway tracks. The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead. She says she is all right and gets on the train, but drops unconscious once aboard. When she recovers, she finds herself seated in a compartment across from Miss Froy, who has evidently helped her. In the compartment are other passengers who appear not to understand English.Iris and Miss... Answer:","output":"Based on the movie plot provided, a potential question for discussion or analysis could be:  How does the unique setting and circumstances within the European village bring out the different personalities and motivations of the characters, ultimately leading them to uncover a hidden mystery while dealing with their own personal dilemmas? This question encourages an in-depth exploration of the movie's setting and its impact on the development of the characters and the story. The plot takes place in a small mountain village, isolating a group of diverse travelers that are forced to mingle and stay overnight in a quaint hotel, bringing out various interpersonal conflicts and secret affairs. By centering the narrative around the avalanche that has thwarted their travel plans, the plot essentially puts the characters in a confined space, allowing for their various personalities to clash and interact in interesting ways. For instance, the urgency of Caldicott and Charters to reach the cricket Test match in England demonstrates their priorities, and their willingness to stay in the maid's room indicates a sense of adaptability and compromise. The unfolding dynamics between Iris, Gilbert, and Miss Froy set the stage for an intriguing relationship as they go from simply trying to get a good night's sleep to helping each other uncover the mysterious events surrounding the musician's murder and the potential target on Miss Froy. The secretive couple, Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter, serve as yet another example of the complexities that emerge within the movie's plot, brought to light by the confinement of their circumstances. Their illicit affair contrasts with the other characters' situations, introducing an element of deception and moral ambiguity within the story. In conclusion, the unique setting and circumstances presented in the movie plot not only allow the characters to face their own personal dilemmas but also force them into a mysterious investigation. This question encourages a deep dive into the ways in which the plot's confined environment pushes the narrative forward and highlights the distinct personalities, motivations, and relationships among the diverse characters."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. Bacteria with the mutation increase in numbers, so the mutation becomes more common. Other mutations are harmful. They may even be deadly. Harmful mutations often result in a protein that no longer can do its job. Some harmful mutations cause cancer or other genetic disorders.  David is a biochemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is testing three strains of bacteria, case A, case B, and case C. In case A the bacteria does not respond to antibiotics. In case B the bacteria resists antibiotics. Finally, in case C, the bacteria does not develop any immunity to antibiotics and eventually perishes.  In which case the organism would less likely have genetic disorder, case B or case C? Answer:","output":"In case B, the bacteria are less likely to have a genetic disorder. In this case, the bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics, which is an example of a beneficial mutation. This mutation helps the bacteria survive in their environment and increases their chances of thriving under antibiotic pressure. As a result, the bacteria in case B are more likely to have a healthy, functional protein that contributes to their successful adaptation and survival. In contrast, case C involves bacteria that do not develop any immunity to antibiotics and ultimately perish. The lack of resistance may indicate that these bacteria possess harmful mutations or are simply not adapting well to their environment. Such mutations could potentially cause genetic disorders or a compromised ability to perform necessary functions for survival. So, between case B and case C, case B is less likely to have a genetic disorder, as it demonstrates a beneficial mutation that supports its survival and adaptation to its environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's why the other options are not correct: - Badminton World Federation emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement is not relevant to the passage, as it states that the BWF emerged as a force in the sport rather than focus on the impact of the scandal on China or the athlete. - CNN emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement is not related to the topic of the passage. CNN is a news organization, not a player in the sport of badminton. - Farewell Badminton World Federation emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement doesn't make any sense, as it mixes a quote from the passage with the phrasing of the option. - Olympic emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement is vague and unrelated to the passage. The term \\"Olympic\\" does not clearly identify an entity or a team within the sport of badminton. - Wang Xiaoli emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement is incorrect, as it suggests Wang Xiaoli, Yu Yang's partner, was a prominent player in the 1970s, which is not relevant to the passage or the situation being discussed. - Yu emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement is incorrect, as it refers to Yu Yang, who was not a player in the 1970s, and it is unrelated to the main topic of the passage. - Yu Yang emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement is incorrect, as it suggests Yu Yang was a prominent player in the 1970s, which is not relevant to the passage or time frame being discussed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: How much did the Bishop of Rochester spend on the new castle at Rochester?  It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were...

How is \\"Don’t touch me, not ever And then you will win!\\" said in French?","output":"In French, the phrase \\"Don't touch me, not ever, and then you will win!\\" can be translated as \\"Ne me touche pas, jamais, et alors tu gagneras !\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of each part of the sentence: 1. \\"Don't touch me\\" - In French, the negation structure consists of \\"ne\\" placed in front of the verb and \\"pas\\" placed after the verb. In this case, the verb \\"toucher\\" (to touch) is combined with the pronoun \\"me\\" (me). The imperative form (command form) of the verb toucher, for the singular informal \\"you\\" (tu) would be \\"touche.\\" So, the negation \\"Don't touch me\\" becomes \\"Ne me touche pas.\\" 2. \\"Not ever\\" - This phrase can be translated as \\"jamais\\" in French. It is an adverb that means \\"never\\" or \\"not ever\\" and can be used here to reinforce the idea that the speaker does not want to be touched at all. 3. \\"And then\\" - This phrase can be translated as \\"et alors.\\" \\"Et\\" means \\"and,\\" while \\"alors\\" is an adverb meaning \\"then\\" or \\"so.\\" This part of the sentence is used to connect the first two phrases with the last one, implying a cause-and-effect relationship. 4. \\"You will win\\" - In French, \\"you will win\\" can be translated as \\"tu gagneras.\\" \\"Gagner\\" means \\"to win\\" and is conjugated here in the future tense for the singular informal \\"you\\" (tu). The future tense of the verb \\"gagner\\" for the subject \\"tu\\" would be \\"gagneras.\\" Putting all these parts together, the French translation of \\"Don't touch me, not ever, and then you will win!\\" is \\"Ne me touche pas, jamais, et alors tu gagneras !\\""},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: Formerly, men not wearing military uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included obligatory trains and tiaras or feathers in their hair (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World War I, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King George V was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation.

Space exploration ships traverse the vast unknown, discovering new planets and keeping them secure from any potential threats. In their journeys, they come across other extraterrestrial species, some friendly and some posing threats to humanity's existence. The protagonists, led by the unyielding Captain Alena Armstrong, consist of a diverse team of crew members aboard the United Earth Alliance (UEA) Exploration Ship, The Celestial Nova. The team is assigned to explore an uncharted area to gather data and uncover whether extraterrestrial life exists nearby. As the crew of The Celestial Nova delves deeper into uncharted territory, their advanced sensors detect an unidentified vessel lurking nearby—one that seems to defy all technological capabilities known to humanity. Before the team can react, the unknown ship closes in on their position. What comes next is an intense standoff fraught with tension. The enemy patrol ship not only appears to be technologically superior but also inhabited by a species that the UEA has never encountered before. Their motive remains unknown, but it becomes clear that this species has no intention of initiating peaceful contact. Captain Armstrong decides to take a calculated risk and attempt to communicate with the potential adversaries. Her diplomatic efforts yield a fragile truce, revealing that this enemy faction calls themselves the Chrono Order, a species of time-manipulating beings on a mission to prevent a catastrophe that affects the entire universe. The Chrono Order claims that, in the near future, Earth's reckless journey into deep space would accidentally trigger a series of events that lead to a rip in the fabric of space-time. This tear would create a domino effect, spreading destruction and chaos throughout the universe. Faced with this daunting prophecy, the crew of The Celestial Nova and the Chrono Order's operatives, led by their enigmatic commander, Nylios, must now work together to avert this impending disaster. Their journey brings about explosive skirmishes with other hostile extraterrestrial species, tense diplomatic affairs, and forbidden time-bending practices. As the uneasy alliance between Captain Armstrong's team and the Chrono Order progresses, double-crossings and hidden agendas unfold, threatening to tear them apart. Alena battles inner demons as she struggles to trust Nylios and his team, questioning their true intentions while trying to uphold her commitment to protecting humanity. The climax of the story brings them face to face with the heart of the supposed anomaly—the Tempus Anomaly—that threatens to unravel the universe. To save the very fabric of existence, they must confront their own fears and form a bond stronger than ever. But will the enemy factions and internal struggles jeopardize their mission? The Tempus Anomaly is a thrilling science fiction adventure that weaves together action, suspense, and the ethical consequences of humanity's exploration of the unknown.

Please answer the following question: Background: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]  An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.  Paragraph: Company X stopped taking on more debt, and decided to file for bankruptcy, while company Y, kept benefiting from the tax benefits of debt, having a lower debt level.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which company had fewer costs than benefits related to debt, company X or company Y?

Can you fix that?","output":"The book is written as a diary but jumps very from person to person. The unique format of the book, which is written as a diary, makes it an engaging and immersive read for the audience. However, it also has a fascinating twist in that it jumps from one person's perspective to another, effectively allowing readers to get to know the characters on a deeper level. This approach can be highly beneficial for the storytelling process, as it enables the author to provide different points of view on specific events and situations. By presenting various perspectives, the readers can piece together a more comprehensive picture of what is happening within the storyline, and ultimately form a richer understanding of the characters' emotions, motivations, and experiences. Additionally, the diary-like structure itself lends a certain sense of intimacy to the narrative. As readers peruse the personal thoughts and feelings of each character, they forge a connection with them. This close association makes it easier to relate to the characters and become invested in their journey. Despite the potential advantages, there are also challenges that come with writing a book in this format. The frequent jumps between characters can make it difficult for readers to follow the narrative if the transitions are not seamless. It is essential for the author to establish a clear distinction between the different perspectives to avoid confusion. One way to address this challenge is by writing each character's diary entries in a unique voice or style. This differentiation helps the readers easily identify the character behind each entry, fostering an uninterrupted flow of the narrative. Incorporating elements like date and time stamps or distinct chapter headings can also contribute to a smoother reading experience. Subtle visual cues, such as different fonts or formatting for each character, can offer additional clarity. Moreover, writing from multiple points of view requires a thorough understanding of each character, their background, and their thought processes. The author must ensure that the characters' voices remain consistent and authentic. Developing well-rounded and believable characters can also help readers remain engaged and interested in their story. In conclusion, while writing a book as a diary that jumps from one person to another can present certain challenges, it also holds immense potential to deliver an engaging and intimate reading experience. By carefully handling transitions, playing with narrative styles, and creating well-developed characters, an author can successfully write a compelling multi-perspective story that connects with readers on a deeper level."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Before my first summer vacation at college, my roommate Ted asked to me to work with him on his father's farm in Argentina. The idea of spending two months in Argentine was exciting. Then I began having second thoughts. I had never been far from New England, and I had been homesick my first few weeks at college. What would it be like in a strange country? What about the language? The more I thought about it, the more the idea worried me.  In the end I turned down the invitation. As soon as Ted asked somebody else to go, I began kicking myself. I had turned down something I wanted to do because I was scared, and had ended up feeling depressed. That unhappy summer taught me a valuable lesson out of which I developed a rule for myself: do what makes you anxious; don't do what makes you depressed.  At the end of my senior year, I began to think about becoming a writer. But my professor was urging me to aim at teaching. I hesitated. The idea of trying to live by writing was a lot scarier than spending a summer in Argentina. Back and forth I went, making my decision, unmaking it. Suddenly I realized that every time I gave up the idea of writing, that downhearted feeling went through me. Giving up on what I really wanted to do depressed me. Right then I learned another lesson. To avoid that kind of depression meant having to bear a certain amount of worry and concern. When I first began writing articles, I was frequently required to interview big names. Before each interview I would get butterflies in the stomach and my hands would shake. One person I particularly admired was the great composer Duke Ellington. On the stage and on television, he seemed the very model of confidence. Then I learned Ellington still got stage fright. If the highly honored Ellington, who had appeared on the bandstand some 10,000 times over 30years, had anxiety attacks, who was I to think I could avoid them? I went on doing those frightening interviews. Then I realized to my astonishment that I was even looking forward to the interviews....

Second question: Why is no one answering my questions in Quora? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, both the first and the second questions are essentially asking the same thing - why one's questions on Quora are not receiving any answers. There could be several reasons for this issue, and it is important to consider various factors that might be contributing to it. Here are some possible explanations: 1. Poorly formulated questions: It is crucial to ask clear, well-formulated, and easy-to-understand questions for people to respond to. If your question is lengthy, confusing, or ambiguous, potential answerers might find it challenging to comprehend and be discouraged from responding. 2. Lack of proper tagging and categorization: Quora relies heavily on tags and topic organization to direct questions to the relevant audience. When your question lacks appropriate tags or is miscategorized, it may not reach the right experts or users interested in the subject matter, resulting in fewer or no answers. 3. Oversaturated topics or duplicate questions: Quora has been around for several years and has accumulated millions of questions and answers. If your question has been asked numerous times before or is very similar to existing questions, it might be overlooked by users who assume it has already been answered. In such cases, it is recommended to search for existing answers before posting a new question. 4. Timing and visibility: The time of day or week when a question is posted may affect its visibility to potential answerers. Posting during peak user activity hours or when your target audience is predominantly online improves the chances of receiving more responses. 5. Niche or overly specific topics: While Quora covers a wide array of subjects, some questions may be too niche or specific, limiting their potential answerers. In such cases, it might be difficult to find someone with the knowledge or experience necessary to provide a satisfactory answer. 6. Unfavorable Quora algorithm: Quora's algorithm plays a significant role in deciding which questions get promoted on users' feeds and which ones remain buried. The algorithm considers factors like the number of upvotes, shares, and answers a question receives. If your question receives low engagement initially, the algorithm might not prioritize it, making it less likely to be seen and answered. 7. Inadequate engagement from your Quora network: As part of the Quora community, having a strong network of followers and connections can help increase the visibility of your questions. Engaging actively in answering, following, and upvoting other users' content on the platform generates reciprocal interest from community members and improves the chances of getting your questions answered. While it is possible that a combination of these factors might be contributing to the lack of answers for your questions on Quora, identifying and addressing these issues will likely increase your chances of receiving responses in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Courage Under Fire Movie plot: While serving in the Gulf War, Lieutenant Colonel Serling (Denzel Washington) accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing night-time battle, killing his friend Captain Boylar. The US Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job. Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and on the next day, when further rescue arrived, Walden was reported dead. Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic (Matt Damon), praises Walden heavily. Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward and that Monfriez himself led the crew in combat, and that the fuel bladder technique was originated by him. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and rendered unconscious. Meanwhile, the crew of the Black Hawk claims that they heard firing from an M16, which Ilario and Monfriez deny. Under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg (Michael Moriarty), to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn) to prevent another cover up. When Serling puts pressure on Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train.

Information:  - The Scottish Football League (SFL) was a league featuring professional and semi-professional football clubs mostly from Scotland. From its foundation in 1890 until the breakaway Scottish Premier League (SPL) was formed in 1998, the SFL represented the top level of football in Scotland. After 1998, the SFL represented levels 2 to 4 of the Scottish football league system. In June 2013, the SFL merged with the SPL to form the Scottish Professional Football League.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - Ayrshire is a historic county in south-west Scotland, located on the shores of the Firth of Clyde.  It is also, under the name the County of Ayr, a registration county. Its principal towns include Ayr, Kilmarnock and Irvine. Like the other counties of Scotland, it currently has no administrative function, instead being sub-divided into the council areas of North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire and East Ayrshire. It has a population of approximately 366,800.  - The Old Firm is the collective name for the Scottish football clubs Celtic and Rangers, who are both based in Glasgow. The origin of the term is unclear but may derive from the two clubs' initial match in which the commentators referred to the teams as \\"like two old, firm friends\\", and represents the commercial benefits of the two clubs' rivalry. The name may also be a reference to these two teams being among the original 11 members of the Scottish Football League formed in 1890. The rivalry between the two clubs has become deeply embedded in Scottish culture and has contributed to the political, social and religious division in Scotland and also beyond, especially in neighbouring Northern Ireland. As a result, the fixture was recognised as having enduring appeal.  - The Scottish Junior Football Association (\\"SJFA\\" for short) is an affiliated national association of the Scottish Football Association and is the governing body for the junior grade of football in Scotland. The term \\"junior\\" refers to the level of football played, not the age of the players. The closest equivalent terminology would be non-League football in England, the difference being that non-league football in Scotland is not similarly integrated into its football league system. Founded in 1886, the SJFA is responsible for disciplinary matters within the grade, certain player registration procedures and organising the annual Scottish Junior Cup. Other league and cup competitions are organised by three regional committees. The association headquarters are at Hampden Park, Glasgow, which is Scotland's national football stadium. There was an earlier Scottish Junior FA, which was founded in Glasgow in October 1880. This body also ran a Scottish Junior Cup competition during 188081 season but appears to have disbanded at the end of that season.  - The Scottish Premier League (SPL) was the top level league competition for professional football clubs in Scotland. The league was founded in 1998, when it broke away from the Scottish Football League (SFL). It was abolished in 2013, when the SPL and SFL merged to form the new Scottish Professional Football League, with its top division being known as the Scottish Premiership. A total of 19 clubs competed in the SPL, but only the Old Firm clubs, Celtic and Rangers won the league championship.  - Robert Stevenson \`\` Bobby '' Donnelly ( born 19 January 1987 ) is a Scottish professional footballer currently playing as a defender for Kirkintilloch Rob Roy in the Scottish Junior Football Association , West Region . He has previously played in the Scottish Premier League for Motherwell .  - Girvan (\\"mouth of the River Girvan\\") is a burgh in Carrick, South Ayrshire, Scotland. Girvan is stituated on the east coast of the Firth of Clyde, with a population of about 6,700. It lies south of Ayr, and north of Stranraer, the main ferry port from Scotland to Northern Ireland.  - South Ayrshire is one of 32 council areas of Scotland, covering the southern part of Ayrshire. It borders onto Dumfries and Galloway, East Ayrshire and North Ayrshire. South Ayrshire Council is a Conservative controlled council. The administrative boundaries were formed in 1996 as a direct successor to the Kyle and Carrick district council area, with the district of Dalmellington - located along the south-east of Kyle and Carrick - being transferred over to the newly formed East Ayrshire Council area. South Ayrshire also forms part of the east coast of the Firth of Clyde.  - The Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region is one of three regions of the SJFA which organise their own distinct league and cup competitions. The SJFA used to be split into six regions, but in 2002 they took the decision to reform into three to try to ensure more games between the top clubs and hence increase their revenues. The region currently covers an area from Girvan in South Ayrshire to Denny in Central Scotland.    What entity does 'bobby donnelly' has the relation 'place of birth' with?

Good job, everyone!” That hour had been hell for everyone in the room, save only my little boy, sleeping peacefully in the warming crib, and his mother, who was just stirring from the general that had put her under about 55 minutes earlier. I had come within a few minutes, maybe seconds, of raising my boy as a single parent. Her OB/GYN had fought valliently to keep my family together, and won. Everyone who'd been awake knew exactly how close run a thing it had been. Mr. Murphy had been hanging around the whole time, and neither Doc nor mom was catching a whole lot of breaks that evening. But Doc only needed one, and he made full use thereof. One thing for all new dad's whose wives have had previous abdominal surgery. You never want to hear the muttered words, “Creative anatomy on the way out”, when somebody has your wife’s belly open. Those are about the worst words in the world, because they mean Doc's gotta put stuff to right in there, and he might not have what he'd like in order to get it done.

Process: - Rain falls on wood - The rain seeps into the wood surface - It permeates the wood - When rain evaporates it leaves the wood - It takes the finish of the wood with it - The wood begins to lose it's luster - It begins to look bad - It has pieces of paint missing from the rain - It gets worse when it rains - It eventually will have no paint left.  Question: suppose the wood is sealed happens, how will it affect the rain will not evaporate out of the wood.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"The process described earlier involves the rain affecting an unsealed wooden surface, causing it to lose its finish and luster over time. However, if the wood is properly sealed, the effects of rain on the wood change significantly. To analyze how this perturbation affects the second effect mentioned, we need to understand the role of a sealant in protecting wooden surfaces. A sealant acts as a barrier between the wooden surface and the external elements, in this case, rainwater. It prevents the rain from seeping into the wood surface, essentially creating a protective coat that maintains the appearance and structural properties of the wood. Here are the influences of a sealed wooden surface in relation to the original process: 1. Rain falls on the sealed wood: Since the wood is sealed, the rain cannot penetrate the surface. The sealant acts as a barrier, shielding the wood from the moisture and potential water damage. 2. The rain does not seep into the wood surface: As the wood is sealed, rainwater cannot infiltrate and permeate the wood, so it remains on the surface. Consequently, no damage is caused to the wood's integrity or appearance. 3. Rain does not permeate the wood: The sealant's effectiveness in blocking the rain from entering the wood preserves the material's luster, color, and finish, extending its life over time. 4. When the rain evaporates, it doesn't affect the wood: Since the rain does not come into contact with the wood beneath the sealant, any evaporation of rainwater does not harm the wooden surface or its finish. So, when examining the supposed perturbation – sealing the wood – and its influence on the second effect mentioned – rain evaporation taking the finish of the wood with it – the sealing of the wood has a significant effect: it greatly reduces or eliminates the damage caused by rain to the wooden surface. In other words, the sealed wood is less affected by rain, evaporation, and potential damage than an unsealed surface."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The statement mentions these websites shutting down, or providing links for earthquake donations, but it does not directly address the initial question about websites converting their home page colors. Regarding the question, many websites have been known to change their home page colors for various reasons, such as supporting social causes, raising awareness, or celebrating special events. Here is a more detailed answer: 1. Social causes or awareness campaigns: Websites often update their home page colors to support various social causes, like World AIDS Day, Earth Day, or cancer awareness. For example, sites might change their home page colors to red during World AIDS Day or pink during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. This action generates visibility and solidarity towards specific issues and helps in raising awareness. 2. Tragedy or disaster events: Many websites have altered their color schemes, or converted their homepages to black, in response to tragic events such as terror attacks, natural disasters, or to pay respect to the deceased in memorial events. For instance, in April 2011, Chinese websites turned their home pages black to mourn the victims of the Qinghai earthquake. 3. Celebratory instances: Many websites change their home page colors to celebrate special events or occasions, such as holidays, product launches, or significant milestones. For example, during LGBTQ+ pride month, several websites modify their color schemes to incorporate the rainbow flag colors in support of the LGBTQ+ community. 4. Political or social activism: Sometimes, websites convert their home pages to specific colors to signify support for a political or social movement. One such example is \\"Blackout Tuesday,\\" where numerous websites and social media platforms turned their pages black in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in response to the death of George Floyd in 2020. In summary, various websites have converted their home page colors to align with an array of reasons, including social causes, awareness campaigns, tragic events, celebrations, and political or social activism.

Given the question: This article: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person in whose view the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music?, what is it ? The answer is:","output":"The full name of the person in whose view the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music is Ronald Crichton."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: a. Light is refracted by water vapor in the air.. b. Light is scattered by water droplets in the air.. c. Light is absorbed by water vapor near the ground.. d. Light is reflected by water droplets on the ground.. Answer:","output":"The correct answer is: b. Light is scattered by water droplets in the air. Step 1: Analyze the options a. Refraction is the bending of light as it passes through media with different refractive indices, like from air to water, but it doesn't significantly reduce visibility. b. Scattering is the process where light is diffused or deflected in various directions due to interaction with particles, like water droplets in fog. c. Absorption is when light is taken in by a substance and converted into other forms of energy, like heat. While water vapor can absorb some light, it is not enough to cause the dramatic reduction in visibility in heavy fog. d. Reflection is when light bounces off a surface or object. While some light may be reflected by water droplets on the ground, it is not the primary reason for reduced visibility in heavy fog. Step 2: Justify the correct option Option b is correct because heavy fog is made up of tiny water droplets suspended in the air. When light passes through these water droplets, it is scattered in various directions, preventing the light from traveling directly from its source to the observer.

Fruit farm had depleted soils in the past, but they established an agroforestry system a decade ago. This helped stabilize the soil and increase production. Agroforestry systems are known for various environmental benefits, including cleaner water due to reduced soil erosion and better filtration. Given this information, I can conclude the following: A: Grape farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods, as there is no mention of any efforts towards soil improvement or conservation practices. On the other hand, Fruit farm implemented an agroforestry system, which likely resulted in cleaner water due to its environmental benefits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process:  - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more food is in the body happens, how will it affect the liver turns more glucagon into glucose.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Step 1: Identify the original process The original process involves the regulation of blood sugar levels in the body. When blood sugar levels drop, the pancreas releases glucagon, the liver converts glucagon into glucose, and releases it back into the bloodstream, restoring blood sugar levels. Step 2: Introduce the perturbation The perturbation in this case is the introduction of more food into the body. Step 3: Determine the direct effects of the perturbation  When more food is introduced in the body, it will be digested and absorbed, leading to an increase in blood sugar levels. Step 4: Analyze the effect of perturbation on the original process Given that the blood sugar levels have increased due to the introduction of more food, the body's need to raise blood sugar levels by releasing glucagon from the pancreas and converting it into glucose in the liver may be reduced or eliminated. Step 5: Evaluate the indirect effects of the perturbation (if any) As a result of the increased blood sugar levels, the body may secrete more insulin to help the cells absorb the glucose and maintain optimal blood sugar levels. This could result in a decrease in the release of glucagon from the pancreas, potentially impacting the liver's need to convert glucagon into glucose. Step 6: Assess the overall effect of the perturbation on the process In conclusion, the perturbation of more food in the body might have both direct and indirect effects on the process. The direct effect is the reduction or elimination of the need to convert glucagon into glucose in the liver due to increased blood sugar levels. The indirect effect is a potential decrease in the release of glucagon from the pancreas as the body secretes more insulin to maintain blood sugar levels. Overall, these effects could lead to the liver converting less glucagon into glucose as the perturbation occurs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Although most hardware clones were not produced under license by Nintendo, certain companies were granted licenses to produce NES-compatible devices. The Sharp Corporation produced at least two such clones: the Twin Famicom and the SHARP 19SC111 television. The Twin Famicom was compatible with both Famicom cartridges and Famicom Disk System disks.

The SHARP 19SC111 television was a television which included a built-in Famicom. A similar licensing deal was reached with Hyundai Electronics, who licensed the system under the name Comboy in the South Korean market. This deal with Hyundai was made necessary because of the South Korean government's wide ban on all Japanese \\"cultural products\\", which remained in effect until 1998 and ensured that the only way Japanese products could legally enter the South Korean market was through licensing to a third-party (non-Japanese) distributor (see also Japan–Korea disputes).

Please answer this question: The 1954 film Demetrius And The Gladiators was the sequel to which film of 1953 ?","output":"The 1954 film \\"Demetrius and the Gladiators\\" was the sequel to the 1953 film \\"The Robe.\\" This epic, historical drama directed by Henry Koster was based on a novel of the same name by Lloyd C. Douglas and produced by 20th Century Fox. Both films were significant for their time, with \\"The Robe\\" being the first film released in the widescreen, CinemaScope format. This new format gave audiences a more immersive experience, with a wider aspect ratio that provided a panoramic view of the scenes. \\"The Robe\\" tells the story of a Roman tribune, Marcellus Gallio, played by Richard Burton. He is involved in the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and wins Christ's robe as a gambling prize. The relic becomes a source of turmoil for him as he starts experiencing guilt, nightmares, and spiritual awakening. Marcellus eventually becomes a Christian, as does his slave, Demetrius (played by Victor Mature), who plays a crucial role in the sequel \\"Demetrius and the Gladiators.\\" In \\"Demetrius and the Gladiators,\\" the story picks up where \\"The Robe\\" left off. Following the events of the first movie, Demetrius is entrusted with the robe of Christ by Marcellus. The film revolves around Demetrius' struggles to protect the sacred relic while navigating the dangerous world of gladiators, Roman politics, and religious persecution. Directed by Delmer Daves, the film primarily takes place in Rome and focuses on the political conflict between Emperor Caligula (played by Jay Robinson) and Claudius Caesar (played by Barry Jones). The film also stars actress Susan Hayward as Messalina, the wife of Claudius and a woman who becomes infatuated with Demetrius, adding another layer of complication to the story. As Demetrius tries to keep the robe away from the grasp of the corrupt and power-hungry, he faces many challenges, including imprisonment and being forced to become a gladiator. The movie not only focuses on Demetrius' physical battles but also explores his internal struggles with faith, love, and duty. \\"Demetrius and the Gladiators\\" capitalized on the success and popularity of \\"The Robe,\\" with its captivating story, notable performances, and epic action sequences. The two films remain iconic representations of the biblical epic genre that was prominent in the 1950s and 1960s. They were also significant in showcasing the ancient Roman world and exploring themes of religious faith, redemption, and political intrigue, which were appealing to the audience during that era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus.  Which student learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators? Answer:","output":"Hannah and Joe, both studying horticulture, were exploring the behavior and relationships of ants for their entomology class. While Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, Joe focused on ants that farm fungus. In order to determine which student learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators, we need to take a deeper look at the two types of ants being studied by each of them. Hannah studied ants that farm aphids. These ants, known as aphid-herding ants, maintain a symbiotic relationship with the aphids. Aphids feed on plant sap and excrete a sugary substance called honeydew, which the ants consume as a food source. In return, the ants protect the aphids from predators such as ladybugs and lacewings. As an important part of their survival strategy, these ants have developed various defense mechanisms to ward off aphid predators. They fight by physically attacking predators, as well as releasing various chemical signals to alert their colony members of potential threats. On the other hand, Joe studied ants that farm fungus, also known as leaf-cutter ants. These ants display an entirely different behavior. Leaf-cutter ants cut small pieces of leaves and carry them back to their nest, where they use the leaves to cultivate fungus gardens. They rely on this fungus as their primary food source. For leaf-cutter ants, their primary focus is on maintaining the fungus garden, and they have significantly less interaction with aphids and their predators. Although they may occasionally encounter such predators, their main concerns lie in defending their territory, maintaining their fungus garden, and repelling any infection or contamination by foreign elements. Considering the specific ants being studied by both Hannah and Joe, it is clear that Joe learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators. Since the primary interest of leaf-cutter ants lies in their fungus gardens, they do not have the same level of interaction and defense mechanisms against aphid predators as do the aphid-herding ants. Furthermore, aphid predators such as ladybugs and lacewings are not directly relevant to the leaf-cutter ants' primary concerns. Therefore, Joe, who studied ants that farm fungus, learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators compared to Hannah, who studied ants with a symbiotic relationship directly linked to the protection of aphids."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who sailed back east along the coast to Honduras? is inside the article: Gil González Dávila set out from the Caribbean island of Hispaniola early in 1524, with the intention of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.The Dominicans established themselves in Xocolo on the shore of Lake Izabal in the mid-16th century. Xocolo became infamous among the Dominican missionaries for the practice of witchcraft by its inhabitants. By 1574 it was the most important staging post for European expeditions into the interior, and it remained important in that role until as late as 1630, although it was abandoned in 1631.In 1598 Alfonso Criado de Castilla became governor of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Owing to the poor state of Puerto de Caballos on the Honduran coast and its exposure to repeated pirate raids he sent a pilot to scout Lake Izabal. As a result of the survey, and after royal permission was granted, Criado de Castilla ordered the construction of a new port, named Santo Tomás de Castilla, at a favourable spot on the Amatique Bay not far from the lake.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: It all begins one snowy evening shortly before Christmas, 1933, but no one is feeling very festive at the Girls' Annex of The New York City Municipal Orphanage.11-year old Annie (Alicia Morton, in her film debut, after launching her professional life on Broadway) is gazing out a window at the falling flakes when the silence is pierced by the cries of little Molly (Sarah Hyland), calling for her vanished mother. Pepper (Marissa Rago) angrily erupts over being awakened, but July (Nanea Miyata) jumps to Molly's defense. Annie breaks up the scuffle, and comforts Molly by telling her she was just having another nightmare. Molly admits that he misses her parents terribly, but Pepper, apparently believing that heavy armor is the surest defense, curtly reminds her that they are orphans, that they neither have, nor ever will have, parents. Annie retorts that she is not an orphan - that her parents are alive and are coming back for her, and Molly chirps triumphantly that Annie has a note to prove it. Molly asks Annie to read the note aloud once more, something Annie has done so often that the other girls know its contents quite well:\\"Please take care of our little darling. Her name is Annie.

Movie title: Yellow Submarine Context: Pepperland is a cheerful, music-loving paradise under the sea, protected by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The titular Yellow Submarine rests on an Aztec-like pyramid on a hill. At the edge of the land is a range of high blue mountains. The land falls under a surprise attack from the music-hating Blue Meanies, who live in or beyond the blue mountains. The attack starts with magical projectiles fired from big artillery stationed in the blue mountains. The Blue Meanies seal the band inside a music-proof blue glass globe, they render the Pepperlanders immobile as statues by shooting arrows and dropping giant green apples upon them (a reference to the Apple Records music label), and drain the countryside of colour. In the last minute before his capture, Pepperland's elderly Lord Mayor sends Old Fred, an aging sailor (whom the mayor calls \\"Young Fred\\"), to get help; he runs to the Yellow Submarine and takes off in it (\\"Yellow Submarine\\"). Old Fred travels to Liverpool (\\"Eleanor Rigby\\"), where he follows the depressed and aimless Ringo and persuades him to return to Pepperland with him. Ringo collects his \\"mates\\" John, George, and finally Paul in The Pier, a house-like building on the top of a hill. The five journey back to Pepperland in the yellow submarine. As they start learning to operate the submarine, they sing \\"All Together Now\\", after which they pass through several regions on their way to Pepperland:  Sea of Time â where time flows both forwards and backwards to the tune of \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\". At one point, the submarine passes itself as it loops through time. Sea of Science â where they sing \\"Only a Northern Song\\". Just before the song finishes, they pick up a monster. Sea of Monsters â The monster is ejected into a sea inhabited by other weird monsters. Ringo presses the panic button on the submarine, ejecting him from the submarine and into the sea.

When Sue Walters was diagnosed with leukaemia, she hoped that the best of medical science would be used to cure it. What she could never have anticipated was that her life would be saved by an 18-year-old boy from a remote German village. Sue’s only chance of survival was a stem cell transplant — previously known as a bone marrow transplant. ‘What Nicola has done is amazing — it really is a gift of life. If I hadn’t had the transplant, it was unlikely I’d have lived beyond three months,' said Sue Walters of her donor Nicola Gerber. This would give her a new, stronger immune system to destroy the cancerous cells in her blood. No one in her family matched her tissue type, so doctors searched the worldwide donor register — and found Nicola Gerber, a student from Mechern, near the French border. He had recently registered as a stem cell donor, and was the perfect match. Thanks to Nicola, Sue has made a full recovery. The two began writing to each other a year after the transplant and recently met for the first time when Nicola flew from Germany to see Sue. ‘What Nicola has done is amazing — it really is a gift of life,’ says Sue, who broke down in tears when he walked into the room. ‘If I hadn’t had the transplant, it was unlikely I’d have lived beyond three months.’ Sue’s husband Humphrey, her son Mark and daughter-in-law Maria were all there to show their enormous gratitude. ‘What’s remarkable is for a young guy like this to have the social awareness to do something like that,’ says Humphrey. For Nicola the reward is seeing Sue in good health. ‘She looks so well and so happy,’ he says. ‘It’s a good feeling.’ The story behind his decision to donate is extraordinary. In 2011, a man in his village was diagnosed with leukaemia and needed a stem cell transplant. ‘Half the village — about 300 people — got checked to see if they were a match and one was found,’ says Nicola, now 21 and studying engineering. ‘I registered and though I wasn’t a match, three months later I got a letter saying there was another person who needed my cells. ‘I was told it was a lady from England. I was happy to help,’ he says. Sue, 74, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) — aggressive cancer of the white blood cells — in July 2011 after a blood test showed up abnormalities. About 2,600 people in Britain are diagnosed with this form of leukaemia each year. It’s most common in the over 60s. ‘She looks so well and so happy. It’s a good feeling,' said Nicola. ‘The diagnosis was a huge shock,’ says Sue, who lives in West London and has two children, Claudia and Mark, and three grandchildren. ‘I wanted to know if I was going to die and my doctor said: “Do not go and Google this.” To this day I have never looked.’ She adds: ‘Initially, I did cry, but soon I thought: “I’ve got to get a grip on this.” I never asked about my prognosis. I had complete confidence in the wonderful doctors and nurses. 'It’s only since the transplant that I’ve realised how close to death I was.’ Sue began two courses of chemotherapy, each involving a five-week hospital stay. Her doctor explained that while they could control her cancer with chemotherapy, the only cure was the transplant. Stem cells are ‘master’ cells that can develop into a variety of different cells — those in the bone marrow turn into blood cells. These play a crucial role in the immune system, and in leukaemia, all these cells become abnormal, says Dr Mike Potter, consultant haematologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital and the London Clinic, who treated Sue. ‘Chemotherapy can reduce the cancer, but it can’t destroy it completely. In a stem cell transplant, cells travel to the centre of the bones and start making new blood cells able to fight the cancer that’s left over from the chemo.’ Essentially, the patient’s blood and immune system is replaced by the donor’s. During Sue’s second course of chemotherapy, she was told a donor had been found. ‘I was just told it was a young German boy of 18 and that was a bit of a strange thought,’ says Sue, who works for her husband, a motivational speaker and performance coach in business and sport. About 2,000 people in Britain need a stem cell transplant for leukaemia and lymphoma — cancers of the blood — and other blood disorders, such as sickle cell anaemia. Often, it is their last hope of survival. Patients can receive a stem cell transplant only from someone who matches their tissue type or else the body rejects it, says Dr Potter. ‘There are 22 million volunteers in the world and, for every patient, there are usually just one or two donors who match and sometimes none,’ he says. Around a million Britons are registered as stem cell donors, but there’s a desperate need for more. Only 60 per cent of patients in need of a transplant find the best possible match, according to the charity Anthony Nolan. There is a particular shortage of young, male donors and those of ethnic minority. 'It’s only since the transplant that I’ve realised how close to death I was,’ said Sue. It’s possible to perform a stem cell transplant using a donor who is a less-than-perfect match, but the risks of rejection are higher. Stem cells used to be collected via a needle into the bone marrow, an operation involving a general anaesthetic, which caused considerable pain for days afterwards. Now they can be taken from the blood without an anaesthetic. Before donating his cells Nicola had to inject himself in the stomach twice a day for three days with a drug that stimulates stem cells to come out from the bone marrow and into the blood. ‘It didn’t hurt, but it’s uncomfortable when you feel the stem cells coming out — like a pressure in my chest and back,’ he says. He then travelled to a hospital in Frankfurt to have cells harvested during a three-hour procedure. Blood was removed via a tube into his arm and into a machine, which removed the stem cells before the blood was returned to a tube in his other arm. About ten to 15 litres of blood were removed, then returned. Nicola says it was painless, and while some donors feel very tired afterwards, he felt fine. His cells were flown straight to London — the transplant must be done within 48 hours as the cells have a lifespan of only 72 hours. Sue was prepared with high-dose chemotherapy to wipe out her immune system so her body would accept the new cells. Though her donor was a perfect match, the transplant still carried a 20 per cent risk of her dying, due to infection or rejection of the cells. The transplant on November 25, 2011 was just like a blood trans-fusion, says Sue. ‘I did have terrible pain in my back for about a week after, which I was told was my body fighting the new stem cells.’ It takes three weeks for the donor immune system to start working, and with her own immune system in decline, Sue was kept in hospital. 'She was discharged on Christmas Eve, feeling ‘very weak’. Gradually, her new immune system started to fight the leukaemia. By the summer, Sue’s strength had returned and she now feels extremely well. It’s not until after five years that you can say someone is ‘cured’ — but at three years, Sue is ‘in a very good position’, says Dr Potter. She still takes antiviral and antibiotic drugs as a precaution. A year after the transplant, she received a letter through the London Clinic from Nicola, though their names couldn’t be revealed to each other until two years had passed (to avoid distress for the donor and recipient). ‘It was a very sweet letter,’ she says. ‘He just said: “I’m really glad to help you.” ’ They exchanged Christmas cards and then decided to meet. ‘I’d wanted to know where my stem cells had gone,’ says Nicola. ‘I wanted to know if it worked.’ He says the decision to donate was a simple one. ‘If you have the chance to help someone, you should do it,’ he says.

In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer is:","output":"Adult albatrosses can lose 2.9 ounces a day of weight from their body weight during the process of incubation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: Ecology is the study of ecosystems. An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the human population have raised many important ecological issues.  and the situation: Scientists studied two island. One with an old ecosystem named Old island, and the other with a newly formed and forming ecosystem named New island. Both islands were inhabited, Old island being heavily inhabited.  Answer the following question: Which island had a more favorable amount of rainfall for new ecosystems? A:","output":"Based on the given information, it is not explicitly mentioned which island - Old or New island - has a more favorable amount of rainfall for new ecosystems. However, considering that New island has a newly formed and forming ecosystem, it could be inferred that the current amount of rainfall in New island might be more favorable for the development of new ecosystems as it is still in the process of formation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: In March 2012, researchers in the United States announce that they have developed the first wirelessly controlled device that can supply a drug directly into the body. A small chip is implanted under the skin. It contains the medicine, which it releases at preset times. The developers say the device could improve the lives of millions of people who take medicine for long-term illnesses. A company called MicroCHIPS began developing the device about fifteen years ago. Last month, the company released the results of its first successful tests in humans. The tests took place in Denmark with seven women with osteoporosis.  Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and break easily. The disorder is common among older people, especially women. Many patients have to give themselves daily injections of medicine. One type of treatment requires injections for two years. Robert farra is the president of MicroCHIPS. He says many patients stop taking the medicine because of the pain and stress of the injections and that only twenty-five percent of the patients will go through the entire twenty-four months of treatment. The microchip is a few centimeters long. It has small sections that each hold a single dose of medicine. Mr. Farra says the device has to be programmed with the times to release the drug and that doctors will be able to reprogram the device from a computer or even a cell phone.  The seven women in the study were aged sixty-five to seventy. The researchers say the implants were just as effective as daily injections. And they say the dosage amounts were more exact than patients often give themselves. The microchips in the study held only twenty doses of medicine. Mr. Farra and his team are now designing a version that could hold a full year's worth of medicine. Robert Farra says, \\"The new version may take us two years, and then we may be required to do two additional trials, taking about four years before the device is available on the commercial scale.\\" Question: Which is NOT the advantage of the device? - It can release exact amount of medicine. - It can free patients the pain and stress of injections. - it held only twenty doses of medicine. - It is as effective as daily injections.

Q:U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Lindsey Graham have joined a growing chorus of Republican leaders to disavow comments by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about the Mexican heritage of a judge in a class-action lawsuit against Trump University. Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \\"I regret those comments he made.

In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \\"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States. Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \\"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\\" he said. The backlash appears to be mounting against the candidate, who has repeatedly said he believes U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case charging Trump with fraud.

He then grabs a nearby rod that is positively charged and moves it near the knob of the electroscope. Fascinated he sees the leaves of the electroscope move apart from each other.  and a hint : Similar to the results of a negatively charged rod, if a positively charged rod is brought near the knob of a neutral electroscope, it will attract some electrons up from the leaves onto the knob. That process causes both of the leaves to be positively charged (excess protons), and the leaves will diverge. If the positively charged rob is actually touched to the knob, the rob will remove some electrons and then when the rob is removed, the electroscope will remain positively charged. This is a permanent positive charge.  Please answer this question : Given the rod was negatively charged when it touched the neutral electroscope, would the electroscope have a positive or negative charge? A:","output":"If the rod was negatively charged when it touched the neutral electroscope, the electroscope would have a negative charge. The reason for this is that a negatively charged rod, when brought close to the neutral electroscope, will repel electrons away from the knob and down to the leaves, due to the like charges repelling each other.  When the negatively charged rod is touching the knob, electrons from the rod will transfer to the electroscope, as objects with opposite or different amounts of charge will try to reach an equilibrium state by sharing charges. In this case, since the rod has an excess of electrons (negative charge), it will transfer some electrons to the electroscope. When the negatively charged rod is removed from the electroscope, the transferred electrons will remain in the electroscope, leading to an excess of electrons and resulting in the electroscope having a negative charge. The negatively charged leaves will repel each other and diverge, similar to the situation when a positively charged rod is brought near the electroscope."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The monks raise the child, and Marcelino grows into a rowdy young boy. He has been warned by the monks not to visit the monastery attic, where a supposed bogeyman lives, but he ventures upstairs anyway, sees the bogeyman and tears off back down the stairs. At a festival, Marcelino causes havoc when he accidentally lets some animals loose, and the new local mayor, a blacksmith whom the monks would not let adopt Marcelino because of his coarse behaviour, uses the incident as an excuse to try to shut down the monastery. Given the silent treatment by the monks, Marcelino gathers up the courage to once again enter the attic, where he sees not a bogeyman, but a beautiful statue of Christ on the Cross. Remarking that the statue looks hungry, Marcelino steals some bread and wine and offers it to the statue, which comes to life, descends from the Cross, and eats and drinks what the boy has brought him. The statue becomes Marcelino's best friend and confidant, and begins to give him religious instruction. For his part, Marcelino realizes that the statue is Christ. The monks know something is strange when they notice bread and wine disappearing, and arrange to spy on Marcelino. One day, the statue notices that Marcelino is pensive and brooding instead of happy, and tells him that he would like to reward his kindness. Marcelino answers: \\"I want only to see my mother, and to see Yours after that\\". The statue cradles Marcelino in its arms, tells Marcelino to sleep - and Marcelino dies happy.

Question: Information:  - The River Severn (Welsh: \\"Afon Hafren\\", Latin: \\"Sabrina\\") is the longest river in the United Kingdom, at about . It rises at an altitude of on Plynlimon, close to the Ceredigion/Powys border near Llanidloes, in the Cambrian Mountains of mid Wales. It then flows through Shropshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, with the county towns of Shrewsbury, Worcester and Gloucester on its banks. With an average discharge of at Apperley, Gloucestershire, the Severn is the greatest river in terms of water flow in England and Wales.  - Shrewsbury (or ) is the county town of Shropshire, England. It is on the River Severn and has a population of approximately 72,000.  - Aston Pigott is a hamlet approximately 12 miles west of Shrewsbury within the parish of Worthen and Shelve . The current population stands at around 50 . The hamlet is situated on a small rise giving many of the properties an outstanding view across the Rea Brook valley to the Stiperstones . It contains three working farms that are mainly dairy and lamb farms . The hamlet is served primarily by Worthen which is 1 mile to the west . It adjoins Aston Rogers . The name Aston Pigott probably evolved from East Tun or Town and from the name of the Picot family of Norman descent . In 1180 Ralph Fitz Picot was granted lands by the Corbets , and it was Ralph 's descendants , notably Robert Pigot in 1255 followed by Howel Pigot who established the modern village name . Mains water arrived in 1947 and mains electricity in 1948 .  - Shropshire (or ; alternatively Salop; abbreviated, in print only, Shrops; demonym Salopian ) is a county located between West Midlands in England and Wales. It borders Powys and Wrexham in Wales to the west and north-west, Cheshire to the north, Staffordshire to the east, Worcestershire to the south-east and Herefordshire to the south. Shropshire Council was created in 2009, a unitary authority taking over from the previous county council and five district councils. The borough of Telford and Wrekin has been a separate unitary authority since 1998 but continues to be included in the ceremonial county.  - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish.  - The name Rea Brook can refer to either of two brooks (a local term for a small river) in Shropshire, England.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Worthen is a village in Shropshire, England approximately 13 miles west of Shrewsbury. The village forms part of the Worthen with Shelve civil parish, which includes the hamlet of Little Worthen immediately to the north-east and the villages of Brockton and Pennerley, in addition to several smaller settlements. It sits in the Rea Brook valley. To the south are the Stiperstones and the Bromlow Callow, known for the small clump of trees on top. To the north is Long Mountain.  - The Stiperstones is a distinctive hill in the county of Shropshire, England. It is a quartzite ridge formed some 480 million years ago. During the last Ice Age the summit stood out above the glaciers and was subject to constant freezing and thawing which shattered the quartzite into a mass of jumbled scree surrounding several residual rocky tors. At above sea level it is the second-highest hill in the county, surpassed only by Brown Clee Hill.

Brand management: Dr Pepper Ten is a 10-calorie soft drink Dr Pepper Snapple Group is rolling out on Monday with a macho ad campaign. Dudes don't drink diet. Or at least that's the idea behind Dr Pepper Ten, a 10-calorie soft drink Dr Pepper Snapple Group is rolling out on Monday with a macho ad campaign that proclaims ‘It's not for women.’ The soft drink was developed after the company's research found that men shy away from diet drinks that aren't perceived as ‘manly’ enough. To appeal to men, Dr Pepper made its Ten drink 180 degrees different than Diet Dr Pepper. It has calories and sugar unlike its diet counterpart. Instead of the dainty tan bubbles on the diet can, Ten will be wrapped in gunmetal grey packaging with silver bullets. And while Diet Dr Pepper's marketing is women-friendly, the ad campaign for Ten goes out of its way to eschew women. For instance, there's a Dr Pepper Ten Facebook page for men only. And TV commercials are heavy on the machismo, including one spot that shows muscular men in the jungle battling snakes and bad guys and appear to shoot lasers at each other. ‘Hey ladies. Enjoying the film? Of course not. Because this is our movie and this is our soda,’ a man says as he attempts to pour the soda into a glass during a bumpy ATV ride. ‘You can keep the romantic comedies and lady drinks. We're good.’ Dr Pepper Ten is not the first diet soda aimed at men. (Think: Coke Zero and Pepsi Max.) But it’s the first ad campaign to be so overt about courting men who want to drink a soda with fewer calories. The ads come at a time when overall sales in the 74billon soft drink industry are slowing as more Americans buy healthier options like juice and bottled water. Volume has fallen from slightly over 10 billion cases in 2005 to 9.4 billion cases in 2010, according to Beverage Digest data. ‘Regular sugared soft drinks have declined in recent years, and some consumers have taste issues with some of the diet sodas,’ said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. Dr Pepper said men, in particular, are dissatisfied with the taste and image of diet drinks. The company wouldn't disclose the formula of Dr Pepper Ten, but said that the drink has 10 calories and 2 grams of sugar, which gives it a sweeter taste. Dr Pepper said there are 23 flavours in. its regular soda, (which has 150 calories and 27 grams of sugar per can) and Dr Pepper Ten contains all of them. Interesting approach: It's not often that a major brand tries to block out an entire segment of the population, but that's exactly what Dr Pepper is doing with the launch of its latest product, Dr Pepper Ten. The company, which declined to give figures for how much was spent on the campaign, also worked hard to craft a macho message. 'One topic people never tire of talking or arguing about is differences between men and women, particularly if women are excluded. That will always get someone's attention' Deborah MitchellUniversity of Wisconsin. The company said ads for Dr Pepper Ten will air on all major networks, FX and ESPN during college football games. A Facebook page for the drink contains an application that allows it to exclude women from viewing content, which includes games and videos aimed at being ‘manly.’ For instance, there's a shooting gallery where you shoot things like high heels and lipstick. There is also a ‘man quiz’ with questions on activities like fishing and hunting. ‘One topic people never tire of talking or arguing about is differences between men and women, particularly if women are excluded,’ said brand expert Deborah Mitchell. 'Regular sugared soft drinks have declined in recent years, and some consumers have taste issues with some of the diet sodas' John SicherBeverage Digest. ‘That will always get someone's attention,’ added Ms Mitchell, executive director for the Center for Brand and Product Management at the University of Wisconsin School of Business. As for whether the ads will resonate with men remains to be seen. Paul McDonald, 25, who works in green energy contracts in Berkley, California, says he drinks soda labelled ‘diet’ and doesn't think there is any stigma attached. ‘No one has ever made fun of me for drinking a Diet Coke, and I'm on a rugby team - we make fun of each other for everything,’ he said. 'Women get the joke. \\"Is this really for men or really for women?” is a way to start the conversation that can spread and get people engaged in the product' Jim TrebilcockDr Pepper. And women? Jim Trebilcock, executive vice president of marketing for Dr Pepper, said he's not worried that they'll be offended by the campaign. The drink and marketing were tested in six different markets across the country before being rolled out nationally, and women weren't offended, he said. In fact, about 40 per cent of people who have tried the soda so far are women. ‘Women get the joke,’ he said. ‘“Is this really for men or really for women?” is a way to start the conversation that can spread and get people engaged in the product.’ See video here.

The critic consesnsus is: Despite boasting a stellar cast, Fireflies in the Garden is just tedious, dull and predictable melodrama. Instantly forgettable.. What reviews supported this critic consensus?","output":"The critic consensus on \\"Fireflies in the Garden\\" points to the film's tiresome, monotonous, and predictable nature, despite the presence of an impressive ensemble. A number of notable reviews have shared similar viewpoints, revealing agreement among critics on the film's shortcomings. 1. A.O. Scott of The New York Times: In his review, Scott observes that the film's narrative falls into a predictable pattern and the characters are underdeveloped. According to Scott, the failure to evoke audience empathy is particularly unfortunate given the film's talented ensemble, which ends up being underutilized. 2. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian: Bradshaw offers a critical review of \\"Fireflies in the Garden,\\" comparing it to a soap opera in terms of melodramatic content. He notes that, although the cast is impressive, their performances are stifled by the unrealistic dialogue and disjointed narrative. 3. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times: Ebert's review of the film further reinforces the critic consensus. He acknowledges the potential of the high-caliber cast but states that their talents are wasted on a trite screenplay. Ebert also sees the film's plot as too familiar and offers little to make it stand out from other family dramas. 4. Tim Robey of The Telegraph: Robey's review highlights the miscasting of certain characters as contributing to the film's downfalls. He explains that while the ensemble is strong, the film's writing pales in comparison, resulting in a severe imbalance between the actors' capabilities and the underwhelming material they are given to work with. 5. Claudia Puig of USA Today: Puig criticizes the film's unconvincing family dynamics, remarking that the actors, despite their talent, were unable to rescue the poorly penned and implausible relationships presented in the film. She also notes that the film's predictable storylines do little to leave a lasting impression. 6. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune: Phillips draws attention to the fact that \\"Fireflies in the Garden\\" does not live up to its potential, given its A-list cast. The film is criticized for being underwhelming and unmemorable, largely due to its overemphasis on melodrama and heavy-handed approach to storytelling. In summary, while many critics acknowledged the film's potential due to its outstanding cast, consistent criticisms regarding the lackluster narrative, weak dialogue, and underdeveloped characters have led to the film's widespread dismissal as a forgettable and predictable melodrama."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: how does the mls schedule work I found the following answer on Google: The league's closed membership makes it one of the world's few soccer leagues not using promotion and relegation . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, the answer provided does not directly explain how the MLS schedule works but rather mentions that the league has a closed membership system without promotion or relegation. Let me explain the MLS schedule for you. Step 1: Understand the structure of MLS Major League Soccer (MLS) is a professional soccer league in the United States and Canada with currently 27 teams (24 from the United States and 3 from Canada). Step 2: Divide the teams into conferences The league is divided into two conferences: the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference. Step 3: Regular season schedule Each team plays a total of 34 games during the regular season, which typically starts in late February and ends in October. The schedule includes a mix of both home and away games. Matches are scheduled primarily against teams within their own conference, but also they play few games against teams from the other conference. Step 4: Scheduling considerations MLS aims to minimize travel time between locations for teams, which is why the majority of matches are scheduled within the same conference. Furthermore, the league also considers factors such as stadium availability, team preferences, and potential weather-related issues while creating the schedule. Step 5: Postseason and MLS Cup At the end of the regular season, the top seven teams from each conference qualify for the postseason playoffs, which take place in November and December. The playoff is a knockout-style competition leading to the final match, known as the MLS Cup, where the Eastern Conference Champion and Western Conference Champion play for the league title. In conclusion, the MLS schedule is based on a regular season with 34 games per team followed by playoffs for top teams within each conference and concludes with the MLS Cup to determine the league champion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Randy's health was being examined by Robert because","output":"Randy had been experiencing a series of unusual symptoms lately. These included persistent fatigue, unexplained weight loss, frequent episodes of dizziness, and occasional sharp pains in his abdomen. Worried about these symptoms, Randy had approached his close friend, Robert, who happened to be a well-qualified and experienced physician, to help him gain insights into his current health condition. Robert, being a genuine individual, kindly agreed to assess Randy's health without any second thoughts. To begin his examination, Robert asked Randy a series of questions to determine his recent medical history and if any possible genetic factors could be contributing to Randy's symptoms. Randy recalled that his father had undergone bypass surgery a decade ago and his mother, albeit active, was managing her type 2 diabetes with medications. Robert noted this information and proceeded to conduct a series of non-invasive tests in his clinic to get a better understanding of Randy's health. He started with vital sign assessments, such as measuring Randy's blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature. This was followed by a comprehensive physical examination to check for any abnormalities, carefully evaluating the lymph nodes, the abdomen, the medical eye, ear, and throat regions, and looking for any unusual skin or joint issues. After the basic examinations, Robert obtained a blood sample from Randy to be sent to the laboratory for a complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). These tests would allow him to assess Randy's heart health for any signs of anemia, inflammation, and kidney function decline, as well as his glucose levels, electrolyte balance, and liver enzymes. He also ordered a lipid panel that would provide an overview of Randy's cholesterol and triglyceride levels. With the lab results, Robert wanted to ensure he checked for hormonal imbalances and other irregularities, such as hypothyroidism or cortisol deficiencies. So, he asked the lab to perform a thyroid function test and measure Randy's cortisol levels. Robert then assessed Randy's cardiovascular health by conducting a stress test. This involved monitoring Randy's heart rate and blood pressure while he exercised on a treadmill to detect any possible abnormalities in how his heart responded to physical activity. To supplement this, he performed an electrocardiogram (EKG) to ascertain if Randy's heart had any irregular electrical activity or rhythm. As a part of the in-depth examination, Robert also wanted to ensure that Randy's dizziness and balance issues weren't stemming from an inner ear problem. Consequently, he sent Randy to an audiologist for a hearing test and a vestibular assessment. Once Robert had collected all the test results, he went through the data meticulously to understand the root cause of Randy's symptoms. He noticed that the lab data showed Randy had elevated fasting glucose levels and an increased HbA1c, which pointed towards possible prediabetes. Furthermore, his lipid panel suggested borderline high cholesterol levels. In light of these findings, Robert scheduled a follow-up appointment with Randy to discuss the test results and recommend a course of action. He reinforced the importance of a healthy lifestyle, encompassing a well-balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management to mitigate the risk of developing full-blown diabetes and cardiovascular issues. He also referred Randy to a nutritionist to help him make informed dietary choices and keep his prediabetic state in check. Throughout the entire process, Robert was extremely professional and compassionate, ensuring Randy's comfort and understanding at every juncture. The thorough examination and guidance provided by Robert was invaluable in helping Randy gain clarity about his health and take proactive steps towards a healthier future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Since ( p(0) = 0 ), we can write ( p(x) ) as ( p(x) = xq(x) ) where ( q(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n-1 ) with integer coefficients. 3. Given that ( p(a_i) = n ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ), we have:    [    a_i q(a_i) = n quad text{for} quad i = 1, 2, ldots, n    ]    This implies that ( a_i ) divides ( n ) for each ( i ). 4.

However, since we are looking for a line parallel to x+2y-3=0 and passing through the intersection point, the exact coordinates of the intersection point are not necessary for the final equation of the desired line. 2. **Determine the Slope of the Parallel Line**: The line parallel to x+2y-3=0 will have the same slope. The slope-intercept form of a line is y=mx+b, where m is the slope. For the line x+2y-3=0, we can rewrite it as 2y=-x+3, or y=-frac{1}{2}x+frac{3}{2}. Thus, the slope (m) is -frac{1}{2}. 3. **Formulate the Equation of the Parallel Line**: Since the desired line is parallel to x+2y-3=0, it will have the form x+2y+c=0, where c is a constant that we need to determine. Given that the line must pass through the intersection of the first two lines, we can use the property that two lines are parallel if their coefficients of x and y are proportional. The line x+2y-3=0 can be rewritten to match the form of the coefficients in the given solution, which is 3x+6y-9=0.

Extend the triangle A M B to form a parallelogram by doubling the median M C_1. In this configuration:    [    2 A M^2 + 2 B M^2 = A B^2 + 4 M C^2_{1} > A B^2    ] 5. Here, ( M C_1 ) is half the length of ( AB ) because ( C_1 ) is the midpoint. 6. The length of the median can be expressed as:    [    A M = frac{2}{3} m_a quad text{and} quad B M = frac{2}{3} m_b    ] 7. This yields:    [    2 left(frac{4}{9} m_a^2right) + 2 left(frac{4}{9} m_b^2 right) > c^2    ] 8. We can rewrite it as:    [    frac{8}{9} (m_a^2 + m_b^2) > c^2    ] 9. Solving to isolate m_a^2 + m_b^2:    [    m_a^2 + m_b^2 > frac{9}{8} c^2    ] 10. Therefore:     [     boxed{m_a^2 + m_b^2 > frac{9}{8} c^2}     ] The above steps and conclusion demonstrate the required inequality."},{"instruction":"Ten percent less than twice the total number of students present in the science class yesterday have attended class today.

Hence, the speed of service is crucial. Recent research conducted by employees of the Higher School of Economics (HSE) has shown that the service speed of cashless payments is slower compared to cash payments. For instance, \\"the average cash checkout time for a customer is 1.8 minutes, whereas the average cashless checkout time is 2.2 minutes\\" ([source](https://www.hse.ru/data/2012/11/21/1248588763/)). For large companies, time expenses for customer service (and related expenses such as labor costs, for example) can be a significant argument in favor of preferring cash transactions. 2. **Cost of Handling Transactions**:      The cost of handling cash turnover might be substantially lower for large companies compared to the expenses associated with card acquiring. For customers, the cost of goods does not depend on the payment method: whether it is a bank card or cash. However, when customers of retail networks pay for their purchases with bank cards, the expenses related to the payment of a trading concession are practically deducted from the company’s income. Additionally, if a customer returns a product to the store, the commission amount that the company paid to the banks is not refunded. 3. **Risk of Fraud**:      The risk of fraud with bank cards, such as unlawful payments or thefts from bank cards, remains quite high. Part of the costs associated with this risk must be borne by the retail networks. Therefore, large retail networks can reduce these costs by preferring cash payments with customers. # Conclusion: The above arguments demonstrate why companies might prefer cash payment methods.

Let ( x ) and ( y ) be complex numbers such that (frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}) are integers for some four consecutive positive integers ( n ). We need to prove that (frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}) is an integer for all positive integers ( n ). 2. Define the sequence ( a_n = frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} ). Notice that ( a_n ) is a polynomial in ( x ) and ( y ) with integer coefficients. Specifically, ( a_n ) is the sum of the first ( n ) terms of a geometric series:    [    a_n = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + cdots + y^{n-1}    ] 3. Given that ( a_n ) is an integer for four consecutive values of ( n ), say ( n = k, k+1, k+2, k+3 ), we need to show that ( a_n ) is an integer for all ( n ). 4. Consider the recurrence relation for ( a_n ). We know that:    [    a_{n+2} = (x + y)a_{n+1} - xya_n    ]    This can be derived from the properties of the roots of the characteristic polynomial associated with the sequence. 5.

Since ( a_{k+2} ) and ( a_{k+3} ) are integers, and ( a_k ) and ( a_{k+1} ) are integers, it follows that ( b ) and ( c ) must be rational numbers.  8. Suppose ( b ) and ( c ) are rational numbers. Let ( b = frac{p}{q} ) and ( c = frac{r}{s} ) where ( p, q, r, s ) are integers and ( gcd(p, q) = 1 ), ( gcd(r, s) = 1 ). 9. Since ( a_n ) is an integer for four consecutive values of ( n ), the recurrence relation implies that ( b ) and ( c ) must be integers. This is because any rational number that satisfies the recurrence relation with integer initial conditions must itself be an integer. 10. Therefore, ( b ) and ( c ) are integers. Since ( b = x + y ) and ( c = xy ), it follows that ( x ) and ( y ) are roots of the monic polynomial ( t^2 - bt + c ) with integer coefficients. 11. Hence, ( x ) and ( y ) are algebraic integers. Since ( a_n ) is a polynomial in ( x ) and ( y ) with integer coefficients, and ( x ) and ( y ) are algebraic integers, it follows that ( a_n ) is an integer for all ( n ).

Thus, f(x) = 0 has no solution on (0, +infty). In summary, when f(x) in A_{2}, for any x in (0, +infty), f(x) < 0 holds.

Discuss the monotonicity of g(x) and determine whether it has any extreme values. If it does, find the extreme values.","output":"(1) From the given function, we have f'(x) = x^3 - ax. So when a = 1, f(2) = 2 and f'(2) = 6. Hence, the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point (2, f(2)) is y - 2 = 6(x - 2), which simplifies to 6x - y - 10 = 0. (2) Differentiating g(x) with respect to x, we get: g'(x) = (2x - 2)e^x + (x^2 - 2x + 2 - a)e^x - ef'(x) Simplifying, we get: g'(x) = (x^2 - a)(e^x - ex) Let h(x) = e^x - ex, then h'(x) = e^x - e. If we set h'(x) = 0, we get x = 1. When x in (-infty, 1), h'(x) < 0 and h(x) is decreasing. When x in (1, +infty), h'(x) > 0 and h(x) is increasing. Thus, when x = 1, h(x) is at a minimum, h_{min} = h(1) = 0. Therefore, for all x in mathbb{R}, h(x) geq 0. Now, if a leq 0, g'(x) = (x^2 - a)h(x) geq 0, so g(x) is increasing on (-infty, +infty), and has no extreme values. If a > 0, setting g'(x) = 0 gives us x = pm sqrt{a}. When x < -sqrt{a} or x > sqrt{a}, g'(x) = (x^2 - a)h(x) geq 0, so g(x) is increasing. When -sqrt{a} < x < sqrt{a}, g'(x) leq 0, so g(x) is decreasing. Thus, when x = -sqrt{a}, g(x) attains a maximum value of g(-sqrt{a}) = (2sqrt{a} + 2)e^{-sqrt{a}} + frac{e}{4}a^2. When x = sqrt{a}, g(x) attains a minimum value of g(sqrt{a}) = (-2sqrt{a} + 2)e^{sqrt{a}} + frac{e}{4}a^2. In conclusion, - When a leq 0, g(x) is increasing on (-infty, +infty) and has no extreme values. - When a > 0, g(x) is increasing on (-infty, -sqrt{a}) and (sqrt{a}, +infty), and decreasing on (-sqrt{a}, sqrt{a}).

Thus, for any group of three consecutive students, there must be at least one liar.

So we can write: 0.60M + (percentage of women who speak French) = 40%  (2) We are told that 76.36% of the women do not speak French, which means that 100% - 76.36% = 23.64% of the women do speak French. Since W is the percentage of women in the company, the percentage of the total employees who are women that speak French is 0.2364W. We can now update equation (2) with this information: 0.60M + 0.2364W = 40%  (3) Now we have two equations with two unknowns (M and W): M + W = 100%  (1) 0.60M + 0.2364W = 40%  (3) We can solve this system of equations to find the value of M (the percentage of men in the company). First, let's solve equation (1) for W: W = 100% - M  (4) Now we can substitute equation (4) into equation (3): 0.60M + 0.2364(100% - M) = 40% Expanding the equation: 0.60M + 23.64% - 0.2364M = 40% Combining like terms: 0.60M - 0.2364M = 40% - 23.64% 0.3636M = 16.36% Now, divide both sides by 0.3636 to solve for M: M = 16.36% / 0.3636 M ≈ 45% Therefore, the percentage of men in the company is approximately boxed{45%} ."},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

For point G, since |overrightarrow{BG}| = frac{sqrt{19}}{3} and overrightarrow{BG} = frac{1}{3}(overrightarrow{BA} + overrightarrow{BC}), we can calculate the square of the vector overrightarrow{BG} as follows: |overrightarrow{BG}|^2 = left(frac{1}{3}(overrightarrow{BA} + overrightarrow{BC})right)^2 = frac{1}{9}(a^2 + c^2 + 2a cdot c cdot cos B) = frac{1}{9}(4 + a^2 + 4a).

Applying the cosine rule gives us b, and finally, the sine rule yields the value of sin A.

A remarkable number is defined to be a number that can be expressed as the sum of 2023 natural composite numbers.  To solve the problem, we denote this integer by ( n ): 1. Let us generalize the problem and solve it for any ( n geq 2 ). We hypothesize that the number ( 4n + 3 ) is not remarkable. Specifically, we aim to prove the following: # Proof:  Statement 1: The number ( 4n + 3 ) is not remarkable. 2. We begin by noting that ( 4n + 3 ) is an odd number. Therefore, in any sum of ( n ) natural composite numbers that equals ( 4n + 3 ), there must be at least one odd composite summand.  3. The smallest odd composite number is 9, while the smallest even composite number is 4. Thus, any sum of ( n ) composite numbers that includes at least one odd composite number must exceed ( 4n + 3 ). Let us examine the minimum such sum:          [     sum = 9 + 4(n-1)     ]     4. We then compute:         [     9 + 4(n-1) = 9 + 4n - 4 = 4n + 5     ]     5. Notice that:     [     4n + 5 > 4n + 3      ] 6. Hence, we conclude that ( 4n + 3 ) cannot be written as the sum of ( n ) composite numbers, thus proving it is not a remarkable number.  Statement 2: Any natural number greater than ( 4n + 3 ) is remarkable. 7. Now, we prove that any number ( a > 4n + 3 ) is remarkable. We address two cases:     8. **Case 1:** When ( a ) is even. Suppose:          [     a = 4n + 4 + b     ]     9. Here, it can be written as:          [     a = (4n - 4 + 8) + underbrace{4 + 4 + cdots + 4}_{n-1 text{ times}}     ]     10. Where ( 4 geq 8 ) is a composite and ( b ) is a composite number. 11. **Case 2:** When ( a ) is odd. Suppose:          [     a = 4n + 1 + c     ]      12. Here, it can be written as:     [     a = 9 + (4n - 8 + 8) + underbrace{4 + 4 + cdots + 4}_{n-2 text{ times}}     ] 13. Where ( c geq 4 ) is some composite number.  14.

Given (7^2 = 49), we have:    [    49 equiv 9 pmod{10}    ]    Thus,    [    7^{1990} equiv 9 pmod{10}    ]    This indicates that the last digit of (7^{1990}) is 9. 3. **Properties of (t^{1988}) Last Digit for Any Integer (t)**: For any integer (t), the last digit of (t^4) can only be one of: (0, 1, 5, 6). This can be validated by calculating the fourth power of numbers from 0 to 9 and observing the last digits:    [    begin{aligned}    0^4 & = 0,     1^4 & = 1,     2^4 & = 16 equiv 6,     3^4 & = 81 equiv 1,     4^4 & = 256 equiv 6,     5^4 & = 625 equiv 5,     6^4 & = 1296 equiv 6,     7^4 & = 2401 equiv 1,     8^4 & = 4096 equiv 6,     9^4 & = 6561 equiv 1.    end{aligned}    ] 4. **Implication for (m^{1988}, n^{1988}, r^{1988})**    [    t^{1988} = (t^4)^{497}    ]    Therefore, the last digit of (m^{1988}, n^{1988}, r^{1988}) must be one of (0, 1, 5, 6). 5. **Contradiction in Sum Last Digit**: Given that each (m^{1988}, n^{1988}, r^{1988}) ends in (0, 1, 5, text{ or } 6), consider all possible sums:    [    begin{aligned}       0+0+0 &= 0,        0+0+1 &= 1,        0+0+5 &= 5,        0+0+6 &= 6,        vdots        6+6+6 &= 18 equiv 8 pmod{10}    end{aligned}    ]    None of these cases give a last digit of 9. Since we are working modulo 10, the sum of three numbers with last digits (0, 1, 5, 6) cannot be 9. **Conclusion:** Hence, it is impossible for (m^{1988} + n^{1988} + r^{1988} = 7^{1990}) to hold true if (m, n, r) are integers.

Each row (horizontal line) on the chessboard contains a unique number of figures. Specifically, the possible configurations are such that one row contains exactly one figure, another row has exactly two figures, a third row has exactly three figures, and so on until the eighth row, which has exactly eight figures. This allows us to label the rows according to their figure count. 2. The goal is to select 8 figures such that each column (vertical line) and each row (horizontal line) contains exactly one marked figure. 3. We will start by identifying the unique configuration within each row:     1. **First row**: Since it contains exactly one figure, we mark that sole figure.     2. **Second row**: Contains exactly two figures. Out of these two figures, we need to mark one. We will select the figure which does not disrupt our goal of maintaining exactly one marked figure per column.     3. **Third row**: Contains exactly three figures. We need to choose one of them. This selection is made by ensuring that the choice does not interfere with columns marked in previous steps.     4. Continue this iterative marking for **fourth** to **eighth** rows. 4. Let us ensure that each step accounts for selecting a figure without conflicting with previously selected columns.     - Let A_i (where i in {1, 2, ldots, 8}) represent a set of figures in the i-th row identified by their specific columns.     - If A_1, A_2, ldots, A_8 are disjoint (no two selected figures share the same column), the objective is satisfied.     - Assume A_1 contains the column of one figure from the first row, A_2 must then avoid this column while picking one from the second row's two figures, and so on. 5. This method's success hinges on the distinctiveness of each row's figure count, ensuring that there is always at least one free column for marking. # Conclusion: By following this method, we ensure that each row and column will have exactly one of the marked eight figures without any form of overlap, thereby fulfilling the problem's requirement.

In an isosceles triangle, the area (A) can be expressed using the formula for the area of a triangle, (A = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}). The height (h) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in one of the two right triangles formed by the altitude as (h = sqrt{a^2 - left(frac{b}{2}right)^2}). Hence, (A = frac{1}{2} b sqrt{a^2 - left(frac{b}{2}right)^2}). 2. The semiperimeter (s) of the triangle is (frac{2a + b}{2} = a + frac{b}{2}). 3. We know from the properties of a triangle that the area (A) is also given by (A = rs), where (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. Solving for (r) gives (r = frac{A}{s}); substituting for (A) and (s), we find (r = frac{frac{1}{2} b sqrt{a^2 - left(frac{b}{2}right)^2}}{a + frac{b}{2}}). 4.

Now, we need to find out how many buckets George carries each round. Since George and Harry together take 22 rounds to fill the pool with 110 buckets, and we know Harry's contribution, we can calculate George's contribution per round by dividing the total number of buckets George carries by the number of rounds.
