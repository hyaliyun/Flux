Mary alleges that she's been suicidal and has resorted to self-medicate in an effort to handle the aftermath of their highly publicized (and highly contentious) divorce battle.

Given the context: Why did Jan do this? Possible answers: Have the money to buy it, add to the collection, burn the book The answer to this question is:","output":"Jan bought the new book from the library and put it on their shelf. To determine why Jan did this, let's analyze the possible answers step by step: 1. Have the money to buy it: It's possible that Jan had the money to buy the book, but that alone wouldn't justify why they put it on their shelf. People usually buy things they can afford, but the key is understanding why they used their money on a particular item. 2. Add to the collection: It is more likely that Jan bought the book and put it on their shelf to add it to their existing collection. People who are interested in reading or collecting books would typically store books on a shelf and expand their collection over time. This action indicates that Jan values books and wants to keep them. 3. Burn the book: This option doesn't make sense in this context, as there is no indication that Jan has any malicious intent. Buying a book just to burn it would be irrational, and adding it to the shelf suggests preservation rather than destruction. Given the information provided, it seems most logical to conclude that Jan bought the new book from the library and put it on their shelf to add it to their collection."},{"instruction":"Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Her husband, Nick, is devoted to her and their four-year-old son Matty. The family live in a beautiful home on the Pacific Northwest waterfront. When Nick scores yet another business triumph, he buys a yacht to celebrate. Leaving Matty with their friend Angie, who is a teacher at Matty's preschool, the couple set sail for a romantic weekend. But Libby drinks too much wine and passes out. When she wakes, she is covered in blood and Nick is gone. Dizzy and disoriented, she follows a trail of blood to the upper deck. Nick is not there but Libby sees a knife and picks it up. The lights of a Coast Guard boat flash and a voice orders Libby to drop the knife. A mayday was received from the Parsons' yacht. Libby is taken into custody but Nick has seemingly vanished. Tests reveal that the blood found on the yacht was the same type as Nick's. It is presumed that the couple had an argument and Libby attacked Nick. He managed to send a mayday alert before falling or being pushed overboard.Despite the fact that no body is found, Libby is charged with murder. No one believes her story, not even the sheriff who is a family friend. Frantic over what will happen to Matty if she is found guilty, Libby signs over custody to Angie. Nick had a large life insurance policy -- which police believe was the motive for his murder -- and Libby has the money put in Matty's name.The trial is swift and a jury finds Libby guilty. She is taken to a women's prison several hours away. At first Angie regularly brings Matty to visit. When they stop coming, Libby telephones Angie but the number is disconnected.

Jones played college football at the University of Pittsburgh where he finished seventh in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1941. Hypothesis: Edgar Francis Jones was not as good of a football player than the six others voted higher than him for the Heisman Trophy in 1941.","output":"Based on the given context, it is not possible to accurately draw the hypothesis that Edgar Francis Jones was not as good of a football player as the six others voted higher than him for the Heisman Trophy in 1941. The context provides information about Jones' career and achievements but does not provide enough information to compare his performance with those who were voted above him in the Heisman Trophy race that year. Moreover, using only Heisman Trophy voting as the sole criterion to determine a player's ability and talent may be flawed. There are several factors to consider when comparing football players, such as their individual stats, positions, and the impact they had on their team's overall performance. Additionally, the Heisman Trophy voting process itself is subjective, considering that it involves opinions from sportswriters and former winners. It is essential to gather more information about the individual performances, statistics, and contributions of Edgar Francis Jones and the six players ranked higher than him in 1941 Heisman Trophy to make a more concrete and accurate hypothesis. A more comprehensive analysis that takes into account their college career stats, achievements, and NFL performance would be necessary to determine if Jones was indeed not as good as the other six players. In conclusion, while the context provided gives an overview of Jones' accomplishments, it does not offer sufficient data to draw a reliable hypothesis about his ability compared to the six football players ranked above him in the 1941 Heisman Trophy voting.

The army fought in colonial engagements in China, Libya (19111912), northern Italy against the Austro-Hungarian Empire during World War I, Abyssinia before World War II, and in World War II in Albania, Greece, north Africa, Russia and Italy itself. During the Cold War the army prepared itself to defend against a Warsaw Pact invasion from the east. Since the end of the Cold War the army has seen extensive peacekeeping service and combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. - Alfonso Ferrero , Cavaliere La Marmora ( Italian pronunciation : ( alfnso la marmora ) ; November 18 , 1804 -- January 5 , 1878 ) was an Italian general and statesman .

Two of his brothers were Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora and Alberto Ferrero la Marmora, the naturalist. - The Royal Italian Army (Italian: \\"Regio Esercito Italiano\\") was the army of the Kingdom of Italy from the unification of Italy in 1861 to the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946. In World War II the Royal Army fought first as part of the Axis (193943) and then as part of the Allies (194345).

He was elder brother to Alessandro Ferrero La Marmora, soldier and founder of the Bersaglieri, and to Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora, Italian general and statesman. - The Bersaglieri (Marksmen in English) are a corps of the Italian Army originally created by General Alessandro La Marmora on 18 June 1836 to serve in the Army of the Kingdom of Sardinia, later to become the Royal Italian Army. They have always been a high-mobility light infantry unit, and can still be recognized by the distinctive wide brimmed hat that they wear (only in dress uniform in modern times), decorated with black capercaillie feathers. The feathers are usually applied to their combat helmets. Another distinctive trait of the Bersaglieri is the fast jog pace they keep on parades, instead of marching.

The school district superintendent invited him back Wednesday only after Walpole submitted a written commitment to focus more on diversity and sensitivity training, according to a statement. A high school football coach in Charleston, South Carolina, was fired after he permitted a post-game celebratory ritual involving a watermelon that some say is racist. After a parent reported the \\"watermelon ritual\\" to the school board, the Charleston County School District launched an investigation and ultimately fired Academic Magnet High School coach Bud Walpole, according to CNN affiliate WCSC. \\"Players would gather in a circle and smash the watermelon while others were either standing in a group or locking arms and making chanting sounds described as, 'Ooh, ooh, ooh,'\\" school district Superintendent Nancy McGinley said, describing the noises as \\"monkey sounds.\\" The watermelon was decorated with caricatures drawn with Sharpie markers, she added. Dot Scott, president of the Charleston branch of the NAACP, said the organization supported the school's decision to fire Walpole. Scott thanked the superintendent at a Wednesday press conference \\"for her swift attention to an inappropriate and racially insensitive ritual performed by the football team.\\" The school district has not yet responded to CNN's request for comment. A number of parents and students, however, are standing in support of Walpole, who coached at the school for 10 years. More than 4,000 people have signed a petition to reinstate the ousted coach, as of Wednesday afternoon. Some say they don't see the ritual as racist. \\"I just don't understand why the school district is concerned this is an issue,\\" Connie Biggs, the president of Academic Magnet's Booster Club told WCSC. \\"Is it because it's a watermelon? If it had been a pumpkin or a cantaloupe would that have been a different reaction from the district.\\" Harry Griffin, a junior at The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, said he has known Walpole for six years and considers the coach a man of integrity. Griffin played for Walpole's high school team as a fullback and nose guard. CNN first learned of this story through an iReport Griffin uploaded. \\"Coach Walpole was fired because his team had a harmless tradition that was made to seem prejudiced,\\" Griffin wrote in a CNN iReport. \\"They had a post-game ritual of smashing a watermelon and eating it after every victory.

Speaking at Cambridge University, the brainbox said he believed robots could end up becoming more intelligent that humans – and could end up deciding they no longer need to serve us. Hawking expressed worry at the idea that developing AI to such a high level could result in the creation of autonomous weapons. “I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer.\\" Hawking said at the launch of The Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence. “It therefore follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence – and exceed it. “In short, success in creating AI could be the biggest event in the history of our civilisation. “But it could also be the last unless we learn how to avoid the risks. “Alongside the benefits, AI will also bring dangers – like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many. “It will bring great disruption to our economy.” We pay for your stories!

Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was left in a difficult position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.Several of Goya's friends, including the poets Juan Meléndez Valdés and Leandro Fernández de Moratín, were overt afrancesados: the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte. He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority, and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops. During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, Wellington from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals. Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for The Disasters of War. He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance. The final plates are testament to what he described as \\"el desmembramiento d'España\\"—the dismemberment of Spain.

To keep Blade from interfering, they frame him for the murder of a human familiar. FBI agents subsequently locate Blade's hideout and kill his mentor and friend, Abraham Whistler. Demoralized, Blade surrenders and is arrested. Posing as federal marshals, the vampires persuade the authorities to turn Blade over to them. He is rescued by private investigator Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler, Abraham's daughter, who invite Blade to join their band of vampire hunters, the Nightstalkers. From them, Blade learns that Danica Talos, an old enemy of King's, has revived Dracula, or \\"Drake\\", with the goal of using his powers to cure vampires of their weaknesses. As Drake is too powerful to kill via normal means, the Nightstalkers have created an experimental bioweapon known as Daystar, capable of killing vampires at the genetic level. However, they have failed to make it effective. Eager to test Blade, Drake isolates him from the Nightstalkers, as he considers them unworthy of challenging him. He explains that all humans and vampires are inferior in his eyes and that he intends to wipe them from the Earth.

Recorded background music first found its way into factories, shops and restaurants in the USA. Very soon it spread to other parts of the world. Now it is becoming difficult to go shopping or eat a meal without listening to background music. To begin with, background music was intended simply to create a soothing atmosphere. Recently, however, it's becoming a big business. An American marketing expert has shown that music can boost sales or increase factory production by as much as a third. But it has to be the light music. Lively music has no effect at all on sales. Slow music can increase receipts by 34%. This is probably because shoppers slow down and have more opportunity to spot items they would like to buy. Yet, slow music isn't always the answer. The expert found that in restaurants slow music meant customers took longer to eat their meals, which reduced overall sales.

The jeweler wanted to store the diamond inside of the glass case but the","output":"lock had been tampered with. Frustrated and worried about the safety of the precious gem, he sighed and paused for a moment, his eyes darting around his small, dusty workshop as if to find a solution hidden amongst the tools and trinkets scattered across the workbench. The jeweler, an old and wise man named Ezekiel, had been entrusted with this rare diamond, called the Celestial Sparkle, by a mysterious and influential customer. He knew that there were others who sought the diamond, so he needed to protect it at all costs. Taking a deep breath, Ezekiel decided to get to work and devise a new way to secure the diamond. As he rummaged through his collection of tools, his eyes fell upon a set of intricate blueprints that had been left partially obscured beneath a stack of old books. He had purchased these plans many months ago at an eccentric inventor's workshop. The blueprints detailed a hidden room within a room - a secret chamber that seemed like a perfect place to store the diamond. Ezekiel meticulously examined the plans and started to reformulate the layout in his mind to fit the dimensions of his workshop. Starting at once, the old jeweler began clearing away the clutter from the back corner of the room. He erected a temporary wooden frame, and using a skill saw, meticulously cut out a section of the floor. The secret chamber was designed to be hidden under a false panel, with the opening mechanism hidden within an antique clock that would sit atop the floor panel. The clock had been collecting dust in the corner of the workshop, its intricate mahogany body, and brass gears calling out to be used for a purpose so fitting as this. As he worked on installing the clock mechanism and carefully disguised the secret chamber's entrance, Ezekiel remembered the stories behind the Celestial Sparkle. Legend had it that the diamond had been crafted by an ancient civilization that possessed advanced technology and abilities beyond human understanding. The unique properties of the Celestial Sparkle enabled it to capture the light of the cosmos and project it, creating a celestial map that would guide its bearer to unparalleled knowledge and limitless power. With the hidden chamber now complete, Ezekiel securely placed the Celestial Sparkle inside a velvet-lined box, and carefully lowered it into the secret vault beneath the workshop floor. He slid the false panel into place, obscuring the precious gem from view and adding an extra layer of security by locking the antique clock's gears with a specially designed key. The old jeweler felt a wave of relief as he finished concealing the diamond, confident that it would be safe from any intruders who may come looking for it. Unbeknownst to Ezekiel, however, a nefarious group led by the cunning and ruthless Maximillian Thorne had caught wind of the Celestial Sparkle's location. Thorne, a renowned collector of rare and mystical artifacts, had long sought the diamond for his ultimate goal of unlocking the absolute power it promised. His ragtag team of thieves and mercenaries followed any leads they could find, with Thorne himself orchestrating their every move. Unaware of the looming threat, Ezekiel continued his daily routine, expertly crafting fine jewelry in his workshop, with the antique clock ticking away above the diamond's hidden chamber. He knew the mysterious customer would return within the next few weeks to retrieve the Celestial Sparkle, but for now, he felt secure that he had done everything in his power to keep it safe. As the days went by, Thorne's group closed in on the small, unsuspecting town where Ezekiel and the Celestial Sparkle were hidden away. Complex plans and strategies were conceived as they prepared to steal what they believed was rightfully theirs. Soon, Ezekiel's life would become intertwined with the dark ambitions of Maximillian Thorne, a dangerous cat-and-mouse game fueled by greed, power, and the ancient secrets of the Celestial Sparkle. For now, however, Ezekiel could rest easy, unaware of the storm that lay ahead and the epic confrontation that would determine the fate of the celestial gem and the untold knowledge it held within."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Whose decision to leave causes Alise to be left in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers and animal friends?

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\"?

The Qatar foreign ministry has denied this, and proof is, unsurprisingly, difficult to find. But such an accusation has increasingly cropped up, particularly in terms of Qatar's prolific record of resolving hostage situations in Syria. Thirteen Greek orthodox nuns, an American journalist, and 45 Fijian peacekeepers are just some who have been released in the last 18 months with Qatar's and, it appears, often the Nusra Front's help. In the melange of designated terrorist and jihadist groups at play in Syria and Iraq, there is a vast spectrum ranging from the deranged like Islamic State (IS) to the more moderate groups like (the now defunct) Harakat Hazm that was supported by, among others, America. Being a directly affiliated al-Qaeda group, the Nusra Front is nearer the IS end of the spectrum. Yet, while the Qatari relationship with the Nusra Front appears to be far from straightforward with some of the state's initiatives failing, indicating some distance between the two, according to recent reports, Qatar appears to want to reform this relationship. This begs the question of why Qatar would want even loosely to associate itself with a group like the Nusra Front. Firstly, there are no \\"good choices\\" in Syria today. Qatar has surmised, it seems, that supporting or transforming the Nusra Front, is one of the \\"least worst\\" options. Secondly, the Nusra Front has pledged to concentrate its efforts on removing the Bashar al-Assad government, as opposed to attacking the \\"far enemy\\" (ie Western states). On this point, the Nusra Front is aligned tightly with Qatar, which also is implacably against the government and fundamentally believes that the situation in Syria will only improve if he is removed. This idea is also reflected in the Nusra Front's composition, which is far more Syrian-dominated than the foreign jihadist-magnet that is IS. Thirdly, with this goal in mind, and perhaps most crucially, the Nusra Front group is widely seen as one of the most effective groups operating in Syria against a wider backdrop of splintered groups whose powers are highly limited. The potential creation of an effective fighting force against IS (or the Syrian regime) is a significant draw for Qatar. Fourthly, Qatar possesses a small, young foreign ministry and it does not have a foreign intelligence service. Though far from alone on this issue, the state struggles to map the dynamic conflict and finds it difficult to plot the shifting actors. Instead, it seems that Qatar prefers to continue to support the people or groups with whom it already has relations. As the conflict inexorably deteriorated and groups became more and more extreme, it seems that Qatar, unable to chop and change support easily and wanting to retain relevance, maintained relations with its contacts in Syria, some of whom appear to have close affiliations with the Nusra Front. Nevertheless, the low-level Qatari contacts with this group (if, indeed, they do exist) are not sufficient to turn the tide in Syria, and rumours of such existing contacts have added fuel to the media frenzy that has alighted on Qatar and its allegedly nefarious links in recent years. Source: Quilliam Foundation Profile: Syria's Nusra Front New insight into Nusra Front This is why Qatar is hoping to bring the Nusra Front in from the cold. If the state can get the group to eschew its al-Qaeda affiliation and adhere to a broadly moderate Islamist platform, Qatar can officially commence, with Western blessing, the supply of one of the most effective fighting forces in Syria. Not an easy sell, but the promise of Qatar supplying a potential tsunami of support will prove to be a powerful negotiating tactic. Once again, the silence from Doha on this matter encourages speculation inferring that Qatar has some kind of a genuine sympathy with the goals of the likes of the Nusra Front. But the fact remains that Qatar is a key Western ally. It hosts a critical US military base, it grafted US and UK higher-education institutions and ideas onto its education system, and has long promoted the Middle East's most visible and powerful woman, Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser al-Missned, the Emir's mother. These are transparently not the policies of a state with sympathies for the likes of IS or al-Qaeda. Indeed, there is no chance that Qatar is doing this alone: the US and UK governments will certainly be involved in or at least apprised of Qatar's plans. And, with increasing desperation in the face of IS and Bashar al-Assad's resilience, a reformed, effective fighting force would be welcomed by the West. Indeed, the UN special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, recently said that he would speak to anyone, including the Nusra Front, in the effort to save lives. Qatar is not the first state to reason that it is time to talk to groups that are unpalatable and extreme, but who are, nevertheless, influential. But the ultimate judgement on this emerging policy will rest on how well Qatar can manage this transition and if this new fighting force can alter the balance of power. The recent assassination of the Nusra Front's central military commander, Abu Hammam al-Shami, in Idlib, Syria, indicates the fluid nature of the conflict. Whether he was killed because of an internal disagreement about the putative negotiations to eschew the Nusra Front's al-Qaeda affiliation or not, this assassination indicates the daily changes at the tactical level that can have potentially profound strategic effects. In such a changeable, fractured operating environment, Qatar will not be able to engineer a clean break of the Nusra Front from al-Qaeda. But, in a context where the best that can be hoped for is the \\"least worst\\" solution, Qatar's plan is as viable as any other. Dr David Roberts is a lecturer in the Defence Studies Department at King's College London. He was the Director of the Qatar office of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). His book Qatar: Securing the Global Ambitions of a City State will be published in 2015.Follow him on Twitter @thegulfblog A summary of the above article is?","output":"The claim that Qatar has ties with the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliated group, has been widely debated. Officially, the foreign ministry of Qatar denies such connections, yet amidst its record of mediating hostage situations in Syria, questions have risen about its relationship with this extremist group. The Nusra Front is known to be towards the extremist end of the spectrum and it's puzzling why Qatar would want to associate with such a group. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, Qatar may perceive itself as lacking good choices in the Syrian conflict and hence views supporting or transforming the Nusra Front as potentially the \\"least worst\\" option. Secondly, the Nusra Front aligns with Qatar on its stance against the Bashar al-Assad government. Thirdly, the Nusra Front is seen as one of the most effective groups in Syria, making them a strong ally for Qatar against more intense groups like the Islamic State (IS). Lastly, Qatar's lack of a foreign intelligence service makes mapping the conflict and understanding the shifting actors challenging, hence it tends to continue supporting groups it already has connections with. Despite having links with the Nusra Front, there is speculation that Qatar, with the help of the western states, is aiming to reform the group; with ambitions to incentivise them to renounce their al-Qaeda association and commit to a moderate Islamist platform. If successful, Qatar could officially commence supplying this reformed group, potentially creating a powerful fighting force in Syria. Qatar's silence on these matters, however, raises eyebrows. Nevertheless, it is important to note that Qatar has been a long-standing Western ally and it is unlikely it would undertake such a course of action without the awareness of its allies. The idea of reforming an extreme group like the Nusra Front into a potentially effective fighting force presents itself as a 'least worst' solution in the face of the desperate situations created by IS and the steadfast Bashar al-Assad. However, the fluid nature of the Syrian conflict and the complex dynamics of the Nusra Front makes such transition difficult. For example, the assassination of the Nusra Front's military commander, Abu Hammam al-Shami infers internal disagreements and changes in hierarchy that might affect negotiations on the ground. Therefore, a clean break of the Nusra Front from al-Qaeda mediated by Qatar is unlikely, but Qatar's proposition under the prevailing circumstances seems as feasible as any other solution."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Question: What is amplified by playback equipment? Context: Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.

The FDA review the data and if the product is seen as having a positive benefit-risk assessment, approval to market the product in the US is granted.\\" Answer: A:","output":"Before the final step in the approval process of new pharmaceutical products in the United States, several tasks need to be completed. Firstly, an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing needs to be submitted to the FDA. This filing should include sufficient pre-clinical data to justify proceeding to trials on human subjects. Following approval of the IND, there are three phases of clinical trials that must be conducted on human participants. Phase I of these trials usually involves studying the potential toxicity of the drug using healthy volunteers. In Phase II, the pharmacokinetics of the drug is studied, which means understanding how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted in the body. Dosing of the drug is also examined in patients during this phase. Phase III, the final phase of these clinical trials, involves conducting a large-scale study on the efficacy of the drug in the intended patient population. Following the successful completion of all these phases of testing, a New Drug Application (NDA) must be submitted to the FDA for review. The FDA then reviews the data submitted and examines the benefit-risk assessment of the product. So, before the final step of obtaining permission to market the drug in the United States, you must complete pre-clinical data compilation, submission of IND, completion of Phase I, II and III human clinical trials, and submission of a New Drug Application to the FDA for review."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Will Shaw (Henry Cavill) works as a financial advisor in San Francisco.

Here's the problem: -5*d - 171625 = -3*d - 171763 First, let's put all the parts with \\"d\\" on one side. To do that, we can add 3*d to both sides of the equals sign: (-5*d + 3*d) - 171625 = -171763 -2*d - 171625 = -171763 Now, let's move all the numbers that don't have \\"d\\" to the other side. We can do this by adding 171625 to both sides: -2*d = -171763 + 171625 -2*d = 138 Now, we want to know what one \\"d\\" is, not two \\"d's\\". So, let's divide both sides by -2 to find out what one \\"d\\" is: d = 138 / -2 So, d equals -69. And that's it! The answer to the math problem is d = -69.

How can Turkish chemist work in London? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"While the two questions asked are related to employment, they are not the same as they deal with different industries and geographic locations. The first question pertains to the difficulty of acquiring a job as a fashion buyer, while the second question is about the process for a Turkish chemist to work in London. Below, I provide a detailed response for each question. 1. Is it hard to get a job as a fashion buyer? The fashion buyer profession is competitive and can be challenging to enter, especially for candidates with little to no experience in the field. Factors that can affect the difficulty of securing a job as a fashion buyer include personal skills, qualifications, industry experience, and the overall demand for fashion buyers in the market. To increase your chances of landing a job as a fashion buyer, consider the following tips: a) Gain relevant education: A bachelor's degree in fashion, merchandising, or a related field can serve as a solid foundation. Some universities offer specialized programs in fashion buying and supply chain management, which can provide industry-specific knowledge and skills. b) Gain experience: Build your experience by working in entry-level positions within the retail sector or fashion industry, such as sales associate or visual merchandiser. These positions will help you understand the workings of a retail environment and provide valuable insights into customer buying patterns. c) Develop your skills: Strong negotiation, communication, and analytical skills are crucial for fashion buyers. Familiarize yourself with market trends and consumer behavior, as well as the sourcing and manufacturing processes associated with fashion products. d) Network: Attend fashion events, job fairs, and trade shows to meet industry professionals and potential hiring managers. Building connections within the industry can open up opportunities and improve your chances of securing a job. e) Prepare an outstanding resume and portfolio: Showcase your relevant education, experience, and skills, as well as any internships or volunteer work that demonstrate your knowledge and passion for the fashion industry. 2. How can a Turkish chemist work in London? For a Turkish chemist to work in London, they must go through a series of steps, including obtaining the required qualifications, searching for available job opportunities and applying, securing a job offer, and obtaining the necessary visa or work permit. a) Obtain the necessary qualifications: A chemist typically needs at least a bachelor's degree in chemistry or a related field. Advanced positions may require a master's degree or Ph.D., along with specialized training and experience in the subfield of interest. b) Search for job openings: Utilize various resources, such as job websites, networking events, and social media platforms, to find job opportunities in London. Companies and research institutions may also post positions on their websites. c) Apply for positions: Prepare a strong CV and cover letter that highlight your qualifications, experience, and skills as a chemist. If required, obtain a Credential Evaluation from a recognized UK organization to ensure your qualifications are recognized in the United Kingdom. d) Secure a job offer: Go through the interview process and work on showcasing your qualifications and experiences that make you the ideal candidate for the position. e) Obtain the necessary visa or work permit: As a Turkish national, you will need a visa or work permit to work in London. This often includes the Skilled Worker visa, previously known as the Tier 2 (General) visa, which requires sponsorship from the UK employer. Ensure you and your employer meet all the eligibility requirements for the visa category. In conclusion, although the questions are both related to employment, they are not the same as they involve disparate industries and locations. The first question is about the challenges of pursuing a career as a fashion buyer, while the second question focuses on the process for a Turkish chemist to work in London."},{"instruction":"Zermelo made other fundamental contributions to axiomatic set theory which were partly a consequence of the criticism of his first major contribution to the subject and partly because set theory began to become an important research topic at Gttingen The set theory paradoxes first appeared around 1903 with the publication of Russell s paradox What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","output":"Zermelo made other fundamental contributions to axiomatic set theory, which were partly a consequence of the criticism of his first major contribution to the subject and partly because set theory began to become an important research topic at Göttingen.

These indigenous languages consist of dozens of distinct language families, as well as many language isolates and unclassified languages. Many proposals to group these into higher-level families have been made, such as Joseph Greenberg's Amerind hypothesis. This scheme is rejected by nearly all specialists, due to the fact that some of the languages differ too significantly to draw any connections between them. Context: Although both North and Central America are very diverse areas, South America has a linguistic diversity rivalled by only a few other places in the world with approximately 350 languages still spoken and an estimated 1,500 languages at first European contact. The situation of language documentation and classification into genetic families is not as advanced as in North America (which is relatively well studied in many areas). Kaufman (1994: 46) gives the following appraisal: Since the mid 1950s, the amount of published material on SA [South America] has been gradually growing, but even so, the number of researchers is far smaller than the growing number of linguistic communities whose speech should be documented. Given the current employment opportunities, it is not likely that the number of specialists in SA Indian languages will increase fast enough to document most of the surviving SA languages before they go out of use, as most of them unavoidably will. More work languishes in personal files than is published, but this is a standard problem. It is fair to say that SA and New Guinea are linguistically the poorest documented parts of the world. However, in the early 1960s fairly systematic efforts were launched in Papua New Guinea, and that area - much smaller than SA, to be sure - is in general much better documented than any part of indigenous SA of comparable size. As a result, many relationships between languages and language families have not been determined and some of those relationships that have been proposed are on somewhat shaky ground. The list of language families, isolates, and unclassified languages below is a rather conservative one based on Campbell (1997). Many of the proposed (and often speculative) groupings of families can be seen in Campbell (1997), Gordon (2005), Kaufman (1990, 1994), Key (1979), Loukotka (1968), and in the Language stock proposals section below. Question: What were some of the popular languages being spoken? Answer:","output":"In the Americas, there are many different indigenous languages spoken by the native people. Some popular languages include Quechua in South America, which is spoken by millions of people, and Nahuatl in Central America, which was the language of the ancient Aztec Empire. There are also many other languages like Navajo in North America, Aymara in South America, and Mayan languages in Central America. Keep in mind that there are hundreds of other languages spoken by indigenous people across the Americas, and each one is special and unique!"},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The hottest show this summer---\\"the Voice\\" just finished on Sunday at the Shanghai Stadium.

Choices: - classroom - kitchen sink - backpack - cabinet - store The rationale to choose \\"backpack\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Backpack is the most logical and appropriate choice among the given options for the following reasons: 1. Functionality and purpose: Backpacks, by design, are meant to carry items such as books, stationeries, and other personal belongings. They are specifically meant to serve students in an academic setting. Therefore, placing pencils in a backpack aligns with its intended use. 2. Portability and convenience: Billy, who presumably uses the pencils for academic purposes, would benefit from having these essential items in a backpack. Backpacks make it easy for students to transport their materials between home and school or among classes without any hassle. In comparison, other choices like classroom, kitchen sink, and cabinet lack this portability attribute. A store, on the other hand, is not a personal container for Billy to store his items. 3. Organizational benefits: Backpacks typically have several compartments and pockets. This feature allows students to neatly organize their belongings, further justifying the rationale behind choosing \\"backpack\\" as the most suitable answer. Other options, such as the kitchen sink or classroom, fail to provide an adequate level of organization for storing and retrieving items like pencils. 4. Personalization: Backpacks are personal items that students customize, which is useful for creating a sense of ownership and individual style. Possessing a backpack tailored to one's personal preferences is an additional factor that establishes the backpack as the most appropriate choice for storing pencils. 5. Educational context: In the context of the given question, it is logical to assume that the pencils Billy bought are likely to be used for writing purposes in academic settings, such as schools or colleges. As backpacks are the standard form of storage for a student's belongings, it is reasonable to store pencils in the backpack. In summary, the most suitable answer to the question \\"Billy bought pencils and put them in his what?\\" should be \\"backpack.\\" This choice is supported by the functionality and purpose of backpacks, their portable nature, organizational benefits, ability to be personalized, and the typical educational context associated with pencils."},{"instruction":"Horko nesnesitelné a domovní kanalizace... ...no,ta se ani nedá popsat. Which language is this?","output":"The language you've provided is Czech, a West Slavic language predominantly spoken by the people in the Czech Republic. To provide some basic information about the Czech language, it's one of the Slavic languages family and it's spoken by approximately 10 million people worldwide. In terms of its structure, the Czech language uses the Latin alphabet enhanced with several diacritical marks (accents), namely kroužek, háček, and acute accent. These accent marks can change both the sound and meaning of words. This standard alphabet was introduced in the 14th century by Jan Hus, a Czech theologian and reformer, making Czech one of the oldest written Slavonic languages. Czech features a well-articulated and systematic grammar that makes widespread use of inflections, changing the ends of words to express an array of grammatical relations and allowing for flexible sentence structures. It has seven declension classes for nouns and adjectives and three for pronouns, an aspect we see often in many Slavic languages. Czech vocabulary is mainly derived from Proto-Slavic and Common Slavic roots, but it has also borrowed many words from other languages, especially Latin, German, and English in recent decades. The Czech Republic has a high level of education, and as a result, a significant percentage of the population has fluency or at least a basic level of English, which facilitates communication with non-Czech speakers. Modern Czech literature has produced several esteemed works, and Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is known for being a city with a rich historical and cultural heritage. The language continues to evolve and is now influenced significantly by English, the de facto global language of business and internet communication. Given the sentence you've written in Czech, \\"Horko nesnesitelné a domovní kanalizace... ...no,ta se ani nedá popsat\\", the partial translation in English would be \\"Intolerable heat and domestic sewage... ...well, one can't even describe that.\\""},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

The politicians believe industry will find the new vehicle cheaper to construct and to operate. European Space Agency member states authorised the project at a special council meeting in Luxembourg, where they also agreed funding for the space station and a rover to go to Mars. All up, the Esa nations came forward with 5.924bn euros in contributions to cover a number of programmes over the next few years. \\"I think I can summarise this ministerial council by saying it is a success; I'd even go so far as to say that it is a great success,\\" said agency director-general Jean-Jacques Dordain. The Ariane 5 has been operating since the mid-1990s and has come to dominate the market for putting up big commercial satellites. But its position is now under threat from competitor services offering lower prices. The fear is that the 5's position will be eroded inexorably in the latter half of this decade. The Ariane 6 concept is seen as the riposte. This vehicle would employ more modern methods of production and a streamlined assembly to try to reduce unit costs. Moreover, because the rocket's modular design can be tailored to a wide range of satellite and mission types, it should gain further economies from frequent use. Ministers committed 4bn euros to cover not only the 6's development but also an upgrade to Esa's small Italian-built Vega rocket. In future, these two vehicles will actually share some propulsion elements. \\"They will be a true family with the same DNA,\\" said Mr Dordain. After months - and a final day - of hard bargaining, Europe's two big space powers, France and Germany, came together to push Ariane 6 forward. France always intended to put up most of the money, but it needed German support financially and programatically. This it got by fulfilling commitments to the International Space Station, which Germany regards as central to its space endeavours. The meeting agreed 800 million euros be spent on the ISS and related activities up to 2017 - just 20 million short of what had been asked at the start of the day. This was achieved in part by the Italians promising to return eventually to funding levels it withdrew from a couple of years ago, and by the UK, which gave a \\"one-off\\" payment to the ISS at the last ministerial gathering in 2012, coming up with a further, increased contribution. The third big issue for the Luxembourg gathering concerned the ExoMars rover, which is due to be sent to the Red Planet in 2018 to search for signs of past or present life. It is a project with a troubled history that has come within a breath of being cancelled on more than one occasion. Its persistent woe has been a shortfall in the money needed to carry the venture through to completion. This gap is on the order of 200 million euros. Ministers could only promise 140 million euros in Luxembourg, even after the UK and Italy, the \\"champions of ExoMars\\", upped their participation. But Mr Dordain told reporters the sum was enough for now to keep the mission on track. \\"It means I can sign industrial contracts next year,\\" he explained. Other programmes to be approved at the meeting included the next phase of Sentinel-6, a future satellite for the EU to measure the shape of the oceans; and \\"AnySat\\", which is a concept for small, adaptable telecommunications spacecraft. A summary of the above article is?","output":"Ariane 6 is a new rocket that will replace the older Ariane 5 rocket. The older rocket was really good at sending big satellites into space, but now there are other companies offering to do the same job for less money. The Ariane 6 rocket will be cheaper to build and use, and it can be changed to send many different types of satellites into space.

Yet many schools across the country have reduced their physical education programs. Criticism of the cuts has led in some places to efforts to give students more time for exercise, not less. The future health of Americans may depend on it. A study reports that life expectancy has fallen or is no longer increasing in some parts of the United States. The situation is worst among poor people in the southern states, and especially women. Public health researchers say it is largely the result of increases in obesity,smoking and high blood pressure. They also blame differences in health services around the country. In 2006, a study found that only 4% of elementary schools provided daily physical education all year for all grades. This was true of 8% of middle schools and 2% of high schools. The study also found that 22% of all schools did not require students to take any P. E. One problem for P. E. teachers is that schools are under pressure to put more time into academic subjects. Also, parents may agree that children need exercise in school. Yet many parents today still have bad memories of being chosen last for teams because teachers favored the good athletes in class. But experts say P. E. classes have changed. They say the goal has moved away from competition to personal performance, as a way to build a lifetime of activity. These days, teachers often lead activities like weight training and yoga.

A panda who has grown depressed with boredom and loneliness has been given a plasma TV in order to cheer her up. Sijia is one of three giant pandas which had to be rescued from the Wolong National Natural Reserve when they were left orphaned and abandoned in the devastating 2008 earthquake in Wenchuan, Sichuan province. Silja and her fellow panda survivors were then sent to the Yunnan Wild Animal Park, and this year the others were returned successfully to the wild. Sad pandaface: Sija and two other pandas were saved from the 2008 earthquake in Wenchuan, China, and taken in by a zoo, but now that the others have left, Silja has become depressed. Panda telly: Sija has been given some new playthings, including a plasma screen TV which shows imagery of pandas in the wild. However, with zoo keepers saying that Sijia is not ready to be released just yet, she is living alone in her cage with limited stimulation. A short while after the other two were removed, keepers noticed that Sija had become uninterested in her food and showed signs of depression. Animal psychology experts concluded that her cage was not interesting enough and ordered new toys for Sija, including the plasma TV to be installed to help pass the time. Happy bear: Animal psychology experts also ordered that Sija be given a swing to play on in her enclosure at the Yunnan Wild Animal Park in Sichuan province,. Swing when you're winning: Sija enjoying her newly installed swing in her zoo enclosure. Distractions: The big panda has also been given a 'fake friend' in the shape of a giant cuddly toy panda to make her feel less lonely. She was also given a giant sized cuddly panda to help remove the feelings of loneliness, as well as a swing just the right size for a panda looking to have fun. So far, Yunnan Wild Animal Park say that the distractions seem to be working, and in particular the TV images of wild pandas going about their lives have proven particularly successful in distracting Sijia from her loneliness. Zu spokesman De Liu said: ‘It is still early days yet, but we are cautiously optimistic that we may have given her enough to do to stop her getting more depressed.’ What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

The phrase underscores the importance of individual freedom, balanced against the responsibility of ensuring that one's actions do not infringe upon the freedoms or well-being of others. In constructing this sentence, we see the subject (\\"la liberté\\") at the beginning, followed by a verb (\\"consiste\\") and a prepositional phrase (\\"à pouvoir faire\\"). Next, comes the object (\\"tout ce qui\\"), and finally, an adverbial phrase (\\"ne nuit pas\\") that qualifies the action, asserting the limits of one's freedom in relation to the rights of others (\\"à autrui\\"). This sentiment aligns with the French concept of \\"fraternité,\\" or brotherhood, in which members of society work together to achieve collective goals, while also acknowledging the individual's role and liberties within the larger social context.

Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here's \\"Have a Cigar\\" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives. The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes \\"Pink\\" is the name of one of the band members. According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the \\"dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce\\", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience.Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: \\"The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling.\\" Waters commented: \\"it's about none of us really being there ...

Is H2 is used as the rotor coolant in electrical generators at power stations, because it has the highest thermal conductivity of any gas. a good answer to this question? --yes --no","output":"Yes, your statement is accurate. Hydrogen gas (H2) is indeed used as a coolant in electrical generators at power stations due to its high thermal conductivity, as well as several other benefits. However, let me provide you with a more detailed and long answer to give you a better understanding. Hydrogen gas (H2) is an essential element in the efficient and safe operation of large electrical generators at power stations. The primary reason for using hydrogen as a cooling medium in electrical generators is its exceptional thermal conductivity, which is about 7 times higher than that of air. This high thermal conductivity allows for effective heat dissipation from the generator's core, maintaining the generator's temperature within an acceptable range and averting overheating issues. Several other factors contribute to the use of hydrogen as a coolant in electrical generators at power stations: 1. Lower density: Hydrogen is a very light gas, which results in reduced windage loss (frictional losses due to gas movement within the generator casing). Lower windage loss enhances the generator's efficiency. In large generators, hydrogen cooling can increase the efficiency by up to 1% compared to air cooling, which is significant when considering the scale of power generation. 2. Lower viscosity: Hydrogen has lower viscosity compared to air, which means that it can flow more easily around the components of the generator and more effectively remove any hotspots. 3. Inert gas: Hydrogen is an inert gas and does not react with other elements under normal operating conditions. This ensures that the generator's components do not corrode or degrade due to chemical reactions with the coolant. 4. Safety: Although hydrogen is flammable, the generators are designed to minimize the risk of ignition by limiting the oxygen content inside the generator casing. In addition, if a hydrogen leak is detected, safety measures are in place, such as alarm systems, automatic shutdown, and efficient ventilation systems to minimize the risk of an explosion. It is important to note that hydrogen cooling is primarily applied in large electrical generators used in power stations, where the benefits of increased efficiency, effective heat removal, and reduced windage loss outweigh the increased complexity, cost, and safety measures required for handling the hydrogen gas. In conclusion, hydrogen gas (H2) is used as the rotor coolant in electrical generators at power stations due to its superior thermal conductivity, lower density, lower viscosity, inert nature, and increased safety precautions. These properties and considerations make hydrogen an effective coolant, enhancing the generator's performance, preventing overheating, and ensuring a reliable and efficient power generation process."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you will be shown an English sentence.

He won the marathon at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome while running barefoot, setting a world record. At the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Abebe was the first athlete to successfully defend an Olympic marathon title, breaking his own world record in the process. Abebe returned to his homeland a hero. He was greeted by a large crowd, many dignitaries and the commander of the Imperial Guard, Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway. Abebe was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa along a procession route lined with thousands of people and presented to Emperor Haile Selassie. The emperor awarded him the Star of Ethiopia and promoted him to the rank of asiraleqa (corporal). He was given the use of a chauffeur-driven Volkswagen Beetle (since he did not yet know how to drive) and a home, both owned by the Guard. On December 13, 1960, while Haile Selassie was on a state visit to Brazil, Imperial Guard forces led by Mengistu began an unsuccessful coup and briefly proclaimed Selassie's eldest son Asfaw Wossen Taffari emperor. Fighting took place in the heart of Addis Ababa, shells detonated in the Jubilee Palace, and many of those closest to the emperor were killed. Although Abebe was not directly involved, he was briefly arrested and questioned. Mengistu was later hanged, and his forces (which included many members of the Imperial Guard) were killed in the fighting, arrested or fled. In the 1961 Athens Classical Marathon, Abebe again won while running barefoot. This was the second and last event in which he competed barefooted. The same year he won the marathons in Osaka and Kosice. While in Japan, he was approached by a Japanese shoe company, Onitsuka Tiger, with the possibility of wearing its shoes; they were informed by Niskanen that Abebe had \\"other commitments.\\" Kihachiro Onitsuka suspected that Abebe had a secret sponsorship deal with Puma, in spite of the now-abandoned rules against such deals. Abebe ran the 1963 Boston Marathon, finishing fifth in 2:24:43, the only time in his competitive career that he completed an international marathon without winning. He and countryman Mamo Wolde, who finished 12th, had run together on record pace for 18 miles, until cold winds and the hills in Newton caused both to fall back. The race was won by Belgium's Aurele Vandendriessche in a course record 2:18:58. Abebe returned to Ethiopia and did not compete in another marathon until 1964 in Addis Ababa. Abebe won that race in a time of 2:23:14.8. Did he participate in other competitions after that one?","output":"Yes, Abebe Bikila participated in other competitions after the 1964 Addis Ababa marathon. After winning that race, he went on to compete in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where he successfully defended his Olympic marathon title and broke his own world record. Abebe continued to compete in various marathons and races after the Tokyo Olympics, although he faced some challenges, including injuries, during his career.

I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed.

Context: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. Question: Why are the young girls screaming? Answer: Answer:","output":"The young girls were screaming because they had just witnessed a very distressing scene. The waitress, who had approached their table to take their order, had suddenly fainted, falling onto their table, and then backward onto the floor, hitting her head on the corner of a wall. This caused her to get injured and bleed profusely. The sight of an adult suddenly collapsing, accompanied by the presence of blood and subsequent commotion, was certainly scary and shocking, particularly for young girls under the age of 12. They might not have fully understood what was happening and the sight of blood can often cause panic and fear, especially in young children.

The NOAA confirmed recently that hackers breached its weather system. (AP) Hackers from China breached the federal weather network recently, forcing cybersecurity teams to seal off data vital to disaster planning, aviation, shipping and scores of other crucial uses, officials said. The intrusion occurred in late September but officials gave no indication that they had a problem until Oct. 20, said three people familiar with the hack and the subsequent reaction by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service. Even then, NOAA did not say its systems were compromised. Officials also said that the agency did not notify the proper authorities when it learned of the attack. NOAA officials declined to discuss the suspected source of the attack, whether it affected classified data and the delay in notification. NOAA said publicly last month that it was doing “unscheduled maintenance” on its network, without saying a computer hack had made that necessary. In a statement released Wednesday, NOAA spokesman Scott Smullen acknowledged the hacks and said “incident response began immediately.” He said all systems were working again and that forecasts were accurately delivered to the public. Smullen declined to answer questions beyond his statement, citing an investigation into the attack. NOAA's satellites provide the bulk of the information for generating weather models, advisories and warnings to the nation and world. Maintaining the operations and data acquisition from these satellites is a 24/7 process. This video was filmed at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, Md., where command, control and data distribution systems are located. (NOAA/YouTube) Determining the origin of cyber­attacks is difficult, experts said, and Chinese officials have denied repeated accusations that they intrude in U.S. government computer systems for espionage or other purposes. Geng Shuang of the Chinese Embassy said the consulate was not aware of the case and had not been contacted by the U.S. government about the attacks. “Cyberattack is quite common in today’s cyberspace,” he said. “Jumping to conclusions on its origin without hard evidence is not responsible at all.” The embassy also urged “relevant U.S. parties to stop this kind of unfounded accusation.” But NOAA confirmed to Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) that China was behind the attack, the congressman said. Wolf has a long-standing interest in cybersecurity and asked NOAA about the incident after an inquiry from The Washington Post. “NOAA told me it was a hack and it was China,” said Wolf, who also scolded the agency for not disclosing the attack “and deliberately misleading the American public in its replies.” “They had an obligation to tell the truth,” Wolf said. “They covered it up.” Commerce Department Inspector General Todd Zinser said his office was not notified of the breach until Nov. 4, well after he believes the hack occurred. He said that is a violation of agency policy requiring any security incident to be reported to his office within two days of discovering the problem. “We’re in the process of looking into the matter, including why NOAA did not comply with the requirements to notify law enforcement about the incident,” Zinser said. Wolf said he did not know if the breach involved classified material or what information was accessed. Confirmation of the NOAA hack followed an admission Monday by the U.S. Postal Service that a suspected Chinese attack — also in September — compromised data on 800,000 employees, including letter carriers on up through the postmaster general. NOAA officials also would not say whether the attack removed material or inserted malicious software in its system, which is used by civilian and military forecasters in the United States and also feeds weather models at the main centers for Europe and Canada. NOAA’s National Ice Center Web site also was down for a week in late October. The center is a partnership with the Navy and Coast Guard to monitor conditions for navigation. The two-day outage skewed the accuracy of National Weather Service long-range forecasts slightly, according to NOAA. The attack in September hit a Web server that connects to many NOAA computers, said one person familiar with the incursion. The server had security protections, but the person compared the security to leaving a house protected by “just a screen door.” Smullen’s statement said that four sites were hit by the breach. Weather satellites orbit hundreds to thousands of miles above Earth and offer continuous views of weather systems, such as hurricanes, thunderstorms and cold fronts, while also measuring temperature and moisture at different altitudes — all crucial bits that feed prediction models. To get that information to the public, NOAA makes satellite data and imagery publicly available through the Web, as well as file-transfer networks for downloads. NOAA has characterized its decision to cut off satellite images as causing minimal disruption. But it has previously touted those same systems as intrinsic to the nation’s “environmental intelligence.” NOAA satellites “provide critical data for forecasts and warnings that are vital to every citizen and to our economy as a whole,” NOAA Administrator Kathryn D. Sullivan said a year ago. Wolf said a hack could steal technical insights or cull isolated information “that may not look significant until they’re put with something else and then they become valuable.” “The Chinese are stealing us blind,” Wolf said. The attack on NOAA joins a spate of cyber-espionage on federal systems revealed recently, including an attack suspected from Russia that breached unclassified White House computer networks. The October satellite data outage meant that the National Weather Service and centers around the world did not receive large amounts of information. “All the operational data sent via NOAA, which is normally an excellent service, was lost,” said Stephen English, head of the satellite section at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading, England. The center is renowned for running a highly advanced global weather prediction model that during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, for example, aided evacuations and preparations in the United States when it signaled that the superstorm would hit land rather than hook out to sea. The Rutgers University Global Snow Lab, which provides daily snow cover updates for researchers and forecasters using a data feed from the Ice Center, posted a notice on its Web site that its reports were incomplete throughout the outage. A July report on NOAA by the Inspector General for the Commerce Department — where NOAA sits — criticized an array of “high-risk vulnerabilities” in the security of NOAA’s satellite information and weather service systems. The report echoed the views of a 2009 audit from the IG that said the primary system that processes satellite data from two environmental and meteorological systems had “significant” security weaknesses, and that “a security breach could have severe or catastrophic adverse effects.” The watchdog’s previously unreleased report, obtained by The Post under a Freedom of Information Act request, called for “immediate management attention” and said NOAA’s security planning was so poor that the agency had little idea how vulnerable its system was. ||||| Just a few months after a blistering internal report warned of serious technology security problems in the agency that oversees the National Weather Service, the agency confirmed Wednesday that it was recently the victim of a cyberattack on four of its websites — an attack that one of the agency's congressional overseers said was orchestrated by China. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA — which not only provides satellite data for climate researchers and weather forecasters, but also helps manage the network of GPS satellites critical to business and military operations — said that the attack was detected \\"in recent weeks\\" and that \\"unscheduled maintenance\\" addressed the problem. NOAA gave no further details because an investigation is continuing. But \\"NOAA told me it was a hack and it was China,\\" Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees NOAA, told The Washington Post. Wolf accused NOAA of \\"deliberately misleading the American public in its replies.\\" \\"They had an obligation to tell the truth,\\" Wolf told the newspaper. \\"They covered it up.\\" NOAA's own records show that it issued seven technical alerts reporting significant \\"network problems\\" on Oct. 19 and 20, which caused the loss of some weather data and delays in satellite data transmissions affecting email and Internet connectivity. It said the outage was resolved through \\"unscheduled maintenance\\" — the same wording it used in confirming the recent cyberattack. The problems affected four agencies for which NOAA provides or coordinates data, two of them related to the military — the Air Force Weather Agency, the Navy's fleet meteorology center, the SNPP polar-orbiting environmental satellite system and the products division of the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service. It's that last office — the environmental satellite data service, or NESDIS — that an inspector general's report sharply took to task in July for \\"significant security deficiencies\\" that threaten a \\"risk in its national critical mission.\\" The report (PDF) from the internal watchdog of the Commerce Department, NOAA's home agency, faulted NESDIS for inadequately applying security measures across workstations and servers, most notably in systems that relay distress signals to search and rescue operations and systems that are connected to other government networks, which it said \\"could provide an attacker with access to these critical assets.\\" Poor security in NESDIS' information systems \\"increase the risk of cyber attacks,\\" the report concluded. NOAA eventually agreed with most of the report's recommendations, but only after a delay so it could review potentially classified material involving the Air Force — one of the services involved in the October outage. An inspector general's report in July said weaknesses in NOAA's security left it open to cyberattacks on critical systems.

He always tried hard to win in any situation. Given the context: Why did Carson do this? Possible answers: hide an injury, hide his fears, show off to others The answer is:","output":"Carson's determination to win the game and his consistent effort to excel in any situation could be attributed to a combination of factors such as concealing an injury, masking his fears, or impressing others. Each of these motives will be examined in detail below. 1. Hiding an injury: In certain situations, athletes or individuals who participate in competitive games may attempt to conceal an injury. The primary reason for doing so is to avoid being seen as weak or vulnerable and to maintain their position or status within the team, community, or social circle. This might mean pushing themselves beyond their physical limits to prove their ability to persevere despite the pain they're experiencing. In Carson's case, this could be the driving force behind his persistent efforts to win. He might believe that hiding his injury and continuing to excel is the key to retaining his standing or avoiding criticism from others. 2. Hiding his fears: Another possible explanation for Carson's unwavering determination to win is that he could be using his performance in the game to mask his insecurities or concerns. For instance, he might worry about how others might perceive him if he doesn't win or if he is seen as a weak link, which would make him feel vulnerable. By constantly striving to be the best and securing victories, Carson could direct attention away from his fears and present a confident, successful image. This might help him feel more in control and maintain the illusion of emotional stability. 3. Showing off to others: Additionally, Carson's actions could stem from a desire to seek approval, validation, or admiration from others. Society often places a strong emphasis on success, and one's achievements or victories can significantly influence their social standing. This might be particularly important in a competitive sports setting, where the ability to win or excel is highly sought-after and respected. In this context, Carson's efforts to consistently win and emerge as a strong competitor might be a way for him to flaunt his skills, abilities, and prowess, thereby winning the admiration and respect of his peers, coaches, or onlookers. In conclusion, there are several potential motives behind Carson's consistent efforts to win the game and excel in any situation. He could be trying to hide an injury to avoid appearing weak or losing his position; he might be masking his fears and presenting a confident, successful image; or he may be seeking approval, validation, or admiration from others by showcasing his talents and securing victories. Each of these factors, or a combination of them, could explain Carson's determined attitude and unwavering commitment to winning."},{"instruction":"Give the rationale and then the answer.

The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho).

Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information.

A one-armed criminal, a Boglodite named Boris the Animal, stages a jailbreak (along the way killing Obadiah Price, a fellow inmate he'd made a deal with). His intention is to rewrite history, with Agent K, the one who arrested and imprisoned him, being a major factor in his plan...On Earth, Agent K and his partner Agent J cover up an arrival of an alien spacecraft, and hear of the prison break. At a Chinese restaurant thats a local haunt for aliens, Agent K discovers Boris (who had previously gone to see Obadiah's son Jeffrey) and the two fight, with J joining in. K is upset that the alien he should have killed is out loose again; he deems it his own affair and forbids J to help him, suspending him. A puzzled J checks up on Boris: he appeared in 1969 to stop the prevention of the ArcNet Shield, a device that K deployed to protect the world from harm (but which killed off the Boglodites, as they can only survive by feeding off worlds). He managed to kill on 15 July 1969 an alien named Roman the Fabulous and on the following day... at this point O cuts him off and tells him not to investigate any further. That night, as K waits for Boris with a gun in his hand, he suddenly vanishes...The next morning, J discovers that he has a new partner, the liberated Agent AA, and that K has been dead for forty years (having been killed by Boris the Animal on 16th July 1969). O notices he is suffering from headaches and craves chocolate milk, which she explains are symptoms of time-fracture (aka the crime of interfering with history, which Obadiah Price was imprisoned for).

The first sentence primarily focuses on the speaker's understanding of the history between Muslims and Israelis and their perception of Muslims having jihads against themselves. The sentence does convey a sense of conflict between Muslims and Israelis, but it does not specifically address whether the Muslims are hated by Israelis. While Sentence 1 does mention the hatred of Muslims for Israelis, the speaker is trying to express their understanding of why the conflicts may exist between the two groups. They also acknowledge the Palestinians as a separate entity, which indicates that the context of the sentence is primarily focused on the historical relationships between these groups. On the other hand, Sentence 2 directly addresses the belief about whether Muslims are hated by Israelis and lists three possible options for agreement, uncertainty, or disagreement.

Here are possible answers to this question: - great outdoors - story book - flower shop - field of flowers - herb garden I believe the correct choice is \\"story book\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"A talking bee can be found in a story book, and there are several reasons to support this claim. Firstly, let's examine the other options before delving deeper into the correct choice: 1. Great outdoors: While bees, being natural creatures, can indeed be found in the great outdoors, the concept of a talking bee is purely fictional. Bees in the real world communicate through pheromones, wing vibrations, and movements but they do not possess the ability to talk like humans. 2. Flower shop: Bees are known to collect nectar and pollen from flowers, which they use to make honey. However, flower shops typically offer cut flowers or potted plants, which are not necessarily the ideal place for bees to hang out. More importantly, as mentioned earlier, talking bees do not exist outside the realms of fiction. 3. Field of flowers: A field of flowers would certainly attract a large number of bees seeking nectar and pollen. However, as previously mentioned, bees are not able to talk, thus making this scenario improbable. 4. Herb garden: Bees might be present in an herb garden, as some herbs produce flowers that are rich in nectar or pollen. However, talking bees cannot be found in such locations as they only exist in fictional stories. Having analyzed the other options and eliminating them based on the criteria of being a talking bee, the correct choice is indeed \\"story book\\". In story books, anthropomorphism, a literary device where human traits are attributed to animals, plants, or inanimate objects, is quite common. Thus, talking bees or other animals with human-like traits can be found within these works of fiction. Story books defy the boundaries of reality, allowing authors to express their creativity through various characters and their unique abilities. As a result, talking bees can be found as central or supporting characters, representing certain values, themes, or lessons to be learned. Classic examples of talking bees in story books include characters such as Buzz-Buzz from \\"The Bee Who Would Not Work\\" by Charlotte B. Herr or Maya the Bee from \\"The Adventures of Maya the Bee\\" by Waldemar Bonsels. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question of where a talking bee can be found is a story book. This is because talking bees do not exist in reality, and story books offer an avenue for authors to create fictional characters with human-like traits. These characters can be used to convey meaningful messages and cultivate an appreciation for the natural world and the fascinating creatures, like bees, that inhabit it."},{"instruction":"Given a comment text in Tamil, classify the comment into one of these categories (i) Hope speech, if it contains encouraging, positive or supportive contents about equality, diversity or inclusion, (ii) Not Hope Speech or (iii) Not in Expected Language, if the text is not Tamil. @Jyothi Jyothi idhu MG innaiku panniruka tweet sister","output":"Part 1: Comment text in Tamil Usage: \\"@Jyothi Jyothi idhu MG innaiku panniruka tweet sister\\" is a Tamil comment as it mainly contains Tamil words like \\"idhu,\\" \\"innaiku,\\" \\"panniruka,\\" and \\"sister\\" (borrowed from English).

Hundreds of thousands of wetland species experienced significant population declines as their habitat was increasingly fragmented and destroyed. Although market hunting within the Central Flyway was a contributing factor in the decline of many waterfowl species' numbers in the early decades of the twentieth century, loss of breeding habitat to agricultural expansion is certainly the most significant. Early maps of midwestern states depict many lakes and marshes that are either nonexistent or significantly reduced in area today. Channelization, a related process of concentrating and facilitating the flow of water from agricultural areas, also contributed to this degradation.

JCF Capital ULC will buy out Trump Hotels’ management contract allowing them to remove the president’s name from the Bay Street tower, a move one Toronto realtor called “long overdue.” The Trump Organization has agreed to sell the management contracts for the Trump International Hotel and Tower Toronto to JCF Capital. ( Bernard Weil / Toronto Star ) “Trump Tower…is a running joke in real estate, it’s synonymous with probably the biggest real estate failure in the city in recent memory,” said David Fleming, a Toronto realtor with Bosley Real Estate Ltd. “That building needs a clean start.” JCF Capital ULC and Trump Hotels, which never owned the building, announced the agreement Tuesday. Article Continued Below “Collectively, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Eric Danziger and their team have been exceptional partners and we hope to have the pleasure of working with the Trump Organization again in the future,” said Jay Wolf, the president of JCF Capital, in a statement. Trump Hotels CEO Eric Danziger echoed his comments, saying they “look forward to exploring other opportunities with JCF in the near future.” The release did not explain why JCF, a joint venture between Juniper Capital Partners and Cowie Capital Partners, decided to buy-out the Trump Hotels management contract. JCF bought the building, which includes 211 hotel units, 74 condos and most of the commercial, retail and amenity space, in March for 298 million. “Most people would think it’s because of President Donald Trump and his views and the negativity and controversy that surrounds him, but personally I think if you trace this project back to its roots there’s a failure from the beginning,” said Fleming. Read more: Toronto’s Trump Tower sells for 298M Trump can’t appeal court decision he misled Toronto investors The project has been shrouded in controversy, which include multiple lawsuits, since opening in 2012. In one case, investors won damages after they successfully argued U.S. President Donald Trump and the developer Talon International had misled them into believing their investments would offer significantly higher returns. Article Continued Below Changing the name could help shift the focus to the building’s features, said Marco Chiappetta, a realtor with Sotheby’s International Realty Canada, who has listed one of the building’s one bedroom plus den condos for 1.6 million. “Right now the building features probably the nicest finishes in the city and not a lot of people know that,” he said. “A new name will freshen up the brand.” New name or not, Fleming said it won’t change his mind about the hotel-condo model. “I don’t like the commercial taxes, I don’t like the higher maintenance fees, I don’t like the potential for the hotel to make decisions that affect the condo. I think it’s incredibly risky and I would never put a buyer into a hotel condo, let alone this one in particular,” he said. Chiappetta takes a different view. He sees the amenities offered by the hotel condo model, including things like 24-hour concierge service, as an asset. Despite the forthcoming branding change, the controversy isn’t over for the 65 storey hotel-condo. Mitchell Wine, a Toronto lawyer with Levine Sherkin Boussidan, has started a class action law suit against Talon, the hotel condo’s developer. The class action suit, which could include between 100 and 150 people, is seeking the return of deposits paid by people who did not close their transactions to become owners. With files from the Canadian Press Read more about: ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email Donald Trump’s business will be paid millions of dollars to release the owner of a Toronto hotel complex from using his name. JCF Capital ULC, the closely held U.S. firm that owns the Trump International Hotel & Tower in the city’s downtown business district, reached a buyout deal to exit the contracts with the Trump Organization’s hotel unit, the companies said Tuesday in a statement. While no breakup fee was disclosed, the amount was at least 6 million, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Signage may be removed from the 65-story tower as soon as Aug. 1, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential details. Trump International Hotel & Tower in Toronto Photographer: Norm Betts/Bloomberg The hotel will likely be operated under Marriott International Inc.’s St. Regis brand, people familiar with the plan said earlier this month. The agreement to remove the the U.S. president’s brand marks the first step toward revamping the property, which has faced a history of construction delays and lawsuits. Most recently, it’s been a site for protests against the Trump’s comments disparaging women, Mexicans and Muslims, even though his company has no ownership stake in the property. JCF Capital acquired the tower with the Trump brand and agreements in place last year from former owner Talon International, the developer run by Russian-Canadian billionaire Alex Shnaider. Since then, JCF has been in talks with hotel chains and the Trump Organization to complete an operating plan. The tower was a tough sell under its Trump name: Talon struggled to sell the building after defaulting on its 2007 loan, and when JCF Capital acquired the loan on the property from lender Raiffeisen Bank International AG and launched a sale process for the building, it garnered no bids aside from its own. New Brands The Trump brand, traditionally associated with luxurious properties in major cities and resort towns, is also undergoing change. A line of hotels called Scion aimed at younger customers was announced last year, and another, American Idea, was launched this month for smaller markets, with the first three planned for Mississippi. While Trump has resigned from any roles in his companies, he’s not divested his ownership stakes. His interests were placed in a trust overseen by an independent ethics officer and managed by Trump’s sons Eric and Don Jr., along with Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg. The president is the beneficiary of that trust.

Data is obtained from \\"PreCogs,\\" three mutated humans who can see into the future. When the PreCogs detect that a murder is going to be committed, an automated system processes two painted wooden balls: one with the name of the perpetrator engraved into it, and one with the name of the victim or victims engraved into it (the system itself being designed to be tamperproof). The color of the ball indicates what kind of murder they are facing: a brown ball indicates a premeditated murder, which the PreCogs can predict up to four days out. A red ball indicates a crime of passion, which, due to the lack of premeditation, cannot be seen until often no less than an hour before the crime is to be committed.The only three things that the PreCogs can predict are the victim or victims, the perpetrator, and the exact date and time of the crime. Thus, Anderton and his team have to perform a meticulous process called \\"scrubbing\\", where they process the images produced from the precogs' visions in order to locate telltale clues and thus narrow down the location.

But alas, in the ever-changing landscape of television, even the most successful culinary entities can lose their essence, and so is the story of The Great British Bake Off (or GBBO, as it is known). Having been a cherished program that once captivated millions with its charming ambiance, gentle humor, and captivating cakes, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for continued success. However, recent years have seen the juggernaut of a baking show succumb to a fate that it always keenly advised against: the soggy bottom. The Mary Berry Factor In many ways, iconic judge Mary Berry was the heart and soul of GBBO. Balancing technical knowledge with her warm demeanor, Mary Berry proved to be a driving force behind the show's initial success. From her invaluable critiques to her matronly wisdom, her presence transformed the competition into a master class for home bakers and cake lovers alike. Yet, following her departure in 2016, the show has arguably failed to fill the void left behind. A Change in the Landscape It was in 2016 that the landscape shifted in ways that didn't sit well with many fans. Channel 4 acquired the rights to the show, and along with it came the loss of not only the queen of cakes herself, but also beloved hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. Replacements did come, in the form of judge Prue Leith and presenters Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig, later replaced by Matt Lucas. However, as competent and qualified as these newcomers have been, the necessary cohesion of humor, charisma, and the quintessentially British charm was left wanting. Crumbling Under Pressure It's no secret that the relentless drama in recent seasons has taken precedence over the once gently soothing pleasure of watching showstoppers come to life. Though previous seasons also had their share of controversial eliminations, the spotlight has grown increasingly harsh on contestants. Ensuing Twitter storms, the avalanche of criticism on social media or media outlets might be driving ratings; but it sadly departed from the initial spirit of camaraderie and triumphs of the original. Furthermore, it seems that the emphasis on the \\"competition\\" aspect over the craft of baking may have driven away loyal viewers searching for solace in an abundance of heartwarming soggy-bottom-full cakes and genial banter. Commercialization's Impact What sets the old version of GBBO apart from the recent one, is the shift from Buckinghamshire to Essex. In its new home, the show is commercialized in a fashion that has arguably detracted from the endearing authenticity of previous seasons. Greater commercial intervention in the form of sponsorships has fed into an already pressurized environment, where calmer, gentler moments are lost. Time to Postpone the Bake? These changes in the show have sparked a considerable debate on whether GBBO needs revitalization. Should producers try to rekindle the simplicity and genuine warmth that won over audiences in the first place? Or, will the show need to reinvent itself with even more extensive changes to cater to new viewers? Conclusion Despite the challenges faced by The Great British Bake Off in recent years, the show's legacy is etched into the hearts of home bakers everywhere. The fervent hope of fans lies in the show returning to its roots by showcasing irresistible baked goods, jolly camaraderie, and conjuring an atmosphere where learning and enjoyment stand out above all else. Until then, the soggy bottom remains a poignant reminder of what once was, in the glory days of Mary Berry's reign."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

A more detailed and long answer would be: Windows PowerShell is indeed Microsoft's task automation framework, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language built on the .NET Framework. Windows PowerShell was introduced with Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista. It has since become an integral part of all new Windows versions and updates. However, it was not included by default in some older versions of the Windows operating system. Before PowerShell, Windows primarily relied on the Command Prompt and VBScript for command-line operations and automation. Certain versions of Windows that were released before the introduction of PowerShell do not have it built-in by default. These include: 1. Windows XP - Released in 2001, Windows XP was a widely-used operating system that preceded Windows Vista. PowerShell was not included by default in Windows XP, but Microsoft did release a special downloadable package called \\"Windows Management Framework,\\" which added PowerShell functionality to Windows XP SP2 and later versions. 2. Windows Server 2003 - This server version of Windows followed Windows Server 2000 and was released before Windows Server 2008, which was the first server edition to include PowerShell. These two major versions of Windows do not have PowerShell built-in by default.

Here is a detailed overview of the two main approaches: Method 1: Manual Cutting using Hand Tools This method makes more sense if you have limited resources and experience working with metal. You'll need the following tools and materials: 1. Silver sheet 2. Metal ruler 3. Utility knife or jeweler's saw 4. Clamps 5. Permanent marker or scribe 6. Safety glasses 7. Workbench or sturdy table 8. Sandpaper or metal file Here's the step-by-step process for cutting a strip of silver using manual tools: Step 1: Measure and Mark the Silver Sheet - Determine the desired width and length of the silver strip. - Using the metal ruler and permanent marker or scribe, mark the measurements on the silver sheet. Step 2: Secure the Silver Sheet - Lay the sheet of silver on a sturdy table or workbench. - Use clamps to securely hold the silver sheet and the ruler in place alongside the marked line. Step 3: Cut the Strip - Put on safety glasses to protect your eyes from any metal debris. - If using a utility knife, score the marked line multiple times until the strip is created. Press firmly and follow the straight edge of the ruler. - If using a jeweler's saw, lubricate the blade with some cutting oil or beeswax. Carefully saw through the marked line using straight, consistent strokes while pressing the saw against the straight edge of the ruler. Step 4: Smooth the Edges - Use sandpaper or a metal file to remove any burrs or rough edges along the cut strip. Method 2: Laser Cutting This method is more suited for precision cutting and if you have access to advanced technology, such as a laser cutting machine. The process is as follows: 1. Create a Design File - Using design software like Adobe Illustrator or AutoCAD, create a digital file of the strip with the desired dimensions. - Save the file in a compatible format for the laser cutting machine. 2. Prepare the Laser Cutter - Turn on the laser cutter and configure the settings, such as material type, material thickness, and cutting speed, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. - Load the design file into the machine. 3. Secure the Silver Sheet - Place the silver sheet on the cutting bed and adjust the laser head to the proper distance from the sheet. 4. Laser Cut the Strip - Initiate the cutting process. The laser cutter will precisely cut the strip according to the design file. - Once the cut is complete, remove the silver strip and clean it with a soft cloth to remove any residue from the cutting process. Both methods have their advantages and limitations. The manual cutting method is more cost-effective, easily accessible, and suitable for smaller-scale projects. On the other hand, the laser cutting method offers higher precision, quicker turnaround time, and the ability to handle more complex designs, making it ideal for large-scale projects or specialized applications. Ultimately, the method that makes the most sense to accomplish this goal will depend on your specific requirements, available resources, and the level of precision needed for the project."},{"instruction":"2. imminent concerns re swine (h1n1) flu Repeat this setence, but with the correct capitalization.","output":"2.

A:","output":"Yes, I can certainly provide an insightful answer to your complex question regarding the Somali National Alliance and the Battle of Mogadishu. The Somali National Alliance (SNA) was a coalition of factions that emerged during the Somali Civil War, which began in the late 1980s and continued into the early 1990s. The SNA was established in June 1992 under the leadership of General Mohamed Farah Aidid. It consisted of various subclans and armed factions with the primary goal of overthrowing the government of President Siad Barre, who ultimately was deposed in 1991. After Barre's fall, chaos ensued as different factions and warlords competed for control, leading to a devastating humanitarian crisis in the region. The Battle of Mogadishu, which took place on October 3-4, 1993, was an armed conflict between US forces and the SNA. It was part of Operation Restore Hope, a United Nations (UN) mission to restore stability and deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Somalia suffering from famine and civil war. The immediate catalyst for the battle was the UN and US forces' attempt to capture key SNA leaders, including Mohamed Farah Aidid, in order to weaken the power of the Somali warlords and foster a more stable environment for humanitarian efforts. The US forces, supported by Malaysian and Pakistani UN troops, launched a raid into the heart of Mogadishu, known as Operation Gothic Serpent, with the aim of arresting two of Aidid's high-ranking lieutenants. However, things quickly went awry for the US forces during the raid. Two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down, and Somali militia, backed by SNA, fiercely resisted the attempted arrests. The intense urban warfare lasted for a night and a day, with both sides suffering significant casualties. The US lost 18 soldiers and had 73 wounded, while it is estimated that hundreds of Somali militiamen and civilians were killed in the skirmish. The Battle of Mogadishu significantly impacted the international community's perception of the causes and potential outcomes of the intervention in Somalia, leading to reduced international involvement and an eventual withdrawal of the US forces in 1994. In conclusion, the Somali National Alliance and the Battle of Mogadishu are intrinsically linked as the SNA was the main party to come into conflict with the US forces during the battle. The SNA, led by General Mohamed Farah Aidid, provided organizational support and resistance to the US-UN intervention in Somalia, eventually leading to one of the most notorious urban warfare incidents in modern history. This intertwined history between the two further highlights the complexity of the Somali Civil War, international intervention, and the legacy of the conflict that persists to this day."},{"instruction":"Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who formed the band named Jaojoby? , can you please find it? After several years having focused entirely on his career with the Regional Information Service, Jaojoby was approached in 1987 by Frenchman Pierre Henri Donat to contribute several recordings to Madagascar's first salegy compilation album, Les Grands Maîtres du Salegy (\\"Grand Masters of Salegy\\"). The runaway success of one of the tracks he composed and performed, \\"Samy Mandeha Samy Mitady\\", elevated salegy from a regional genre to one of nationwide popularity, leading a newspaper to declare him the \\"King of Salegy\\". High demand for live performances led the singer to return to Antananarivo in 1988 to form a band named \\"Jaojoby\\" that included former bandmates from Los Matadores and The Players. Jaojoby begin touring regularly at home and abroad, performing his first international concerts in Paris in 1989. In the meantime, he worked as a press attaché for the Ministry of Transport, Meteorology and Tourism from 1990 until 1993, at which point he left his job to become a full-time musician.The 1992 release of Jaojoby's first full-length album, titled Salegy!, was facilitated by fRoots magazine editor Ian Anderson, who had worked with Jaojoby to record several of his tracks for a radio broadcast two years previously. Jaojoby's second album, Velono, was the first salegy album to be recorded in France, as well as the first of his albums to be produced in a professional-quality recording studio. Following the 1994 release of Velono, Jaojoby became a regular on the international music festival circuit and has performed at such events as WOMAD in Reading, the Festival du Bout du Monde in Brittany, WOMEX in Spain, the Festival des Musiques Métisses in Angoulême, the MASA Festival in Abidjan, and similar events in Germany, the Netherlands, and Portugal.

He was given a Catholic upbringing by his parents, John William Sutcliffe and his wife Kathleen Frances (nee Coonan). Reportedly a loner, he left school aged fifteen and had a series of menial jobs, including two stints as a gravedigger in the 1960s. Between November 1971 and April 1973, Sutcliffe worked at the Baird Television factory on a packaging line. West Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents. Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside background, and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the FBI, plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that \\"Wearside Jack\\" was a blatant hoaxer. The investigation used it as a point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The \\"Wearside Jack\\" hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services. In response to the police reaction to the murders, the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group organised a number of 'Reclaim the Night' marches. The group and other feminists had criticised the police for victim-blaming, especially the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12 November 1977. They made the point that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men's violence. In 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during action for damages on behalf of her daughter's estate, argued in the High Court that the police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending the murderer of her daughter in Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire. The House of Lords held that the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire did not owe a duty of care to the victim due to the lack of proximity and therefore failing on the second limb of the Caparo test.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What had to happen to the floor","output":"of the incident room to cope with the weight of the paper?

The ballad evolved from \\"Hey Jules\\", a song McCartney wrote to comfort John Lennon's son, Julian, during his parents' divorce. \\"Hey Jude\\" begins with a verse-bridge structure incorporating McCartney's vocal performance and piano accompaniment; further instrumentation is added as the song progresses. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a fade-out coda that lasts for more than four minutes. \\" Having earmarked the song for release as a single, the Beatles recorded \\"Hey Jude\\" during the sessions for their self-titled double album, commonly known as \\"the White Album\\". The sessions were marked by an element of discord within the group for the first time, partly as a result of Ono's constant presence at Lennon's side, and also reflective of the four band members' divergence following their communal trip to Rishikesh in the spring of 1968 to study Transcendental Meditation. Author Peter Doggett describes the completed version of \\"Hey Jude\\" as a song that \\"glowed with optimism after a summer that had burned with anxiety and rage within the group\\". The Beatles first taped 25 takes of the song at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London over two nights, 29 and 30 July 1968, with George Martin as their producer. These dates served as rehearsals, however, since they planned to record the master track at Trident Studios to utilise their eight-track recording machine (Abbey Road was still limited to four-tracks). A take from 29 July, which author and critic Kenneth Womack describes as a \\"jovial\\" session, was issued on the Anthology 3 compilation in 1996. The 30 July rehearsals were filmed for a short documentary titled Music! However, the film shows only three of the Beatles performing \\"Hey Jude\\", as George Harrison remained in the studio control room, with Martin and EMI recording engineer Ken Scott. Author Simon Leng views this as indicative of how Harrison was increasingly allowed little room to develop ideas on McCartney compositions, whereas he was free to create empathetic guitar parts for Lennon's songs of the period. During the rehearsals that day, Harrison and McCartney had a heated disagreement over the lead guitar part for the song. Harrison's idea was to play a guitar phrase as a response to each line of the vocal, which did not fit with McCartney's conception of the song's arrangement, and he vetoed it. In a 1994 interview, McCartney said, \\"looking back on it, I think, Okay. Well, it was bossy, but it was ballsy of me, because I could have bowed to the pressure.\\" Ron Richards, a record producer who worked for Martin at both Parlophone and AIR Studios, said McCartney was \\"oblivious to anyone else's feelings in the studio\\", and that he was driven to making the best possible record, at almost any cost.

Article:","output":"Title: Unfortunate Series of Events: Wrong Place, Wrong Time & Wrong Mindset Have you ever been caught up in an unfortunate situation, completely by chance? A similar tale of mishaps unfolded recently when being in the wrong place at the wrong time and in the wrong state of mind resulted in an unintentional run-in with law enforcement. The incident, which occurred on Sunday night near Tampa, Florida, began when deputies and aviation unit members from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office made a surprising discovery in a mangrove patch. A total of almost 70 mature marijuana plants were found, weighing a substantial 77 pounds and carrying an estimated street value of nearly 115,000. The plants were discovered in the vicinity of a Courtney Campbell Causeway boat ramp, with WFLA reporting the head-turning scene. But the real story unfolded when an unexpected turn of events stole the spotlight. During the removal of the illicit plants, a car crash occurred. The source of the crash was a 2007 Chevy Tahoe, driven by a 25-year-old, Yasiel Martinez. Martinez inadvertently rammed his vehicle into the back of one of the deputy's parked cars, with the deputy still inside it, according to the Tampa Tribune. Under normal circumstances, this might have been categorized as a simple accident. However, investigators found that Martinez appeared to be intoxicated. At the scene, two blood alcohol concentration (BAC) tests were administered to Martinez, and the readings showed .143 and .144, respectively—well above the legal limit. As a result, Martinez was charged with driving under the influence and taken into custody at a local jail. He was later released on Monday morning after posting a 500 bail. The story does not mention how the deputy involved in the vehicle collision is faring, but one can imagine the sheer coincidence of crashing into a law enforcement vehicle while officers are in the midst of confiscating a significant amount of marijuana. In a twist of irony, one can't help but think of the old adage that timing is everything. In conclusion, this remarkable case highlights how being in the wrong place at the wrong time and with the wrong mindset can lead to highly unlikely, yet potentially serious consequences. Not only did Yasiel Martinez unwittingly stumble upon an active police operation, but his intoxicated state and the resulting car crash brought him face-to-face with the very officers who were just moments away from carrying out a major drug bust. No doubt, this story will serve as a cautionary tale for the importance of responsible decision-making and a healthy respect for chance encounters."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

PUBLISHED:. 11:35 EST, 27 March 2012. |. UPDATED:. 12:59 EST, 28 March 2012. Fanatic: Gunman Mohammed Merah, who is said to have recorded the footage sent to Al-Jazeera. A disturbing video showing the killings of three French soldiers and four people at a Jewish school was sent to a TV network - but not by the gunman who filmed it, police said. The revelation raises the possibility of an accomplice to the crimes. Arabic TV network Al-Jazeera has said it will not air the footage of the Toulouse shootings after the video arrived at its office in Paris. It appears to have been recorded during Mohammed Merah's deadly attacks earlier this month. The decision not to broadcast the video, which was sent on a USB memory stick along with a letter to the station, came after French president Nicolas Sarkozy and family of the victims had asked for it not to be shown. Police believe it was filmed by the gunman himself, who was killed last week after a 32-hour stand-off with police at his apartment. Merah recorded all of his murders, which began on March 11 with the shooting of a French soldier. Before the rampage ended, two more soldiers, three Jewish children and a rabbi were killed. Al-Jazeera's announcement came as it emerged that Merah's convicted criminal father plans to sue the French government for ‘murdering’ his son. In what is likely to be one of the most controversial legal actions in criminal history, Mohammed Benalel Merah wants an apology and compensation. This is despite the fact that he is a convicted drug dealer who had next to nothing to do with his son from the age of six, and now lives in Algeria. Mr Merah, who is in his 60s, said that his son, who murdered seven people in total, stood ‘no chance’ against the police. Meanwhile, it has been claimed that the killer had spied for the French secret service before his ten-day spree. Italian. newspaper Il Foglio alleges that the Muslim fanatic acted as an. informer to the DGSE intelligence agency while travelling to Israel,. Jordan and Afghanistan in 2010. In return for information about Islamic terror cells, the paper said, French agents allowed Merah to travel freely. Il Foglio claims details of this arrangement were leaked by French and Israeli spies. Respect: President Nicolas Sarkozy delivers a speech today before magistrates and policemen who investigated the shootings. Earlier he joined calls for the gunman's footage not to be aired after it was sent to broadcasters. Elsewhere. on the continent, police in Spain arrested a suspected Al Qaeda member. who is thought to have been key to the terror cell's internet. operations, spreading propaganda and working to recruit jihadists. Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz. said the arrest was not connected to the murders in France, adding that. the Jordanian-born Saudi citizen had 'administered one of the world's. most important jihadist forums'. The letter sent to Al-Jazeera said Merah's killings were carried out in the name of Al Qaeda. Zied Tarrouche, the network's Paris bureau chief, said the note was written in poor French with spelling and grammatical errors. The. images it accompanied appear to have been taken from the point of view. of the killer, he said, perhaps from a camera hung around Merah's neck. They were shaky but of a high technical quality. The video had clearly been edited with. religious songs and recitations of Koranic verses laid over the. footage, Mr Tarrouche said. He added: 'You can hear gunshots at. the moment of the killings. You can hear the voice of this person who. has committed these assassinations. You can hear also the cries of the. victims, and the voices were distorted.' Earlier Mr Sarkozy had asked that the images not be broadcast. 'I. ask the managers of all television stations that might have these. images not to broadcast them in any circumstances, out of respect for. the victims - out of respect for the Republic,' he said. Family: Police arrest Abdelkader Merah, the gunman's older brother. The killer's father has now spoken out in public, vowing to sue the French government for shooting his son dead. There has been no indication that other stations received the footage. Mr Tarrouche said: 'We are not a. sensationalist channel. We're not looking to broadcast images without. weighing the risks and the consequences. That's why the management will. decide today after meeting at headquarters in Qatar.' The decision not to broadcast the images came a few hours later. As. France tries to come to terms with the attacks shown in the video, the. gunman's estranged father says French special forces could easily have. ‘taken my son alive’. Mr Merah said: ‘They could have used gas to capture him, but they preferred to kill him. ‘I’m. going to hire the biggest named lawyers and work for the rest of my. life to pay their costs. I will sue France for killing my son.’ Siege: A hooded policeman looks out of a window at the bullet-ridden apartment where Merah made his last stand. The killer's father claims police could have taken him alive. His move was immediately condemned by. Mr Sarkozy’s government, who revealed that Mohammed Benalel Merah spent. four years in prison in Toulouse before returning to his homeland of. Algeria. In 1999 he was arrested for drug. dealing on the Toulouse estate where Mohammed junior grew up, and in. June 2000 he was sentenced to five years in prison. The term was. increased by nine months for witness tampering. Alain. Juppe, France’s foreign secretary, said: ‘If I was the father of a. monster like that, I’d shut up out of shame’, while a spokesman for Mr. Sarkozy said the legal action was ‘abhorrent’. Anti-terrorist prosecutor Francois Molins, meanwhile, said police did ‘everything they could to arrest Merah alive’. The French authorities' activities prior to Merah's killings have also come into question. Security chiefs were today refusing to comment on Il Foglio's claim that they may have been working with the killer before his attacks in south-west France. The Italian newspaper said: 'Merah was considered to fit the profile of the kind of young man who could infiltrate terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and provide crucial intelligence to western countries.' Prime Minister Francois Fillon last week defended the state's intelligence agencies and insisted France had had 'no grounds' to detain Merah before he went on his rampage. He told French radio: 'There was no single element to allow for the detention of Mohammed Merah. France mourns: Hundreds of people gather in Toulouse's Capitol square for a minute's silence in memory of Merah's victims. 'Intelligence agents had watched him for long enough to come to the conclusion that there was no indication that this was a dangerous man who would one day pass from words to acts. 'Merah was interrogated, watched and listened to, and appeared to be a man living a normal life.' The self-styled Islamic warrior, who was shot dead by police marksmen, is said to be buried in Algeria, so that his grave will not be desecrated in France. Merah’s brother, 29-year-old Abdelkader Merah, has been charged with aiding and abetting the terrorist. Both brothers are thought to have been members of radical Islamic groups in Toulouse, and Merah was known to security services in both France and America. Spanish police today arrested a suspected member of Al Qaeda who was key to the terror group's internet propaganda and recruiting operations, officials said. The suspect arrested in the eastern city of Valencia 'administered one of the world's most important jihadist forums', dedicated to recruiting and indoctrinating Islamic terrorists, Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said. The name of that forum and the suspect's name were not given, only his initials, MHA. He is Jordanian-born with Saudi citizenship. 'He was known within the organisation as Al Qaeda's librarian,' Mr Fernandez Diaz said, without specifying what that term meant in this case. The suspect worked at home for '8 to 15 hours a day' for Al Qaeda and for two offshoots, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the minister said. 'He spread jihadist ideas and worked to recruit and arrange transportation of possible jihadists to Afghanistan and other countries where terrorism is very active,' Mr Fernandez Diaz said. The Interior Ministry said in a statement he was arrested as part of a probe that determined the man used the Web to distribute videos designed to encourage terrorist acts, the ministry said in a statement. The minister said the raid in which he was arrested was not linked to the recent killings in Toulouse, France. However, he added that gunman Mohammed Merah became indoctrinated thanks to the work of people like the Valencia suspect. Spanish authorities said today's arrest stemmed from a probe that began in February 2011. The suspect was arrested at home on orders from an investigating magistrate in Madrid. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This comprehensive article contains a number of significant points revolving around the 2012 attacks in Toulouse, France, carried out by Mohammed Merah, who filmed his killings and expressed affiliation with Al Qaeda. Here are the main takeaways from this article: 1. Shocking Video Footage: A disturbing video showing the killings of three French soldiers and four people at a Jewish school was recorded by the shooter, Mohammed Merah, and sent to Arabic TV network Al-Jazeera. However, the footage was sent not by the gunman himself, but by an unidentified individual, raising the possibility of an accomplice. 2. Al-Jazeera's Decision: Responding to appeals from French president Nicolas Sarkozy and the victims' families, Al-Jazeera decided not to air the video. 3. Merah's Father's Intent to Sue: Mohammed Benalel Merah, Mohammed Merah's father, who was largely absent from his son's life and is a convicted drug dealer living in Algeria, plans to sue the French government for the death of his son. His reasoning was that they could have captured his son alive instead. 4. Merah's Possible Connection with French Intelligence: Italian newspaper Il Foglio suggested that Merah may have worked as an informant for the DGSE intelligence agency in 2010, providing information on Islamic terror cells while traveling through Israel, Jordan, and Afghanistan. Merah's free travel was supposed to be a result of this arrangement. 5. Merah's Brother Arrested: Mohammed Merah's brother, Abdelkader Merah, was arrested and charged with complicity in the terrorism, raising questions about potential radical Islamic networks operating in Toulouse. 6. Al Qaeda Member Arrested in Spain: Spanish police arrested a key member of Al Qaeda, involved in the terror group's online operations. The arrest in Valencia was unrelated to the Toulouse attacks but sheds light on the larger digital network of extremist recruitment and propaganda. 7. Legal and Sociopolitical Fallout: The act of Merah's father to sue the state sparked significant outrage in France. There were also questions about how the French intelligence agencies handled the situation as it emerged that they might have collaborated with Merah in the past. Overall, the article deals with a number of violent events and their dire repercussions, leaving a lasting impact on multiple nations."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

UPDATED:. 19:51 EST, 6 October 2013. Cecil Parkinson’s love child may have cost him a chance to try for the Tory leadership, newly released files from the Margaret Thatcher archives have revealed. The documents, which include his resignation letter, record the downfall of the man who the Prime Minister was widely thought to have considered her heir. They reveal that Mrs Thatcher was secretly planning to appoint Mr Parkinson as Foreign Secretary, a move that would have kickstarted his rise to the top. Instead, he informed her on the day of the 1983 election that he was having an affair with his former secretary, Sara Keays, and that she had become pregnant with his child. Notes on a scandal: Cecil Parkinson and Margaret Thatcher during the Conservative Party Conference in 1981. Thatcher may have been considering him as her successor before his admission of a love child derailed his political career. Heart-felt: Cecil Parkinson's previously-unpublished resignation note and Mrs Thatcher's reply. The 30-year-old files have been released from the archives at Churchill College, Cambridge. They reveal the chaos that ruined Mrs Thatcher’s reshuffle plans. Her notes from the time show that she intended to make Mr Parkinson Foreign Secretary, though her staff’s reshuffle documents suggest that they did not know about the idea. Chris Collins from the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, the only historian to have studied the files, said she had essentially anointed him as her successor. He said: ‘It’s only speculative that she considered him to be her successor but it would appear that she was very serious about him indeed. Cecil Parkinson with his wife Ann. He had been having an affair with his secretary for 12 years. Scandal: Sara Keays, former secretary and mistress of Cecil Parkinson. News of their affair and her pregnancy forced Parkinson to resign in October 1983. ‘He had risen very fast and she knew that by promoting him in this way, she would create an atmosphere around him.’ The former party chairman told Mrs Thatcher about his 12-year affair on June 9, 1983, the day of the election. How Diana stole the limelight. He wrote to her: ‘It seems strange that after over eight years on the front bench as part of your team, I am now to be a spectator of events rather than a participant in them.’ Mrs Thatcher later received a letter from Miss Keays’s father Colonel Keays, but she is believed to have burned the note in a fireplace at Chequers. As a result of the news, she decided to delay the reshuffle by a day – and made Mr Parkinson secretary for trade and industry instead. At the time, she wrote to Judge Alan King-Hamilton saying: ‘It has been a most difficult week – and such a sad ending for everyone. ‘These days it is not permitted to suffer one’s wounds in private. There has been no peace for Cecil and Ann [his wife].’ Mr Parkinson was forced to resign a few months later on October 14 after Miss Keays decided to publish a statement to ‘put the record straight’ regarding the nature of their relationship. She wrote: ‘My baby was conceived in a long-standing, loving relationship which I allowed to continue because I believed in our eventual marriage.’ Flora Keays was born on New Year’s Eve 1983, although an injunction prevented her identity from being known or publicly reported until she turned 18. She was diagnosed with learning disabilities and Asperger syndrome – and needed surgery to remove a brain tumour when she was four. Mr Parkinson’s resignation letter and Mrs Thatcher’s reply were never published, possibly because they could have prolonged the embarrassing scandal. However along with other documents they have now been made available to the public, and can be accessed online at www.margaret thatcher.org. The files reveal that she replied to Mr Parkinson’s letter saying: ‘I am saddened beyond words both by the loss of your contribution as a member of the Government and by the tragic circumstances in which that loss has come about.’ But Mrs Thatcher also made it clear that she expected him to remain with his wife. Journalists at the time were suspicious that it had been Mrs Thatcher who prevented the couple from splitting up. Mr Parkinson remained in his marriage – and returned to the government in 1987. * Treasury staff hid silver cutlery from Margaret Thatcher to stop her taking it for the Cabinet table, the files reveal. Douglas Wass, who was the first permanent secretary of the Treasury, told the Prime Minister in his leaving speech: ‘The Treasury has a splendid collection of Georgian silver. ‘When you heard this, your ears pricked up. I gave instructions that during your visit it was to be kept out of sight. ‘I now know what the monks must have felt when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries!’ Letter: John Nott praised the former PM's looks. John Nott wrote a letter paying tribute to Margaret Thatcher and her ‘good looks’ when he resigned as defence secretary. He wrote: ‘It is inexcusable to say so nowadays, but I actually admire you as a woman – your good looks, charm and bearing have always attracted me, as a man. 'I’m sorry, but what is wrong with that! ‘I think your emotional, instinctive and unpragmatic approach to most issues – so very unmasculine – is the secret of your success in the male-dominated world of politics.’ Mr Nott did not receive a reply and although Mrs Thatcher marked, underlined and scrawled on almost every document she ever read, his letter was left blank. He left the government in 1983 and was replaced by Michael Heseltine after being criticised over the 1981 defence white paper. In his letter he wrote: ‘Your greatest triumph as a PM, if I may say so, is that your colleagues actually like you. Some of them even love you, just a little!’ He signed off the rather personal letter with: ‘Love – John.’ Margaret Thatcher may have been aware that Alan Clark was having an affair when she appointed him as a minister. In a previously secret note to Mrs Thatcher, her principal private secretary Ian Gow urged her not to allow his dalliance with ‘this absurd girl’ to prevent the appointment. The note does not spell out who the girl is, but Mr Clark’s many affairs have been documented by his biographer, who has had access to his personal papers. Mrs Thatcher did not reply to the note, but Mr Clark received his first ministerial posting as a parliamentary under-secretary at the Department of Employment in 1983.

Margaret Thatcher was a very important leader in the United Kingdom. She liked Cecil Parkinson a lot and thought he could be a great leader too. But there was a problem. Cecil Parkinson had a girlfriend named Sara who worked with him, and they had a baby together. This was a big surprise because Cecil was already married to another lady named Ann. When people found out about this, it caused a lot of trouble. Margaret Thatcher was going to give Cecil a big job to help him become a leader, but she changed her mind when she learned about his secret family. Cecil had to leave his important job, and this made Margaret Thatcher and many other people very sad.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more sediment forms happens, how will it affect more matter to compress and heat. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in sediment formation occurs, potentially leading to more matter to be compressed and heated. Step 2: Evaluate the potential effect of increased sediment formation on the compression and heating of matter If the sediment formation increases in the sea, it can lead to a thicker layer of sediment formed above the dead organisms' matter on the sea floor. Step 3: Consider the potential impact on the compression and heating of the matter With more sediment accumulating, the pressure applied to the dead organisms' matter on the sea floor will increase. This increase in pressure, coupled with the heat from Earth's interior that gets trapped by the overlying sediment, could result in the matter becoming compressed and heated more quickly. Step 4: Assess the potential effect on the overall process of crude oil formation An increase in sediment formation could potentially accelerate the process of crude oil formation by increasing the pressure and heat applied to the dead organisms' matter. However, this acceleration would depend on various factors, such as the rate of sediment accumulation, the composition of the sediment, and other geological and environmental factors. Conclusion: The perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in sediment formation could directly affect the process of crude oil formation by potentially leading to faster compression and heating of the dead organisms' matter. However, further investigation would be needed to understand the extent to which this increased sediment formation impacts the overall process, as several factors could influence the specific outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Japanese.

Shakespeare in Love is a 1998 American romantic period comedy-drama film directed by John Madden, written by Marc Norman and playwright Tom Stoppard. The film depicts an imaginary love affair involving Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) and playwright William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) while he was writing Romeo and Juliet. Several characters are based on historical figures, and many of the characters, lines, and plot devices allude to Shakespeare's plays. The original idea for Shakespeare in Love came to screenwriter Marc Norman in the late 1980s after a rudimentary pitch from his son Zachary. Norman wrote a draft screenplay which he presented to director Edward Zwick, which attracted Julia Roberts, who agreed to play Viola. However, Zwick disliked Norman's screenplay and hired the playwright Tom Stoppard to improve it (Stoppard's first major success had been with the Shakespeare-themed play Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead). The film went into production in 1991 at Universal, with Zwick as director, but although sets and costumes were in construction, Shakespeare had not yet been cast, because Roberts insisted that only Daniel Day-Lewis could play the role. Day-Lewis was uninterested, and when Roberts failed to persuade him, she withdrew from the film, six weeks before shooting was due to begin. The production went into turnaround, and Zwick was unable to persuade other studios to take up the screenplay. Eventually, Zwick got Miramax interested in the screenplay, but Miramax chose John Madden as director. Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein acted as producer, and persuaded Ben Affleck to take a small role as Ned Alleyn. The film was considerably reworked after the first test screenings. The scene with Shakespeare and Viola in the punt was re-shot, to make it more emotional, and some lines were re-recorded to clarify the reasons why Viola had to marry Wessex. The ending was re-shot several times, until Stoppard eventually came up with the idea of Viola suggesting to Shakespeare that their parting could inspire his next play. Among the locations used in the production were Hatfield House, Hertfordshire (for the fireworks scene), Broughton Castle, Oxfordshire (which played the role of the de Lesseps home), the beach at Holkham in Norfolk, the chapel at Eton College, Berkshire, and the Great Hall of Middle Temple, London.

It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Kevin Toms (born 22, April 1957 in Paignton) is a British computer game designer who founded Addictive Games and is famous for creating the original \\"Football Manager\\", a simulation game released in the early 1980s that included a portrait of his bearded face on publicity material and cassette covers. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA).

His exit is coming up soon so he let's up on the gas a little and makes a left turn onto the exit. After a short way he pulls into a parking lot reaching his destination. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Given a car is accelerating, is it being acted upon by a balanced or unbalanced force? Hint: A car’s gas pedal, like the one in Figure below , is sometimes called the accelerator. That’s because it controls the acceleration of the car. Pressing down on the gas pedal gives the car more gas and causes the car to speed up. Letting up on the gas pedal gives the car less gas and causes the car to slow down. Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force. Answer:","output":"An accelerating car is being acted upon by an unbalanced force. Step 1: Understand the concept of acceleration Acceleration refers to a change in velocity, which can occur when an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction. Step 2: Relate acceleration to the forces acting on a car When a car is accelerating, it is experiencing a change in velocity, which means there must be an unbalanced force acting on it. When Eric stepped on the gas pedal, he increased the power delivered to the car's engine, producing a greater forward force. Conversely, when he let up on the gas pedal, he provided less power to the engine, resulting in an unbalanced force that caused the car to slow down. Step 3: Analyze the situation provided In the given scenario, Eric let up on the gas pedal, which reduced the power delivered to the engine and caused the car to slow down. This reduction in speed is deceleration, which is a type of acceleration. Step 4: Conclude based on the information Since acceleration occurs when there's an unbalanced force acting on the object, and the car in the situation experienced acceleration, we can conclude that it is being acted upon by an unbalanced force."},{"instruction":"John Barnard (6 July 1794 at Chislehurst, Kent; died 17 November 1878 at Cambridge, England) was an English amateur cricketer who played first-class cricket from 1815 to 1830.

New York City's suburbs are situated between the humid subtropical climate zone (Cfa) and the humid continental climate zone (Dfa). The humid continental climate zone is characterized by having significant temperature differences between seasons, cold winters, and warm to hot summers, whereas the humid subtropical climate has hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters. The transition between these climate zones is influenced by factors such as the city's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, the moderating influence of water bodies, and the impacts of urban heat island effect within the city.

In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent 13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent. Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was 2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. Part of the problem was the cost of restoration of the new property and the deteriorating equipment. In addition, while the tourists in Vermont had enjoyed the sights of cornfields, farms, covered bridges, a waterfall and a gorge on a Steamtown excursion, the Scranton trip to Moscow, Pennsylvania, cut through one of the nation's largest junkyards, an eyesore described by Ralph Nader as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\".In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the spending of 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of 66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study.

Yet it might be time to add another, even more common protagonist: the idle young American. For all of Europe’s troubles — a left-right combination of sclerotic labor markets and austerity — the United States has quietly surpassed much of Europe in the percentage of young adults without jobs. It’s not just Europe, either. Over the last 12 years, the United States has gone from having the highest share of employed 25- to 34-year-olds among large, wealthy economies to having among the lowest. The grim shift — “a historic turnaround,” says Robert A. Moffitt, a Johns Hopkins University economist — stems from two underappreciated aspects of our long economic slump. First, it has exacted the harshest toll on the young — even harsher than on people in their 50s and 60s, who have also suffered. And while the American economy has come back more robustly than some of its global rivals in terms of overall production, the recovery has been strangely light on new jobs, even after Friday’s better-than-expected unemployment report. American companies are doing more with less. “This still is a very big puzzle,” said Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard professor who was chief economist at the Labor Department during the Clinton administration. He called the severe downturn in jobs “the million-dollar question” for the economy. Employers are particularly reluctant to add new workers — and have been for much of the last 12 years. Layoffs have been subdued, with the exception of the worst months of the financial crisis, but so has the creation of jobs, and no one depends on new jobs as much as younger workers do. For them, the Great Recession grinds on. For many people with jobs and nest eggs, the economy is finally moving in the right direction, albeit a long way from booming. Average wages are no longer trailing inflation. Stocks have soared since their 2009 nadir, and home prices are increasing again. But little of that helps younger adults trying to get a foothold in the economy. Many of them are on the outside of the recovery looking in. The net worth of households headed by people 44 and younger has dropped more over the past decade than the net worth of middle-aged and elderly households, according to the Federal Reserve. According to the Labor Department, workers 25 to 34 years old are the only age group with lower average wages in early 2013 than in 2000. The problems start with a lack of jobs. In 2011, the most recent year for which international comparisons exist, 26.2 percent of Americans between ages 25 and 34 were not working. That includes those for whom unemployment is a choice (those in graduate school, for example, or taking care of children) and those for whom it is not (the officially unemployed or those who are out of work and no longer looking). The share was 20.2 percent in Canada, 20.5 percent in Germany, 21 percent in Japan, 21.6 percent in Britain and 22 percent in France. The European economy has deteriorated over the last two years, and the American economy has strengthened modestly. But the job growth here has been fast enough merely to keep pace with population growth, which suggests that this country still lags in the employment of young adults. In 2000, by contrast, the United States led Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Japan — as well as Australia, Russia and Sweden — in such employment rates. The nation now trails them all. Older American workers have also lost relative ground, but not as much. As Mr. Katz, Mr. Moffitt and others note, an explanation of the root causes remains elusive. But there are obvious suspects, and each probably plays a role. The United States, for example, has lost its once-large lead in producing college graduates, and education remains the most successful jobs strategy in a globalized, technology-heavy economy. It is no accident that the most educated places in the country, like Boston, Minneapolis, Washington and Austin, Tex., have high employment rates while the least educated, including many in the South and inland California, have low ones. The official unemployment rate for 25- to 34-year-old college graduates remains just 3.3 percent. Beyond education, the nation has also been less aggressive than some others in using counseling and retraining to help the jobless find work. To take one small example, a recent study in France by the renowned M.I.T. economist Esther Duflo and four colleagues found that placement programs for unemployed workers helped not only the workers but the economy too. The counseled workers were more likely to find work, and they did not simply take jobs from other candidates. Overall employment rose more quickly in the regions with job counseling. Other research notes that the United States has expanded parental leave and part-time work less than other countries — and, perhaps relatedly, employment rates among women here have slipped. Whatever role these trends are playing, they do not appear to fully explain the employment decline. It is too big and too widespread. Existing companies are not adding jobs at the same rate they once did, and new companies are not forming as quickly. What might help? Easing the parts of the regulatory thicket without societal benefits. Providing public financing for the sorts of early-stage scientific research and physical infrastructure that the private sector often finds unprofitable. Long term, nothing is likely to matter more than improving educational attainment, from preschool through college (which may have started already). Many business executives and economists also point to immigration policy. Done right, an overhaul could make a difference, many say, by allowing more highly skilled immigrants to enter the country and by making life easier for those immigrants already here. Historically, immigrants have started more than their share of new companies. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the jobs slump is that the Americans in their 20s and 30s who have been most affected by it remain decidedly upbeat. They are much more hopeful than older generations, polls show, that the country’s future will be better than its past. Based on what younger adults have been through, that resilience is impressive. It’s probably necessary, too. The jobs slump will not end without a large dose of optimism. David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

How to clean keens Use a stiff bristle brush to remove lose dirt. Scrub the outside of your keens, including the tread, to remove lose dirt and debris. Scrub them until all of the dirt and debris are removed.","output":"After removing the loose dirt from your Keens, rinse them thoroughly with water, ensuring that any residual dirt is washed away, paying close attention to hard-to-reach areas such as crevices and shoelace eyelets. If your shoes have removable insoles or footbed liners, take them out and gently scrub them with mild soap and water to remove any dirt, grime, and odors. Once they are clean, rinse them well and place them aside to air dry. Next, prepare a mixture of warm water and a small amount of gentle detergent, stirring the solution until it forms light suds. Dampen a soft cloth or sponge in the soapy water, wring out any excess, and gently clean the inner and outer surfaces of your Keens. Focus on areas that have stains or marks, using a gentle circular motion to lift and dissolve any stubborn dirt. Should you encounter any particularly challenging stains, moisten a soft-bristled toothbrush with the soapy water and gently scrub the affected area, taking care not to damage the shoe's material. Once the stains have been treated, wet a clean cloth with water and use it to remove any soap residue from your Keens. Be sure to go over every part of the shoe to ensure that no soap is left behind, as this may cause discoloration or irritation while wearing them. Now that your Keens have been thoroughly cleaned, it's time to dry them. It's essential to avoid using direct heat sources such as a hairdryer or radiator, as these may damage the shoe's material and cause it to become brittle or warped. Instead, place your Keens in a well-ventilated area and stuff them with paper towels or clean rags to help absorb any excess moisture. This will also help maintain their shape while they dry. If your Keens have laces, remove them, clean them with the soapy water, rinse them thoroughly, and hang them up to air-dry separately. Once both your Keens and their laces are completely dry, re-lace the shoes, making sure they're correctly tightened to provide the best support and comfort. Finally, to keep your Keens looking fresh and to prolong their lifespan, consider applying a protective spray or conditioner designed for their specific material, such as fabric, leather, or synthetic materials. This treatment will help to prevent stains, repel water, and protect your shoes from UV damage. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and test the product on a small, inconspicuous area before applying it to the entire shoe. By following these steps, you'll ensure that your Keens will not only look great, but you'll also be able to enjoy their comfort and durability for many adventures to come."},{"instruction":"Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms.","output":"Title: Outstanding and Essential: The True Companion for Android Devices Review: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 stars) I have been using Android devices for years, and throughout my experience, I must say that the com.google.android.gms package has become an indispensable, versatile, and reliable utility app, providing an unparalleled user experience for Android users like myself.

We need to find the sum of the perimeters of all the triangles formed through this process. Let's analyze the process step by step: 1. T1 is given with side length 40 cm, so the perimeter of T1 is 3 * 40 cm = 120 cm. 2. For T2, we join the midpoints of T1's sides. Since T2's sides are formed from connecting the midpoints of T1, each side of T2 has half the length of T1's sides or 40 cm / 2 = 20 cm. So, the perimeter of T2 is 3 * 20 cm = 60 cm. 3. For T3, we again connect the midpoints, in this case of T2's sides. So, T3's sides will have half the length of T2's sides or 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm. The perimeter of T3 is 3 * 10 cm = 30 cm. 4. We continue this process indefinitely, always halving the side lengths of the previous triangle and calculating the perimeter of the new triangle. Notice that the sum of the perimeters has a pattern: 120 cm + 60 cm + 30 cm + ... This is a geometric progression with an initial term 'a' of 120, and a common ratio 'r' of 1/2 (since each new term is half of the previous term). The formula to find the sum of an infinite geometric series is: S = a / (1 - r), where S is the sum, a is the initial term, and r is the common ratio. So, let's apply this formula: S = 120 / (1 - 1/2) S = 120 / (1/2) S = 120 * 2 S = 240 cm Therefore, the sum of the perimeters of all the triangles formed through this process is 240 cm."},{"instruction":"The after-action review had treated the CIA as the lead agency for any offensive against al Qaeda, and the principals, at their March 10 meeting, had endorsed strengthening the CIA's capability for that role. To the CTC, that meant proceeding with \\"The Plan,\\" which it had put forward half a year earlier-hiring and training more case officers and building up the capabilities of foreign security services that provided intelligence via liaison. On occasion, as in Jordan in December 1999, these liaison services took direct action against al Qaeda cells. In the CTC and higher up, the CIA's managers believed that they desperately needed funds just to continue their current counterterrorism effort, for they reckoned that the millennium alert had already used up all of the Center's funds for the current fiscal year; the Bin Laden unit had spent 140 percent of its allocation. Tenet told us he met with Berger to discuss funding for counterterrorism just two days after the principals' meeting. While Clarke strongly favored giving the CIA more money for counterterrorism, he differed sharply with the CIA's managers about where it should come from. They insisted that the CIA had been shortchanged ever since the end of the Cold War. Their ability to perform any mission, counterterrorism included, they argued, depended on preserving what they had, restoring what they had lost since the beginning of the 1990s, and building from there-with across-the-board recruitment and training of new case officers, and the reopening of closed stations. To finance the counterterrorism effort, Tenet had gone to congressional leaders after the 1998 embassy bombings and persuaded them to give the CIA a special supplemental appropriation. Now, in the aftermath of the millennium alert, Tenet wanted a boost in overall funds for the CIA and another supplemental appropriation specifically for counterterrorism. To Clarke, this seemed evidence that the CIA's leadership did not give sufficient priority to the battle against Bin Laden and al Qaeda. He told us that James Pavitt, the head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, \\"said if there's going to be money spent on going after Bin Laden, it should be given to him. My view was that he had had a lot of money to do it and a long time to do it, and I didn't want to put more good money after bad.\\" The CIA had a very different attitude: Pavitt told us that while the CIA's Bin Laden unit did\\"extraordinary and commendable work,\\" his chief of station in London \\"was just as much part of the al Qaeda struggle as an officer sitting in [the Bin Laden unit].\\" The dispute had large managerial implications, for Clarke had found Ailies in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

The process described is essentially a saltwater desalination method, commonly known as distillation, where saltwater is heated to produce steam, which is then collected and condensed back into freshwater, leaving behind the salt. After the salt has been removed, the collected desalinated water undergoes quality testing and treatment to ensure it is safe for its intended purpose, such as drinking, agricultural, or industrial use. The water is treated to remove any remaining impurities, such as dissolved gases or residual contaminants, and is often disinfected by adding trace amounts of chlorine or using ultraviolet (UV) light. The treated water is then pumped into storage facilities or distributed directly through pipelines in the water supply network. Concurrently, the separated salt is collected, processed, and refined for various applications. The salt produced from desalination plants is often not pure enough for direct use in food or other products, so it undergoes several refining steps, including washing, dissolving, filtering, and drying. These steps remove any residual impurities and contaminants, resulting in a high-quality, food-grade salt. Finally, the refined salt is packaged and distributed for use in various sectors, such as food manufacturing, agriculture, water treatment, and other industrial applications. Additionally, the remnants from the process, known as brine, could also be discharged back into the sea, ensuring that environmental regulations and safeguards are followed to minimize any potential harm to marine ecosystems. In summary, the final step in this salt-water separation process consists of ensuring the safe and effective treatment, collection, and storage of the desalinated water, as well as processing and refining the separated salt, transforming it into a usable product for distribution and consumption across different industries."},{"instruction":"Q: Passage: Historically, rubies have also been mined in Thailand, in the Pailin and Samlout District of Cambodia, as well as in Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, India, Namibia, Japan, and Scotland; after the Second World War ruby deposits were found in Madagascar, Nepal, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, and Vietnam.

Sophie Borland. PUBLISHED:. 19:03 EST, 21 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 10:20 EST, 22 November 2012. Lauren Hughes, pictured, died three days after being admitted to hospital with an asthma attack. Nurses who didn’t know how to give the kiss of life went into a panic when a child was admitted to hospital with a severe asthma attack. Her family described scenes of hysteria as staff who were meant to be helping their daughter desperately tried to call senior medics to ask them what to do. Three days later, 15-year-old Lauren Hughes died having suffered brain damage due to a lack of oxygen. The appalling case was revealed by her parents today in a damning report by the Patients Association into failings in NHS care. Pat and Dolly Hughes said one nurse became so distraught at the Ross-on-Wye community hospital she had to be calmed down by a colleague. They said they couldn’t understand how a healthy teenager was able to die of an asthma attack while in hospital. The hospital trust later admitted the nurses at its minor injuries unit weren’t trained in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and should have dialled 999. Lauren had been taken to the unit by her mother when she started to suffer an asthma attack. Initially they couldn’t even get into the hospital as the door had been locked for the evening. Lauren – who was in obvious distress – was also ignored by two paramedics walking out of the hospital who did not stop to help or even let her in. She was eventually transferred to University Hospital North Staffordshire but died three days after the initial attack in May. Dr Peter Wilson, Medical Director at Wye Valley NHS Trust, which runs the community hospital said the trust has carried out a ‘full review’ of the unit where Lauren was treated. Staff have also admitted that nurses are not trained to do CPR as it is ‘above and beyond what is expected of them’. Untrained: Nurses at the Ross-on-Wye Community Hospital didn't know how to carry out the kiss of life. Today’s report on NHS care also found cases of patients being treated ‘worse than animals’ and ridiculed by ‘rude’ nurses. Relatives also say doctors are ignoring their pleas to promise to resuscitate loved ones should they stop breathing. Some families spoke of a lack of compassion among staff who didn’t care if patients ‘lived or died’. In one case, the daughter of a 94-year-old man who was being neglected by nurses told them ‘you wouldn’t treat an animal like that’. Sandra Lamb also revealed how a doctor refused to sign a form agreeing to resuscitate her father should he stop breathing. In another example, an elderly man with dementia was allowed to wander out of hospital and drowned in a river. The family of Ronald Bowman, who was being treated at the Panteg Hospital, Pontypool, South Wales, think he was trying to get home to his wife. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association said: ‘The sad conclusion of this report is that still far too many patients are being shockingly let down by the NHS every day. ‘These appalling and tragic cases serve to highlight the devastating consequences when poor practice is left unchallenged and unchanged. Behind each one are many more unheard voices. ‘Whilst there is a lot to be proud of about the NHS, including the overwhelming majority of staff who are skilled and hard-working, these cases are a tragic wake-up call for those in Westminster as well as on hospital wards.’ Over the past few years a number of reports have drawn attention to examples of poor hospital care, particularly involving the elderly. The Government, along with various NHS organisations, has repeatedly promised to drive up standards and change the culture of the health service. But the Patients Association said that little had changed. It has been producing annual reports of poor care since 2009. Mike Farrah, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health service staff, described the stories in the report as ‘shocking and deeply distressing’.

An Alzheimer’s patient who went missing from a 'dementia friendly' ward drowned in a river near the hospital, his son said. Nick Bowman has accused Panteg County Hospital staff of not appropriately caring for his father Ronald, from Langstone in Newport, who died earlier this year. He said that his family had been assured by healthcare professionals that his 74-year-old father was being well looked after. But after escaping the ward, which is especially designed for patients with dementia, Mr Bowman drowned in a river near to the hospital. The family believe that Mr Bowman was trying to cross the river so he could get home to his wife. Mr Bowman was admitted to the Royal Gwent Hospital suffering with meningitis. He was later transferred to the Hafen Deg ward at Panteg County Hospital in Pontypool, South Wales. His family were told that he would be checked on by ward staff every 15 minutes. But Mr Bowman managed to escape from the ward twice, being found once in the hospital car park and in the reception. Mr Bowman went missing for a third and final time in June this year. Police found his shoes at the bank of a river near to the hospital. Three weeks later Mr Bowman’s body was found four miles downstream from the hospital. His son said: 'We believed that as he had left the ward twice before, that the medical staff would be especially diligent when keeping an eye on my father. This was not the case. 'My family and I are incredibly hurt and distressed that after my father was admitted to hospital with meningitis, and seemingly making a recovery, he was left without any of the basic care that he deserved and he needed.' King George's Hospital, in Ilford, Essex. Joan Girdiefski is afraid to be admitted to her local hospital following the treatment of her sister Margaret Allen. She had been admitted to King George’s Hospital, in Ilford, Essex, and was suffering from advanced breast cancer. Mrs Girdiefski told the Patients Association that when her other sister phoned the ward to ask after Margaret, she was told by a nurse: ‘She is screaming away nicely.’ She said: ‘I would rather die on my own settee than be admitted into the local hospital, because I would hate to depend on people that wouldn’t care if I either lived or died.’ Sandra Lamb accused a doctor at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital of acting like God when he refused to promise to resuscitate her father Edward. Mrs Lamb said on one evening she had tried to summon a nurse to help the 94-year-old but there was no one on the ward. She then noticed 18 other patients had pressed their ‘assistance lights’. When a consultant refused to sign a form promising to resuscitate her father, she told him: ‘You are not God. I brought my father here to make him well, not to kill him.’ Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham.

She then noticed that ‘assistance lights’ had been pressed on the beds of 18 other patients on the wards who had not yet been attended by nurses. And when she tried to get the consultant to sign a form promising to resuscitate her father should the need arise he refused. She said: ‘I asked him why he would not resuscitate if necessary and the reason he gave was that he would not be willing to put his signature to.’ Mr Lamb died last September.

During ancient times, Gibraltar was regarded by the peoples of the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.The Rock was revered by the Greeks and Romans as one of the two Pillars of Hercules, created by the demigod during his tenth labour when he smashed through a mountain separating the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. According to a Phocaean Greek traveller who visited in the sixth century BC, there were temples and altars to Hercules on the Rock where passing travellers made sacrifices. The Spanish later symbolised the importance of the Pillars of Hercules with a heraldic device consisting of a pair of columns with a scroll wrapped around them – a symbol that became the sign and the related Portuguese cifrão ().To the Ancient Romans, Gibraltar was known as Mons Calpe, a name perhaps derived from the Phoenician word kalph, \\"hollowed out\\", presumably in reference to the many limestone caves in the Rock. It was well-known to ancient geographers, but there is no known archaeological evidence of permanent settlements from the ancient period. According to the Roman writer Avienus, the ancient Greek traveller Euctemon recorded that thirty stadia separate [the Pillars of Hercules]; [Euctemon] says that they bristle with woods all over and are always unwelcoming to seamen.

An hour later National Express said it had \\"received an approach in connection with a possible offer for the group from another third party whose intentions are not yet known\\". Sources speculated that interested parties could include Stagecoach, the Scottish travel firm; SNCF, the French operator; as well as Deutsche Bahn of Germany. FirstGroup, which runs First Great Western and is also Britain's biggest bus operator, said National Express had sought a \\"put-up-or-shut-up\\" ruling by the Takeover Panel. Sir Moir Lockhead, deputy chairman and chief executive of FirstGroup, said: \\"In making a preliminary approach to the board of National Express, our intention was to enter discussions with a view to seeking a recommended merger that would create a significant British transport group, in a stronger position to compete with state-run companies across Europe. \\"We believe this combination would have offered a highly compelling proposition to both sets of shareholders.\\" On Wednesday's closing prices, a combination of the two transport companies would have created a business worth £2.14bn. The removal of FirstGroup's bid interest adds to the pressure on National Express to embark on a rights issue to relieve the burden of its £1.2bn debt pile. Analysts believe National Express, which had a market value of £400m before the approach, needs to raise about £400m from investors. Three weeks ago FirstGroup made a \\"very preliminary\\" all-share offer for National Express. Days later, National Express was rocked when the Government announced plans to nationalise the company's flagship East Coast Mainline rail franchise. The company said it would run out of money to operate the service by the end of the year. Richard Bowker, the company's chief executive, resigned at the same time. Mr Bowker won the East Coast franchise in 2007. However, by agreeing in the terms of the deal that National Express would pay £1.4bn to the Government for the right to operate the franchise for eight years, he was blamed for putting unmanageable strain on the company's finances. National Express said it had already sounded out shareholders about a possible rights issue before FirstGroup's approach. Although the response was said to be tepid at the time, banking sources believe that without the problematic franchise, National Express may need to raise only £250m, which may be more acceptable to shareholders. FirstGroup is now barred from bidding for National Express for another six months unless a rival bid emerges, the target's board agrees to a deal or if there is a \\"material change\\" in circumstances. National Express shares closed down 1 at 310¼p and FirstGroup closed up 2½ at 344¾p. Summary:","output":"FirstGroup was interested in joining with National Express, another big company, to create a larger transport group. However, they decided not to make an offer because of some unclear things happening with National Express's train businesses. Later, National Express said that another group was thinking about making an offer to join with them, but we don't know who they are yet. Some people think it could be a company from Scotland, France, or Germany. This whole situation makes it more likely that National Express will need to find ways to deal with its large amount of debt."},{"instruction":"Please add punctuation to this: 2 years ago 0800 DrTuber spanking domination lesbian booty","output":"2 years ago, at 08:00, Dr. Tuber did spanking, domination, lesbian, and booty."},{"instruction":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Throwtheeggsothatitfallsintothenest!","output":"Step 1: Separate words by identifying common words and proper spacing.

Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"No, the statement \\"Life has been found around cracks around ice fractures on Europa\\" is not a verifiable fact as of now. The reasoning is as follows: 1. Europa, one of Jupiter's largest moons, has been a subject of interest for scientists due to its potential to harbor life. The reason behind this interest is the presence of a subsurface ocean beneath its icy surface. 2. Based on observations of Europa's surface and data gathered from various missions (such as Galileo, Hubble Space Telescope, and others), scientists have inferred the existence of plumes that eject water vapor and other particles from beneath the moon's icy crust. This suggests that Europa may have a liquid water ocean beneath its surface. 3. Data from these missions has not provided concrete evidence for the existence of life on Europa. The plumes and cracks on the ice allow scientists to examine material from the subsurface ocean, potentially providing clues about the moon's habitability. 4. NASA's planned Europa Clipper mission, which is expected to launch in the 2020s, aims to further explore the moon's surface, composition, and geology to determine its habitability. This mission may provide additional information regarding the possibility of life on Europa but has not been launched yet. In conclusion, while there is potential for life on Europa due to the subsurface ocean, there has been no verifiable evidence of life found around cracks around ice fractures on Europa as of now."},{"instruction":"Kyle Chandler played in what 2015 romantic film dram based on the 1952 romance novel \\"The Price of Salt\\"?

For females, it is menarche, the onset of menstruation, which occurs, on average, between ages 12 and 13. The age of menarche is influenced by heredity, but a girl's diet and lifestyle contribute as well. Regardless of genes, a girl must have a certain proportion of body fat to attain menarche. Consequently, girls who have a high-fat diet and who are not physically active begin menstruating earlier, on average, than girls whose diet contains less fat and whose activities involve fat reducing exercise (e.g. ballet and gymnastics). Girls who experience malnutrition or are in societies in which children are expected to perform physical labor also begin menstruating at later ages. Besides heredity, what other factors contribute to when menustration begins?","output":"Apart from heredity, several other factors contribute to the onset of menstruation, or menarche, in females. These factors can be broadly categorized into physical, nutritional, environmental, and psychosocial factors. 1. Physical factors: A girl's body composition, particularly her proportion of body fat, plays a crucial role in determining the onset of menarche. Increased body fat may lead to earlier menstruation, while lower body fat may delay it. Girls who participate in activities that reduce body fat, such as ballet or gymnastics, may experience later onset of menarche compared to girls with less physically demanding activities. 2. Nutritional factors: Diet and nutrition can significantly impact the age of menarche. Girls who consume a high-fat diet may experience earlier menstruation compared to those with a lower fat intake. Malnourished girls or those experiencing growth stunting due to inadequate nutrition are likely to experience delayed menstruation. 3. Environmental factors: Exposure to certain environmental chemicals, such as endocrine disruptors, may affect the timing of menarche. These chemicals are present in various consumer products, including some plastics, personal care products, and pesticides. They can interfere with the normal functioning of hormones, potentially leading to earlier or later onset of menstruation. 4. Psychosocial factors: Family environment and stress levels can also play a role in determining the age of menarche. Girls who experience high levels of stress or come from unstable family environments may have delayed menarche. Furthermore, socioeconomic status can influence the onset of menstruation, as living conditions, access to healthcare, and diet quality can directly impact a girl's overall health. 5. Geographic location and ethnicity: Girls living in different geographic regions and different ethnic backgrounds may experience menarche at different ages. This can be due to variations in genetics, lifestyle, environmental factors, and cultural practices. 6. General health and chronic illnesses: The overall health of a girl can also impact the onset of menarche. Girls suffering from chronic illnesses or immune system disorders may experience delayed menstruation. On the other hand, early puberty and menarche might be associated with an increased risk of certain health issues, such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular problems. In summary, various factors, including physical, nutritional, environmental, and psychosocial factors, can substantially influence the onset of menarche in females. It is essential to consider these factors in order to better understand and promote healthy development in girls."},{"instruction":"Article: Enjoy wonderful programmes on Hello TV 7.00 a.m.-8.00 a.m. Follow Billy As Billy grows up, his tail is becoming longer and longer.

Available choices: (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","output":"(A). Yes, we can conclude that \\"The nation's private saving is made up of personal and business saving.\\" As an AI assistant, I understand that you are referring to the components of a nation's private saving. In this context, private saving comprises both personal savings and business savings. Let's break down the two components to provide a more comprehensive understanding: 1. Personal saving: This refers to the portion of an individual's or household's disposable income (income after taxes) that is not consumed or spent. People save money for various reasons, such as making investments, securing their financial future, or preparing for emergencies. Personal saving can include savings in various forms, such as bank accounts, retirement accounts, investments in stocks or bonds, or even physical assets like real estate. 2. Business saving: This constitutes the accumulated earnings and retained profits that businesses generate from their operations. Businesses save money to finance future investments, expand their activities, or maintain a buffer for any economic downturns or unforeseen expenses. Business saving can be in the form of cash reserves, retained earnings reinvested in the company, or investments in marketable securities. By combining personal and business saving, we get a comprehensive view of a nation's private saving. Private saving is an essential component of a country's overall economic stability and growth. When individuals and businesses save and invest, it leads to the accumulation of capital that can be used for various productive purposes, contributing to the overall economic development and well-being of the nation. In conclusion, the statement \\"The nation's private saving is made up of personal and business saving\\" is accurate, as both these components together comprise a nation's private saving. Hence, the correct answer is (A). Yes."},{"instruction":"Four-Cylinder Engines Are Smaller, Quieter and Gaining New Respect Civilizing the 4-cylinder engine, a popular power source for vehicles in the United States dating back to the Model T, once posed a huge challenge. While in-line 4s can be elegantly simple, the up-and-down motion of their pistons produces an annoying — and unavoidable — imbalance that grows with engine size. Modern 4-cylinders provide relief from the buzzing through the use of technologies that can quell the inherent noise and harshness, including counterbalance shafts, sophisticated combustion controls and improved sound deadening and engine mounts. An alternate plan, used by Subaru today (and Volkswagen in earlier times), is to design engines that don’t generate the jitters in the first place. Boxer engines, whose four cylinders are laid flat in 180-degree opposition, naturally cancel out most vibration, without a need for balance shafts. But while boxer 4s (or even the V-4 engines used in many motorcycles) offer advantages in smoothness, automakers say that their modern in-line 4s are smooth enough to satisfy even the fussiest customers. Still, for consumers like Jennifer and Jarid Lukin of Ardsley, N.Y., saving fuel and money remains the biggest lure. The recently traded their 6-cylinder Acura TL for a new Honda Accord EX-L and its 190-horsepower 4. The Accord is rated at 25 m.p.g. in combined city and highway driving by the E.P.A., compared with 21 for the Acura. “With our lifestyle, we didn’t need a 6-cylinder,” Ms. Lukin said. “The 4-cylinder isn’t a racecar, but I’m not racing to day care.” Hybrids, Ms. Lukin said, might post even better mileage, but also cost thousands of dollars extra upfront. “We’re saving money right now, and in the long term,” she said. Those kind of consumer calculations spurred Hyundai to draw up what seemed a bold strategy only a year ago: to build its 2011 Sonata family sedan with only 4-cylinder engines, no optional V-6. Now that choice seems prescient. The midsize Sonata is selling well with a 2.4-liter, direct-injection 4 that is the strongest and most frugal in its class: 200 horsepower with 35 highway m.p.g. Compare that with 1990, when the Sonata’s 4 produced a puny 116 horsepower and just 25 highway m.p.g. “These are good times,” said John Krafcik, chief executive of Hyundai Motor America. “Americans aren’t counting cylinders any more.” This fall, the Sonata will offer a turbocharged 4 that combines 274 horsepower with a highway rating of 34 m.p.g. A Sonata Hybrid will harness an electric motor, lithium-polymer batteries and, yes, a gas 4-cylinder, to return roughly 38 m.p.g. General Motors’ Buick division has matched Hyundai’s strategy with its 2011 Regal sedan. A version of the stylish Opel Insignia sold in Europe — where even big autobahn sedans rely on smaller gasoline or diesel engines — the midsize Regal offers a choice of a 182-horsepower 4-cylinder or a 220-horsepower turbo version. Smaller engines also trim vehicle weight and development costs, and not simply because they are lighter or have fewer parts. Engineers, Mr. Krafcik said, did not have to spend time designing a stronger chassis for the Sonata to support a V-6 version. “If you have a V-6 in the lineup, it makes the 4-cylinder version heavier than it needs to be,” Mr. Krafcik said. Let’s not overlook the green elephant in the room; this trend is not driven entirely by consumer demand or environmental consciousness on the part of automakers. Around the world, downsized engines are the linchpin of strategies to meet stricter fuel-economy and pollution rules, including limits on carbon-dioxide emissions. In the United States, the regulatory bar calls for new cars and trucks to average at least 34.1 m.p.g. by 2016, a level that would result in emissions of 250 grams of carbon dioxide per mile driven. That carbon cutoff is itself momentous: cars will need to improve mileage to about 37.8 m.p.g., up from the current 27.5 m.p.g., with trucks rising to 28.8 m.p.g. from 23.5 today. Even at companies like Ford, which has ambitious plans for electric vehicles, leaders say that downsizing engines in mainstream products will save vastly more fuel than will hybrids, diesels or electrics — and at much lower cost to consumers. Ford has pledged to put 1.3 million of its EcoBoost engines on the road by 2013 — two-thirds of them 4-cylinder versions — and to offer them in 80 percent of its model lineup. Brett Hinds, Ford’s manager of advanced engine design, called EcoBoost “the cornerstone of our sustainability efforts.” “A hybrid can have a big impact per vehicle, but the numbers sold are relatively small,” Mr. Hinds said. “EcoBoost engines can have a large-scale impact on global carbon dioxide, fuel consumption and oil imports.” Of course, if gasoline stays relatively affordable, Americans may resist the small-engine gospel and backslide into big V-8s. But Mike Omotoso, powertrain forecaster for J. D. Power, said more consumers were resigning themselves to a world of higher-price gas and choosing their cars accordingly. Ford is placing a big industry bet with the redesigned Explorer, looking to restore sales and shine to what was once America’s top-selling S.U.V. The 2011 model will offer an optional turbocharged 2-liter EcoBoost with 4 cylinders, a count that might have seemed laughable in the Explorer’s heyday. Yet that pint-size engine produces a surprising 237 horsepower and 250 pound-feet of torque — just 5 pound-feet less than the 3.5-liter V-6 alternative, with the tradeoff that it makes 53 fewer horses. It’s also expected to deliver about 19/27 m.p.g. in city and highway driving, according to Ford, a 30 percent improvement from the previous Explorer’s V-8. Relying on the architecture of the Ford Taurus, the new Explorer — now a car-based crossover — shaves several hundred pounds from the old pickup-based version, making a small engine more suitable. That engine alone trims nearly 100 pounds, and as with the Sonata, weight savings snowballed through the design. While the pricing isn’t official, Ford has said it will charge more for the EcoBoost model than for the V-6 version. Some customers, Mr. Hinds acknowledges, may resist paying extra for an engine with fewer cylinders. Yet test-driving the EcoBoost Explorer, he said, would bring skeptics into the growing 4-cylinder fold — and have them convincing friends that bigger isn’t always better: “I drove the 2-liter Explorer, and it was great,” is what Mr. Hinds hopes they will be saying.

It was the organizing principle of rural economy that originated in the Roman villa system of the Late Roman Empire, and was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe. It was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract. Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor, supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor (sometimes called a fief), and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court. The term is most often used with reference to medieval Western Europe. Antecedents of the system can be traced to the rural economy of the later Roman Empire (Dominate). With a declining birthrate and population, labor was the key factor of production. Successive administrations tried to stabilise the imperial economy by freezing the social structure into place: sons were to succeed their fathers in their trade, councilors were forbidden to resign, and coloni, the cultivators of land, were not to move from the land they were attached to. The workers of the land were on their way to becoming serfs. Several factors conspired to merge the status of former slaves and former free farmers into a dependent class of such coloni: it was possible to be described as servus et colonus, \\"both slave and colonus\\". Laws of Constantine I around 325 both reinforced the semi-servile status of the coloni and limited their rights to sue in the courts; the Codex Theodosianus promulgated under Theodosius II extended these restrictions. The legal status of adscripti, \\"bound to the soil\\", contrasted with barbarian foederati, who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries, remaining subject to their own traditional law. As the Germanic kingdoms succeeded Roman authority in the West in the fifth century, Roman landlords were often simply replaced by Germanic ones, with little change to the underlying situation or displacement of populations. The process of rural self-sufficiency was given an abrupt boost in the eighth century, when normal trade in the Mediterranean Sea was disrupted. The thesis put forward by Henri Pirenne, while disputed widely, supposes that the Arab conquests forced the medieval economy into even greater ruralization and gave rise to the classic feudal pattern of varying degrees of servile peasantry underpinning a hierarchy of localised power centers. How much of society was involved in manorialism?","output":"Manorialism was a big part of society in medieval Western and parts of central Europe. It involved a Lord of the Manor, who had control over land and people called peasants. These peasants worked on the land and had to follow the rules made by the Lord and his special court. So, many people in the society during that time were involved in manorialism, as it was the main way of organizing how they lived and worked on the land."},{"instruction":"What's an example of a movie review?","output":"A movie review is when someone shares their opinion about a movie they watched.

Gov. Mary Fallin declined to say what she would do with the measure, which would make it a felony to perform an abortion, punishable by at least a year in prison. Also, it calls for revoking the medical license of any doctor who performs the procedure. Senate Bill 1552, approved 33-12, likely will lead to a court challenge. Its author, Sen. Nathan Dahm, welcomes that, saying he hopes the issue goes to the U.S. Supreme Court and results in the overturning of the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion. “Most people know I am for defending rights,” said Dahm, R-Broken Arrow. “Those rights begin at conception.” “I believe it's a core function of state government to defend that life from the beginning of conception.” Dahm said an anti-abortion legal group has agreed to defend any lawsuit over the legislation at no charge. The Oklahoma attorney general's office is in charge of defending the state from lawsuits. The bill specifies that abortions can be performed to preserve the life of the mother. What they're saying Sen. Ervin Yen, R-Oklahoma City, a medical doctor, called the bill “insane” and voted against it. He predicted it would be invalidated in litigation if it is signed into law. “It will be declared null and void,” he said. Jennifer Miller, of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said this measure is the first of its kind and is unconstitutional. She called on Fallin to veto it, but she noted the conservative governor has signed a series of anti-abortion bills. “Since Gov. Fallin took office in 2011, she has signed 18 bills restricting access to reproductive health care services, including a Texas-style clinic shutdown law, a ban on the most common method of second trimester abortion, unconstitutional restrictions on medication abortion, and a law that forces abortion providers to perform an ultrasound and display and describe the image,” Miller said. “Each of these laws have been blocked by courts; in fact, the Center for Reproductive Rights has challenged unconstitutional restrictions on reproductive health care in Oklahoma eight times in five years.” NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue called the bill “reckless and dangerous.” “This bill puts doctors in the crosshairs for providing women with the option of exercising our fundamental right to decide how and when to start a family,” Hogue said. “And it creates penalties for doctors doing their jobs: performing a safe and legal medical procedure.” “This obviously unconstitutional bill will never withstand legal scrutiny and is designed to scare doctors and shame women. It is a shameful new low for the anti-choice movement.” Bill Donohue, president of The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, said it makes sense to criminalize abortion in Oklahoma. “Currently, it is a felony in Oklahoma for non-doctors to perform an abortion, so this bill simply adds doctors to the list,” he said. “Quite frankly, it would be illogical not to do so: It is not the training of the abortionist that is the crux of the matter, it is the procedure, and its aftermath, that counts.” Will Fallin sign it? Michael McNutt, a spokesman for the governor, said Fallin was considering the issue. “The governor will withhold comment on that bill, as she does on most bills, until she and her staff have had a chance to review it,” he said. One section of the bill requires the attorney general to determine how much it will cost to defend any constitutional lawsuit arising from the measure. Oklahoma is facing a 1.3 billion revenue shortfall. ||||| OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - An Oklahoma bill that could send any doctor who performs an abortion to jail headed to the governor on Thursday, with opponents saying the measure is unconstitutional and promising a legal battle against the cash-strapped state if it is approved.

The bill also calls on state medical boards to revoke licenses for the “performance of an abortion” but allows an exemption for abortion necessary to preserve the life of the mother. “This is our proper function, to protect life,” Republican Nathan Dahm, an author of the bill, said during a debate. Supporters have said the bill could withstand a legal challenge because the state was within its rights to set licensing requirement for doctors. Democratic Senator John Sparks said the bill would not stand up in court and would lead to expensive legal battles. “This measure is harmful, discriminatory, clearly unconstitutional, and insulting to Oklahoma women and their families,” the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights group, said in a letter to Fallin. Several abortion rights groups have promised a court fight if Fallin signs the bill, which they expect to happen as she has approved more than a dozen pieces of legislation restricting abortion since taking office in 2011. The state has been one of the leaders in adding restrictions to abortions. Oklahoma City University constitutional law professor Andrew Spiropoulos said the bill, if approved, may be on shaky legal ground because the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that abortion is legal in the United States. “When there is a conflict between a state law and federal law, it is the federal law that prevails,” he said. Lawmakers have faced criticism for not doing enough to plug a projected 1.3 billion state budget shortfall next year, which has caused Oklahoma to cut back on funding for schools and services. ||||| FILE - In this March 10, 2016 file photo, Sandy Springer, of Edmond, Okla., stands with other members of Bound 4 Life, an anti-abortion group, at the state Capitol in Oklahoma City.

The Oklahoma House... (Associated Press) OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Any doctor who performs an abortion in Oklahoma could be charged with a felony and punished with up to three years in prison under a bill that the Legislature passed Thursday. The measure is the first of its kind in the nation, according to abortion rights group Center for Reproductive Rights. The bill also would restrict any physician who performs an abortion from obtaining or renewing a license to practice medicine in Oklahoma. With no discussion or debate, the Senate voted 33-12 Thursday for the bill by Republican Sen. Nathan Dahm. A handful of Republicans joined with Democrats in voting against the bill, which now heads to Gov. Mary Fallin, an anti-abortion Republican. Fallin spokesman Michael McNutt said the governor will withhold comment until her staff has time to review it. \\"Since I believe life begins at conception, it should be protected, and I believe it's a core function of state government to defend that life from the beginning of conception,\\" said Dahm, R-Broken Arrow. Abortion rights supporters have said the bill is unconstitutional and will be challenged immediately. Sen. Ervin Yen, an Oklahoma City Republican and the only physician in the Senate, described the measure as \\"insane\\" and voted against it. \\"Oklahoma politicians have made it their mission year after year to restrict women's access vital health care services, yet this total ban on abortion is a new low,\\" Amanda Allen, an attorney for the New-York based center said in a statement. \\"The Center for Reproductive Rights is closely watching this bill and we strongly urge Governor Fallin to reject this cruel and unconstitutional ban.\\" Dahm says he's hopeful the measure could lead to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Also Thursday, the Oklahoma House approved a bill that requires the state Department of Health to develop informational material \\"for the purpose of achieving an abortion-free society,\\" but lawmakers didn't approve any funding for it. The measure, which now goes to the Senate, requires the health department to produce information about alternatives to abortion and the developmental stages of a fetus, but the bill's sponsor says it cannot be implemented without any funding. |||||","output":"Oklahoma looks set to become the first US state to effectively ban abortion after lawmakers approved a bill to make it a criminal offence. If passed, the legislation would make performing an abortion a felony, punishable by a minimum of one year's imprisonment. Governor Mary Fallin has yet to indicate whether she will sign the bill into law. Opponents have reacted angrily to the proposed legislation, with many calling it \\"unconstitutional\\" and pledging legal challenges should it reach the statute books. Among other provisions, the bill also calls for the lifting of medical licenses for doctors who carry out abortions, although it does allow exemptions to preserve the life of the mother."},{"instruction":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: ThefastestandeasiestwaytoopenyourM3U8fileistodouble-clickit.","output":"In order to complete this task, I must interpret the provided string and figure out the logical breaks between the words.

What is the correct answer to this question? Available options: [I] freezing and thawing. [II] growth and reproduction. [III] evaporation and precipitation. [IV] photosynthesis and respiration....A:","output":"The correct answer to this question is [IV] photosynthesis and respiration. These two processes are essential components of the carbon cycle, which is the biogeochemical process through which carbon is cycled between the atmosphere, land, and oceans. Photosynthesis is a process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into organic compounds, such as glucose, using energy from sunlight. This process not only removes CO2 from the atmosphere but also results in the production of oxygen (O2) as a byproduct. In photosynthesis, the radiant energy from sunlight is harnessed by chlorophyll molecules in plant cells, initiating a series of complex biochemical reactions that culminate in the formation of glucose. This organic compound is then used as an energy source by the plant and is also the basis of the food chain for animals that consume plants. Respiration is a process that occurs in all living organisms, including plants, animals, and microbes. During respiration, organic compounds, such as glucose, are broken down within cells to generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is necessary for various vital life processes. One of the byproducts of respiration is the release of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, thereby completing the carbon cycle. To recap, photosynthesis and respiration are two essential parts of the carbon cycle. Photosynthesis captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, converting it into organic compounds, while respiration breaks down these compounds and releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. The carbon cycle is crucial to life on Earth, as it maintains the balance of carbon in the environment and plays a significant role in the regulation of global temperatures and climate patterns."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of numbers and you need to subtract every value in the list with the index it is at.

Running: This is a physical activity that involves the movement of the legs and body to propel oneself forward. It does not involve electromagnets or electricity. Therefore, running cannot be an example of an electromagnet. 2. Recorders: Recorders can refer to audio or video recording devices that capture and store sounds or images. Some of these devices like cassette recorders, use coils of magnetic tapes to store information. These coils can behave like weak electromagnets when an electric current is passed through them. So, recorders could be an example of devices using electromagnetism. 3. Grass: Grass is a type of plant, consisting of leaves and roots, growing on the ground. There is no involvement of electromagnets or electricity in the growth or function of grass. Hence, it cannot be an example of an electromagnet. 4. Rock climbing: Rock climbing is an activity where one attempts to climb up, down, or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls.

The trouble started following the 1997-98 season while negotiating a new contract for Lindros. Clarke threatened to trade him, saying, \\"If you want to be the highest-paid player in the game or close to it, you've got to play that way.\\" While Lindros was not traded and he played well during the 1998-99 season, his season was cut short after sustaining a collapsed lung during a game on April 1 against the Nashville Predators. Lindros' parents criticized team trainer John Worley and claimed Clarke tried to kill their son by trying to put him on a plane back to Philadelphia, which would have been fatal given his condition. After Lindros criticized Worley in March 2000 for failing to diagnose a concussion (his second of the season), Clarke stripped Lindros of the role of team captain. A few weeks after suffering a third concussion during practice, Lindros returned to the Flyers lineup for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals and sustained his fourth concussion of the season (his sixth in 27 months) during Game 7. Afterwards, Clarke said he did not dislike Eric, but he had a problem with his parents, saying, \\"If he's going to come back, he can't have his dad calling us and telling us who to trade for and who he wants to play with Eric and who can't play with Eric.\\" Lindros never played for the Flyers again, as he rejected the Flyers qualifying offer in the off-season and sat out the 2000-01 season. Lindros pushed for a trade to Toronto but that move fell apart at last minute when Clarke and Leafs manager Pat Quinn could not agree on terms. [4] Clarke finally traded Lindros to the New York Rangers in August 2001. Following the trade, Clarke said, \\"I don't give a crap whether he ever plays again or if I ever see him again.

It consists of two parts: 1. I was scared. 2. I felt the need to say something. Taking the first part, \\"I was scared,\\" the premise does not provide enough information to confirm whether the protagonist is indeed scared. They could be feeling other emotions, such as concern, uncertainty, or surprise, which might result in a similar response. Without further context, we cannot be certain that the protagonist is scared. Moving on to the second part, \\"I felt the need to say something,\\" there is evidence in the premise that supports this statement. The fact that the protagonist starts to protest indicates that they have a sufficiently strong reaction to speak up and share their thoughts about the situation. The use of the word \\"Maybe\\" in their protest also suggests that they are unsure about the outcome of the action being taken and would like to explore alternatives or offer an opinion. With this in mind, we can partially agree with the hypothesis. While we can confirm that the protagonist felt the need to say something based on their protest, we cannot definitively conclude that they were scared, as there is not enough information provided in the premise. Furthermore, their emotions could be a combination of various factors, including fear, concern, or uncertainty."},{"instruction":"Texasin sinetti Translate this to English?","output":"The phrase \\"Texasin sinetti\\" is in Finnish, and when translated to English, it means \\"the seal of Texas.\\" The Seal of Texas is the official emblem of the state, representing its sovereignty and historical significance. It is used on official documents, government buildings, and seals of public institutions. The design of the Texas state seal consists of a five-pointed star, the Lone Star, encircled by two concentric circles. The Lone Star represents the independent spirit and unity of Texans. The words \\"The State of Texas\\" are inscribed along the inner circle, signifying its status as a Republic before it became a part of the United States. The outer circle displays a combination of symbols, representing different aspects of Texas history. These include an olive branch and a live oak branch, symbolizing peace and strength, respectively, and the Texas longhorn, representing the cattle industry's role in the state's economic development. Additionally, the Alamo's image, a symbol of the Texan struggle for independence, is commonly seen in some representations of the seal. The current design of the Texas state seal was created in 1839 and adopted as the official seal of the state when Texas joined the United States of America as the 28th state in 1845. Since then, the seal has become an iconic symbol representing the state's unique history and culture."},{"instruction":"This is a test of commonsense with single/multi-choices.

This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars. The most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, where it is described as residing in the Lower City, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure: ...and when he had overthrown the city walls, he built a citadel [Greek: Acra] in the lower part of the city, for the place was high, and overlooked the temple; on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a garrison of Macedonians. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude, from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities. The location of the \\"lower part of the city\\", elsewhere referred to as the \\"Lower City\\", at the time of Josephus (1st century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the original urban center traditionally known as the City of David. Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself. The top of the Mount is approximately 30 metres (98 ft) above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later Herodian-era expansion of the Temple enclosure. The elevation decreases to the south of this point. Josephus, a native of Jerusalem, would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large-scale quarrying. On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times, casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the..., what would be the answer ?

South Africa's pace attack exposed some familiar weaknesses but also highlighted that the Centurion pitch is very difficult, especially with the new ball. There was pressure on; the light was not great; England couldn't win the game; they were batting to save the game - all the usual issues. You might think that England should have fared a bit better but the new ball is difficult. It's very awkward as a batsman when the ball lands in the same place on separate occasions and does completely different things. Captain Alastair Cook got one that rolled along the ground and another that nearly took out his armpit, and when you've got about half a second to react and in your mind you're wondering what the pitch is going to do, that creates uncertainty. Top batsmen have to deal with these situations but it is so much easier said than done. Alex Hales got one that kept a bit low but it was another failure. He has had four games and scored 136 runs. My view has not changed: any opening bowler would reckon Hales gives you more chance than he should as an opening batsman. It's possible they will continue with him. They dropped Adam Lyth after seven matches, and they are running out of options as to who to turn to with eight opening batsmen tried since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012. They could put Nick Compton up there but he has hardly set the world on fire, either opening or at number three, and he played a loose shot to be the third England wicket to fall inside the opening 10 overs. They are going to have to think hard about it, but they have got to sort the opening position out. In the early summer conditions when England play three Tests against Sri Lanka, Hales might well score some runs and it might just be that one score that gets his Test career under way. But he just has these technical issues that have been talked about time and again. He has got one score of 60 but the other innings he hasn't got going and it will be the manner of the dismissals that will disappoint him. But pressure makes you do funny things and Hales, Compton and James Taylor all know their places are under the microscope. Discarded players such as Gary Ballance and Ian Bell will be thinking that if they start the domestic season well they could force their way back into the team. All of these players will feature in county cricket and will have a few games early-season. They will have to get out there and battle to earn selection. It is no bad thing in a way; you want competition for places and you want it to be tough but I don't think any of them will be sleeping particularly easily before the selection for the first Test match against the Sri Lankans at Headingley on 19 May. I would be surprised if they went back to Bell, though. It seems as though they have moved on after he was part of the 2-0 defeat against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates late last year. Ballance has made four hundreds and six fifties in his 15 Tests and I think they want to get him back in the side again, but he has got to earn it. Having lost the series, South Africa are ironically now enjoying some players in excellent form, so they have a great deal of hope for the future. Hashim Amla played beautifully again. It was a very brave innings after being hit a few times on the thumb and it was a shame he didn't get his second hundred in the match And the diminutive Temba Bavuma, who made that wonderful hundred in Cape Town, continues to impress everybody. He's got an excellent attitude, he moves his feet really well, technically he looks good and he has been a revelation, as has the young fast bowler Kagiso Rabada. He took two more wickets to tear through the England top order in that short session before the close. They both came with promise but have really shown they can have really successful Test careers. It's a big day for Rabada, who wants one more wicket to become the youngest South African to take 10 in a Test match. I wondered how he would run in having bowled 29 overs, getting his seven wickets in the first innings haul of 7-112, but he certainly seemed to be moving OK. He will do that I am am sure, and he and Morne Morkel will be quite a handful. Clearly South Africa will be very strong favourites to wrap it up on the final day. I was a bit surprised how long they batted on. I thought they would have got to a 270 lead and really push on and play more shots. Had they declared earlier they could have had England batting before the storm arrived and tested them in some very dark conditions. AB de Villiers is a new captain and it is always difficult setting up declarations, but the general view is they could gave declared an hour earlier. However, they've got lots of time left and they have the second new ball, which is perfectly timed after 60 overs on Tuesday to wrap it up if they haven't already done so. Jonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Jamie Lillywhite. A summary of the above article is?","output":"South Africa's pace attack exposed some familiar weaknesses in England's batting lineup during the recent Test match at Centurion. England faced a target of 382, which seemed unlikely given their overnight score of 52-3. Although there were difficult batting conditions due to the pitch and lighting, England's top batsmen were expected to perform better under pressure. Captain Alastair Cook and Alex Hales, in particular, struggled against the unpredictable pitch and South Africa's pace duo of Kagiso Rabada and Morne Morkel.

Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies. An antibody is a large, Y-shaped protein that binds to an antigen , a protein that is recognized as foreign. Antigens are found on the outside of bacteria, viruses and other foreign microorganisms. Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen ( Figure below ). They fit together like a lock and key. Once an antigen and antibody bind together, they signal for a phagocyte to destroy them. Phagocytes are white blood cells that engulf targeted antigens by phagocytosis. As the antigen is on the outside of a pathogen, the pathogen is destroyed by this process. Q: Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of what, resulting in a signal for a phagocyte to destroy them? Choices: - pathogen - adhesion - immunogen - antigen A: A:","output":"Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen, resulting in a signal for a phagocyte to destroy them."},{"instruction":"Question: Where is a catwalk unlikely to be?

Step 2: Understand the term \\"catwalk.\\" A catwalk is a narrow, elevated platform used for various purposes like fashion shows or a walkway for workers, usually in an auditorium, theatre, or manufacturing facility. Step 3: Determine the likelihood of a catwalk in each choice. - theater/theatre: Theatres often have catwalks for stage personnel and lighting. - airplane: Unlikely to have a traditional catwalk, but there may be restricted walkways for personnel performing maintenance. - new york city: As a major center for the fashion industry, catwalks can be found in numerous fashion show venues and performance spaces. - fieldhouse: While not specifically geared towards performing arts or fashion, it is possible to have catwalks for maintenance purposes. Step 4: Identify the choice that is least likely to have a catwalk. Considering the context and purpose of a catwalk, the least likely place to find one would be \\"airplane\\" because it is a mode of transportation, and its primary function is not related to performing arts, fashion, or requiring an elevated platform for maintenance. The maintenance walkways in airplanes usually do not fall under the traditional definition of a catwalk.

In 1867, Rubinstein handed over the directorship of the Conservatory to Zaremba. Later that year he resigned his conductorship of the Russian Music Society orchestra, to be replaced by Balakirev. Tchaikovsky had already promised his Characteristic Dances (then called Dances of the Hay Maidens) from his opera The Voyevoda to the society. In submitting the manuscript (and perhaps mindful of Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev that ended with a request for a word of encouragement should the Dances not be performed.At this point The Five as a unit was dispersing. Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov wanted to remove themselves from Balakirev's influence, which they now found stifling, and go in their individual directions as composers. Balakirev might have sensed a potential new disciple in Tchaikovsky. He explained in his reply from Saint Petersburg that while he preferred to give his opinions in person and at length to press his points home, he was couching his reply \\"with complete frankness\\", adding, with a deft touch of flattery, that he felt that Tchaikovsky was \\"a fully fledged artist\\" and that he looked forward to discussing the piece with him on an upcoming trip to Moscow.These letters set the tone for Tchaikovsky's relationship with Balakirev over the next two years. At the end of this period, in 1869, Tchaikovsky was a 28-year-old professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Having written his first symphony and an opera, he next composed a symphonic poem entitled Fatum. Initially pleased with the piece when Nikolai Rubinstein conducted it in Moscow, Tchaikovsky dedicated it to Balakirev and sent it to him to conduct in Saint Petersburg. Fatum received only a lukewarm reception there. Balakirev wrote a detailed letter to Tchaikovsky in which he explained what he felt were defects in Fatum but also gave some encouragement. He added that he considered the dedication of the music to him as \\"precious to me as a sign of your sympathy towards me—and I feel a great weakness for you\\"....

Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish's raucous comedy Night School laughed its way to the top of the box-office chart, beating the overall comedy curse in opening to 28 million from 3,010 theaters. The film reunites director Malcolm D. Lee, producer Will Packer and Universal, the winning trio behind the 2017 box-office hit Girls Trip, which debuted to 31 million in summer 2017. Thanks to an ethnically diverse audience, Night School scored the best debut for a broad comedy since Girls Trip. Another exception to the comedy slump is Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M. Chu's rom-com that opened to 26.5 million in August on its way to earning nearly 220 million globally. Heading into the weekend, some tracking services suggested Night School — cementing Haddish's star status after her breakout role in Girls Trip — could clear 31 million in its domestic launch. One hitch may have been generally weak reviews; Night School bears a 31 percent Rotten Tomatoes score, compared to 90 percent for Girls Trip. Lee's latest comedy, which earned a far better A- CinemaScore from audiences, follows a group of misfits who are forced to attend night school in order to pass their GED exams (Haddish plays their teacher). Rob Riggle, Taran Killam, Romany Malco and Keith David round out the cast. In addition to starring, Hart is among the producers. Caucasians made up 37 percent of ticket buyers, followed by African-Americans (30 percent), Hispanics (24 percent), Asian (5 percent) and other (4 percent), according to Universal. Overseas, Night School launched to 5.5 million from its first 19 markets for 33.5 million globally. “Working with some of the funniest comedic talent in the business today with Kevin and Tiffany, pairing them with two filmmakers at the top of their game in Malcolm and Will, and you have a movie that checks all of the boxes for which audiences clearly turned out,\\" says Universal domestic distribution chief Jim Orr. Thanks to solid family turnout, Warner Bros.' new animated offering Smallfoot opened in second place with 23 million from 4,131 theaters. The movie, whose voice cast includes Channing Tatum and LeBron James, likewise earned an A- CinemaScore. Nearly half the audience was under the age of 25. Co-written and directed by Karey Kirkpatrick, Smallfoot follows a group of Yeti who encounter a human (neither can believe the other is real). James Corden, Zendaya, Common, Gina Rodriguez, Danny DeVito and Yara Shahidi also lend their voices. Internationally, Smallfoot took in 14 million from 49 markets for a total bow of 37 million. Smallfoot no doubt took a bite out of Amblin and Universal's family offering, The House With a Clock in Its Walls, which declined 53 percent in its sophomore outing to 12.5 million. Still, House is no slouch, finishing Sunday with a domestic total of 44.8 million and 65.8 million worldwide. In its third weekend, Paul Feig and Lionsgate's sleeper hit A Simple Favor, starring Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively, followed at No. 4 domestically with 6.6 million. The black comedy's North American tally stands at 43.1 million through Sunday, and 62.9 million globally. New Line's horror pic The Nun remained a force to be reckoned in its fourth weekend, rounding out the top five with 5.4 million for a domestic cume of 109 million. The pic also topped a quiet weekend overseas with 16.2 million from 80 markets for a foreign sum of 221 million and 330 million worldwide, the best showing of any film in the Conjuring universe. CBS Films and Gregory Plotkin's modestly budgeted slasher film Hell Fest, distributed by Lionsgate, opened in sixth place with 5.1 million from 2,297 theaters, on par with expectations. The pic stars Amy Forsyth, Bex Taylor-Klaus, Reign Edwards and Tony Todd and centers on a group of teens who are pursued by a killer at a horror-themed amusement park on Halloween. Audiences gave the film a C CinemaScore, not unusual for the genre. The fourth new movie opening nationwide, albeit in far fewer locations, was Little Women, the seventh big-screen adaptation of the iconic novel about the March sisters. The indie pic, from distributor Pinnacle Peak and playing in 643 cinemas, tanked with roughly 747,000. Sarah Davenport, Allie Jennings, Lucas Grabeel, Ian Bohen and Lea Thompson star. With awards season getting underway, a flurry of films opened at the specialty box office, including National Geographic's critically acclaimed documentary Free Solo, which scored the best screen average of the year to date, 75,201. If estimates hold, it will boast the best opening average ever for a documentary, topping 2006's An Inconvenient Truth (70,333). Free Solo, launching in four theaters and fueled by a 100 percent Rotten Tomatoes score, follows professional climber Alex Honnold's quest to free-climb Yosemite's El Capitan and is the latest title to participate in the doc boom at the box office. \\"In a year when audiences are recognizing the power of seeing docs on the big screen, it's so gratifying to see Free Solo embraced as the thrilling theatrical experience it is,\\" says National Geographic Global Networks CEO Courtney Monroe. One exception to the doc upswing is Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 11/9, which bowed nationwide last weekend to just 3 million. In its second weekend, Fahrenheit 11/9 tumbled 63 percent to 1.1 million from 1,719 theaters for a domestic total of 5.2 million. Moore's latest film is one of the few docs to ever open wide, a risky move that isn't paying off. Opting to launch nationwide was even more problematic for Dan Fogleman's Life Itself, which plummeted more than 65 percent in its second outing to 770,085 for a 10-day domestic total of 3.8 million, and Assassination Nation, which declined more than 80 percent in its second weekend to 202,827 for a total of 1.7 million. The two films, along with Fahrenheit 11/9, all made stops on the recent fall festival circuit. Elsewhere at the specialty box office, Fox Searchlight's The Old Man & the Gun, the last film Robert Redford says he will star in, posted a respectable screen average of 30,000 as it debuted in five locations. The crime drama, directed by David Lowery and co-starring Sissy Spacek and Casey Affleck, tells the gritty tale of compulsive real-life bank robber Forrest Tucker, who escaped from prison 16 times over the course of a long career that ended when he was in his late 70s. Danny Glover, Tika Sumpter, Isiah Whitlock Jr., John David Washington, Tom Waits and Elisabeth Moss co-star. \\"We opened in a group of theaters that are supported by different demos, so it is very encouraging to see audiences in both the Landmark in West L.A. as well as the Regal Union Square [in Manhattan] coming to see the film,\\" says Searchlight's Frank Rodriguez. Washington pulled double duty this weekend, between Old Man & the Gun and Neon's Monsters and Men, helmed by first-time feature director Reinaldo Marcus Green. The police shooting drama, launching in 18 locations, posted a screen average of 7,277. (MoviePass recently announced it has taken a financial stake in the film.)

The Constitution provided for a \\"Kampuchean People's Representative Assembly\\" to be elected by secret ballot in direct general elections and a State Praesidium to be selected and appointed every five years by the KPRA. The KPRA met only once, a three-day session in April 1976. The members of the KPRA, however, were never elected; the Central Committee of the CPK appointed the chairman and other high officials both to it and to the State Praesidium. Plans for elections of members were discussed, but the 250 members of the KPRA were in fact appointed by the upper echelon of CPK. Democratic Kampuchea was an atheist state, but Buddhist influences still persisted. All religions were banned, and the repression of adherents of Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism was extensive. Nearly 25,000 Buddhist monks were massacred by the regime. In actual fact, all power belonged to the Standing Committee of CPK, the membership of which comprised the Secretary and Prime Minister Pol Pot, his Deputy Secretary Nuon Chea and seven others. It was known also as the \\"Centre\\", the \\"Organisation,\\" or \\"Angkar\\" and its daily work was conducted from Office 870 in Phnom Penh.

Sentence 1: \\"A group of people are walking through a park.\\" This sentence tells us that there are multiple people involved, and they are walking within the boundaries of a park. Sentence 2: \\"A man is being pulled by himself.\\" This sentence suggests that there is one man who is somehow pulling himself. Now, let's compare the two sentences and determine if Sentence 2 is true based on Sentence 1. Step 1: Identify the subjects. In Sentence 1, the subject is \\"a group of people.\\" In Sentence 2, the subject is \\"a man.\\" Step 2: Analyze the actions. In Sentence 1, the action is \\"walking through a park.\\" In Sentence 2, the action is \\"being pulled by himself.\\" Step 3: Determine if there is a connection between the subjects and their actions. There is no direct mention of \\"a man\\" in Sentence 1, so we cannot make a definitive conclusion about the man in Sentence 2. However, the group of people walking through the park could potentially include at least one man. Step 4: Determine the truthfulness of Sentence 2 based on Sentence 1.

In the given sentence, \\"Kamtchatka\\" and \\"Yakutsk\\" are the subjects, while \\"they\\" is a pronoun referring to either Kamtchatka or Yakutsk. The objects in the sentence include the \\"war,\\" \\"army,\\" and the context of them being \\"defeated within weeks.\\" Step 2: Analyze the context of the sentence. The sentence mentions that Kamtchatka declares war on Yakutsk and provides information about Yakutsk's better-equipped and larger army. This context helps us to understand the power dynamics between the two subjects. Step 3: Determine the antecedent of 'they'. The pronoun \\"they\\" is used to indicate a group. In this context, \\"they\\" refers to one of the two parties engaged in the conflict, either Kamtchatka or Yakutsk. Based on the sentence structure, it talks about Yakutsk's army size and equipment comparing to Kamtchatka's. Then, within the same sentence, it provides the outcome of the conflict - which is \\"they were defeated within weeks.\\" Step 4: Analyze the situation and identify the most likely antecedent. Since Yakutsk has a much better-equipped and larger army, it would be more logical to assume that the pronoun \\"they\\" refers to the weaker side - who is \\"Kamtchatka.\\" Though the sentence construction is a bit counterintuitive given the immediate antecedent is Yakutsk, the context implies that it's Kamtchatka who were defeated due to their weaker army. Conclusion: \\"Yakutsk\\" and \\"they\\" do not point to the same thing in the sentence. \\"They\\" in the sentence is more likely referring to \\"Kamtchatka\\" since they were the weaker side based on the context and they were the ones to be defeated."},{"instruction":"Q:Would Aaron Barrett or Axl Rose be better known for working with Guns N' Roses and AC/DC?

Many people have a highly varied ancestry. For example, in the United States, colonial and early federal history were periods of numerous interracial relationships, both outside and inside slavery. This has resulted in a majority of people who identify as African American having some European ancestors. Similarly, many people who identify as white have some African ancestors. In a survey in a northeastern U.S. university of college students who identified as \\"white\\", about 30% were estimated to have up to 10% African ancestry. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): When were periods of numerous interracial relationships in the U.S.?","output":"The United States has experienced multiple periods of numerous interracial relationships throughout its history. The nature and extent of these relationships varied depending on the cultural, social, and political factors in place during each period. Here, I will discuss four significant periods marked by an increase in interracial relationships: 1. Colonial America (1600s-1700s): During the 17th and 18th centuries, European settlers arrived in North America, interacting with the Native American population. Intermarriages were common between Native Americans and European settlers as the latter sought companionship, assimilation, and access to indigenous knowledge of the land. Certain colonies even passed laws that recognized these interracial relationships, and the children born from them were granted civil rights. 2. Antebellum and Civil War Era (1800s-1865): Interracial relationships during this period were heavily influenced by the institution of slavery. Enslaved Africans and African Americans were often forced into sexual relationships with their white slave owners, resulting in mixed-race children. Some relationships between free blacks and whites, or between whites and enslaved African Americans, were consensual despite strong social stigma and legal prohibitions. The lines separating black and white individuals were fluid and blurry, with many racially mixed individuals passing for one identity or the other. 3. Reconstruction Era to early 20th century (1865-1920): After the Civil War and the abolishment of slavery, the United States entered a period of Reconstruction. During this time, many African Americans gained more rights and freedom to form consensual relationships with white individuals. However, the rise of white supremacy groups and the introduction of Jim Crow laws in the South limited the number of public interracial relationships. Moreover, some states implemented \\"anti-miscegenation\\" laws prohibiting interracial marriage between whites and African Americans. Regardless, many interracial relationships continued discreetly. 4. Civil Rights Movement to the present (1950s-present): The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s sought to dismantle racial segregation and inequality throughout the United States. In 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Loving v. Virginia officially invalidated all remaining anti-miscegenation laws, enabling interracial marriages to occur legally across the country. Since then, there has been a steady rise in the number of interracial relationships. Increased immigration from Asia, Latin America, and other regions has further increased the diversity of the U.S. population and contributed to the establishment of various interracial relationships and marriages, transcending racial and ethnic boundaries. To summarize, periods of interracial relationships in the United States were marked by various political and social conditions. Interracial relationships have occurred throughout the country's history, but the degree of acceptance and visibility of these relationships has evolved over time. Today, interracial relationships and marriages are much more common and generally accepted in American society."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: The impact of adopting a plant-based diet on human health and the environment In recent years, there has been a growing interest in plant-based diets as more individuals are becoming aware of the potential benefits they can offer for both human health and the environment. A shift towards such dietary patterns has also been fueled by numerous scientific studies and a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The consumption of animal-based products such as meat, dairy, and eggs is often associated with negative environmental impacts like deforestation, pollution, and high greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, the overconsumption of meat and other animal products has been linked to several chronic diseases such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and certain cancers. As a result, there is an increasing number of people who are advocating for a shift towards more sustainable and health-conscious dietary choices, including plant-based diets. A plant-based diet primarily consists of whole, minimally processed plant foods like vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds, with little to no consumption of animal-derived products. Hypothesis: Adopting a plant-based diet leads to a reduction in carbon footprint, preservation of natural resources, and improved overall health among individuals. The hypothesis suggests that if a significant portion of the population were to adopt a plant-based diet, it would result in numerous benefits for both the environment and human health. These benefits could include a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the conservation of natural resources like water and land, and improved overall health among individuals who follow such dietary patterns. To test this hypothesis, researchers could conduct a series of studies analyzing the environmental impacts of various diets, comparing the results of plant-based diets to those derived from animal-based products. These studies could take into account factors such as greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide), water usage, land usage, and the amount of waste generated during food production. Concurrently, research could also be conducted to track the health outcomes of individuals who have adopted a plant-based diet, utilizing various biomarkers and risk factors for chronic diseases like heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and certain cancers. If the findings of these research efforts support the stated hypothesis, it would provide strong evidence for the benefits of adopting a plant-based diet, encouraging individuals and governments to take action towards a more sustainable and healthy diet. This could further lead to the development and implementation of policies that promote plant-based diets and discourage the consumption of animal products, ultimately resulting in a world where human health and the environment are both prioritized."},{"instruction":"Give the step-by-step reasoning process and then the final answer. Blake gave some of his money to his friend, Connie. Connie used all the money she had been given to buy some land. In one year, the land tripled in value. So, she sold the land and gave half of all the money she got from the sale of the land to Blake. If Connie gave Blake 30,000, how much money, in dollars, did Blake initially give to Connie?","output":"Step 1: Understand the problem. Blake gave some money to Connie, which she used to buy land. The land's value tripled in one year, and she sold it. After that, Connie gave half of the sale money to Blake, which amounted to 30,000. Step 2: Find how much money Connie made from the sale of the land. Connie gave half of the sale money, which was 30,000, to Blake. Therefore, she must have made 2 * 30,000 = 60,000 from the sale of the land (both halves). Step 3: Determine the original value of the land. Since the land's value tripled in one year, we can divide the amount Connie made from the sale (60,000) by 3 to find the original value of the land: 60,000 / 3 = 20,000. Step 4: Find out how much money Blake initially gave to Connie. Since Connie used all the money Blake gave her to buy the land, and the land's original value was 20,000, then Blake initially gave Connie 20,000.

Sean Mercer (John Wayne) spots one and moves out with his men to capture it. During the chase which ensues, Little Wolf, the Indian (Bruce Cabot), is gored in the leg and the rhino escapes. Kurt (Hardy Krüger), who was driving the herding jeep, blames himself for the mishap, despite what Sean says, as he feels he was herding too close. Pockets (Red Buttons), driver of the catching car, tells Sean a tourniquet isn't doing any good to stop the bleeding, and so they head into town to take the Indian to the hospital while Kurt dives back to the compound to bring Brandy (Michèle Girardon), who technically owns Momella Game Ltd., to town to meet them.The credits play while Sean and the others are driving back.Kurt arrives at the compound in the evening and tells Brandy what happened while she dresses; they depart and join the others at the hospital where they all anxiously await news of the Indians fate. When a young Frenchman with a chip on his shoulder named Charles Maurey (Gérard Blain) comes up to them and asks Sean for the Indian's job, as he was afraid if he waited someone else would get it, the party reacts with indignation and Kurt knocks him down in anger. Sean separates them, and just then Doctor Sanderson (Eduard Franz) enters to tell them about the Indian. He sadly relates to them that the Indian needs a transfusion, but his blood type AB negative is very difficult to match, and the plasma is not doing the job.

Ninety years","output":"Title: The Dark Cycle Genre: Horror, Mystery, Thriller Plot: In a sleepy coastal town named Moorhaven, a nightmarish legend haunts the memories and dreams of the residents. Every ninety years, a darkness falls upon the village, unleashing a terrible evil that leaves behind a trail of terror and death. Generations have tried to unravel the mystery behind the phenomenon, but each is met with doom before the cycle renews itself once more, and the tide of darkness recedes for another nine decades. As yet another ninety-year cycle approaches, recent transplant Ava, a young historian with a penchant for the paranormal, stumbles upon Moorhaven's grim history in an old journal she acquires at a local antique store. Obsessed with the town's dark past, Ava soon learns that she isn't the only one with a vested interest in the legend. A handful of concerned citizens, along with young musician, Nathan, form an unlikely alliance with Ava to get to the bottom of the mystery. As they start unraveling the cryptic clues left behind, they realize that the evil that invades their town every ninety years is not a curse but a malevolent entity that inhabits a family's ancestral lineage, a bloodline that Nathan belongs to. Ava, Nathan, and the others piece together the tattered whispers of the past, uncovering the sinister rituals and sacrifices that have been committed to both sustain and combat the evil. However, unearthing the truth comes at a terrible cost. One by one, the members of their group are hunted down by the evil entity, a merciless shapeshifter consuming their worst fears and manipulating them until they succumb to their tragic ends. Ava and Nathan try their best to deter the prophesized events, but their efforts only seem to fuel the creature's appetite for blood and pain. As the cyclical dark wave draws nearer, Ava and Nathan share a night of vulnerability, discovering solace and love in each other's arms, embracing the possibility that they may not survive the impending showdown. With time running out, Nathan, Ava, and the last surviving members of their group decipher a clue that may hold the key to ending the dark cycle once and for all. They trace the origins of the entity to a secluded cave by the coastline, the gateway to its ethereal prison. Under the moonlit shadows, they come face to face with the shapeshifter in its true form, a ghastly, rotted creature born from the sins of the town's founding members—a depravity buried deep within the very soil Moorhaven was built upon. In the heart-stopping climax, Nathan meets a sacrificial fate, forced to confront the evil entity alone as the others are torn apart one by one. Ava, witnessing Nathan's final moments, realizes the part she is destined to play in the ancient prophecy. Empowered by her love for Nathan, she recites an ancient incantation, placing her hand upon the creature's rotting flesh. The evil begins to disintegrate as the relentless dark energy returns to the depths of its timeless prison. Ava, mourning over their immense loss, vows to ensure that the dark cycle never returns to harm Moorhaven again. She decides to document all that she has learned, a record that will travel through generations to preserve the truth. After a devastating farewell to Nathan's family and the remnants of their fellow truth-seekers, Ava leaves Moorhaven with a heavy heart and steps into a future she could have never envisioned—a future that is, at last, free from the pernicious grip of the ninety-year cycle."},{"instruction":"Identify the most salient words in this sentence: organisation try to disperse a group of demonstrators that were blocking the streets","output":"In the given sentence, the most salient words are: 1.

I went here when it first opened and it was AMAZING! Last night I came back and this was by far the worst buffet and dining experience I have ever had. For the 44 they charged, I would have been better off going to McDonalds,Circus Circus buffet OR JUST STARVE instead. The bone marrow was the worst thing I've ever had, it was just a ridiculous amount of fat and the prime rib was flavorless. I even had the end piece of the prime rib. How do you mess that up??? They use to have mac n cheese and it was yummy! Now they replaced it with some cauliflower dish that looks exactly like the mac n cheese. Why would you do that?!?!?!?!? It's like they are just purposely pissing me off with this deception!!!!!!!!! One of my favorite dishes that they had was the pork belly sliders on mantao bread (Chinese white bread thingy) and again it was delicious. I even ate 5 in 1 sitting! Now it's GONE!!!! I had to force myself to eat enough to justify the 44 I sent. I ended up filling up on bread, yes you read that right, bread, sugar free cookies and ice cream. I still can't believe that a simple dish like spaghetti can be ruined but Wicked Spoon you proved me wrong! The so called clam pizza was tasteless. I just ended up eating dinner rolls. In fact if they had served King's Hawaiian rolls, then that would have been the best thing on the menu but since they didn't, the plain dinner rolls were good enough. They even messed up on the Korean short ribs. HOW DO YOU DO THAT?!?!?!?!?

Your review is clearly negative, expressing disappointment and dissatisfaction with the food quality, options, and value for money. You mentioned the removal of your favorite dishes and the fact that most of the food lacked flavor or taste. You also noted that even simple dishes like spaghetti and the Korean short ribs were not up to par. It appears that deceptive appearances, such as the cauliflower dish that looked like mac and cheese, and inadequately prepared dishes worsened your experience. It's important that a buffet provides satisfying food choices and delivers the quality that guests expect, especially for the price they pay. It's understandable that reading positive reviews from others who attended on the same day adds to the frustration, as it seems like their experiences were vastly different from your own. This discrepancy might be due to individual taste preferences or a lapse in the buffet's quality control. In such cases, it is essential to provide constructive feedback directly to the establishment or leave an honest review on platforms where they can take your suggestions seriously and work towards improvements.

Context: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that's been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin? Options: A. using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser B. use just water to cleanse C. use abrasive soap D. not enough information Answer:","output":"A. using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser"},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Baruch ben Neriah\\" to Russian?","output":"The name \\"Baruch ben Neriah\\" (ברוך בן נריה) is not a phrase or expression that can be directly translated into words with equivalent meanings in another language.

But to describe this pop-jazz singer, composer and guitarist as a gifted Cole acolyte doesn’t take into account the winding tributaries that bring in the blues, folk, pop-soul, light funk, Americana and Broadway flavors. Together they flow into a fertile musical delta that reflects Mr. Harris’s unfashionably hopeful vision of multicultural America. Richard Termine for The New York Times Allan Harris, a composer, singer and guitarist, performing in his show on Monday. The latest on the arts, coverage of live events, critical reviews, multimedia extravaganzas and much more. Join the discussion. On Monday evening Mr. Harris began an extended engagement at the Metropolitan Room with a show, “Just Me,” that explores all those tributaries. It began conventionally enough with “On the Street Where You Live,” the stentorian Lerner and Loewe standard from “My Fair Lady,” reinvented by Mr. Harris and his band (Dan Kaufman on piano, Paul Beaudry on bass and Jerome Jennings on drums) as an intimate, medium-light swinger. The performance was typical of the way Mr. Harris removes show tunes from their quasi-operatic pedestals and warms them up with an easygoing approach that is not about flaunting the size and range of his voice but about humanizing them with jazz rhythms and a friendly narrative approach. “I’ve Never Been in Love Before” (from “Guys and Dolls”), “When Will the Bells Ring For Me?” (a Tony Bennett signature song, usually done by Mr. Bennett with grand emotional flourishes) and the Cole hit “Too Young” were heated up and served with the same home-cooked affability. The set’s most unpromising show tune, the starchy “Bring Him Home” (from “Les Misérables”) yielded the most surprises, as Mr. Harris used the various layers of his voice to convey the tension of a desperate man holding back tears. A change of direction was signaled by Mr. Harris’s strapping on a guitar to perform songs from his show “Cross That River,” a theatrical song cycle about a runaway slave named Blue who flees to Texas in the 1860s to become one of the first black cowboys. As the rougher edges of Mr. Harris’s voice came to the fore, he slipped into the persona of an itinerant folk-blues yarn spinner. His special guest, the jazz violinist Alan Grubner, supplied a thread of wild, antic fiddling. At one point Mr. Harris’s scrubby guitar evoked a softened Bo Diddley sound that seemed miles away from the unfailingly suave Cole. But was it really? The attitude of these songs, even the one titled “Blue Was Angry,” isn’t bitter or hard-bitten. You never had the sense of listening to a troubadour who had traveled thousands of miles on foot over dirt roads. It was the voice of a benign storyteller, a deeply romantic true believer with a heroic vision of American history and the African-American contribution. That vision coalesced in Mr. Harris’s original anthem “I Do Believe,” a hymn to American unity and cooperation as stalwartly upbeat as “The House I Live In,” Frank Sinatra’s ode to harmony in diversity. In Mr. Harris’s music, the dream lives on. Allan Harris performs through June 23 at the Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Manhattan; (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com.","output":"Baritone crooner Allan Harris began an extended engagement at the Metropolitan Room in New York with his show \\"Just Me,\\" exploring his pop-jazz singing, composing, and guitar playing.

So, we'll move the 4580 to the other side of the equation. When we move it across, it switches from being negative to positive. It's like we had 4,580 cookies taken away but now they're given back! 0 + 4580 = 229 * l Now our equation is: 4580 = 229 * l To solve for \\"l\\", we need to divide both sides by 229. It's like sharing 4,580 cookies between 229 friends. How many cookies does each friend get? 4580 ÷ 229 = l When we divide, we find out that: l = 20 So the solution is l = 20. And there you go, each friend gets 20 cookies!"},{"instruction":"What is the most logical next event?

Answer: In Hegel's words, \\"The object is revealed to it [to \\"subject\\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? a. yes; b. no;","output":"Answer: To understand what Hegel means by \\"object,\\" it is crucial to delve into his philosophical framework, which revolves around the dialectical relationship between the subject and the object. In Hegel's philosophy, the term \\"object\\" holds a central position and serves multiple purposes, providing a broader context. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) was a German philosopher primarily associated with the idealist and dialectical traditions. In his philosophical system, the subject and the object are two entities that are continuously engaging in a reciprocal and dynamic relationship. The interaction between these two entities plays a significant role in shaping self-awareness, knowledge, and experience. First, one should grasp the concepts of the 'subject' and the 'object'. The term 'subject' generally refers to the perceiving and knowing entity (i.e., the individual, the self, the consciousness); it is active and constantly interacting with things outside itself. On the other hand, the 'object' represents all that exists outside of an individual's subjectivity. It constitutes everything in the external world that the subject perceives, thinks about, or interacts with, including people, things, and ideas. The object is associated with externality and otherness. Hegel emphasizes the significance of the subject-object relationship, arguing that the two cannot exist independently of each other. Through the dialectical process, the subject comes to know and understand the object, while concurrently recognizing itself as distinct from the object. This interaction leads to a constant evolution in the subject's understanding of both themselves and the external world. There are three main aspects of the object in Hegel's philosophy: 1. Object as Otherness: The object becomes a point of reference for the subject, representing an external reality that stands in opposition to the subject's internal experience and subjectivity. This contrast between subject and object leads to a process of negation, where the subject aims to negate the object to establish self-awareness and self-understanding. 2. Object as Mediation: The object enables the subject to develop and refine its knowledge through its presence and interaction. Without the object, the subject would remain in a state of inadequacy or incompleteness. The object functions as a mediating force and catalyst, helping the subject to discover and be conscious of its own nature, ideas, and abilities. 3. Object as a Moment in the Absolute: In the broader context of the dialectical process, the object is an essential component in the unfolding of the Absolute, which is the ultimate unity or synthesis between subject and object. The Absolute symbolizes the culmination of knowledge, reason, and self-awareness, as well as the recognition of the interdependence and dynamic interaction between subject and object. In summary, the term \\"object\\" in Hegel's philosophy refers to the external reality that stands in opposition to the subject. This opposition drives the dialectical process of self-awareness, knowledge, and experience. The object serves as an essential reference point, mediator, and a moment in the unfolding of the Absolute."},{"instruction":"Q:If you were Greek and saw a shark here, where are you? A. pool hall B. mediterranean sea C. seafood restaurant D. gulf of mexico E. south pacific The best answer is A:","output":"The best answer is B. Mediterranean Sea. If you were Greek and saw a shark, it would be most likely that you are in the Mediterranean Sea since Greece is a country located on the southeastern tip of Europe within the Eastern Mediterranean area. The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land. It is home to several species of sharks, including the blue shark, shortfin mako shark, thresher shark, and basking shark, among others. Here is a brief explanation of the other options and why they are less likely: A. Pool hall: A pool hall is an indoor recreational facility that typically houses pool tables and other games. It is highly unlikely that you would see a shark in a pool hall, as it is not a habitat for marine life. C. Seafood restaurant: While it is possible that you may see a shark on the menu or as a dish in a seafood restaurant, it is less likely that you would encounter a live shark in this environment compared to the Mediterranean Sea. D. Gulf of Mexico: The Gulf of Mexico is a large body of water bordering the southeastern United States and eastern Mexico. Although there are sharks in this region, if you were Greek and saw a shark, it is more likely to assume you are in the Mediterranean Sea, as it is closer to Greece and a more logical location for a Greek person to be. E. South Pacific: The South Pacific is a vast expanse of ocean stretching from the eastern edge of Australia to the western edge of South America. While there are sharks present in this region, it is far away from Greece, and it would be less likely for a Greek person to be there compared to the Mediterranean Sea."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Sweet Smell of Success is a 1957 American film noir made by Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions and released by United Artists.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there organisms live shorter lives happens, how will it affect MORE oil. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation of organisms living shorter lives could have an indirect effect on the process of crude oil formation. Here's a step-by-step analysis of how this could happen: 1. Shorter lifespan of organisms: If organisms in the sea live shorter lives, there could be a potentially faster turnover of dead organisms, assuming their reproduction rates remain constant or increase. 2. Accelerated accumulation of dead matter: With more organisms dying at a faster rate, there could be an accelerated accumulation of dead matter on the sea floor. 3. Faster sedimentation: With more dead matter accumulating at the bottom, the rate at which sediments and other particles fall on top of this organic material could also increase, potentially leading to faster sedimentation rates around these deposits. 4. Rapid burial and, consequently, more rapid formation of oil: If these higher rates of sedimentation lead to rapid burial of the organic matter, the conditions required for crude oil formation (i.e. high pressure and temperature) may be reached sooner. This could result in more crude oil being formed over a shorter period of time. However, it's important to consider that this hypothesis would depend on various factors, such as the reproduction rates of organisms, the specific types of organisms involved, and the surrounding environmental conditions. Additionally, since the process of crude oil formation takes millions of years, any increase in oil production due to shorter organism lifespans might also be seen over a very long timescale."},{"instruction":"From March 29 to April 19, a new version of Death of a Salesman was performedat tne Capital Theatre as the first in a series of foreign classics to mark the 60th anniversary of the Beijing People's Art Theatre.The last time this play was performed in Beijing was 29 years ago.

The first thought might be Asia, which is indeed the largest continent and has numerous countries with significant cultural differences.

Article: Earthquakes may happen anywhere on the earth. When some plates of the earth move suddenly, an earthquake happens. Many earthquakes begin under the sea. They often happen near the mountains , too. During an earthquake, the shakings make rocks rise suddenly and even crack open. Houses fall, people are killed or hurt, and sometimes the whole villages or cities are destroyed . Can we do something to keep ourselves safe from earthquakes? Scientists have studied earthquakes and made maps that show the \\"earthquake belts\\". In areas in these belts, it's possible for earthquakes to happen. In these areas we should build strong houses to fight against earthquakes. In the future, scientists will be able to tell when and where an earthquake will be before they happen. They can also tell people what to do and how to do it. Question: A map showing the earthquake belts will tell people _ . Answer: The answer is:","output":"A map showing the earthquake belts will tell people the regions around the world where earthquakes are more likely to occur. These belts often coincide with areas where tectonic plates interact with each other, making them more prone to seismic activity. By knowing the locations of these earthquake belts, people can better prepare for potential earthquakes by constructing stronger buildings and infrastructure, implementing emergency response plans, and staying informed about possible seismic events in their region. Ultimately, having access to this information will help people to mitigate the risks associated with earthquakes and potentially save lives and property."},{"instruction":"Can someone explain the differences between spiritualism and religion? What is the difference between spirituality and religion? Do those questions have the same meaning? (a). no (b). yes","output":"(a). no While the questions asked may initially seem similar, they are asking for slightly different information. To understand the distinctions, we need to examine the concepts of spiritualism, spirituality, and religion separately. 1. Differences between Spiritualism and Religion: Spiritualism is a belief system or philosophy that recognizes the existence of spirits and communication between the living and the deceased as possible and significant. Spiritualists believe that people possess a spirit or soul that continues to exist after their physical death. Often, spiritualism involves practices such as mediumship, where a person (medium) can communicate with spirits. On the other hand, religion is a more organized and structured system of beliefs that revolves around a specific concept or deity. Religion often includes a set of rituals, scriptures, and institutions designed to maintain its belief system and guide its followers on how to lead their lives. Most religions have specific doctrines, moral codes, and explanations about the origins and purpose of human existence. In summary, spiritualism is a belief in spirits and the possibility of communication between the living and the deceased, while religion is a structured system of beliefs that involves a defined set of practices, rituals, and doctrines. 2. Differences between Spirituality and Religion: While spirituality and religion can share certain elements, they are distinct concepts. Spirituality is a more individual and personal experience, focusing on an individual's connection to something greater than themselves, often referred to as the divine or the transcendent. This connection can be experienced and developed in various ways, with the ultimate goal of self-improvement, personal growth, and a sense of inner peace. Spirituality is often subjective, as each person defines and experiences it in their unique way. It may not necessarily involve any specific deity, scripture, or doctrine but can include a broader search for meaning, purpose, and personal growth. Religion, as previously explained, is more organized and structured, involving specific beliefs, rituals, and practices. Religion often focuses on the relationship between an individual and the deity or divine presence that the religion centers around, with clear guidelines and teachings about how this relationship should work. Religions usually have a community aspect, with a shared belief and common practices followed among a group of people. In essence, spirituality is a more personal and subjective journey that emphasizes one's internal development and relationship with the transcendent, while religion is a structured system that prescribes shared beliefs, practices, and community among its followers. To answer your question: The first question refers to the differences between spiritualism as a belief system, focusing on communication with spirits, and religion as a structured belief system centered around a specific deity. The second question pertains to the differences between spirituality as a personal and individual experience, and religion as a more organized and shared belief system. While both questions address the distinctions involving aspects of belief systems, they are not precisely the same and emphasize different aspects within the broader concept of spirituality and religion."},{"instruction":"OK. You'll be given the following question. Please do chain-of-thought reasoning. Pick which sentence is not logical. Options: - Sentence A: \\"She put a cobra in her handbag\\" - Sentence B: \\"She kept a mobile phone in her handbag\\"","output":"To determine which sentence is not logical, we need to analyze each sentence in terms of the scenario's likelihood and the potential consequences. Sentence A: \\"She put a cobra in her handbag\\" Cobras are extremely dangerous venomous snakes. They pose a serious risk to human safety, and keeping a cobra in a handbag is highly unlikely, as it could lead to lethal accidents. Furthermore, the typical size of a cobra, which can reach up to 6 feet or more in length, makes it an improbable object to keep in a handbag. In addition, it is illegal to keep cobras as pets without special permits in most jurisdictions. Sentence B: \\"She kept a mobile phone in her handbag\\" This sentence is entirely logical. A mobile phone is a common personal item that people carry every day. Handbags are designed to carry various objects, including phones. Keeping a mobile phone in a handbag is a common practice around the world and poses little to no risks or concerns. Based on this chain-of-thought reasoning, Sentence A: \\"She put a cobra in her handbag\\" is not logical due to the dangerous nature of cobras, their size, legal restrictions, and potential safety risks.

The Home Depot became the largest home improvement retailer in the United States – a title it still holds today. As the company grew, so did its stock price, which in turn increased the personal wealth of Arthur Blank. By expanding the number of stores and implementing effective business strategies, Blank and Marcus were able to turn The Home Depot into a multi-billion dollar business.

Paul Ciancia, 23, was shot in the leg and took a bullet in the mouth that split his tongue and knocked out his teeth, reports the New York Daily News. Officials say he is listed in fair condition and will require surgery and extensive physical therapy. The unemployed motorcycle mechanic has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of TSA agent Gerardo Hernandez and could face the death penalty. Four others, including two TSA agents, were injured. A note made it clear Ciancia hated TSA agents, but his background doesn't provide many clues to his motive. At the Catholic boys' school he attended in Delaware, near his family's home in southern New Jersey, he is remembered as a quiet loner. He was mostly silent in class apart from the occasional sarcastic comment, but \\"I've seen him smile and laugh before,\\" a classmate tells the Philadelphia Inquirer. Ciancia and his younger brother, Taylor, were both badly affected by the death of their mother in 2009, a classmate of Taylor Ciancia's says, describing the pair as awkward. \\"They had some depression issues, and they both got obsessive,\\" she says. CIancia had lived in LA for about a year before the shooting, acquiring at least three weapons, but seemed normal when a former roommate met him for lunch just a week before the shooting. \\"He would always talk about documentaries he would watch about whatever, but there was never any kind of hatred, or any hatred group, or anything like that,\\" the roommate tells ABC 7. \\"He said he was going back to New Jersey, going to work for his dad, making amends with family problems, and spending the holidays with his family.

Ciancia's injuries include a gunshot wound to his leg, a bullet in his mouth that split his tongue, and knocked out teeth, and he is reportedly listed in fair condition. Paul Ciancia will likely need surgery and extensive physical therapy as part of his recovery process. The unemployed motorcycle mechanic has been charged with first-degree murder concerning the death of TSA agent Gerardo Hernandez and may face the death penalty if convicted. The investigation into Ciancia's background has not yet provided a clear motive for his actions, but a note found on his person detailed a strong hatred for TSA agents. Those who knew Ciancia at the Catholic boys' school he attended in Delaware, near his family's home in southern New Jersey, described him as a quiet loner. Known for his silence in class apart from the occasional sarcastic comment, Ciancia had shown signs of laughter and smiling in the past, according to a former classmate. It is reported that both Paul Ciancia and his younger brother, Taylor, were severely affected by the loss of their mother in 2009. A classmate of Taylor Ciancia described the brothers as awkward and mentioned that they suffered from depression and obsessive tendencies.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"According to historian Fernand Ouellet, \\"[...] the war has the effect of stimulating French-Canadian nationalism.\\" In this statement, Fernand Ouellet, a well-known Canadian historian, highlights the impact of war on French-Canadian nationalism. He suggests that war events and their consequences can lead to an increase in nationalistic sentiments among French Canadians. This assertion could be related to various historical events and conflicts that have shaped the French-Canadian identity over time. One such example could be World War I, where French-Canadian nationalism was considerably affected by the controversial issue of conscription in 1917 - the mandatory enlistment of citizens into the armed forces. The debate over conscription revealed a deep divide between French Canadians, who opposed it due to their ties to France and a belief in the principle of voluntary service, and English Canadians, who generally supported it due to a sense of loyalty to the British Empire. This conflict exacerbated the feelings of French-Canadian nationalism and led to a deeper understanding of the differences between the two primary cultural groups in Canada. Another instance that demonstrates the link between war and French-Canadian nationalism is World War II. Similar to WWI, conscription became a contentious issue, heightening the sense of French-Canadian nationalism. While the federal government initially committed to a voluntary enlistment system, conscription was implemented in 1944 due to a shortage of military personnel. French Canadians saw this as another attempt to force them to participate in a war they did not support, which further solidified their nationalistic feelings and disillusionment with the Canadian government. Aside from these specific events, war, in general, has a unique tendency to highlight cultural differences and test national unity. Shared experiences during conflicts can lead to increased solidarity within a group, as evident in the French-Canadian population's reaction to the conscription debates. Thus, Fernand Ouellet's statement emphasizes that war can play a crucial role in stimulating and shaping French-Canadian nationalism across different historical periods."},{"instruction":"Translate to Czech: In all likelihood, Sam's cover has been blown as well.

In the past few years, awareness about mental health disorders has been on the rise, with people being more open to seeking professional help and support from their friends and family. However, when it comes to helping a loved one through mental health challenges, it can become an overwhelming and daunting task. This article sheds light on essential steps like seeking medical help, finding therapy, and practicing self-care while catering to the needs of someone with mental health issues. Seek Medical Help The first step in helping a loved one facing mental health challenges is to encourage them to seek medical help. As a support person, it's crucial to recognize the signs and symptoms of mental health disorders and guide them towards professional help. Here are some ways to approach this critical step: 1. Educate yourself: Increase your understanding of mental health disorders, their symptoms, and available treatment options. This knowledge will help you identify potential issues and better communicate your concerns. 2. Have an open conversation: Share your observations and express your concerns without judgment or blame. Encourage your loved one to share their feelings and experiences. 3. Research mental healthcare professionals: Look for psychologists, psychiatrists, or therapists experienced in treating the specific mental health issue. Gather information about their qualifications, treatment approaches, and patient reviews. 4. Offer assistance in scheduling an appointment: It might be daunting for your loved one to make that first call. Offer your support, be it by helping them find a suitable professional, making the appointment, or accompanying them on the visit. Help the Person Find Therapy Therapy plays a vital role in managing mental health disorders. It helps individuals understand their condition, build coping strategies, and improve their overall quality of life. Here's how you can help your loved one find suitable therapy: 1. Understand different types of therapy: Psychotherapy comes in various forms like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and more. Research the methods and identify the most suitable therapy for your loved one. 2. Search for a compatible therapist: Not all therapists are the same, and finding the right fit is critical to the success of therapy. Assist your loved one in finding a therapist that meets their specific needs, preferences, and personality. 3. Encourage consistency and commitment: Therapy requires regular sessions and active participation to derive benefits. Motivate your loved one to attend sessions consistently and engage in the therapeutic process wholeheartedly. 4. Be involved, with permission: If your loved one is comfortable, ask for their permission to communicate with their therapist. This way, you can stay informed about the progress and help your loved one adhere to the therapist's recommendations. Take Care of Yourself It's essential to recognize the emotional toll that caregiving might have on you. While supporting a loved one with mental health issues, it's crucial to practice self-care and maintain your well-being. Here are some tips for taking care of yourself: 1. Set realistic expectations: Understand that recovery from mental health disorders is a gradual process, and it's essential to be patient and supportive. 2. Establish boundaries: Clearly define and communicate your personal boundaries to avoid caregiver burnout. It's okay to acknowledge your limits and seek assistance from others. 3. Engage in self-care activities: Make time for activities that promote self-care such as exercise, meditation, pursuing hobbies, and connecting with friends and family. 4. Seek support for yourself: Don't hesitate to talk about your feelings and experiences with someone you trust. Joining a caregiver support group or seeking professional help, if necessary, can be beneficial in managing your emotional well-being. Conclusion Being a source of support for someone with mental health issues can be a challenging and rewarding experience. By following the steps in this article – seeking medical help, helping find therapy, and taking care of yourself – you can contribute significantly to the recovery and well-being of your loved one. Remember that patience, empathy, and self-care are essential ingredients in this journey. By offering the love and understanding your loved one needs, you will help them build strength and resilience to overcome mental health challenges and lead a fulfilling life."},{"instruction":"Based on having at least one of the symptoms , most students had been hung over between three and 11 times in the previous year . On average the students suffered at least one of the 13 symptoms between three and 11 times in the last year . Please tell me if the sentences above mean the same.","output":"The two sentences convey similar information but differ slightly in the details they present. Let's break down each sentence separately to better understand the nuances between them. Sentence 1: \\"Based on having at least one of the symptoms, most students had been hung over between three and 11 times in the previous year.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the fact that most students experienced a hangover, defined by having at least one of an unspecified number of symptoms, between three and 11 times during the previous year. The key point here is that students must have experienced at least one symptom to qualify as having a hangover. Sentence 2: \\"On average the students suffered at least one of the 13 symptoms between three and 11 times in the last year.\\" This sentence provides more specific information than the first sentence by mentioning that there are 13 symptoms in total. It says that on average, students experienced at least one of these 13 symptoms between three and 11 times during the last year. Unlike the first sentence, which describes the majority of students, this sentence focuses on the average number of times students suffered from at least one symptom across all students. In summary, while both sentences convey the same essential idea - that students experienced hangovers multiple times in the last year - the first sentence emphasizes the majority of students experiencing hangovers, whereas the second sentence provides more specifics regarding the number of symptoms (13) and highlights the average number of times students suffered from at least one symptom."},{"instruction":"Complete the following sentence.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... Question: Why were a lot of Midlanders out of work? === The answer to the above question is Available choices: [a]. people were going back to school to learn open source; [b]. OpenAdvantage was hiring all the workers; [c]. not enough information; [d]. industry was being automated and moved to Asia; The answer is:","output":"[d]. industry was being automated and moved to Asia;"},{"instruction":"On a demandé à M.

Translate to English.","output":"The concentrations of these four air pollutants have decreased by 40 to 60% in twenty years, with carbon monoxide showing the greatest improvement and nitrogen oxides the least. In this statement, the author is discussing the reduction in concentrations of four specific air pollutants over a period of twenty years. These pollutants have experienced a decrease in their concentrations ranging from 40 to 60%, which indicates a significant improvement in air quality. Among the four pollutants mentioned, carbon monoxide has shown the greatest improvement in terms of reduction in its concentration levels. Carbon monoxide is a harmful gas produced primarily by the combustion of fossil fuels, such as in vehicles or industrial processes. The reduction in carbon monoxide levels can be attributed to various factors, including the introduction of more stringent emissions standards for vehicles and industries, increased use of cleaner technologies, and better pollution control measures. On the other hand, nitrogen oxides have exhibited the least improvement among the four pollutants. Nitrogen oxides, which include nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide, are mainly produced by the combustion of fossil fuels, as well as some industrial activities. These gases can contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain, and can have negative impacts on human health and the environment. The lesser improvement in their concentration levels may be due to several reasons, such as the continued reliance on fossil fuel-based power generation, the growth in vehicle ownership and usage, or a relative lack of focus on reducing these specific emissions in comparison to other pollutants. In conclusion, the reduction of air pollutant concentrations over the past twenty years has led to improvements in air quality for many regions. Carbon monoxide has seen the most significant reduction, while nitrogen oxides have lagged behind. Continued efforts to reduce these four pollutants, as well as other harmful emissions, are essential in order to protect both human health and the environment."},{"instruction":"In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which place plant roots would play greater role in soil development, Kenya or Tanzania? Answer:","output":"In Tanzania, plant roots would play a greater role in soil development. This is because the extensive forest cover in Tanzania includes many trees with large and complex root systems. These roots help to improve soil structure, increase the organic matter content, and enhance water retention and nutrient cycling, thereby promoting soil development. Additionally, forests in Tanzania have a high biodiversity of plants, which can lead to a diverse range of root systems that contribute to soil formation and stability. In contrast, the grasslands of Kenya feature shorter vegetation with shorter roots compared to forests. Although grasses do contribute to soil development by preventing erosion and adding organic matter, their impact is typically less significant than the contributions made by trees and other large vegetation found in the forests of Tanzania."},{"instruction":"Choose how you want this story to end. Another member of state-funded Russia Today made waves on Wednesday -- not by standing behind Moscow, as the news network is wont to do, but by bucking it. From the anchor chair, Liz Wahl closed a show -- as seen in video which she later tweeted -- talking about the \\"ethical and moral challenges\\" she faces working for Russia Today, also known as RT. She spoke of being from a family who fled to America to escape Soviet forces during the 1956 Hungarian revolution, being the daughter of a U.S. military veteran and being the partner of a physician who works at a U.S. military base. In a statement, OPTIONS: - Abby Martin said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - America said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - Crimea said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - Hungarian said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - Liz Wahl said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - Martin said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - Moscow said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - Putinist said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - RT said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - RT. said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - Russia said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - Russia Today said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - Soviet said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - U.S. said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\" - Wahl said, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.\\"","output":"Given the context of the story and to maintain coherence, the most fitting ending would be the statement: \\"Liz Wahl said, 'When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional.'\\" This statement follows logically from the narrative thread in which Liz Wahl, who is the central character, voices her moral and ethical dilemmas while working for Russia Today, which is Russia’s state-funded news network. As Wahl has pronounced her disquiet with the editorial position of her organization, particularly with its pro-Moscow slanting of the news, it's logical that she would also discuss the typical professional response to such a situation. In stating, \\"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional,\\" Wahl is outlining the inherent professional responsibilities of a journalist. This includes the duty to maintain journalistic ethics and integrity—even at the cost of employment—if the organization's editorial direction conflicts with these principles. Wahl's background and associations—with her family having escaped to America from Soviet forces and her being the partner of a doctor who works at a U.S. military base—makes the situation even more poignant. The statement is, therefore, not just a assertion of professional duty, but an implied critique of Russia Today's editorial direction under the Russian government's control. Furthermore, by choosing this option, the narrative also opens up a broader conversation about journalistic autonomy, ethics, and the generally accepted modes of conduct within the profession."},{"instruction":"Here is a goal: stand mixer How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of getting a stand mixer, you can follow these simple steps: 1.

Mr Trump said: \\"Very exciting that one of the great resorts of the world, Turnberry, will be opening today after a massive Â£200m investment. \\"I own it and I am very proud of it. \\"I look forward to attending the official opening of this great development on 24 June.\\" Mr Trump is likely to be the Republican candidate in the US presidential election in November after seeing off a host of rivals in the primaries. The outspoken billionaire has been a controversial figure during the campaign, most notably calling for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US following the San Bernardino shootings in California. This prompted a petition advocating a ban on Mr Trump coming to the UK, which attracted hundreds of thousands of signatures. The size of the petition triggered a three-hour debate at a Westminster committee room, which ended without a vote being taken.

Context: When a friend tells you she has wild roses blooming everywhere, it’s not hard to imagine where the conversation headed to next… to turning them into rose petal jam, of course. My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour’s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils. Question: What did the narrator make? Answer: A:","output":"The narrator made rose petal jam using the rose petals they picked with the help of their daughter and friend Simona at Canto del Maggio.

On August 16, delegations from other strike committees arrived at the shipyard. Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibuła news-sheet, Solidarność, produced on the shipyard's printing press with KOR assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, Mury (Walls), gained popularity with the workers.On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes).

Haug said it being \\"a pretty inoffensive song musically\\" helped Powderfinger make that decision. \\"The Day You Come\\" spent nine weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #25.The second single was the double a-side, \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray\\", released on 9 November 1998. \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out\\", a song about a friend of Fanning's who had difficulty in social situations, was one of the roughest Powderfinger songs to date. 'Don't Wanna Be Left Out' could be comfortably ranked with other Powderfinger songs such as 'Lighten My Load' and 'Rise Up'. Drummer Jon Coghill described it as the most difficult Powderfinger song to play live at the time, because it was so \\"fast and offbeat\\". The music video for \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out\\" was unpopular and drew criticism from band members. \\"Good-Day Ray\\" was dedicated to Australian television presenter Ray Martin and his public disagreements with former Media Watch host Stuart Littlemore. Its lyrics verged on punk, though Coghill denied that Powderfinger were a punk band. He also described the music video for \\"Good-Day Ray\\" as being one of the better videos the band had made.Internationalist's third single was \\"Already Gone\\", released on 12 February 1999.

The song's music video was one of Powderfinger's first to feature computer graphics, and was produced by Fifty Fifty Films. \\"Passenger\\" spent 11 weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #30.

Any senator becomes more corrupt, the more lobbyists he talks to.","output":"As an AI, I will analyze the given sentence to determine its grammatical validity through the following steps: 1. Identifying the structure: The sentence appears to be a complex sentence with a main clause and a dependent clause. The main clause is \\"Any senator becomes more corrupt,\\" and the dependent clause is \\"the more lobbyists he talks to.\\" 2. Checking the main clause: \\"Any senator becomes more corrupt\\" - Subject: \\"any senator\\" is a universally quantified noun phrase. - Verb: \\"becomes\\" is an intransitive verb in the present tense. - Object: \\"more corrupt\\" is a comparative adjective phrase that serves as the object complement of the verb \\"becomes.\\" The main clause seems to be grammatically correct. 3. Checking the dependent clause: \\"the more lobbyists he talks to\\" - Subject: \\"he\\" is a pronoun referring back to \\"any senator.\\" - Verb: \\"talks\\" is a transitive verb in the present tense. - Object: \\"more lobbyists\\" is a comparative noun phrase serving as the direct object of the verb \\"talks.\\" - Prepositional phrase: \\"to\\" is a preposition introducing the prepositional phrase \\"to more lobbyists.\\" The dependent clause seems to be grammatically correct. 4. Linking the clauses: The main clause and the dependent clause are linked by the correlative conjunction \\"the more... the more.\\" This conjunction is used in sentences expressing a cause-and-effect or proportional relationship. In this case, the sentence communicates that the level of corruption increases proportionally as a senator talks to more lobbyists. Considering the above analysis, the sentence appears to be grammatically valid: \\"Any senator becomes more corrupt, the more lobbyists he talks to.\\""},{"instruction":"Here is a news article: Apple Beijing Shop Pelted With Eggs as IPhone Debut Botched By Bloomberg News (Adds background on Hong Kong crowds in 11th paragraph.) Jan. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., whose skill at hyping new products helped make it the world’s most valuable technology company, became a victim of its own success after a botched introduction of its iPhone 4S in China led it to suspend sales. Would-be customers who waited overnight as temperatures dropped below minus 9 degrees Celsius reacted with fury after the company’s main store in Beijing’s Sanlitun district failed to open. The company sold out of the handsets at stores that did open and later halted sales of all iPhones at its five retail outlets in the country “for the time being,” spokeswoman Carolyn Wu said by phone. Apple had advertised that the store would open at 7 a.m. At 7:15 a.m., people began chanting “Open the door!” and “Liars!” after an unidentified man said over a bullhorn that the phone wouldn’t go on sale today, without giving an explanation. The store stayed closed “for safety reasons,” Wu said. Beijing police temporarily cordoned off the shop after it was pelted with eggs by the crowd. “This is a debacle,” Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group, a Shanghai-based retail advising company, said in a phone interview today. “Everybody knows there will be massive numbers of people when Apple has this kind of a launch. This shows very poor retail management ability.” ‘Very Angry’ Elsewhere in the capital, the introduction went more smoothly. At Apple’s store in the Xidan neighborhood, the company handed out 1,000 tickets good for the purchase of a maximum two iPhone 4S handsets each. In Shanghai, a store in the Pudong district opened an hour early to accommodate the waiting crowds before selling out of the phones immediately. “I’m very angry,” said Li Yun, 59, a retiree who said she tried to buy the device on behalf of her daughter at the People’s Square store in Shanghai. “They had said they would start selling the iPhone 4S at 7 a.m. but I was told they were already sold out by the time I got here at 6 a.m.” About 60 migrant workers, hired by resellers to line up last night outside Apple’s store in Beijing’s Xidan, weren’t paid the 120 yuan (19) they were promised because they failed to get an iPhone 4S after the 12-hour wait, according to several of them, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. They came by bus from a labor market in the suburbs and received only a 10-yuan food allowance, they said. Expansion Slowed The crush of crowds at the stores is a reflection of the company’s decision to slow the opening of outlets in China, Rein said. Apple in February 2010 announced a plan for 25 stores in China over two years, then slowed the expansion. Including the Hong Kong shop, which started selling the iPhone 4s on Nov. 11, there are six in the country. “There isn’t enough product in enough retail points,” Rein said. “If they had more points of sale, it would disperse the crowds.” Hundreds of people lined up outside the store in Hong Kong’s IFC Mall for several nights when the new iPhone went on sale, prompting police to use metal barricades to keep order. Apple has more than 300 outlets worldwide and planned to sell the latest iPhone model through its three stores in Shanghai, two in Beijing, the two main cities in the world’s largest mobile-phone market. Second-Largest Market The Cupertino, California-based company sold 5.6 million iPhones in China in the first nine months of last year, giving it a 10.4 percent share of the smartphone market in the third quarter, according to research company Gartner Inc. Apple’s Wu earlier declined to comment on the outlook for iPhone 4S sales in China. Apple’s stores in China generate the highest traffic and highest revenue of any of the company’s stores in the world, on average, Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said last January. The maker of Macintosh computers and the iPad tablet increased its revenue in China to 13 billion in the year ended Sept. 24, from 3 billion a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in October. China accounted for 16 percent of Apple’s revenue in the fiscal fourth-quarter, making it the company’s biggest national market after the U.S. Foxconn Suicides Today’s confrontation wasn’t the first during a product introduction at the Sanlitun store, which opened in 2008 as Apple’s first in the country. In May, the store was temporarily closed when a group that lined up outside to buy the iPad 2 “became unruly,” Wu of Apple said at the time. Four people were injured and a glass door to the shop was smashed, the China Daily reported. The violence adds to challenges for Apple in China, where company supplier Foxconn Technology Group was hit by a series of employee suicides. The Taipei-based company installed safety nets on buildings, raised pay and hired counselors in 2010 after at least 10 workers killed themselves. Apple also commissioned a review by a team of suicide-prevention experts. China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd., the nation’s second-largest carrier, is the only one of the country’s three service providers offering the iPhone with a service contract. The company sent a text message to subscribers trumpeting free home delivery of the new handset through its online store. Yellow Bulls “Buy the iPhone 4S without lining up!” China Unicom said in a text sent to subscribers in Beijing. Unicom’s online shop made the device available at midnight, the text said. While Apple suspended iPhone 4s sales at its China shops, the handsets remain available on its website as well as from Unicom and resellers, Wu said. Sophia Tso, a spokeswoman at China Unicom in Hong Kong, didn’t immediately reply to messages left by phone and e-mail seeking comment. The Unicom site lists the 16-gigabyte model for 5,880 yuan (932), with different levels of subsidies. The handset is free to users committing to a three-year plan for 286 yuan a month or a two-year plan costing 386 yuan a month, the website said. The crowd around Apple’s main Beijing store diminished after police lifted the cordon and the doors remained closed. Some waited a while longer for a chance to buy the phone, which includes voice recognition software that doesn’t work with Mandarin, before giving up. “We were unable to open our store at Sanlitun due to the large crowd and to ensure the safety of our customers and employees,” Wu said. The fracas outside the store was caused by yellow bulls, a euphemism for people who buy the phones for sale at a markup, Tony Si, an 18-year-old bartender, said outside the store. The disorder, police response and store closing was their fault, not Apple’s, though he is still disappointed, he said. “I’m angry because they said they’d sell it, and now they aren’t selling it,” Si said. --Edmond Lococo, with assistance from Margaret Conley and Stephanie Wong in Shanghai, Shiyin Chen in Singapore, Feifei Shen and Bloomberg News in Beijing and Mark Lee in Hong Kong.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) (Associated Press) Apple reacted to the scuffle by postponing iPhone 4S sales in its mainland China stores to protect the safety of customers and employees. It said the phone still will be sold online and through its local carrier. Customers including migrant workers hired by scalpers in teams of 20 to 30 to buy iPhones for resale at a markup to Chinese gadget fans waited overnight in freezing weather at the Apple store in Beijing's east side Sanlitun district. The crowd erupted after the store failed to open on schedule at 7 a.m. Some threw eggs and shouted at employees through the windows. A person with a megaphone announced the sale was canceled. Police ordered the crowd to leave and sealed off the area with yellow tape. Employees posted a sign saying the iPhone 4S was out of stock. \\"We were unable to open our store at Sanlitun due to the large crowd, and to ensure the safety of our customers and employees, iPhone will not be available in our retail stores in Beijing and Shanghai for the time being,\\" said Apple spokeswoman Carolyn Wu. Other Apple stores in China opened Friday and Wu said iPhone 4S quickly sold out. She said the phone still will be sold in China through Apple's online store, its local carrier China Unicom Ltd. and retailers that are authorized resellers. Wu declined to comment on what Apple might know about scalpers buying iPhones for resale. China is Apple's fastest-growing market and \\"an area of enormous opportunity,\\" CEO Tim Cook said in October. He said quarterly sales were up nearly four times over a year earlier and accounted for one-sixth of Apple's global sales. Apple's iPhones are hugely popular in China and stores are mobbed for the release of new products. iPhones are manufactured in China by an Apple contractor but new models are released in other countries first. That has helped to fuel a thriving \\"gray market\\" in China for phones smuggled in from Hong Kong and other markets. Last May, the Sanlitun store was closed for several hours after a scuffle between an employee and a customer during the release of the iPhone 4, the previous model in the series. Customers began gathering Thursday afternoon outside the Sanlitun store. People in the crowd said the number grew to as many as 2,000 overnight but many left before dawn after word spread that the store opening would be cancelled. There were about 350 people left when the protest erupted after 7 a.m. \\"On the one hand there is poor organization and on the other there were just too many people,\\" said a man outside the Sanlitun store Friday, who would give only his surname, Miao. \\"I don't think they prepared well enough.\\" Another man who refused to give his name said he was a migrant laborer who was paid 100 yuan (15) to wait in line overnight. Others in the crowd said scalpers had organized groups of 20 to 30 migrant workers to buy phones or hold places in line. Organizers held colored balloons aloft to identify themselves to their workers. Others said they were waiting to buy the phone for themselves. \\"I just like the 4S,\\" said Zhu Xiaodong, a Beijing resident. He said he was upgrading from the previous iPhone 4 model. ___ Associated Press videographer David Wivell and researcher Zhao Liang contributed. ___ Online: Apple Inc.: http:://http://www.apple.com ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Apple Inc.'s iPhone 4S launch in China led to a chaotic situation in 2012.

TJ had been placed in charge of the children when the kids' grandmother, Katherine, left home on July 15 and will watch the children while the legal proceedings play out in a California court. TJ Jackson, 34, is the son of Tito Jackson and the late Delores Martes Jackson. TJ and his older brothers, Taj and Taryll, form the R&B group 3T. Jackson is married with three children, a boy and two girls. Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian of Michael Jackson's children A 1995 article in People described the brothers' childhood as normal despite their famous father, uncle and aunts. Taj Jackson told the magazine: \\"My mom made sure that we had a real childhood, with birthday parties, baseball, family outings, all that stuff.\\" They were close to their Uncle Michael. \\"He's like a third parent to us,\\" Taj told People in 1995. Eventually the brothers went along on one of his tours and decided to form a singing group and were recording their first album in 1994 at the time of their mother's death. Initially it was believed Delores Martes Jackson, who had divorced from Tito Jackson in 1993, drowned in a swimming pool, but the case was reopened, and her sons in 1995 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against a man they accused of killing her.

What is the length of the platform? Options: (A) 338 (B) 234 (C) 240 (D) 881 (E) 271 Let's give some random thoughts before answering.","output":"To find the length of the platform, we can first calculate the total distance the train covers during the 19 seconds. Given: Length of train = 124 meters Speed of train = 68 kmph We'll first convert the speed from kmph to meters per second (m/s). 1 km = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds (68 km/h) × (1000 m/km) × (1 h/3600 s) = 18.89 m/s (approximately) Now that we have the train's speed in m/s, we can calculate the total distance the train covers in 19 seconds. Total distance = speed × time Total distance = 18.89 m/s × 19 s = 359 m (approximately) The total distance covered by the train includes both the length of the train and the length of the platform. Length of train + Length of platform = Total distance Length of platform = Total distance - Length of train Length of platform = 359 m - 124 m = 235 m (approximately) The length of the platform is approximately 235 meters.

The word \\"pleasant\\" conveys a positive sentiment, as it is usually associated with something enjoyable or likable. On the other hand, the word \\"but\\" serves as a conjunction that contrasts or negates what was previously mentioned. Lastly, the word \\"not\\" is a negation, which means it negates the adjective or verb that it modifies. However, the sentence provided seems incomplete, as there is no adjective following \\"not.\\" As a result, it is difficult to make a concrete judgment on whether the sentiment of the entire sentence is positive or negative. But, based on the available information, we can make an assumption. Assuming that the contrast between \\"pleasant\\" and what follows \\"not\\" would be something with a negative sentiment, the sentence could be expressing an overall neutral sentiment. For example, if the complete sentence were \\"pleasant but not thrilling,\\" the sentiment would not be overwhelmingly positive or negative. However, we cannot draw a conclusive decision without knowing the missing part of the sentence. In conclusion, it is challenging to definitively categorize the sentiment of the sentence \\"pleasant but not\\" as either positive or negative due to the incomplete nature of the provided sentence. We can only assume that the overall sentiment may be neutral when considering the contrasting nature of the given words. Further analysis would require a complete sentence with proper context."},{"instruction":"Can we conclude from \\"A group of walkers looking at a store display.\\" that \\"Some people are looking at some store objects.\\"?

He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - Skiffle is a music genre with jazz, blues, folk and American folk influences, usually using homemade or improvised instruments. Originating as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was associated with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, The Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer and Chas McDevitt. Skiffle played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians and has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, blues boom and British Invasion of the US popular music scene. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - George Harrison, (25 February 1943 29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song. - Liverpool, in North West England, is a major city and metropolitan borough with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015 within the City of Liverpool. Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region. - Sir James Paul McCartney, (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. With John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame with the rock band the Beatles, largely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is the most celebrated of the post-war era. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine. - The counterculture of the 1960s refers to an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon that developed first in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) and then spread throughout much of the Western world between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s, with London, New York City, and San Francisco being hotbeds of early countercultural activity. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the American Civil Rights Movement continued to grow, and became revolutionary with the expansion of the US government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. As the 1960s progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding human sexuality, women's rights, traditional modes of authority, experimentation with psychoactive drugs, and differing interpretations of the American Dream. Many key movements related to these issues were born, catalyzed, or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s. - \\"Beatlemania\\" is a term that originated and was coined during the early 1960s to describe the intense fan frenzy directed towards the English rock band the Beatles. The phenomenon began in 1963 and continued past the group's break-up in 1970, despite the band ceasing public performances in 1966. - The Beatles ' Hits EP was released 6 September 1963 . It is The Beatles second British EP and was only released in mono , with the catalogue number Parlophone GEP 8880 . This EP can be seen as an early example of a greatest hits release . It was also released in Australia and New Zealand . - John Winston Ono Lennon, (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 19408 December 1980) was an English singer and songwriter who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. With fellow member Paul McCartney, he formed a celebrated songwriting partnership.

In 1979, the locomotive was renumbered \\"1881\\", painted black with silver stripes, and leased to a Hollywood company for use in the filming of the horror movie Terror Train (1979), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s. The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers. The number 1293 was also restored to the engine. In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration. As of July 2010, Ohio Central Railroad has lost control of most of its holdings, but former owner, Jerry Joe Jacobson, maintained a collection of vintage equipment including CPR 1293 and her sister, CRP 1278, which is also a veteran of Steamtown, U.S.A. operational locomotives. No. 1293 is still operational as of October 2011.Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, like her sister, CPR 1293, was also built by Canadian Locomotive Company in 1948, and is a type 4-6-2, class G5d light-weight \\"Pacific\\" locomotive. It was purchased by Blount in May 1965, and renumbered 127. Blount had planned to renumber all three of the series 1200 CRP locomotives in his collection from 1246, 1278, and 1293 to 124, 127 and 129 respectively, but 1278 was the only one of the three that underwent the change. The new number remained on the locomotive from 1966 until 1973, when its former number was restored. The locomotive was leased to the Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan from 1970 to 1971. After some repair work, the locomotive was returned... Answer:","output":"After the locomotive, Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, was returned from its lease to the Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan from 1970 to 1971, it underwent some repair work. The explicit information about where the locomotive performed excursion runs after being returned is not provided in the article text. However, there are some pieces of information that can help deduce the locomotive's activities. Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, along with its sister locomotive, CPR 1293, was part of the vintage equipment collection of Jerry Joe Jacobson. As per the article, No. 1293 is still operational as of October 2011. Since both locomotives were veterans of Steamtown, U.S.A., it is reasonable to assume that CPR 1278 may have also been involved in excursion runs or at least operational duties in Steamtown during or after its restoration period, similar to its sister locomotive. From the information provided in the article, we cannot pinpoint the exact location or event where the locomotive performed excursion runs after being returned from Michigan. However, the association with Steamtown, U.S.A., and being part of Jerry Joe Jacobson's vintage equipment collection indicates that the locomotive likely remained involved in exhibition, excursion, or operational activities."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = The Eagle, eatType = coffee shop, food = Indian, priceRange = high, customer rating = 1 out of 5, area = city centre, near = Burger King","output":"\\"The Eagle is a coffee shop located in the city centre, right next to Burger King, where they serve expensive Indian food but unfortunately, people only rate it 1 out of 5 because they don't like it very much.\\""},{"instruction":"How is \\"Rope access\\" said in Russian?","output":"The phrase \\"Rope Access\\" is translated into Russian as \\"Веревочный доступ\\". Let's break it down: 1. \\"Rope\\" translates to \\"Веревочный\\" in Russian. Here, it's being used as an adjective and is spelled with a capital letter to maintain the integrity of the original term \\"Rope Access\\". The word \\"Веревочный\\" directly translates to \\"rope\\" (noun), and when used as an adjective in this context, it refers to anything related to or involving the use of ropes. 2. \\"Access\\" is translated as \\"доступ\\" in Russian. This word refers to the ability or right to enter or use something. It is typically used in contexts involving accessibility or permission, such as in the usage of a device, a place, or in the context of accessing a web page. In the term \\"Rope Access\\", it signifies the use of ropes for accessing typically hard-to-reach areas. So while the literal translation would yield \\"Rope Access\\" = \\"Веревочный доступ\\", it is always crucial to note that languages are not always directly translatable from one to another. Cultural and contextual factors may cause the meaning of certain translations to shift. The term \\"Rope Access\\" is a specific term used in the field of workforce industry, referring to a set of techniques where ropes and specialized hardware are used as the primary means of providing access and support to workers. Typically it's used for commercial or industrial services where the use of scaffolding, cranes or aerial work platforms is not feasible. This includes applications like inspection, surveying, maintenance, and construction on buildings, towers, bridges, dams, wind turbines, and more. In Russia and many other Slavic countries, \\"Rope Access\\" techniques are gaining popularity in industries like construction, power generation (especially wind turbines), and even entertainment and media (for things like setting up overhead cameras for sporting events). Despite this, there may not be an exact match for the phrase \\"Rope Access\\" in Russian since it's a relatively new and growing field of work being adopted more and more."},{"instruction":"Q:Paul Edwin Gregory [Pop] (June 9 1908 – September 16 1999) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball who played from 1932 through 1933 for the Chicago White Sox.

Available choices: (a). unacceptable. (b). acceptable.","output":"(b). Acceptable. The sentence \\"Emily caused Benjamin to see himself in the mirror.\\" is indeed grammatically correct in English. Let me expound on why the sentence is grammatically accurate. The structure of the sentence follows the standard English sentence structure, which is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Here's a breakdown: Subjeсt: The subject of the sentence is \\"Emily.\\" The subject represents what or whom the sentence is about. Its role is to perform or command the action. Verb: The verb is \\"caused.\\" It reveals the action or state being done by the subject. English sentences require at least one main verb to show the action. In this case, \\"caused\\" demonstrates Emily's action upon Benjamin. Object: The object of the sentence is the entire phrase \\"Benjamin to see himself in the mirror.\\" This statement is affected by the action of the subject. In other words, it tells who or what is receiving the action. \\"Benjamin\\" here is the indirect object, whereas \\"to see himself in the mirror\\" is the direct object that expands on the action done onto Benjamin. The sentence also uses the reflexive pronoun \\"himself\\" correctly. Reflexive pronouns refer back to the subject of the clause. They are used when the subject and the object of a sentence refer to the same person or thing. In this case, \\"himself\\" refers back to \\"Benjamin.\\" Furthermore, the verb \\"caused\\" is appropriately employed. It is a factitive verb, or a causative verb which means causing something to happen or making something change. It's followed by an object (in this case, 'Benjamin') and a to-infinitive clause (in this case, 'to see himself in the mirror'). Thus, both grammatically and contextually, the sentence \\"Emily caused Benjamin to see himself in the mirror.\\" is correct in English."},{"instruction":"Are these paraphrases?

The sentences provided state different information concerning the national affiliation of the team the person was part of. In the first sentence, the man was part of the Swedish team and in the second sentence, he was a part of the Danish team. The change between Swedish and Danish alters the team's identity and hence its meaning, so these sentences are not paraphrases.

The two sentences convey different meanings due to the swap in nationality of the team, which makes them not paraphrases."},{"instruction":"Article:Vallop Suwandee, who chairs an advisory board to the governor of Bangkok, was quoted as saying that street vendors would be removed from all 50 districts of the city. It seemed that one of the most popular and distinctive aspects of Bangkok life was to be wiped out, days after CNN had voted Bangkok the best place in the world for street food, and just two months before the city government was planning to hold a street-food festival. Mr Vallop now says he was misquoted: \\"Let me be clear, on behalf of the city of Bangkok. Street food will continue to be part of Bangkok life, on the condition that there will not be obstructions for pedestrians, and that the vendors observe sanitary rules in the interest of public health. \\"We will allow them to be in certain areas, under strict conditions.\\" This is not the first time the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority (BMA), which is responsible for running the city, has tried to impose order and standards on the hundreds of thousands of food vendors operating on the streets. Right after the BMA was first established in 1972 it launched a similar campaign to force the vendors to operate in designated markets instead. Variations of that campaign were revived every few years but implementation has always been weak because the BMA recognised the vital role street vending played in providing a source of income in difficult economic times. Most of the time it has quietly chosen not to push too hard. This time may be different. The number of officially approved locations for street food vendors has been cut dramatically, from a peak of 726 four years ago to 243 by the end of last year. Tens of thousands of vendors have been forced to move already, leaving many downtown areas like Siam Square, Asok and Silom with few or no street-food stalls now visible during the day and night. The most recent area to be cleared is the increasingly wealthy neighbourhood of Thonglor. A small side street, or soi, which for many years had been famous for its street food, is no more, although city officials say the vendors were offered alternative locations in smaller sois further away. The BMA is not being specific about its ultimate plans but it looks as though it aims to have street-food confined to a very few well-known city-centre areas, like the backpacker hangout of Khao San Road and Yaowarat Road, which runs through the historic Chinatown area, and to be more widely permitted in outer city neighbourhoods. With growing numbers of tourists and commuters coming into the downtown area, Mr Vallop says there is not enough space for street vendors. A vendor may occupy a space where land prices run to many thousands of dollars per square metre, he told me - why should one person have that privilege? He said the BMA had received many complaints about blocked pavements. These arguments, though, have been lost in the furore over the perceived threat to the city's much-loved street-cuisine. Chawadee Nulkair is a self-styled street food fanatic who publishes a blog, bangkokglutton.com, cataloguing her culinary discoveries. She opposes the BMA's move against the vendors, even though she acknowledges the inconvenience to pedestrians. \\"As much as we complain about the clutter and the chaos,\\" she told me, \\"this is what defines us. \\"This street food is Thai culture. Motorbikes drive on the pavements here. Even without the vendors the pavements would still be awful.\\" Chawadee took me to Yaowarat Road, sometimes described as the birthplace of street food, and still one of the best places to eat in Bangkok. She explained how the Chinese immigrants, who settled in large numbers in the 19th Century, began cooking food along the roadsides to make a living, using simple stoves and iron woks. That style of cooking, along with classic Chinese ingredients like noodles, significantly changed Thai cooking. Street food has also become an essential service for the growing numbers of commuters, who may have long journeys to and from work, and limited time and space to cook at home. We passed a number of stalls sending out mouth-watering aromas into the night air, before settling on a stall Chawadee knew would cook an excellent prawn noodle hot pot, a classic Thai-Chinese dish. The kitchen was set out on the front steps of a bank, with the chef cooking fried rice and noodle dishes at lightning speed, sheets of flame curling around his blazing wok. The stall has been run by Voracha Rujarawan and her family for three generations. She is worried by the city government's plans. Already she has to make regular payments to local officials and the police. Now they are insisting she needs proper dish-washing facilities, although it is not clear how they can do that without running water. On cue, a uniformed municipal officer arrived and started questioning her at length about how she would meet the tougher new hygiene standards. The city's argument that public demand for better pedestrian access has also been challenged by a survey carried out by the Urban Design and Development Centre, a city planning project started by the architecture faculty at Chulalongkorn University, which is actually campaigning to make walking better in Bangkok. The UDDC Director, Niramon Kulsirisombat, says the survey of more than 1,000 respondents showed that food vendors were not considered the worst problem; in fact Bangkok's typically narrow pavements are such an obstacle course of electricity poles, hydrants, disused phone boxes and road signs that pedestrians usually find themselves walking in the road even without food stalls. She said there were too few channels for Bangkok's residents to have their views heard by the city government; that it took too much of a government-knows-best, top-down approach to development. This criticism has also been applied to the BMA's controversial decision to demolish a historic community in old Bangkok to make way for a tourist park, and its ambitious plan to build a concrete walkway 10m (33ft) wide and 14km (nine miles) long, along the bank of the Chaophraya river. \\"The reasons the BMA gives for moving the street food, blocking the pavements and hygiene, are not enough. Like Singapore 50 years ago, when Lee Kwan Yew began modernising the city, they said we have to move all this street food chaos, that it is a symbol of a third world country. But actually, in Bangkok, you should see street food as a form of life support for so many people.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The Bangkok Metropolitan Authority (BMA) is working to remove street food vendors from all 50 districts of the city. Citing obstruction and public health concerns, the BMA requires vendors to observe strict sanitary rules and allow for clear pedestrian access. Thousands of vendors have already been displaced, but Ben Suebsaeng, a food vendor for over 45 years, says that street food is more than just clustered stalls, claiming they add culture and vibrancy to the city. Other critics of the BMA agree, suggesting the authority's reasons for moving the vendors is insufficient and that street food is an integral part of everyday life for many in Bangkok."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Title: Low production value, ok dialogue, but awesome ideas Review: This movie is worth buying just for it's classification of women in a bar.

The infected \\"hemophages\\" die within twelve years after being infected. The \\"Archministry\\", a militant medical group headed by Vice-Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus, has taken control of the government and begun rounding up infected citizens and exterminating them in order to contain the virus. Having been infected a decade earlier, Violet Song Jat Shariff has become a member of an underground resistance movement fighting to protect the hemophages from the government. Working with the resistance, Violet steals a weapon that was apparently created to exterminate all hemophages, only to discover that it is a young boy named \\"Six\\". Rather than kill the child, Violet flees with the boy, believing that a cure for the disease can be reverse-engineered from the antigens before he dies from them. She eventually converses with Daxus, who tells her that the boy is his son, but she does not believe him. Instead she takes him to her friend Garth, who tells her the boy has no antigens and he has no value to anyone. He also tells her that the boy has a tracking device embedded in him (\\"so hot he's nearly radioactive\\"), that they can track him easily and he has only 8 hours to live. In the meantime, Nerva reveals to Violet that the antigens in Six's blood are actually deadly to humans. Furthermore, Daxus clarifies that the boy is his clone, his previous claim to her being a ruse to earn her sympathy. Since the hemophages are nearly exterminated, the Archministry intends to engineer a new plague to maintain its power. When he refuses to give her the cure, Violet escapes with Six and lets him spend his last moments at a playground. Daxus arrives and takes Six's body for dissection.

LOL! that's how you know it's bad. :|","output":"One might describe the sentiment of this review as primarily negative, with aspects of sarcasm and disapproval. The reviewer seems to be expressing disappointment and even mockery towards the establishment, indicating that they believe the quality of the experience is subpar. The first clue to the negative sentiment is the use of \\"LOL\\" (Laughing Out Loud). This acronym, when used in a review, can often signal that the reviewer finds something about the experience laughable or ridiculous. In this case, they are laughing at the fact that the establishment hires people to dance on the dance floor, which the reviewer seems to think is a desperate and perhaps even pathetic attempt to create the illusion of a lively and enjoyable atmosphere. The next clue to the negative sentiment is the use of sarcasm. The phrase \\"Oh, I forgot to mention\\" suggests that the reviewer has intentionally withheld this piece of information until now to heighten the sense of surprise and disbelief. It's as though they are saying \\"You won't believe what I'm about to tell you,\\" which underscores the ridiculousness of the situation in their view. The reviewer also uses a frowny face emoticon \\":|\\" to further illustrate their disapproval and disappointment. This emoticon serves as a visual representation of the negative sentiment, reinforcing the notion that the reviewer is not pleased with their experience at this establishment. Finally, the statement \\"that's how you know it's bad\\" conveys a strong sense of negative judgment. By making this assertion, the reviewer is implying that the mere fact that the venue hires people to dance on the dance floor is a clear and indisputable indication of its overall poor quality. In summary, the sentiment of this review can be described as negative and disapproving, with elements of sarcasm and mockery. The reviewer seems to be expressing their disappointment with the establishment and its apparent need to manufacture a fun atmosphere by hiring dancers, which they view as a clear sign of the venue's inadequacy."},{"instruction":"Write a positive movie review.","output":"Title: A Symphony of Dreams - Movie Review Bright.

Make this lower case","output":"agent is not responsible for cancellation of any service/s and/or refunds from any supplier or carrier that may cease operations. As an AI assistant, I am here to help clarify the implications of the statement provided in lower case. The sentence states that the agent, who could be a person or a company, is not held accountable for any cancellations or refunds resulting from the termination of services by other suppliers or carriers that might halt their operations. Suppliers or carriers can be businesses that provide products or services to customers, and these businesses may need to cease operations for various reasons - ranging from financial difficulties to restructuring. When a supplier or carrier discontinues its services, customers who have purchased or pre-ordered products or services from them might face cancellations and may be seeking refunds. In such scenarios, it is essential to determine who is responsible for managing the cancellation process and refunding the affected customers. This responsibility usually falls on the supplier or carrier itself. However, in some cases, an intermediary agent (such as a booking platform, a travel agency, or any other entity facilitating the transaction between the customer and the supplier/carrier) might be involved in the process. The statement provided emphasizes that the agent, in this case, should not be held responsible for handling cancellations and refunds. This implies that customers should directly contact the supplier or carrier, who might have ceased operations to address the cancellation and refund-related concerns. In summary, the statement clarifies the agent's position and communicates that they are not responsible for managing cancellations and refunds for customers affected by suppliers or carriers ceasing their operations. Instead, customers should seek resolution directly from the suppliers or carriers themselves."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following: The base of the capo is the part that makes contact with the strings on your guitar. You have a few options for the base depending on what office supplies you have lying around. You can use a highlighter, pen, marker, or pencil.

If you have a short pencil or another shorter base, test it by comparing its length to the width of the fretboard. You also have a few options with connecting the base of the capo to the guitar. The important part about the tying component is that it has enough pressure to hold the strings.

If you use an elastic band, test it to make sure it is strong enough to hold the base against the strings. Test the elastic band by stretching the band. You don’t need to stretch it too far, but make sure it doesn’t break on an initial test. Tune up your guitar before attaching the capo. You can either tune to standard tuning (EADGBE) or tune to an alternative tuning. Use a chromatic tuner for the most effective tuning.

Then, she hung up the string of sausage links in her cooler. Later that evening, Brandy, Sam’s Golden Retriever, broke into the cooler and ate 12 links of sausage. After Brandy’s feast, how many ounces of sausage meat were contained in the remaining links? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Determine the total amount of sausage meat in ounces. Sam made the sausage using 10 pounds of spicy meat mix. There are 16 ounces in a pound. To convert the pounds to ounces, multiply the number of pounds by the number of ounces in a pound. 10 pounds x 16 ounces/pound = 160 ounces Sam originally had 160 ounces of sausage meat. Step 2: Determine the amount of sausage meat per link. Sam created a string of 40 sausage links. To determine the amount of sausage meat per link, divide the total weight of sausage meat (in ounces) by the number of links. 160 ounces / 40 links = 4 ounces per link Each sausage link contains 4 ounces of meat. Step 3: Determine the amount of sausage meat eaten by Brandy. Brandy ate 12 sausage links. To find out how many ounces of sausage meat Brandy ate, multiply the number of links by the amount of meat per link. 12 links x 4 ounces/link = 48 ounces Brandy ate 48 ounces of sausage meat. Step 4: Determine the amount of sausage meat remaining. Finally, to find out how many ounces of sausage meat are left after Brandy's feast, subtract the amount of sausage meat eaten by Brandy (48 ounces) from the original total (160 ounces). 160 ounces - 48 ounces = 112 ounces After Brandy's feast, there are 112 ounces of sausage meat remaining in the links."},{"instruction":"Choose your story that continues the following story.

They are having a lunch at the cafe in the club and discussing their latest boat purchases. Stephanie mentions that her latest boat she has been using has cavitation. Barb takes a bite of her sandwich and remarks that the boat she is currently using doesn't have any cavitation. Hint: Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as propellers and pumps, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of tidal stream turbines.When the cavitation bubbles collapse, they force energetic liquid into very small volumes, thereby creating spots of high temperature and emitting shock waves, the latter of which are a source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military submarines, as it increases the chances of being detected by passive sonar.

As the first boy approaches the second boy, they exchange a greeting and introduce themselves.

One possibility is that they choose to play a classic game of tag, taking turns pursuing each other across the playground and the grassy field. As the boys play, they laugh and their energy levels rise, encouraging them to explore more of the park and challenge each other in various physical activities. They might engage in a friendly race, compare their climbing abilities on nearby playground equipment, or even take turns pushing each other on the swings.

Justification: It is not possible to tell the individual water consumption of every person living in a densely populated urban area without any monitoring or recording system due to the following reasons: 1. Large population: Densely populated areas have numerous residents, making it impossible to manually track and measure the water consumption of each individual accurately. 2. Multiple water sources: In a densely populated urban area, people obtain water from various sources, such as tap water, bottled water, or water supplied by water trucks. Without an efficient monitoring system in place, it becomes virtually impossible to track the water consumption from such diverse sources accurately. 3. Varied usage: People use water for different purposes like drinking, bathing, washing dishes, laundry, gardening, and more. Tracking individual water consumption manually is impractical due to these varied uses. 4. Human error: In the absence of an automated monitoring system, any manual efforts to record individual water consumption could be subject to human error or inaccuracies. 5. Privacy concerns: Privacy issues might arise if authorities attempt to monitor individual water consumption without using a proper, non-intrusive system. This further complicates the task of accurately determining water consumption.

The meaning of the word \\"ball\\" is dependent on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence (1) \\"The ball was already emptying out before the fire alarm sounded\\", the word \\"ball\\" refers to a social gathering or a formal event where guests engage in various activities such as dancing, socializing, and enjoying a meal. The sentence implies that the attendees of this social event started to leave the location even before the fire alarm went off, perhaps due to some other issue or reason. In the second sentence (2) \\"The ball rolled into the corner pocket\\", the word \\"ball\\" refers to a round, spherical object that is used for various games and sports. In this context, the sentence is likely describing a scene from a game of pool (or billiards), where a cue ball is struck by the player, causing it to hit another ball and knock it into the corner pocket of the pool table. The meaning of \\"ball\\" here is entirely different from the meaning in the first sentence as it describes a physical object used in a game rather than a social event. In conclusion, although the word \\"ball\\" is the same in both sentences, its meaning varies significantly depending on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence, it refers to a social gathering or event, whereas in the second sentence, it refers to a spherical object used in games and sports.

Aerobic exercises, also known as cardiovascular exercises, consist of physical activities that raise your heart rate and require the pumping of oxygen-rich blood to your muscles. Examples of aerobic activities include running, swimming, cycling, dancing, and brisk walking. All these activities play a significant role in maintaining and improving your physical fitness, particularly your cardiovascular health. The heart is a vital organ that is primarily responsible for pumping blood throughout your body. It supplies oxygen and essential nutrients to your cells, tissues, and organs, and removes waste products like carbon dioxide and other metabolic byproducts. By engaging in regular aerobic activities, your heart becomes stronger because it has to work harder to pump blood to the muscles during exercise. This increased workload puts a positive stress on the heart, ultimately enhancing its efficiency, strength, and endurance. Some of the key benefits of regularly done aerobic activities on your heart include: 1. Improved cardiovascular fitness: Aerobic activities improve the heart's ability to pump blood more efficiently, allowing it to deliver more oxygen-rich blood to your muscles, organs, and other body parts. 2. Lowered blood pressure: Aerobic exercise helps dilate blood vessels and improves blood circulation throughout the body, reducing the pressure in the arteries and lowering the risk of hypertension or heart disease. 3. Enhanced heart muscle strength: Regular exercise can result in a stronger and more resilient heart muscle. This, in turn, reduces the workload on the heart and lowers the risk of heart-related ailments. 4. Increased lung capacity: Since aerobic activity requires deep and faster breathing to deliver oxygen to your muscles, it helps enhance your lung capacity and improves overall respiratory function. 5. Reduced heart disease risk: Aerobic exercises effectively reduce the risk of coronary artery disease, heart failure, and other heart ailments by improving blood circulation, lowering blood pressure, and reducing the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the bloodstream. 6. Weight management: Aerobic exercises help burn calories, maintain a healthy weight, and reduce the risk of obesity, which is a significant risk factor for heart diseases. 7. Mood elevation and stress reduction: Regular aerobic activity has been proven to release endorphins, improving mood and reducing stress, which can indirectly contribute to a healthier heart by reducing stress-related damage. In conclusion, regular aerobic activities play a critical role in building endurance and promoting a stronger heart. These exercises contribute to improved cardiovascular fitness, reduced risk of heart diseases, and enhanced overall quality of life."},{"instruction":"Question: Which of the following two sentences does not make sense?

Manager Davis Moyes, who believes his squad may need as many as eight new players, was in Freiburg on Friday watching talented German defender Matthias Ginter. He also took in Bayern Munich's 5-1 humbling of Schalke where Toni Kroos was again influential. Club scouts watched Porto's Brazilian full-backs Danilo and Alex Sandro in Porto's 2-2 draw with Vitoria Guimaraes on Sunday, although Porto centre-back Eliaquim Mangala did not play. In demand:","output":"Manchester United scouts have been keeping a close eye on several potential transfer targets, as the club prepares for a significant overhaul under manager Davis Moyes. With a belief that the squad requires up to eight new players to remain competitive both domestically and in European competitions, United's scouting network has been working tirelessly to identify players who can make an instant impact at Old Trafford. One such player is Matthias Ginter, the promising young German defender who has caught the eye of many clubs around Europe with his performances for Freiburg. Moyes personally traveled to watch Ginter in action on Friday to determine if he would be a suitable addition to the United backline. Clearly, Moyes recognizes the importance of bolstering his defensive options, especially with the likes of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic nearing the twilight of their Premier League careers. Despite their recent struggles in the Premier League, United remains a desirable destination for players like Ginter, who would no doubt relish the opportunity to work under a manager of Moyes' stature and learn from the likes of Ferdinand and Vidic – both of whom are considered legends of the game. In addition to Ginter, Manchester United scouts were also in attendance at Bayern Munich's 5-1 victory over Schalke, where the talents of Toni Kroos were on full display. The versatile playmaker has been linked with a move to Old Trafford for some time, and his consistently impressive performances for Bayern have only heightened United's interest. The addition of Kroos would provide Moyes with an array of creative options in the midfield, something his squad has been sorely lacking at times this season. However, United's vigilance did not end there, as scouts also watched Porto's Brazilian full-backs Danilo and Alex Sandro in action. With both Patrice Evra and Rafael potentially leaving the club in the near future, securing the services of dynamic, attack-minded defenders such as Danilo and Sandro would be a significant coup for the Red Devils. Though Porto's highly-rated center-back, Eliaquim Mangala, did not feature in the match, it would come as no surprise if United's scouts continue to monitor his progress going forward. What these scouting missions demonstrate is a clear commitment on the part of Manchester United to invest in the playing staff and usher in a new era of success under the guidance of Davis Moyes. With a mixture of youth and experience, as well as a determination to target the best available talent, United's summer spending spree promises to be a busy and exciting one for fans of the club. As Moyes seeks to reshape his squad and implement his own ideas on how the team should play, it is crucial for United to bring in players who can adapt to his methods and elevate the club back to the summit of English and European football. With time running out for some of the seasoned veterans in the current squad, the next transfer window represents a pivotal moment in United's famous history – one which could potentially shape the club's fortunes for years to come."},{"instruction":"Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who works various odd jobs? ?

Can you fix that?","output":"Looking around a room of players with stacks that are twenty times the size of yours is not easy to fathom. Observing a room filled with highly skilled poker players who have managed to accumulate considerable winnings can be an intimidating and humbling experience. It is essential to understand that there are several factors at play, and learning from these players might improve one's own strategy and gameplay. First, experienced poker players understand the importance of position, relative to the dealer, and make decisions based on it. Being in a late position, like the dealer, allows them to gather valuable information from the opponents' actions and adapt their own tactics accordingly. This increased information base allows for better decision-making when it comes to betting, folding, or playing aggressively. Second, successful poker players have spent countless hours honing their skills in reading opponents. They pay attention to every detail, like betting patterns, physical tells, and verbal cues. This ability to deduce an opponent's hand strength and playing style creates a significant advantage and allows for calculated risks that often result in lower loose rates. Another crucial factor that leads to the accumulation of significant stacks is bankroll management. Expert players know when to adjust their bet sizes according to the situation and their opponents. A disciplined approach to managing their resources helps them avoid making costly mistakes due to emotional reactions, impulsive decisions, or simple errors in judgment. Furthermore, skilled players have a deep understanding of poker odds and probabilities, which allows them to make mathematically sound decisions. By comprehending the likelihood of specific outcomes, they can better assess risks, know when to make a call or fold, and optimize their overall game strategy.

What is the answer??","output":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step, like we're telling a story. 1. First, let's handle the numbers on the left side of the equation. We have \\"-268 - 551\\". To solve this, we're taking away 551 apples from 268 apples, which will give us \\"-819 apples\\". So now, our equation looks like this: -819 = -2515 * m + 2030 - 334 2. Now let's handle the numbers on the right side with addition and subtraction. We have \\"2030 - 334\\". Imagine you have 2030 candies, and you ate 334 of them. You are left with 1696 candies. So our equation becomes: -819 = -2515 * m + 1696 3. Next, we want to isolate \\"m\\" so that we can solve for it. To do this, we need to move \\"1696\\" to the left side. When we do this, it switches from being a positive number to a negative number. So now, our equation looks like this: -819 - 1696 = -2515 * m 4. Let's solve the left side, which now looks like \\"-819 - 1696\\". Think of it like you ate an additional 1696 candies, and you're left with \\"-2515 candies\\" total. Our equation is now: -2515 = -2515 * m 5. Finally, we want to find \\"m\\". We can do this by dividing both sides by \\"-2515\\". It's like saying you have -2515 candies and want to share them equally among your toys (each toy represents \\"-2515\\"). So, when we do this, we get: m = 1 So, the answer to the equation is m = 1."},{"instruction":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: this book is awsome.when you first look at it you get a little bit scared ,because it's very big (about 1000 pages)and the first pages are really boring,but when u really start to read it,you just can'tstop,its very exciting,it makes you very curious to know what's going to happen next and it gets you inside the book,taking you to a different world.the characters complement themselves just perfectely and it's very well written (way better than ''harry potter'')and if you watched the movie and liked it,you are going to love the book Answer:","output":"Yes, based on this review, the user would recommend the product."},{"instruction":"What is the answer to this question? what was the first feature-length film to use vitaphone technology?","output":"In order to answer this question, I'll need to look for information on the first feature-length film that used Vitaphone technology.

Bradykinin - Receptor B is a G-protein - encoded receptor for Bradykinin , coupled to the BDKRB2 - Gene in humans . Bradykinin receptor B is a G-protein encoded receptor for bradykinin , coupled by the BDKRB2 gene in humans .","output":"Despite some minor differences in phrasing, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning. Both sentences discuss the relationship between Bradykinin-Receptor B, G-protein, and the BDKRB2 gene in humans. They explain how Bradykinin-Receptor B is a G-protein encoded receptor and that it binds to bradykinin. Furthermore, they indicate that this interaction is regulated by the BDKRB2 gene. However, it is important to expand on the elements in the sentences to truly understand their similarities and meanings. 1. Bradykinin - Receptor B and Bradykinin receptor B: These phrases refer to the same protein receptor, known as the Bradykinin B receptor. This receptor belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and is involved in multiple physiological processes in the human body. 2. G-protein encoded receptor and G-protein coupled receptor: Although the first statement refers to the receptor as \\"G-protein encoded,\\" and the second one, as \\"G-protein coupled,\\" both phrases essentially describe the same feature of the receptor. The Bradykinin B receptor is a GPCR. GPCRs are membrane proteins that translate signals from outside the cell to the inside of the cell by collaborating with G-proteins. 3. Coupling to the BDKRB2 gene: Both sentences mention that the Bradykinin B receptor is linked to the BDKRB2 gene in humans. The BDKRB2 gene provides instructions for producing the Bradykinin B receptor. Consequently, the information present in this gene ensures proper signal transduction and receptor function. The primary difference between the two sentences is the wording used for the connection between the receptor and the gene - \\"coupled to\\" versus \\"coupled by.\\" Despite this slight discrepancy, the intended meanings of both statements remain effectively the same. In summary, both sentences convey the same fundamental information about the relationship between the Bradykinin B receptor, G-proteins, and the BDKRB2 gene in humans. Although there are minor differences in the choice of words, the core meaning remains the same."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What was the causing factor for the Greek theater to be developed in the early 19th century?\\" is in \\"The modern Greek theatre was born after the Greek independence, in the early 19th century, and initially was influenced by the Heptanesean theatre and melodrama, such as the Italian opera.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of less sunlight shining on plants does have a direct effect on the process of converting inputs into sugar. 1. When there is less sunlight, the energy available for the chlorophyll cells to capture is reduced. 2.This leads to a lower efficiency in converting light energy into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. 3. As photosynthesis is responsible for combining carbon dioxide, water, and light energy to produce glucose (sugars) and oxygen, a decrease in sunlight would directly impact the production of sugars. 4. Consequently, plants will produce less glucose, which will affect their growth, development, and overall health, as glucose is essential for energy production and other metabolic activities. 5. A decline in sugar production may also have indirect effects on other processes, such as the release of oxygen and water, as well as absorption of carbon dioxide, water, and minerals.

Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\". The answer to this question is:","output":"The name of the person who conducted The Rite of Spring (Le sacre du printemps) is Pierre Monteux. He worked closely with the composer, Igor Stravinsky, to achieve the orchestral balance and effects sought, and conducted the premiere of the groundbreaking piece during the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris. Despite his initial reservations about the music, Monteux played a significant role in the performance and success of this revolutionary work."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the next sentence.

How to polish concrete Evaluate the concrete. Use a mohs hardness pick to determine the degree of mineral hardness. Determining whether the concrete is soft, medium, or hard will allow you to fine-tune the polishing process. Options: * If the concrete is quite soft, rough, with a woody, leather-like texture, you will need to take an oil or a lime-based polishing compound and sand its surface. Determine the characteristics of the car's paint job. * Average grade stones must be at least. 14-16 psi, heavy if the stone is glass, coarse if the stone is entones or has luster, and powder if the stones are clay or a combination. * Use the tools supplied in the kit to test the hardness of the concrete against the hardness of other minerals. The softest mineral that is capable of scraping the concrete is harder than the concrete, placing the concrete's level of hardness directly below that mineral. * Pastel concrete will require a finer grit mohs or higher. For hard rock concrete, use a smoother mohs.","output":"The most logical next event after evaluating the concrete and determining its hardness would be to select the appropriate diamond polishing pads and grit sequence based on the hardness of the concrete. 1. Choose the right diamond polishing pads: Based on your assessment of the concrete's hardness, select a set of diamond polishing pads designed for your specific concrete type (soft, medium, or hard). These pads are crucial for the polishing process and are engineered with varying levels of grit to grind and smooth the concrete surface. 2. Determine the grit sequence: Start with a lower grit pad (somewhere in the range of 30-50) to remove any roughness and imperfections from the concrete surface. The lower the grit number, the coarser the pad and the more aggressive the grinding. As you progress, gradually increase the grit (e.g., 80, 150, 300, etc.) to refine and polish the surface to your desired level of smoothness and shine. 3. Prep the concrete surface: Make sure that the concrete surface is clean and free of any debris or contaminants. Sweep or vacuum the area to remove any dust or dirt particles that may interfere with the polishing process. 4. Attach the first diamond polishing pad: Attach the initial, lower-grit diamond pad to a concrete floor grinder or polisher. Ensure that it is securely fastened and in good working condition before you begin. Remember always to wear appropriate safety gear, such as gloves, eye protection, and a dust mask. 5. Begin the polishing process: With the concrete prepped and your chosen diamond pad securely attached, start polishing. Begin by working in small sections at a time, carefully moving the grinder or polisher back and forth across the surface in a consistent pattern. Make sure to overlap your passes slightly to ensure even coverage. 6. Progress through the grit sequence: As you continue polishing, switch to progressively higher grit diamond pads according to the sequence determined earlier. This process will help you achieve a smoother and shinier surface with each pass. Remember to clean the surface and pads between grit changes, as this will help prevent unwanted scratches and maintain the pad's performance. 7. Finalize and protect the polished surface: Once you've achieved the desired level of polish, apply a concrete sealer or densifier to the surface to protect it from any stains and provide added durability. By following these steps, you will be able to effectively polish a concrete surface to your preferred level of smoothness and shine."},{"instruction":"What are the steps to prepare for GRE examination?

How the show became so powerful as to randomly select people to be killed is unexplained, but the Contenders treat it as something they cannot control. Contenders are given a pistol, though they may acquire other weapons, and the last one left alive is the winner. Contestants are forced to play the game, regardless of their wishes.

Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","output":"The answer to the question \\"Who has little trouble studying Ashkenazi Jews?\\" is researchers, particularly those focused on genetics. Because Ashkenazi Jews are a homogeneous genetic subgroup and due to the endogamy (marriage within their own ethnic group), their genes are prevalent and passed through generations. This simplifies the process of studying the genes of Ashkenazi Jews. The trend of marrying exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews, especially among Haredi Jews (such as Hasidic or Hareidi sects), who often have large families, further facilitates genetic research on this population."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: - sport is fencing Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.The volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There is a variety of contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through.

Classify your answers into 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Problem:Problem: there are 7 teams in a certain league and each team plays each of the other teams exactly twice . if each game is played by 2 teams , what is the total number of games played ? Options: a ) 15 , b ) 16 , c ) 28 , d ) 42 , e ) 64 Solution:","output":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of games played in the league using the information given. Step 1: Determine the number of matchups Since there are 7 teams in the league and each team plays each other twice, we can use combinatorics to find the total number of matchups. This can be calculated using the formula for the number of combinations: C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items in the combination. Step 2: Apply the formula In this case, we have n = 7 (number of teams) and k = 2 (since a game is played by 2 teams). Now we plug these values into the formula: C(7,2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = 7! / (2!5!) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / (2*1*5*4*3*2*1) = (7*6) / (2*1) = 42 / 2 = 21 Step 3: Account for the double matchups Since each team plays each other twice, we need to multiply the number of matchups (21) by 2. So, 21 * 2 = 42. Step 4: Choose the correct answer Now we see that 42 is among our answer choices: a) 15 b) 16 c) 28 d) 42 e) 64 So the correct answer is d) 42.

Never . Most people in that part of the country married their high school sweethearts so at the ripe old age of nineteen , I had passed my prime . Hopes of getting a date were pretty slim ( about as likely as my acceptance to WWF training camp * giggles * ) . Why is the narrator so down on themselves ?","output":"The narrator appears to be down on themselves due to a combination of factors such as societal expectations, personal experiences, and perceived lack of opportunities. Firstly, the societal expectations, especially in the specific region where the narrator lives, seem to play a significant role in their pessimistic outlook. It is evident that people in this part of the country tend to marry their high school sweethearts, and by the age of nineteen, they are usually expected to have already found their long-term partners. As the narrator is nineteen years old and has not followed this norm, they might feel like an outsider, as if they have missed a crucial milestone in their life. Secondly, the narrator's personal experiences of holding onto failing relationships or dating out of desperation also contribute to their negative self-image. They acknowledge that they might have made poor choices in the past, and this self-awareness has made them more critical of themselves. Due to these experiences, self-doubt might have crept in, leading to a belief that they are somehow not capable of having a successful or fulfilling relationship or that they lack the ability to attract the right person. Moreover, the passage points out that the narrator feels they have \\"passed their prime\\" at nineteen, further indicating a sense of helplessness and lowered self-esteem. This feeling of being past one's prime, particularly when it comes to romantic relationships, can amplify the narrator's lack of confidence and reinforce the belief that they are undeserving or unworthy of a suitable romantic partner. Lastly, the odds of finding a suitable date or partner are perceived by the narrator to be \\"pretty slim,\\" comparable to their chances of getting accepted into the WWF training camp, which they assume to be highly unlikely. This pessimistic outlook could be a result of the limited dating pool in their area or the realization that it could be challenging to find someone who genuinely resonates with them. This perceived lack of opportunities further intensifies the narrator's negativity and self-criticism. In summary, the narrator appears to be down on themselves due to the societal expectations surrounding them, the consequences of their past romantic history, a feeling of already being past their prime, and a perceived lack of potential partners. These factors intertwine and create a substantial impact on their self-esteem and outlook towards relationships and themselves."},{"instruction":"Q:What is the answer for the question: What was the last year Lancaster created costumes and scenery? from the following article ? Lancaster's career designing for the theatre began and ended with Gilbert and Sullivan. His first costumes and scenery were for the Sadler's Wells Ballet's Pineapple Poll (1951), John Cranko's ballet with a story based on a Gilbert poem and music by Sullivan. His last were for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of The Sorcerer (1973). In between, he designed more productions for the Royal Ballet, as well as for Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Old Vic and the West End. It was a matter of mild regret to him that of the twenty plays, operas and ballets that he designed between the two, only one was for a thoroughly serious piece, Britten's Peter Grimes, for the Bulgarian National Opera in Sofia in 1964.Only two of Lancaster's theatre designs have remained in use in 21st-century productions, both by the Royal Ballet: Pineapple Poll and La fille mal gardée. In an article on the latter in 2016, Danielle Buckley wrote, \\"Lancaster's surrealist and stylized designs for Fille amplify the story's pantomime quality, and the exaggerated burlesque of its comedy – but the backdrops of fields that roll into the distance, bundles of hay, dreamy skies and village cottages provide the idealized, pastoral context that the story needs\\". Buckley adds that Lancaster’s designs have been criticised for locating the ballet in no particular time or place – \\"except, that is, of a 1960s London view of idyllic country life\\".Lancaster's stated view was that stage sets and costumes should reflect reality, but \\"through a lens, magnifying and slightly over-emphasising everything which it reflects\\". Sir Geraint Evans commented on how Lancaster's designs helped the performer: \\"[His] design for Falstaff was superb: it gave me clues to understanding the character, and reflected that marvellous, subtle sense of humour which was present in all his work.\\" A:","output":"The last year Lancaster created costumes and scenery was in 1973, for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of The Sorcerer."},{"instruction":"An archaeological party explore some caverns underground .

Ducks are farmed mainly for their meat, eggs, and down. As is the case with chickens, various breeds have been developed, selected for egg-laying ability, fast growth, and a well-covered carcase. The most common commercial breed in the United Kingdom and the United States is the Pekin duck, which can lay 200 eggs a year and can reach a weight of 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) in 44 days. In the Western world, ducks are not as popular as chickens, because the latter produce larger quantities of white, lean meat and are easier to keep intensively, making the price of chicken meat lower than that of duck meat. While popular in haute cuisine, duck appears less frequently in the mass-market food industry. However, things are different in the East. Ducks are more popular there than chickens and are mostly still herded in the traditional way and selected for their ability to find sufficient food in harvested rice fields and other wet environments.

However, it is less popular than chickens for a few reasons: 1. Chickens produce larger quantities of white, lean meat, which is generally more popular in Western cuisines. 2. Chickens are easier to keep intensively, making them more suitable for large-scale, industrialized farming. This results in a lower price for chicken meat compared to duck meat.

With 20 Senate seats to defend in the midterm election -- compared with just 13 Republican ones -- the truth is Sen. Harry Reid and the gang do not have a lot of time to gloat. The economy may be improving, but it is still limping; millions are looking for work, and the deficit continues to grow. So whatever momentum President Obama and the Democrats received from last week's victories will all be gone come 2016 if they can't agree on a detailed budget plan by 2014. And let's be clear: Taxing the rich and closing some loopholes is not a detailed plan. Granted, Democrats are proposing spending cuts -- but they have to be more bullish about their proposed cuts than they are about taxing the rich. The latter got them elected but the economy is in more need of the former. Allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for those who make 1 million a year or more, as championed by some, is estimated to generate only 500 billion to 600 billion over 10 years. That dwarfs the number cutting off Big Bird would bring but it does little to solve the debt problem. Opinion: Conservatives, don't despair. So any plan that does not include significant spending cuts is no plan at all. If Democrats want to build on last week, they have to be bold, because they can't depend on Republicans to say stupid things about rape or ignore minorities forever. In fact, confetti was still falling in Chicago when George P. Bush -- the Spanish speaking, half-Mexican nephew of you know who -- filed his papers with the Texas Ethics Commission to run for an as-yet unspecified office. The 36-year-old is the co-founder of the political action committee, Hispanic Republicans of Texas. That alone won't solve all of the party's image problems with Latinos, but as long as he's not on the crazy, inflammatory side of his party, he's got the looks, charisma and name to be the kind of political star they need -- the kind who can draw big crowds and maybe sway Latino voters two years from now, if not for himself, then certainly for another GOP candidate. Face it Democrats -- the celebration is over and it's time to get to work. At least six of the Senate seats the party has to defend are in red states. Lose those, and President Obama could be spending his final two years butting heads with a Republican Congress. So what do the Democrats need to do? Opinion: Election a call for purple politics. Well for starters, identify candidates to go after Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins' seat, because Obama won Maine. Second, be a party white people want to vote for. Lost in all of the hoopla about Republicans needing to adapt to the country's new demographic, is the fact Romney captured the largest percentage of white votes since Ronald Reagan. True, some of that can be attributed to racist backlash to Obama -- but most of it has to do with the message of the Democratic platform. Romney characterized 47% of the country as a bunch of moochers (and coincidentally came away with 47.8% of the popular vote). That means a lot of voters: the numbers suggest 88% of the people who voted for Romney were white. That's a problem. If Democrats don't figure out a way to make their message attractive to white people, they could possibly lose the Senate. And third, and probably most important, they have to be a party worth voting for. One can certainly say Republicans, from the top of the ticket on down, shot themselves in the foot this election, making it easier for Democrats to paint them as a party to vote against. But for the 2014 midterm, Democrats must present a budget plan people want to vote for. In two years voters are going to be asking \\"What else you got?\\" and if Democrats don't have an answer, they risk getting shellacked in 2014, the same way they got their butts handed to them in 2010.

It suggests that although Obama and the Democrats experienced victories in the elections, momentum will be lost if they cannot agree on a budget plan that includes significant spending cuts. The Democratic Party also needs to appeal to white voters, who made up a large percentage of Romney's support. Finally, the article highlights the importance of finding strong candidates for key elections, such as in Maine, where Republican Sen.

The Home Office figures for 2016/17 are for those who have certificates for firearms and/or shotguns. The police force with the largest number of children having access to guns was Devon and Cornwall, which issued 206 certificates. Overall, 580,658 children and adults were authorised to use guns last year - a reduction of 7,023 compared with 2015/16. Previous Freedom of Information answers from the Home Office have shown children as young as seven to be in possession of a certificate. There is no minimum age for applying for a shotgun certificate, but the law prohibits children from using them without the supervision of an adult aged at least 21, until they are 15. In addition, children aged under 18 are banned from purchasing or hiring any firearm or ammunition. Across all ages, Devon and Cornwall has the highest number of firearms certificates with 11,144, followed by Sussex (6,934) and North Yorkshire (6,734). City of London Police issued only three licences, while Merseyside and Cleveland were the forces with the next lowest number of certificates - 1,029 and 1,125 respectively. Applications for certificates are examined and then granted or refused by local police forces after a number of checks including interviews, visits and references. Certificates can be revoked if a chief officer of the local force is satisfied the holder can no longer be entrusted with firearms or shotguns. The figures showed that 358 firearms certificates and 1,216 shotgun certificates were revoked in 2016/17, with both numbers falling by 10% on the previous year. The UK is seen as having some of the toughest gun control laws in the world. A Home Office spokesman said there are \\"very strict controls on young certificate-holders, including around their tight supervision\\". He added the Policing and Crime Act 2017 had strengthened firearms legislation by closing legal loopholes that had been exploited by criminals. Peter Glenser, chairman of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, said teaching children to use firearms safely and responsibly \\"removes the myths that surround firearms, and teaches both self-control and responsibility towards others\\". He added: \\"Shooting has many aspects - from pest control through to Olympic and Commonwealth Games clay shooting - and it is vital that anyone wanting to compete at these top levels gets an early start in life,\\" he added. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the firearm and shotgun certificates issued to children in the United Kingdom.

Devon and Cornwall had the highest number of children with access to guns, issuing 206 certificates. There is no minimum age for obtaining a shotgun certificate in the UK, but children are prohibited from using them without adult supervision until they are 15 years old. Children under 18 are also not allowed to purchase or hire firearms or ammunition. The process for obtaining a firearm certificate includes scrutiny by local police forces, involving several checks such as interviews and obtaining references.

He traded them for tickets to what? Possible A: city, university building, auditorium, commercial building, theater Why is \\"theater\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Theater\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it follows a logical progression of thought, considering Sam's preferences and the context provided. Step 1: Identify Sam's preferences In the question, it is stated that Sam doesn't like to go to the concert hall because it's too loud. Step 2: Consider the possible options The possible options given are: city, university building, auditorium, commercial building, and theater. Step 3: Eliminate options based on Sam's preferences Since Sam finds the concert hall too loud, it is reasonable to assume that he prefers quieter environments. A city and a commercial building can also be loud places to visit, so they can be eliminated as options. Step 4: Compare the remaining options Now, we're left with university building, auditorium, and theater. A university building could be more generic and doesn't necessarily focus on entertainment or events. An auditorium could be another place where loud events might occur. Step 5: Choose the most aligned option Out of the remaining choices, \\"theater\\" makes the most sense, aligned with Sam's preference for quieter environments. Theaters often host plays, musicals, or movie screenings, which are generally more controlled in loudness compared to a concert hall. Additionally, a trade between concert hall tickets and theater tickets is a plausible trade, as both involve entertainment options. Therefore, \\"theater\\" is the answer that aligns with human common sense."},{"instruction":"Question: Damares - Damares stage name of Damares Alvez Bezerra de Oliveira (January 30 1980 Umuarama) is a Brazilian singer of gospel music Pentecostal.

The reviewer expresses their discontent regarding the relatively high prices for the combo meal burger and chicken strips. The use of the phrase \\"what a joke!\\" indicates that the reviewer finds the pricing situation ridiculous or absurd, implying that they may perceive it as an exploitative or unfair practice by the business. The tone of the review also suggests feelings of disbelief and annoyance, possibly leading the reviewer to question the overall value of the offered food items. The use of ellipsis indicates a pause, which could be interpreted as disbelief or exasperation on the reviewer's part. By highlighting the individual costs of the items, the reviewer seems intent on emphasizing their dissatisfaction and communicating their negative experience to potential customers. Furthermore, the specific mention of the prices shows that the reviewer's primary concern and source of dissatisfaction is the cost aspect of their experience, rather than any issues with the food quality or service.

A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets. - The Brecon Beacons is a mountain range in South Wales. In a narrow sense, the name refers to the range of Old Red Sandstone peaks which lie to the south of Brecon. Sometimes referred to as \\"the central Beacons\\" they include South Wales' highest mountain, Pen y Fan. The range forms the central section of the Brecon Beacons National Park (\\"Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog\\"), a designation which also encompasses ranges both to the east and the west of \\"the central Beacons\\". This much wider area is also commonly referred to as \\"the Brecon Beacons\\", and it includes the Black Mountains to the east as well as the similarly named but quite distinct Black Mountain to the west. The highest peaks include Fan Brycheiniog to the west and Pen y Fan in the central part. They share the same basic geology as the central range, and so exhibit many similar features, such the north-facing escarpment and glacial features such as lakes and cwms below the escarpment. They all fall within the border of the national park. - A landform is a natural feature of the solid surface of the Earth or other planetary body. Landforms together make up a given terrain, and their arrangement in the landscape is known as topography. Typical landforms include hills, mountains, plateaus, canyons, valleys, as well as shoreline features such as bays, peninsulas, and seas, including submerged features such as mid-ocean ridges, volcanoes, and the great ocean basins. - Powys (or ; Welsh: ) is a principal area, local-government county and preserved county in Mid Wales. It is named after the successor Kingdom of Powys, which formed after the Romans withdrew from Britain. - Yr Wyddfa commonly known as Snowdon in English, is the highest mountain in Wales, at an elevation of above sea level, and the highest point in the British Isles south of the Scottish Highlands. It is located in Snowdonia National Park (\\") in Gwynedd, and has been described as \\"probably the busiest mountain in Britain\\". It is designated as a national nature reserve for its rare flora and fauna. - In geology and earth science, a plateau (or ; plural plateaus or plateaux), also called a high plain or tableland, is an area of highland, usually consisting of relatively flat terrain that is raised significantly above the surrounding area, often with one or more sides with steep slopes. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Mynydd Troed is a hill in the Black Mountains of the Brecon Beacons National Park in Powys, south Wales. Its name literally translates to \\"Foot Mountain,\\" based how it appears when viewed from the Allt Mawr ridge. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas. - Brecon, archaically known as Brecknock, is a market town and community in Powys, Mid Wales, with a population in 2001 of 7,901, increasing to 8,250 at the 2011 census. Historically it was the county town of Brecknockshire; although its role as such was eclipsed with the formation of the County of Powys, it remains an important local centre. Brecon is the third-largest town in Powys, after Newtown and Ystradgynlais. It lies north of the Brecon Beacons mountain range, but is just within the Brecon Beacons National Park. - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England. It extends from the lower estuary of the River Severn to the North Atlantic Ocean. It takes its name from the English city of Bristol, and is over 30 miles (50 km) across at its widest point. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - Black Mixen is a subsidiary summit of Rhos Fawr or Great Rhos in the Radnor Forest. The summit is large peat bog plateau. The summit is marked with a cairn, and is next to a radio transmitter and its building. - Radnor Forest is a rock dome in Mid Wales, and a forest only in the mediaeval sense of an unenclosed area used for hunting. The highest point is Rhos Fawr or Great Rhos, a broad featureless plateau which reaches , and a similar plateau adjoining to the east, Black Mixen is the only Nuttall to have a communications mast (a radio transmitter) on its summit. - A glacier (or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of the Earth or a solid-surface planet or moon, where lava, pyroclastics and volcanic gases erupt through a break in the surface called a vent. It includes all phenomena resulting from and causing magma within the crust or mantle of the body, to rise through the crust and form volcanic rocks on the surface. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - Corn Du is a mountain immediately to the southwest of Pen y Fan and the second highest peak in South Wales at 873 m (2,864 ft), situated in the Brecon Beacons National Park. The summit itself is marked by a well structured Bronze Age cairn with a central burial cist like that on nearby Pen y Fan. The two summits are visible from great distances owing to their height above the surrounding moorland, and are famous landmarks. The views from the peaks are also panoramic and very extensive, the Black Mountain (range) and Fforest Fawr being especially obvious to the west. Mynydd Epynt is visible to the north behind the county town of Brecon, and other parts of the escarpment to the east. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Brecon Beacons National Park is one of three national parks in Wales, and is centred on the Brecon Beacons range of hills in southern Wales. It includes the Black Mountain in the west, (\\"Great Forest\\") and the Brecon Beacons in the centre and the Black Mountains in the east. - South Wales is the region of Wales bordered by England and the Bristol Channel to the east and south, and Mid Wales and West Wales to the north and west. The most densely populated region in the southwest of the United Kingdom, it is home to around 2.2 million people. The region contains almost three-quarters of the population of Wales, including the capital city of Cardiff (population approximately 350,000), as well as Swansea and Newport, with populations approximately 240,000 and 150,000 respectively. The Brecon Beacons national park covers about a third of South Wales, containing Pen y Fan, the highest mountain south of Snowdonia. - Waun Fach is the highest mountain at 2661 feet in the Black Mountains in south - eastern Wales . It is one of the three Marilyns over 600m that make up the range , the others being Black Mountain and Mynydd Troed . To the north Rhos Fawr and the Radnor Forest can be seen . After Pen y Fan , it is the second highest mountain in mainland Britain south of Snowdonia . - Snowdonia is a mountainous region in north Wales and a national park of in area. It was the first to be designated of the three national parks in Wales, in 1951. - Rhos Fawr or Great Rhos is a mountain summit in Mid Wales, and is the highest point on the Radnor Forest rock dome. - Cadair Idris or Cader Idris is a mountain in Gwynedd, Wales, which lies at the southern end of the Snowdonia National Park near the town of Dolgellau. The peak, which is one of the most popular in Wales for walkers and hikers, is composed largely of Ordovician igneous rocks, with classic glacial erosion features such as cwms, moraines, striated rocks, and roches moutonnées. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - Mid Wales (or simply \\"Y Canolbarth\\" \\"The Midlands\\") is the name given to the central region of Wales. The Mid Wales Regional Committee of the National Assembly for Wales covered the counties of Ceredigion and Powys and the area of Gwynedd that had previously been the district of Meirionydd. A similar definition is used by the BBC. The Wales Spatial Plan defines a region known as \\"Central Wales\\" which covers Ceredigion and Powys. If Mid Wales is classed as Ceredigion and Powys, the area would be 6,962 square kilometres (about the size of Cumbria). - Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping animals, or pursuing or tracking them with the intent of doing so. Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food, recreation, to remove predators that are dangerous to humans or domestic animals, or for trade. Lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching, which is the illegal killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species. The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds. - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - Pen y Fan is the highest peak in south Wales, situated in the Brecon Beacons National Park. At above sea-level, it is also the highest British peak south of Cadair Idris in Snowdonia. The twin summits of Pen y Fan and Corn Du at 873 m (2,864 ft) were formerly referred to as Cadair Arthur or 'Arthur's Seat'.

So, the charge for borrowing this book would be 20 days * 0.50 per day = 10. The other two books were kept until the end of May. So, the charge for borrowing each of these books would be 31 days * 0.50 per day = 15.50 per book. Since there were two books that she kept until the end of May, the total charge for these two books would be 2 * 15.50 = 31.

Sissi cares for her patients to the effect that they appear to be her extended family (in fact, she states that her own father is a patient in the hospital). As such, she has little experience of life outside the hospital. Meanwhile, Bodo, living with his brother, applies for a funerary job but is quickly dismissed because of his inability to control his emotions. He later robs a grocery store and during the ensuing chase indirectly causes a truck to hit Sissi. Taking cover from the police underneath the truck, Bodo finds Sissi, who cannot speak or breathe. In order to save her life, he performs an emergency tracheotomy. Once Sissi is in medical care, they are separated without Sissi ever learning his name. The circumstances of her accident prevent Sissi from re-adjusting to her mundane life at the hospital, as she obsesses about tracking down her saviour. One of her patient friends, who had accompanied her on the day of her accident, helps her do so. She manages to track down Bodo, who is not interested in maintaining contact with her or any other woman. We see several times how Bodo, in a semi-conscious state, embraces a hot stove, having to be restrained by his brother Walter.

By mid-1858 the problems with the Thames had been building for several years. In his novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was \\"a deadly sewer ... in the place of a fine, fresh river\\". In a letter to a friend, Dickens said: \\"I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature\\", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that \\"in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep\\" on the Thames foreshore, and that \\"the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter\\". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged 34–36 °C (93–97 °F)—rising to 48 °C (118 °F) in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained on the banks of the river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event \\"The Great Stink\\"; the leading article in the City Press observed that \\"Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can never forget it and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it\\". A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a \\"pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination\\", while a second wrote that \\"the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream\\". The leading article in The Illustrated London News commented that: We can colonise the remotest ends of the earth; we can conquer India; we can pay the interest of the most enormous debt ever contracted; we can spread our name, and our fame, and our fructifying wealth to every part of the world; but we cannot clean the River Thames.

But in his three decades in Hollywood he may not have faced as daunting an opponent as Apple. According to an unconfirmed report in a British publication, Willis wants to bequeath his extensive iTunes music collection to his daughters -- something that's not permitted under the current iTunes terms. The Daily Mail says the actor has spent thousands of dollars downloading music on to \\"many, many iPods\\" but, like many iTunes users, was surprised to discover that in Apple's eyes he doesn't actually own the songs. The Mail, without citing any sources, says Willis is considering legal action against Apple to gain control over the music. CNN could not confirm the report Monday, and a request sent to representatives for Willis was not immediately returned. The \\"Die Hard\\" actor's wife, Emma Heming-Willis, cast doubt on the report when she said Monday on Twitter, \\"It's not a true story.\\" But the news reports, exaggerated or not, do raise potentially significant issues about ownership of digital music and whether someone could pass on digital assets to heirs. Apple's terms and conditions for iTunes are an exhaustive, jargon-filled document that users must \\"agree\\" to before downloading content but that many people don't bother to read. In simplified terms, they state that when we buy music from iTunes, we are paying for the license to listen to songs via our iPhone, iPod or other Apple device. But we are not buying the music itself. \\"When you buy a book, you own the copy of that book but not the actual material,\\" Jonathan Handel, a Los Angeles-based entertainment attorney who specializes in digital media and intellectual property, told CNN last year. \\"What you are buying here is right to use music on certain devices.\\" If Willis did take on Apple over ownership of his iTunes collection, he might have an uphill legal battle. The iTunes terms are essentially a contract between the user and Apple, and clicking \\"Agree\\" counts as an electronic signature, digital-media lawyers say. Nothing would stop Willis from leaving music-loaded laptops or phones to his children, although things would get more complicated if his kids tried to transfer the songs to other devices. Apple limits use of digital music to Apple gadgets used by the iTunes account holder. Apple also prohibits users from downloading songs to more than 10 devices, or burning a playlist more than seven times. Willis, 57, has three adult daughters with ex-wife Demi Moore and a young daughter with current wife Heming. Apple did not respond Monday to a request for comment. The company's formidable legal team last month won a 1 billion judgment against rival Samsung in a patent dispute. Other online music retailers, such as Amazon and Google Play, impose similar restrictions on downloads. Willis was trending on Twitter Monday, with some commenters poking fun at the issue. Wrote one Twitter user, \\"I don't know what's more shocking Bruce Willis suing Apple ... or the fact he actually read the Terms and Conditions.\\" Write highlights for this article.","output":"Bruce Willis, a famous actor, wanted to give his iTunes music collection to his daughters when he passes away. However, Apple's rules say that he can't do that because he doesn't really own the music. He has spent a lot of money on his collection, so he might try to fight Apple's rules in court. This situation makes people think about who truly owns digital music and if it can be passed on to others after someone dies."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Water in the clouds becomes very cold - The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes A:","output":"The final step of the process, after the formation of snowflakes, is the precipitation of these snowflakes from the clouds as snowfall. To elaborate, let's break down the entire process step by step: 1. Water in the clouds becomes very cold: Clouds majorly consist of water droplets and ice crystals suspended in the air. The temperature of the clouds plays a crucial role in determining the state of the water particles in it. When the temperature in the cloud decreases to 32°F (0°C) or below, the water droplets start transforming into a solid state, forming ice crystals. 2. The cold water forms ice crystals: At low temperatures, water molecules slow down and come together, leading to the formation of ice crystals. These ice crystals usually form around particles like dust or pollen, which act as a nucleus. 3. The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets: The ice crystals in the cloud continue to grow in size by attracting and absorbing the surrounding supercooled water droplets. Supercooled water droplets are water droplets that remain in a liquid state even below their freezing point. This process is known as \\"accretion.\\" 4. Form snowflakes: As the ice crystals continue to grow by accreting water droplets, they eventually combine with other ice crystals to form a more complex and unique structure known as a snowflake. Snowflakes can have a diverse range of shapes and sizes, primarily depending on factors like temperature, humidity, and atmospheric conditions during their formation. A. Precipitation of snowflakes as snowfall: The final step in the process occurs when the snowflakes become heavy enough to overcome the updrafts of air within the cloud. As a result, they begin to fall from the cloud toward the ground, resulting in snowfall. The intensity and duration of the snowfall, as well as the amount of snow accumulation on the ground, depend on various factors such as temperature, atmospheric conditions, topography, and the duration for which the clouds produce snowflakes."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end?

Although both questions are related to message statuses, they address two different messaging platforms and distinct situations. The first question is about a change in iMessage status on an Apple device. iMessage is an instant messaging service developed by Apple, which allows users to send texts, documents, photos, videos, and other multimedia content over the internet between iOS or macOS devices. In the iMessage context, 'Read' implies that the recipient has opened and viewed the message, while 'Delivered' simply means the message has successfully reached the recipient's device but hasn't necessarily been read. The question is focused on understanding why the status has changed from 'read' to 'delivered.' The second question is inquiring about sending messages on Facebook and its Facebook Messenger platform. While both services are owned by Facebook, the primary difference is that Facebook Messenger is a standalone messaging app, while the Facebook platform comes with its integrated messaging service, accessible via the website or the Facebook mobile app. This question details a situation where the user has sent two messages to a non-friend recipient, one through the Facebook website (computer) and another through Facebook Messenger. The sender's concern is understanding why the message sent through Facebook Messenger is marked as 'Sent' but not 'Delivered.' They are also wondering if the recipient has marked their first message as spam. To summarize, the main difference between the questions is the platforms being discussed (Apple's iMessage and Facebook/Facebook Messenger).

Fear: Friends of the embattled Lord Rennard have warned he could expose Liberal Democrat sex scandals if he is expelled from the party. Friends of the embattled Lord Rennard have warned he could expose Liberal Democrat sex scandals if he is expelled from the party. The Liberal Democrat peer - who has denied allegations of sexual harassment - could go ‘nuclear’ if party leader Nick Clegg stops him from re-joining the party. Lord Rennard became active with the Lib Dems as an orphaned teen and has devoted his entire life to the party. Now friends feel he has been treated ‘cruelly’ and could retaliate if he is shut out permanently. He could reveal secrets, such as claims like that of a former MP who was known to be a persistent sex pest, the liaison between a Lib Dem peer and married MP, and details of gay affairs between peers and MPs, according to the Sunday Times. A spokesman for Lord Rennard declined to comment last night. The Lib Dem peer has kept silent in the last few days, as have the women who made allegations against him. According to one source, he has a ‘little black book’ filled with many politician and activists’ darkest secrets. The Lib Dem, who did not wish to be named, said that most of in the party ‘lived in fear’ of the Svengali-like figure because their careers - and family life - depended on him. The source said: ‘He is often offered up as a shoulder to cry on so everyone has off-loaded their skeletons on to him. But he has all their dirty little secrets apparently stored in a little black book. It’s no wonder that it’s taken ten years for anyone to confront him.’ Crisis management: Lord Rennard was also at the centre of managing other Lib Dem crises such as the discovery that Mark Oaten (left) had hired a rent boy and the extra-marital affairs of Lord Ashdown (right) Lord Rennard was also at the centre of. managing other Lib Dem crises such as the discovery that former MP Mark.

Not worried: Sources close to party leader Nick Clegg have called fears that Lord Rennard 'could go nuclear' a 'grubby threat' Plans for a second inquiry might be. dropped if Lord Rennard apologises but he will only do so if any threat. of legal action by the complainants is dropped. Mr Clegg’s leadership faced a fresh crisis last week after revelations that Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock sexually harassed a vulnerable constituent. Mr Clegg said the first he knew about the crisis was when he saw a report by an independent QC into the claims. There is no sign yet of the crisis abating. Yesterday (SUN), senior Lib Dem councillor in Portsmouth, Eleanor Scott, quit the party group over the way it had handled the affair. She has represented Fratton, the same ward as Mr Hancock, since 2002. Cllr Scott told the Mail she had quit the Lib Dem group of councillors on Portsmouth City Council. She added: ‘I remain a Liberal Democrat Party member, and committed to being a councillor and Portsmouth. ‘I hope that others involved in the Group’s decision On Friday will reflect on their positions, and do the right thing. ‘We need to run a city, not a game show. Cllr Scott added: ‘I have previously raised concerns with Liberal Democrat Party headquarters in London, and I trust that they will concede that they need to give me, and others here, support to clean out the Augean Stables.’ What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article, by Gerri Peev and first published on 26th January 2014, presents a distressing situation within the Liberal Democrat Party in the UK. The central character in this narrative is Lord Rennard, a prominent peer in the party, who is embroiled in allegations of sexual harassment. Here are the key points to understand: 1. **Lord Rennard's potential expulsion**: Allegations of sexual misconduct see Rennard under threat of removal from the political party he's dedicated his life to. His friends have warned about the potential ramifications if this action is taken. 2. **Retaliatory exposure**: Should Rennard be expelled, it is suggested that he could retaliate by exposing potentially damaging scandals within the Liberal Democrat party. From a former MP known as a sex pest, to gay affairs between MPs and peers, and instances of impropriety, Rennard appears to have an extensive knowledge of wrongdoings within the party. 3. **The 'Little black book'**: One anonymous Liberal Democrat source suggests that Lord Rennard has kept a record of these indiscretions using what the source calls a 'little black book'. Because of this, many in the party are said to live in fear due to their personal and professional reliance on Lord Rennard. 4. **Rennard's involvement in past crises**: Notably, Rennard has been involved in the management of past scandals within the party, including an affair of Mark Oaten's with a rent boy, and the extra-marital affairs of Lord Ashdown. He was also the chief executive during the resignation of Charles Kennedy, the previous party leader whose drinking problem became public knowledge. 5. **Potential reaction to threats of exposure**: The article cites sources close to the party leader, Nick Clegg, labeling the hinted exposure of scandals as a 'grubby threat'. The party is reportedly seeking an independent mediator to manage the tense situation. There are also plans to drop a second inquiry into Rennard's misconduct should he issue an apology and if legal threats against him are withdrawn. 6. **New crisis for Clegg’s leadership**: Other recent events have also threatened Clegg’s leadership, particularly allegations of sexual harassment against Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock. 7. **Resignations over party's handling of scandals**: Eleanor Scott, a senior Lib Dem councillor in Portsmouth, resigned from the party group due to its handling of the scandals involving both Rennard and Hancock. Despite her departure from the party group on Portsmouth City Council, Scott said she would remain a Liberal Democrat Party member and committed to being a councillor in Portsmouth. In summary, the situation within the party is tense and fraught with scandal. Lord Rennard serves as a linchpin between past, present, and potentially future controversies, holding a wealth of knowledge to which many within the party are privy. The fear of scandal exposure and internal grievances suggest a crisis within the party that extends beyond Rennard's individual case."},{"instruction":"- Plates on the Earth&#x27;s crust move slowly past each other - As the plates move, they exert a great force - When the force is large enough, the crust breaks - The stress is released as energy - The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves What might be the last step of the process?

We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system. So what started out for changing a light bulb was going to end up costing 10K.

Other luxury features include an ultra-bombé sapphire crystal screen and high-tech android-powered connectivity. But not every phone in the range is sparkling with diamonds. Among the 11 models available is the sleek Black Sport which has a simple inky leather cover, albeit one crafted from alligator skin. And should you have the cash to spare, the phones have gone on sale in the UK at - where else? - luxury department store, Harrods.

The Meridiist range, which is sold at Selfridges, includes the Jewellery Pink Sapphire, which is covered in rose alligator skin and is embellished with 47 precious stones. Even more luxurious is the Jewellery Full Diamonds model, which along with white alligator casing, is decked with 211 shimmering white diamonds. Each of the phones in the Meridiist range also comes with a complimentary concierge service, which, according to the brand, can get everything from reservations in the world's most exclusive restaurants to tickets to sold out shows. Precious stones: Tag Heuer's phones come embellished with white diamonds and pink sapphires. Over recent years, pink sapphires have become an increasingly popular part of the jewellers' repertoire. But not everyone is sold on the stones. In her book, Buried Treasure: Travels Through The Jewel Box, author Victoria Finley reveals that the gems aren't quite what they seem. Chemically rubies and sapphires are identical and are both a gemstone variety of the mineral corundum (aluminium oxide). But while sapphires get their colour from trace amounts of other elements such as titanium, copper and magnesium, only rubies contain traces of chromium - the only material to impart a pink or red colour. As a result, writes Finley, while its perfectly possible to get purple, yellow or even green sapphires, there is no such thing as a pink or red one. For jewellers, this creates a problem, as rubies are graded by their colour. Dark 'pigeon's blood' red is considered the most valuable while pale pink is virtually worthless - so much so that unscrupulous dealers will attempt to heat them in a bid to darken the colour, despite a 50 per cent chance that they'll explode instead. So what do you get when you buy a pink 'sapphire'? The answer is a low grade ruby - a classification endorsed by trade bodies such as International Colored Gemstone Association which doesn't recognise pink sapphires. Like brown diamonds, pink sapphires might be pretty, but in reality, they aren't nearly as valuable as you might think. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1.

Given these facts, what causes earth's seasons among the following options: - principals of aerodynamics - Physical weathering - floods - the tilt of the planet - an external framework - dry conditions - axis rotation - relative location The answer is:","output":"The answer is the tilt of the planet. Earth's seasons are indeed caused by the tilt of its axis relative to its orbit around the Sun. It is crucial to understand how this affects the distribution of sunlight, temperature variations, and climate changes throughout the year. Although other factors mentioned may directly or indirectly affect regional weather patterns or geological processes, they do not primarily cause the Earth's changing seasons. Let's explore in more detail why the tilt of the planet plays a pivotal role in our seasonal variations. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees. As it orbits the Sun, the orientation of this tilt does not change relative to distant stars. However, it does change relative to the Sun. This means that during certain parts of the orbit, the Northern Hemisphere receives more direct sunlight, while in others, the Southern Hemisphere receives more. It is key to remember that when one hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, experiencing summer, the other hemisphere is tilted away, entering winter. The hemisphere receiving direct sunlight experiences warming temperatures and longer days. Consequently, the opposite hemisphere experiences cooling temperatures and shorter days due to the indirect sunlight that it receives during this time. Spring and autumn occur when Earth's axial tilt is roughly parallel to its orbit, leading to equal amounts of daylight and darkness. These transitional periods result in moderate temperatures satisfying a middle ground between the warmth of summer and the cold of winter. Examining the other suggested factors further highlights that the tilt of the Earth is the primary cause of seasonal changes: 1. Principals of aerodynamics: Refers to the study of forces acting on objects in motion through the air and the effects of these forces. These principles are not directly related to the cause of Earth's seasons. 2. Physical weathering: A geological process in which rocks break down into smaller particles due to natural factors, such as temperature fluctuations and freeze-thaw cycles. Although temperature variations are connected to Earth's changing seasons, the weathering process itself does not cause these changes. 3. Floods: A temporary overflow of water that submerges land, which can be caused by weather phenomena, but does not determine the Earth's seasonal changes. 4. An external framework: This term appears to be a vague reference to any external force or structure. It is also not precise or relevant when explaining the cause of Earth's seasons. 5. Dry conditions: Arid weather can be a result or characteristic of certain regional climates during a particular season but is not the underlying cause of seasons. 6. Axis rotation: The Earth's rotation on its axis is responsible for day and night but not seasonal changes, which are directly tied to the tilt of the axis in relation to the orbit. 7. Relative location: Regions on Earth experience distinct seasons due to their latitude, with tropical and polar areas experiencing less extreme variations than temperate locations. However, this localized influence is a result of the axial tilt changing the directness of sunlight received in an area, making tilt the primary cause. In summary, the primary cause behind Earth's changing seasons is the tilt of the planet, which influences the amount of direct sunlight received by each hemisphere throughout the year. While other factors may directly or indirectly influence weather activities or geological processes, they do not hold the key role in causing Earth's seasons."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: \\"What was the \\"stumbling block\\" that Bright mentioned?\\" Context: \\"The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Indigenous Australians have lived in parts of the Northern Territory for around 40,000 years. Pre-European settlement numbers are not known with any precision, although the Indigenous population of the Northern Territory has been estimated at \\"well over 10,000\\". The area now known as Muckaty Station (often referred to as just \\"Muckaty\\", though the origin of this name and near variants such as \\"Mucketty\\" is unknown) was – and is – the responsibility of seven clans of traditional Indigenous owners: Milwayi, Ngapa, Ngarrka, Wirntiku, Kurrakurraja, Walanypirri and Yapayapa. The country is known by the Indigenous name Warlmanpa, which is also the name of a local language.Although there had been several unsuccessful attempts by British or colonial authorities to settle in the Northern Territory, there was no permanent European presence until surveyor George Goyder in 1869 established what is now known as Darwin. The timing was auspicious: in October 1870 the South Australian government decided to construct an overland telegraph line, from Port Augusta on the continent's south coast, to the new settlement just established in the country's tropical north. The line traversed what is now Muckaty Station, with repeater stations built at Powell's Creek to the north and Tennant's Creek to the south. At the same time as the telegraph line was completed in August 1872, a cattle industry was beginning to develop in central and northern Australia. The first pastoral lease in the Northern Territory was granted in 1872, and by 1911 there were at least 250 such leases covering over 180,000 square miles (470,000 km2) of the jurisdiction.

Question with options to choose from: Why did the person mentioned end up losing weight ? Available options: a). They had implemented a strict diet .. b). They had a lot of workouts to do it .. c). None of the above choices .. d). They had surgery ..","output":"The person mentioned in the scenario ended up losing weight due to option d). They had surgery, specifically gastric bypass surgery. Gastric bypass surgery is a medical procedure that promotes weight loss by restricting the amount of food that an individual can consume and altering the digestive process. This procedure consists of two major steps: the creation of a small stomach pouch and the bypassing of a portion of the small intestine. During the first step, the surgeon divides the stomach into a smaller upper section and a larger bottom section using surgical staples. The smaller pouch typically has a capacity of around 1 ounce, which significantly limits the volume of food that a person can eat. Consequently, they feel full quickly and consume fewer calories. The second step entails connecting the newly formed stomach pouch directly to the middle portion of the small intestine, bypassing the initial segment. This change in the digestive path hinders the absorption of calories and nutrients, further contributing to weight loss. It is essential to note that while gastric bypass surgery can lead to significant weight loss without the need for exercise, engaging in physical activities is still highly recommended for overall health improvements. Exercise improves cardiovascular health, muscle strength, flexibility, and mental well-being. Moreover, incorporating exercise into one's daily routine can aid in weight maintenance and prevent potential weight regain following surgery. To summarize, the person mentioned in the scenario lost weight through gastric bypass surgery (option d), which enabled them to experience significant weight loss without exercising. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that exercise remains a vital component of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and, when combined with the surgical intervention, could yield even better long-term results."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Jesse was taking care of Alex's cat for the weekend while he was gone.

Answer:","output":"While \\"Give the cat a treat\\" can be a possible future action that Alex might want to do once Alex is back, it is not a clear and definite answer based solely on the information provided. The question \\"What will Alex want to do next?\\" is broad and can encompass a range of possibilities which are not strictly limited to actions related to the cat. Alex's next steps can be influenced by various factors such as, his travel experience, his to-do list after returning, his physical and mental state. He may want to rest, have a meal, take a shower, unpack his luggage, do some catching up with work or personal matters, or check on his cat. Even if it is about the cat, Alex might first want to cuddle, pet, feed, or play with the cat rather than specifically giving it a treat. However, assuming that Alex's actions will be centered around the cat based on context, \\"Give the cat a treat\\" can be considered a valid, though not necessarily the most accurate, answer. It depends on the cat's habits and Alex's usual interactions with the cat. If giving treats is a common practice or if the treat acts as a means of apology or a symbol of reunion for leaving the cat for the weekend, then it is more likely to be a valid answer. In summary, while \\"Give the cat a treat\\" can be one of the many possible actions Alex might want to do next, it isn't a definitively valid answer without more specific information about Alex's habits, preferences, and immediate tasks after his absence.

The second alleged victim is also being represented by the same lawyer as the first accuser, and in the amended complaint, both are now suing Travolta for sexual harassment as well. EXCLUSIVE DOCUMENTS: Read The Amended Complaint Filed Against John Travolta As we previously reported, Travolta is being sued by an unidentified male masseur for assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. According to the lawsuit, the masseur tried to carry out a deep tissue massage, but “Travolta, had removed his draping and was masturbating. Travolta’s penis was fully erect, and was roughly 8 inches in length, and his pubic hair was wirey and unkempt. Sweat was pouring down Travolta’s neck, and he asked Plaintiff again to say something nice to him.” Travolta’s rep vehemently denied the initial sexual battery lawsuit that was filed on Monday and said in a statement, “This lawsuit is a complete fiction and fabrication. None of the events claimed in the suit ever occurred. The plaintiff, who refuses to give their name, knows that the suit is a baseless lie. It is for that reason that the plaintiff hasn’t been identified with a name, even though it is required to do so. On the date when plaintiff claims John met him, John was not in California, and it can be proved that he was on the East Coast. Plaintiff’s attorney has filed this suit to try and get his 15 minutes of fame. John intends to get this case thrown out, and then he will sue the attorney and Plaintiff for malicious prosecution.” PHOTOS: Top Celebrity Sex Scandals The unidentified male masseur is being repped by the same attorney who filed the initial sexual battery lawsuit against the Oscar nominated actor. According to the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday morning in Federal Court in Los Angeles, the second victim alleges that while working at an unspecified resort in Atlanta, Georgia on January 28, 2012, he did an in-room massage on Travolta. According to the docs, Travolta was staying on the 15th floor of the upscale resort, and he was referred to as Mr. White. The Plaintiff doesn’t normally do in-room massages and asked a co-worker to take the assignment, but he declined because “Travolta has been banned from a spa that the coworker used to work at in Los Angeles.” PHOTOS: Scientology Celebrity Centre Celebrates Anniversary With FamousMembers On the morning of the massage Travolta had “a strange demeanor, bloodshot eyes and climbed onto the already setup massage table…Travolta removed the entire sheet from his body, and he claimed the sheets were sticky and could not tolerate the heat…Travolta further indicated that he likes a lot of “Glutes” work meaning a massage on his buttocks…While he was massaging near Travolta’s buttocks area, Travolta would open his legs and spread his butt cheeks open and had a full erection and would maneuver in a way to try to force Doe Plaintiff No. 2 to touch his anus and around his anus.” PHOTOS: Scandalous Hollywood Ladies As the massage came to an end “Travolta suddenly turned on his stomach with his legs wide open with a full erection. He then tried to force Doe Plaintiff No. 2’s hand on Travolta’s scrotum. Then, Travolta started to grab, rub and caress Doe Plaintiff no. 2’s upper thighs and buttocks….Travolta still had an erection and wanted his abdominals done, but Travolta’s erection was in the way and he refused to have his penis covered by a sheet of a pillow case cover…Travolta started masturbating about 15 minutes left in the session, and Doe Plaintiff No.2, said he had to go,” the docs state. The masseur “complained to all of his supervisors and many coworkers to no avail.” Travolta allegedly went down “to the spa that Plaintiff No. 2 worked at, which is part of the resort Travolta was staying at, as opposed to having Doe Plaintiff No. 2 go to his room. Travolta DEMANDED that Doe Plaintiff No. 2 come back and do it again, and he refused,” the lawsuit asserts.

Travolta’s pit-bull attorney, Marty Singer, told us on Monday, that “The problem in America is anyone can sue anyone. However, in this case this unidentified plaintiff and his lawyer will regret they filed this fabricated suit. We intend to sue both of them for malicious prosecution.” DOCUMENTS: Read The Sexual Battery Lawsuit Filed Against John Travolta Singer, who was recently named as the top entertainment lawyer of the year by the Beverly Hills Bar Association, says unequivocally that he can prove Travolta was on the east coast when the masseur alleges the sexual battery took place in a Beverly Hills hotel. “My client was on the east coast,” Singer told RadarOnline.com, referring to the lawsuit’s key date of January 16, 2012. Travolta has been married to actress Kelly Preston since 1991. The couple’s oldest child, Jett, died in 2009.

Answer:","output":"In this distressing situation, Tracy would most likely want to do the following things to protect herself, seek help, and increase her chances of survival: 1. Maintain composure: It is crucial for Tracy to remain as calm as possible and refrain from panicking. This will help her think more clearly, logically, and assess her surroundings and options effectively. 2. Assess the environment: By observing her surroundings, Tracy may be able to identify potential escape routes or items that could be useful in helping her break free, signaling for help, or defending herself. 3. Find a means of communication or signal for help: Tracy may try to communicate with the outside world or draw attention to her situation by tapping on pipes/walls, shouting for help, or trying to make noise if it's safe to do so. 4. Look for an opportunity to escape: Tracy should be on the lookout for any chance to break free from her confinements or capitalizing on her captor's mistakes — such as leaving something within reach that could be utilized to loosen her bindings or open a locked door. 5. Physically defend herself: If the opportunity arises and there are no other options, Tracy may have to physically confront her kidnapper. She should aim for vulnerable spots like eyes, throat, and groin area, which might give her a chance to subdue her attacker and escape. 6.

The tree structure means that these helpers work in a team, one after another, to separate the sounds.

In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased. and the situation: Drought is major concern in the Midwest. To confront the problem scientists are trying to develop drought-resistant crops. To that end, they took a plant that was not exposed to drought. They labeled it as plant A. Then they took a similar plant, and repeatedly exposed it to drought. They labeled it as plant B. They wanted to find out what makes a plant drought-resistant. Answer the following question: Which plant would change the regulation of their stomata, plant A or plant B?","output":"Plant B, the one that was repeatedly exposed to drought conditions, would be the plant that changes the regulation of its stomata. According to the study by Tombesi et al., plants that have previously been exposed to drought conditions develop a \\"memory\\" that allows them to adapt to water-scarce environments more efficiently. Therefore, these plants (like plant B) modify their stomatal regulation in order to minimize water loss and decrease water use. Stomata are small, adjustable pores found on the surface of leaves, and they play a crucial role in regulating the exchange of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and oxygen between the plant and the atmosphere. Plants can open and close their stomata in response to different environmental conditions, such as light intensity, humidity, and temperature. In response to drought stress, plants need to maintain an appropriate balance between water loss through transpiration and the amount of carbon dioxide taken in for photosynthesis. To achieve this, they need to adjust their stomatal regulation. When plants are exposed to drought, they adopt various strategies to manage water scarcity. One such strategy, as mentioned in the Tombesi et al.'s study, is altering their stomatal regulation to reduce transpiration and increase their hydraulic safety margin. This means that plant B would have a better ability to withstand drought compared to plant A, as it has developed a mechanism to conserve water more effectively. By modifying stomatal behavior in response to drought stress, plant B would be able to close its stomata more effectively when water is scarce. This not only reduces the rate of water loss but also decreases the vulnerability of the plant to xylem cavitation, which is a process that disrupts the water transport system within the plant, leading to reduced functionality or even death. In conclusion, it is plant B that would change the regulation of their stomata as a result of being repeatedly exposed to drought conditions. This adaptive response equips plant B to better handle water scarcity, promoting its survival and making it more drought-resistant."},{"instruction":"Read this article and answer this question From the Act of Union on 1 January 1801, until 6 December 1922, the island of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

In this scene, the Phantom sings to Christine, the young soprano he falls in love with, as he leads her to his secret underground lair beneath the Opera House. The song is an attempt to seduce her with the beauty and power of music, and it demonstrates the Phantom's inner vulnerability and loneliness. On the other hand, \\"All I Ask of You\\" is a romantic duet sung by Christine and Raoul, the dashing young viscount she is in love with. The song takes place on the rooftop of the Paris Opera House, as the two characters confess their love for one another and pledge to protect each other from the Phantom's threats. \\"All I Ask of You\\" is a poignant and tender love song that showcases the deep connection between Christine and Raoul, serving as a sharp contrast to the darker and more complex relationship Christine has with the Phantom. \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" has had a profound impact on musical theater around the world and has been translated into numerous languages, grossing billions of dollars in ticket sales.

Steve Nolan. PUBLISHED:. 13:12 EST, 3 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 13:13 EST, 3 August 2013. Spelling lessons should be scrapped because children can correct mistakes on their mobile phone or computer, a university professor has claimed. Sugata Mitra, professor of educational technology at Newcastle University, said that good grammar was necessary 'maybe 100 years ago' but 'not right now'. He said that traditional spelling classes are unnecessary when students have constant access to state-of-the-art technology. Obsolete: A university professor has said that there is no place in schools for spelling and grammar lessons. Professor Mitra said that pupils should be encouraged not to rely on linguistic rules but to try and express themselves in new ways such as using mobile phone text messaging. The professor spoke out as the Government introduces a drive aimed at improving educational standards that will see pupils tested on spelling 200 complex words by the end of primary school. Alternative: Professor Mitra has said that youngsters should be encouraged to communicate in other ways such as via text messaging. A separate test in spelling, punctuation and grammar was introduced in England for 11-year-olds this year. GCSE students have also been told that they will be docked marks in exams if they do not use accurate English. Professor Mitra said in an interview with the Times that emphasising spelling and grammar in the classroom is: 'a bit unnecessary because they are skills that were very essential maybe 100 years ago but they are not right now. 'Firstly, my phone corrects my spelling so I don't really need to think about it and, secondly, because I often skip grammar and write in a cryptic way.' The professor won the 1million TED Prize to create 'cloud schools' where children learn from each other and retired experts.

Warren Clarke's gruff northern accent was familiar to millions who watched him play the taciturn Superintendent Andy Dalziel in the popular BBC drama. The Oldham-born actor played the surly police officer for 61 episodes, providing the yin to the yang provided by Colin Buchanan's Peter Pascoe. But his career spanned several decades on stage, television and film, ranging from Cold War dramas to comedy and even playing Winston Churchill in the West End. The star, who also appeared in films such as Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, is said to have died after a 'short illness'. Scroll down for video. Actor Warren Clarke, known for his role in TV drama Dalziel And Pascoe, died today at the age of 67. Pictured right with co-star Colin Buchanan. Born into a poor Lancashire family, he worked hard to achieve fame, telling the Daily Mail in 2011 that he was a 'lucky b******', adding: 'Although I've worked nearly 50 years for this, through the tough times as well as the good times.' Clarke was raised by his secretary mother and stained-glass window maker in a council house. They died within a year of one another when Warren was in his 20s, leaving him and his sister Beryl, who is 11 years older, a ‘bunch of photographs and happy memories'. He was conceived when his father returned from the War. He wanted to be a footballer until his passion for acting kicked in. ‘When I told my parents what I was going to do, they said, “Good luck, son.” He told the paper that before one television series, 1989's Nice Work, he had to ask friends for money and his wife Michelle had to sell her engagement ring to buy food. His first big-screen appearance could have led to stardom but was affected by factors out of his control. A twenty-something Clarke appeared alongside Malcolm McDowell as Dim, a half-witted yet violently evil 'droog' in Stanley Kubrick's controversial 1971 dystopian masterpiece A Clockwork Orange, based on Anthony Burgess's novel. After several court cases implicated the film's brutal violence, including the murder of a tramp in an underpass by a gang featuring McDowell and Clarke's characters, Kubrick withdrew the film from cinemas and it remained rarely shown until its re-release following his death in 1999. With appearances in Coronation Street and the Avengers already under his belt Clarke went on to appear in numerous television series and films in a wide variety of roles. Warren Clarke (left) as a thuggish droog in A Clockwork Orange with Malcolm McDowell (right) Oldham-born Clarke was also known for his starring role in BBC series Down To Earth alongside Pauline Quirke, about a family who leave the rat race to relocate to rural Devon. They included a Russian dissident opposite Clint Eastwood in 1982 Cold War thriller Firefox, a violent football hooligan in 1995's British cult classic ID, and a nouveau-riche, pig-obsessed northern Regency industrialist opposite Rowan Atkinson and Miranda Richardson in Blackadder the Third in 1987. This appearance spawned some of his best-loved lines, flattering his daughter (Richardson) by telling Blackadder: 'I'd no more place her in the hands of an unworthy man than I'd place my John Thomas in the hands of a lunatic with a pair of scissors' and 'I love her more than any pig, and that's saying summat'.

Clarke’s marriage to his first wife and the mother of his son, Rowan, ended a few years after his parents died. He said: ‘Not being there with Rowan (who was 10 at the time) was tough. Nobody has an easy time with divorce. You don’t like what’s happening but you have to get on with it. But I’ve got a happy marriage now.’ Warren met Michelle through friends 30 years ago. They tried for a baby for 20 years and had pretty much given up hope when Michele became pregnant with Georgia. ‘When I thought it would never happen, it did, then I thought, “Oh my God, I’m old enough to be a grandfather\\",' he said.

It is good to get into the habit of using the recycling bin instead of the trash can because using the","output":"recycling bin not only helps reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and other disposal sites, but also contributes to the conservation of natural resources, supports the circular economy, and aids in the mitigation of climate change. Firstly, utilizing the recycling bin aids in cutting down the volume of waste that ends up in landfills, incinerators, or other disposal sites. A significant percentage of our daily waste consists of recyclable materials such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal. By segregating and recycling these materials, we help reduce the strain on landfills and incinerators, ultimately decreasing land, air, and water pollution as well as the release of harmful greenhouse gases like methane. Secondly, recycling conserves natural resources, such as trees, water, and minerals. When we recycle paper, for instance, fewer trees need to be cut down for pulp production, which in turn helps combat deforestation, maintain ecosystems, and support biodiversity. Additionally, recycling conserves energy as the amount required to produce new products from raw materials is significantly higher than what is needed to process recycled materials. This energy-saving aspect benefits the environment and contributes to the reduction of our carbon footprint. Moreover, by adopting the habit of using the recycling bin, we foster the growth of the circular economy. In a circular economy, resources are continuously reused, reducing the need for new resources extraction. The practice of recycling extends the life cycle of products and materials, creating new job opportunities in industries like waste management, remanufacturing, and recycling. Furthermore, recycling plays a paramount role in mitigating climate change, as it reduces the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with resource extraction, refining, and processing. By recycling, we indirectly decrease our dependency on fossil fuels, consequently curbing the emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants. In conclusion, the habit of using the recycling bin over the trash can is a crucial one to adopt, as it encourages waste reduction, conserves natural resources, supports the circular economy, and helps combat climate change. By making this simple yet impactful lifestyle adjustment, we can all partake in creating a more sustainable and healthier environment for ourselves and future generations."},{"instruction":"President Donald Trump capped what has been a difficult week politically with an all-out push for tax reform Friday. In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery.

The main subjects here are \\"the activated track,\\" \\"an application,\\" and the actions related with these subjects. Step 2: After breaking down the sentence, I noticed that an important action is that the \\"activated track\\" is doing something (leaves) which happens when the application does two things: warns acoustically and provides visual, turn-by-turn. This breakdown helps us understand the sentence better. Step 3: Now, to represent these actions more clearly, I need to use punctuation. The first logical break in the sentence comes after \\"acoustically,\\" and it needs a comma to separate it from the next part of the sentence. This comma helps to highlight that the application is doing two distinct things. Step 4: Another place where punctuation is needed is after \\"visual.\\" This will create a pause needed before saying \\"turn-by-turn,\\" which in this context is used as an adjective to describe how the application provides visuals. The commas around \\"turn-by-turn\\" treat it as an appositive — additional, non-essential information — while also setting off the list of actions that the application does, which makes the sentence clearer. Step 5: With these commas included, the sentence now reads as: \\"The activated track leaves once an application warns acoustically, and also provides visual, turn-by-turn.\\" The punctuation helps divide the sentence into more manageable segments, thereby making its meaning easier to understand."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Facts: - birth date: 18 june 1987 - name: michael doyle - nationality: british - image: michael_doyle_rockingham_2008 . jpg - birth place: glasgow , scotland Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of michael doyle -lrb- racing driver -rrb- .

See options at the end Amy wrote a letter to Kai to send a clear message, Kai replied Ami with a poem which was obscure, because of the Available options: 1). letter Kai knew how Ami feels. 2). poem Kai knew how Ami feels.","output":"Amy wrote a letter to Kai to send a clear message, and as intended, Kai perfectly understood her emotions through the well-structured content of her message. However, to keep the conversation captivating and engaging, Kai decided to reply to Ami in a unique and mysterious way. As a lover of literature, he composed a poem that, although beautiful and artistic, was obscure and open to interpretation. In the first option, \\"because of the letter Kai knew how Ami feels,\\" it is apparent that Ami's letter had the desired effect. Through her direct and unambiguous words, Ami successfully communicated her feelings to Kai. The letter created a strong emotional bond between them, which was the primary purpose of Ami's correspondence. She wanted to make sure Kai understood her emotions fully, and her approach proved to be effective. Conversely, the second option, \\"because of the poem Kai knew how Ami feels,\\" suggests that despite the obscure nature of the poem, Kai was able to comprehend Ami's emotions. This option implies that the poetic expression resonated with Kai on a deep and personal level. Perhaps the metaphors and symbolism in the poem allowed him to gain a better understanding of Ami's feelings than if she had simply spelled them out. It is essential to understand that different people may respond to various forms of communication in unique ways. The medium of exchange (a letter or a poem) could evoke different emotions and understandings based on the individual's personalities, perspectives, and experiences. In this story, it seems that the combination of Ami's clear letter and Kai's obscure poem has created a dynamic and intriguing conversation between them, allowing both parties to express their emotions while puzzling and delighting the other. By engaging in such a diverse exchange, Ami and Kai have shown that communication can be as complex and layered as the emotions and feelings we share. Ultimately, the combination of their clear and obscure responses has facilitated a mutual understanding of each other's feelings."},{"instruction":"Question.

After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing...

Beginning his career in his father's Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), in 1986, Jarrett first came to prominence upon debuting in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1992. Over the next nine years, he alternated between the WWF and its main competitor, World Championship Wrestling (WCW). After WCW was purchased by the WWF in 2001, Jarrett joined the upstart World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) promotion. In April, WCW was \\"rebooted\\" by Eric Bischoff and Vince Russo, with all titles vacated as a result. Bischoff and Russo also created The New Blood, a stable of younger wrestlers who feuded with the Millionaire's Club, made up of the older members of the WCW roster. Jarrett joined The New Blood, and at Spring Stampede on April 16, he defeated Millionaires Club member Diamond Dallas Page to win the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Page regained the title on April 24, and on April 25, the title was contested in a tag team match pitting Jarrett and Bischoff against Page and actor David Arquette. Arquette won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship after pinning Bischoff. Jarrett hit Page with the championship belt while special referee Kimberly Page's back was turned; WCW official Mickie Jay counted Bischoff out while Jarrett had Page pinned, who kicked out. At Slamboree on May 7, Jarrett defeated Page and Arquette in a three way triple cage match to win his second WCW World Heavyweight Championship after Arquette turned on Page. In May, Jarrett won and lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on two further occasions, regaining the title from Ric Flair both times. Jarrett feuded with Nash and Hulk Hogan throughout June 2000, and on July 9 at Bash at the Beach, he faced Hogan with the world championship on the line; the match ended swiftly after Jarrett immediately laid down, allowing Hogan to rest a boot on his chest and win the title, with Hogan commenting, \\"That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in--because of bullshit like this!\\". Vince Russo subsequently came to the ring and delivered a profanity-laced interview in which he accused Hogan of politicking and claimed that Hogan had used his creative control to refuse to lose to Jarrett. Russo then stated that, while Hogan was free to keep the title belt he had just won (the \\"Hulk Hogan Memorial Belt\\"), Jarrett would wrestle Booker T for the official WCW World Heavyweight Championship later that night. Booker T won the resultant match and Hogan did not appear in WCW again. It is disputed whether the situation was a shoot, a work, or some combination of the two. In the following months, Jarrett briefly feuded with Booker T, Mike Awesome, Sting, Buff Bagwell, and Flair. In late 2000, he joined forces with the Harris Brothers once more, with the trio defeating The Filthy Animals at Starrcade on December 17. In the same evening, Jarrett aligned himself with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Scott Steiner by helping Steiner defeat Sid Vicious. In 2001, Jarrett and Steiner became members of The Magnificent Seven, a large stable headed by Flair. Flair and Jarrett feuded with Dusty and Dustin Rhodes until March, when WCW was purchased by the WWF. Uninterested in Jarrett, the WWF neglected to acquire his contract, leaving him without a job. On the March 26 episode of the WWF's Raw program (which coincided with the final episode of Nitro), company owner Vince McMahon was seen watching Jarrett within the WCW venue on a television set. McMahon announced Jarrett's real-life firing on air, mocking his trademark taunt of distinctly spelling out his name by saying that he would now be known as \\"Capital G, Double-O, Double-N, Double-E - GOONNEE!\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who did he defeat to become world heavyweight camp?","output":"Jeffrey Jarrett defeated Millionaires Club member Diamond Dallas Page to win the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Spring Stampede on April 16."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: Where do Nick and Elizabeth enroll their daughters coincidentally ?

I found the following answer on Google: Full-Time status varies between company and is often based on the shift the employee must work during each work week. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, that is a correct, but a rather simplified answer. The definition of full-time employment can indeed vary from company to company, and also between different countries. Further elaborating, full-time employment generally refers to the primary work schedule that a company or organization follows, where the employee is expected to work a certain number of hours or complete a certain workload each week. Employers can set different rules for what constitutes full-time employment based on necessary job duties, total hours worked, and employee availability. Generally, most businesses and organizations stick to a standard work week, defining a full-time employment position as one that requires 35 to 40 hours of work per week or more. In some instances, full-time employment is simply defined as whatever is the norm at a given business. For example, some jobs may require more than 40 hours per week to meet the full-time employment definition. Moreover, different countries have their own guidelines when it comes to defining full-time work. For instance, in the U.S., the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment, which is a matter generally to be determined by the employer, but the Affordable Care Act defines a full-time employee as an employee who is employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week. Your employment status, whether full-time or part-time, can also impact certain privileges and benefits. Usually, full-time employees are entitled to more extensive benefits, such as health insurance, retirement contributions, and paid time off, compared to their part-time counterparts. Overall, while the concept of full-time work hours varies, it typically refers to the predominant work schedule in a given context. As such, it is important for both employers and employees to clearly understand how full-time is defined in their respective workplaces to ensure fair treatment and compliance with labor laws."},{"instruction":"This article: Andy, Trevor, and Billy are childhood friends.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Exercising more heavily does indeed have an effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the body's cells. When the body is engaged in vigorous physical activity, the demand for oxygen increases, as more energy is required to be produced by cells, specifically in the muscles. To meet this increased need for oxygen, several adaptations occur within the body's systems: 1. Breathing rate and depth increase: This ensures that more air rich in oxygen is taken in and more carbon dioxide is expelled from the body. The increased rate of breathing can help transport a larger volume of oxygen to the lungs than during a resting state. 2. Heart rate increases: The cardiovascular system responds to the increased demand for oxygen by increasing the heart rate. With an elevated heart rate, blood flow is accelerated, allowing more oxygen to be supplied to the working muscles and tissues in a shorter period of time. 3. Red blood cell delivery of oxygen is enhanced: When exercising, the red blood cells carrying oxygen are diverted to the working muscles, prioritizing their oxygen needs over less-active tissues. 4. Enhanced capillary density in muscles: Regular exercise can result in an increase in the number of capillaries in the muscles, allowing for more efficient oxygen and nutrient delivery to muscle cells as well as waste removal. This adaptation can better meet the increased oxygen requirements during heavy exercise. 5. Improved oxygen extraction: When exercising, the body can become more efficient at extracting oxygen from the blood, allowing for an increased amount of oxygen to be utilized by the cells. To summarize, when exercising more heavily, the body undergoes several adaptations to ensure that sufficient oxygen is provided to the body's cells, despite the increased demand. These adaptations involve changes in breathing, heart rate, blood flow, capillary density, and oxygen extraction efficiency. As a result, less oxygen being brought to the body's cells is not a direct consequence of heavy exercise — in fact, the body compensates to ensure that sufficient oxygen is supplied to meet increased energy demands."},{"instruction":"Premise: Vishnu, a four-armed god with mace, conch, discus, and lotus, has many incarnations, of which the most famous is Krishna, who appears as conquering hero, flute-playing lover, or mischievous baby.

Nodes play a significant role in the overall structure, development, and growth of plants. On the plant stem, nodes can be found at different intervals. Between two nodes, there is a section of the stem called an \\"internode,\\" which is devoid of any leaves or buds. The length of the internodes helps dictate the overall growth pattern and appearance of the plant. Some plants have closely spaced nodes with short internodes, resulting in a bushy, dense appearance, while others have widely spaced nodes with long internodes, which give the plant a more spread-out and sparse look. Nodes are essential in transporting essential nutrients and water from the roots through the stem and up to the leaves. They contain vascular tissue, including xylem and phloem, which facilitate the transfer of water, minerals, and sugars throughout the plant. Furthermore, nodes are the primary sites for the initiation of lateral branching in plants. Depending on the species, the angle between the primary stem and the lateral branch (also referred to as the axil) can vary greatly. Axillary buds form in the axil of a leaf and have the potential to develop into lateral branches or specialized structures like flowers. This pattern of alternating nodes and internodes continues along the stem's length, depending on the growth pattern and requirements of the specific plant species. Additionally, nodes are significant in asexual reproduction for certain types of plants. Some plants can grow entirely new plants from sections of stem, called cuttings, containing at least one node. These cuttings are often used by gardeners and horticulture professionals to propagate plants without the need for seeds. In conclusion, nodes are critical structures on a plant's stem, responsible for leaf attachment, nutrient transportation, lateral branching, and potential asexual reproduction. They enable plants to grow, develop, and adapt to their environments, fulfilling various essential functions within their life cycle."},{"instruction":"Question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

But many activists show no signs of budging as the movement continues to generate heavy media attention and support from liberal circles. Looming large is the cautionary spectacle of Oakland. Police there arrested about 100 protesters before dawn Tuesday, using tear gas and riot gear to break up encampments — only to face a massive evening protest and threats of continued unrest from angry backers of the movement. Leaders in other cities said they don't want a repeat of that chaos, but it's unclear how they will eventually oust protesters who refuse to leave. Even in Los Angeles, where city leaders have greeted the demonstrators warmly, there are signs of protest fatigue and increasing anxiety about what happens next. , who earlier this month had ponchos distributed to rain-soaked Occupy L.A. protesters, said Wednesday that the encampment next to City Hall \\"cannot continue indefinitely.\\" Villaraigosa has instructed city officials to draft a plan for another location for the demonstration.

Los Angeles City Atty. Carmen Trutanich, meanwhile, said police should enforce an existing law that keeps people from camping in city parks after 10:30 p.m. since they enforce it elsewhere. Among City Hall staffers, there is ridicule about the protesters' cleanliness and resentment that a weekly farmers market — usually held on the City Hall lawn — has been forced to move. On the East Coast, where the began in September and have since spread to many cities, the approach of winter could curtail the camp-outs dramatically. Here in the more temperate West, they could theoretically continue year-round. Los Angeles police officials said they have no plans to move the protesters out. \\"We're still working as best we can and trying to be cooperative,\\" said Cmdr. Andrew Smith. He said police have a contingency plan to clear out protesters if they have to, but said if police are forced to evict protesters they would take pains to avoid the tear gas used by police in Oakland. About a dozen protesters showed up at Wednesday's City Council meeting to ask lawmakers to allow them to stay. Protester Alex Everett, 26, said he came because he was alarmed at calls for the demonstrators to move on. Everett, who moved into a tent outside of City Hall two weeks ago, said protesters would not leave without a fight. He said there may be violence if police move in to clear out the protest. would take a less confrontational tack than Oakland police \\"for public relations purposes,\\" especially as the city tries to woo an Protesters are expressing similar resolve at encampments across the country. In Lower Manhattan where the Occupy movement began, protesters show no signs of closing shop even as the weather gets colder. After battling back a city plan to clear out Zuccotti Park earlier this month, protesters have been trying to make the occupation more palatable to neighbors, who have complained about incessant drumming and urination in the streets. The local community board voted this week to support the movement, but to also limit \\"sources of noise\\" to two hours a day and to arrange for the protesters to have access to bathrooms. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. Officials are considering moving the Occupy movement protesters from their encampments in parks and public squares, as the activists show no signs of leaving voluntarily. There is concern about a possible repetition of riots and chaos similar to what happened in Oakland, where police arrested 100 protesters, which then prompted backlash in the form of an even larger protest later in the day. The authorities aim to avoid such unrest by finding other means to address the issue. 2. In Los Angeles, even though city leaders initially supported the demonstrators, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa stated that the encampment near City Hall could not continue indefinitely. He cited health and cleanliness concerns, as well as the damage to the lawn and trees in the area. The mayor instructed city officials to find an alternative location for the protest. 3. Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich suggested enforcing an existing law that forbids camping in city parks after 10:30 p.m. 4. While the approach of winter might reduce the number of protesters in the colder cities on the East Coast, the more temperate climate of the West could allow encampments to continue year-round. 5. Protesters resist the idea of being relocated and have expressed their resolve to stay at encampments across the country. In some cases, like in Lower Manhattan, they are trying to improve relations with local communities by addressing noise and sanitation issues. 6. There is concern among some protesters that attempts to remove them from their current locations could result in violence or a standoff with police, similar to the situation in Oakland."},{"instruction":"Who owns FinViz.com?

A brief or concise sentence, in its core, is a well-structured arrangement of words that clearly communicates an idea or a statement without any unnecessary elements or repetition. Learning the art of crafting brief and concise sentences is crucial for efficient written and spoken communication, as exemplified in various textual formats such as slogans, informative headlines, or summarizing statements. The art of brevity can be mastered by employing a combination of linguistic, grammatical, and stylistic tools, which are as follows: 1. Clarity and Focus: A well-constructed brief sentence avoids ambiguity and vagueness to provide a clear and understandable message. This is achieved by focusing on the main point or the core essence of the idea being conveyed. 2. Word Choice: Selecting precise and evocative words play a crucial role in establishing brevity. Favoring 'strong' verbs and nouns can eliminate the need for excessive adjectives or adverbs, which may render the sentence less effective. 3. Sentence Structure: Presenting information in the most logical, straightforward manner, with subject, verb, and object well-aligned, facilitates simplicity and brevity. 4. Omitting Redundancy: Eliminating repetitive or superfluous information streamlines the sentence and ensures that it is not unnecessarily long. 5. Maintaining Context: While brevity is important, it should not come at the expense of context and coherence. The sentence should be constructed in a way that allows it to be easily comprehended within its broader context. In conclusion, the skill of constructing brief and concise sentences is fundamental to the effectiveness of communication across various platforms and media. By understanding the various linguistic and grammatical techniques such as clarity, word choice, and sentence structure, one can create succinct sentences that convey essential information and meaning without unnecessary complexity or length. This approach, when mastered, enables efficient communication that is likely to have a stronger impact on the reader or listener."},{"instruction":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: My daughter loved this book to death - it's death literally.

Disappointment - The fact that the user mentions their work being on FF.net (FanFiction.net) and saying that no one has reviewed it yet, implies that they expected or hoped for some reviews from the online community. The absence of any feedback may have caused them to feel let down, hence, the sense of disappointment. 2. Frustration - The phrase \\"NO one reviewed YET\\" is written in capital letters, which often signifies emphasis or intensity of emotions. In this case, it seems to convey the user's frustration, implying that they might have been waiting for reviews for a significant period, or strongly believe that their work deserves attention. 3. Hopefulness - Despite the disappointment and frustration, the user still mentions their work is on FanFiction.net. The act of sharing this information in the tweet can be seen as a subtle nudge or plea to the audience, hoping to receive reviews in the future.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When considering the possibility of surpassing the speed of light, it is essential to examine the principles laid out by Albert Einstein in his theory of special relativity. According to this theory, the speed of light, or approximately 299,792 kilometers per second in a vacuum, stands as an immutable cosmic speed limit. Consequently, no object with mass can ever attain nor surpass this velocity. The reasoning behind this notion lies in the relationship between energy, mass, and velocity. As an object's speed increases, so does its relative mass. Consequently, the energy required to further accelerate the object increases as well. In fact, as an object with mass reaches the speed of light, it would hypothetically require an infinite amount of energy to continue accelerating. Aside from the energy perspective, surpassing the speed of light would also lead to numerous paradoxes and conflicts with our current understanding of causality and time. For instance, the concept of time dilation, another consequence of special relativity, postulates that as an object approaches the speed of light, time for that object slows relative to a stationary observer. Hence, if anything were to travel faster than light, it could potentially result in events occurring in reverse order, breaking the fundamental principle of cause and effect. In light of these scientific principles and the profound implications associated with breaking the cosmic speed limit, the answer to the question—whether it is possible to travel faster than the speed of light—is a resolute no."},{"instruction":"Given the following context: In 1905, Dinah Sheldon, an enthusiastic art student, is expelled from Miss Ingram's Seminary for wearing two petticoats instead of five, attending political rallies and insisting that she be allowed to study nudes.

Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.

Observing the abundance of game birds Martin wrote: There is plenty of land and water fowl in this isle—as hawks, eagles of two kinds (the one grey and of a larger size, the other much less and black, but more destructive to young cattle), black cock, heath-hen, plovers, pigeons, wild geese, ptarmigan, and cranes. Of this latter sort I have seen sixty on the shore in a flock together. The sea fowls are malls of all kinds—coulterneb, guillemot, sea cormorant, &c. The natives observe that the latter, if perfectly black, makes no good broth, nor is its flesh worth eating; but that a cormorant, which hath any white feathers or down, makes good broth, and the flesh of it is good food; and the broth is usually drunk by nurses to increase their milk. Similarly, Samuel Johnson noted that: At the tables where a stranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy is wanting. A tract of land so thinly inhabited, must have much wild-fowl; and I scarcely remember to have seen a dinner without them. The moor-game is every where to be had. That the sea abounds with fish, needs not be told, for it supplies a great part of Europe. The Isle of Sky has stags and roebucks, but no hares. They sell very numerous droves of oxen yearly to England, and therefore cannot be supposed to want beef at home. Sheep and goats are in great numbers, and they have the common domestic fowls.\\" In the modern era avian life includes the corncrake, red-throated diver, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye and golden eagle. The eggs of the last breeding pair of white-tailed sea eagle in the UK were taken by an egg collector on Skye in 1916 but the species has recently been re-introduced. The chough last bred on the island in 1900. Mountain hare (apparently absent in the 18th century) and rabbit are now abundant and preyed upon by wild cat and pine marten.

The first statement suggests a situation in which a man is being lowered using a pulley system, a mechanical apparatus commonly used to lift or lower objects by applying force. The location for this event is specified as \\"in front of a building,\\" and the mode of action is the lowering on a pulley system. Overall, this statement does not provide information on the reason or motivations behind this action and is not associated to any other event or situation. On the other hand, the statement \\"There is a dog saving a man from a well\\" describes another situation entirely. It presents an event in which a dog is taking action to save a man who is presumably trapped in a well. This event differs significantly from the first statement in several respects. The primary differences are the location (a well), the main characters involved (a man and a dog), the nature of the action (rescue), and the circumstances (being trapped in a well). Given these significant differences, one could initially conclude that the two statements are unrelated, and the first statement's premise cannot be directly determined as true based on the given statement. However, it is important to recognize that certain unknown contextual factors could bring these two seemingly distinct events under the same umbrella. For instance, if a broader context was provided to suggest these events are part of a rescue mission—where the man, who is trapped in a well, is first being saved by a dog and is then pulled in front of a building using a pulley system—the concept of both statements being true would become plausible. Similarly, if the statement about the dog saving the man from a well is a metaphor or symbolic representation of some kind of event or situation coordinating with the man being lowered on a pulley, there might be a connection between the two premises. In summary, without a shared context or additional information to bridge the gap between the two distinct events mentioned, it would be difficult to determine if the premise \\"A man is lowered on a pulley in front of a building\\" is true based solely on the statement \\"There is a dog saving a man from a well.\\" However, shared contexts, metaphors, or parallels between the two events may create a connection in which the first statement's premise could be true."},{"instruction":"Facts: - highschool: tampa -lrb- fl -rrb- jesuit - debutteam: buffalo bills - statseason: 2014 - currentnumber: 65 - birth date: 31 july 1985 - weight: 240 - debutyear: 2009 - statlabel: games played tackles fumble recoveries - heightin: 1 - statvalue: 96 11 1 - size: 225px - caption: sanborn in the 2014 nfl season . - heightft: 6 - college: florida state - name: garrison sanborn - currentteam: buffalo bills - birth place: tampa , florida - undraftedyear: 2009 - position: long snapper - nflnew: garrisonsanborn/2507731 - status: active - image: garrison sanborn.jpg Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of garrison sanborn .

They were one of the most successful vocal groups of the early rock and roll era. Their distinctive sound was a bridge between the pre-rock Tin Pan Alley tradition and the burgeoning new genre. The act went through several personnel changes, with the most successful incarnation comprising lead tenor Tony Williams, David Lynch, Paul Robi, Herb Reed, and Zola Taylor. Convinced by Jean Bennett and Tony Williams that \\"Only You\\" had potential, Ram had the Platters re-record the song during their first session for Mercury. Released in the summer of 1955, it became the group's first Top Ten hit on the pop charts and topped the R&B charts for seven weeks. The follow-up, \\"The Great Pretender\\", with lyrics written in the washroom of the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas by Buck Ram, exceeded the success of their debut and became the Platters' first national #1 hit. \\"The Great Pretender\\" was also the act's biggest R&B hit, with an 11-week run atop that chart. In 1956, the Platters appeared in the first major motion picture based around rock and roll, Rock Around the Clock, and performed both \\"Only You\\" and \\"The Great Pretender\\". The Platters' unique vocal style had touched a nerve in the music-buying public, and a string of hit singles followed, including three more national #1 hits and more modest chart successes such as \\"I'm Sorry\\" (#11) and \\"He's Mine\\" (#23) in 1957, \\"Enchanted\\" (#12) in 1959, and \\"(You've Got) The Magic Touch\\" (#4) in 1956. The Platters soon hit upon the successful formula of updating older standards, such as \\"My Prayer\\", \\"Twilight Time\\", \\"Harbor Lights\\", \\"To Each His Own\\", \\"If I Didn't Care\\", and Jerome Kern's \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\". This latter release caused a small controversy after Kern's widow expressed concern that her late husband's composition would be turned into a \\"rock and roll\\" record. It topped both the American and British charts in a Platters-style arrangement. The Platters also differed from most other groups of the era because Ram had the group incorporated in 1956. Each member of the group received a 20% share in the stock, full royalties, and their Social Security was paid. As group members left one by one, Ram and his business partner, Jean Bennett, bought their stock, which they claimed gave them ownership of the \\"Platters\\" name. A court later ruled, however, that \\"FPI was a sham used by Mr. Ram to obtain ownership in the name 'Platters', and FPI's issuance of stock to the group members was 'illegal and void' because it violated California corporate securities law.\\" The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in its inaugural year of 1998. The Platters were the first rock and roll group to have a Top Ten album in America. They were also the only act to have three songs included on the American Graffiti soundtrack that fueled an oldies revival already underway in the early to mid-1970s: \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\", \\"The Great Pretender\\", and \\"Only You (and You Alone)\\". Did they ever go on tour?","output":"Yes, The Platters were a very popular vocal group and they performed many shows and concerts, which means they went on tour. They even appeared in a major movie called \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" where they performed two of their hit songs, \\"Only You\\" and \\"The Great Pretender.\\""},{"instruction":"Write some highlights for the following article: Justin Ross Harris was indicted last week on eight counts in the hot-car death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper. Harris could face the death penalty if prosecutors decide to seek it and he's convicted of the most serious charge. However, the felony murder charge predicated on second-degree child neglect -- which was the original charge at the probable cause hearing months ago -- still poses the biggest threat to Harris' freedom. That, and, of course, the sexting charges, which will likely be the easiest to prove. But make no mistake: That felony murder charge will be how the prosecution can convict Harris of his son's murder, even if the killing was unintentional, and, in Georgia, if the underlying felony was unintentional. Each of the eight counts plays a key strategic role in maximizing the state's chances of a conviction against Harris. Following is a breakdown of these carefully calculated charges. The brilliance of the strategy is in the details. Murder in Georgia: Most states divide murder into degrees. Georgia does not. In Georgia, there's only one degree of murder, but with very different kinds of killings qualifying as murder. In this case, two types of murder are alleged: 1) an intentional killing called \\"malice\\" murder, and 2) \\"felony murder,\\" an enigmatic unintentional killing, that is still classified as murder because it is the result of an enumerated felony. Even more complicated, in this case, two different subcategories of felony murder are alleged using child neglect crimes as the predicate felony. Any of these convictions carries a minimum life sentence, but only malice murder is eligible for the death penalty. Count 1 -- malice murder: This is the murder with which we are all familiar. It's the kind committed in the Rue Morgue, or by Professor Plum with the candlestick in the billiard room; or any of the \\"Murders She Wrote.\\" Film, literature and even our board games reflect our cultural assumptions about murder -- that it's an evil crime reserved for the most wicked intent. In Georgia, that's called malice murder, which is defined as a killing with \\"malice aforethought,\\" or intent to kill. There are two kinds of malice: express and implied. Express malice is that deliberate, manifested intention to end another's life. The reality is, however, that direct evidence of deliberate intent is a rarity. Defendants don't always volunteer: \\"I shot the sheriff.\\" It's quite the opposite. Nearly all defendants steadfastly maintain their innocence; they're more likely to deny shooting the deputy. That's why the law allows for malice to also be implied from the circumstances, as long as the defendant's behavior demonstrates an \\"abandoned and malignant heart.\\" Whether express or implied, to convict here the prosecution has a heavy burden to prove this mental element. That's why felony murder is a much more appealing and devastating weapon in the charging arsenal. Counts 2 and 3 -- felony murder (which are predicated on counts 4 and 5, respectively): Felony murder is more of a legal fiction than it is traditional \\"murder.\\" It is an unintentional killing, but one that happens during the commission of another crime. The rationale is that if you commit an inherently dangerous felony, you accept the high possibility that a person will die during the act. An example would be that if you were robbing a bank and one of your co-conspirators went crazy and shot a teller and a cop? Well, you'd be charged with felony murder, even though you didn't pull the trigger. You committed a felony, and a death resulted. So, to prove felony murder, the prosecution need not prove intent to kill. It only need prove: 1) commission of the underlying felony and 2) a resulting death. Count 2 is felony murder based upon count 4: intentional child neglect. So, if the defendant acted intending to cause his child cruel and excessive physical pain, and death resulted, he has committed felony \\"murder\\" under count 2. Still the most problematic for this defendant, however, is count 3, which is the original charge from the preliminary/probable cause hearing. This is felony murder predicated on another felony, count 5, second degree child cruelty. But, instead of having to prove the defendant intentionally caused excessive physical pain (first degree), the prosecution here need only prove that he caused pain with criminal negligence (second degree), even if it was unintentional. The traditional felonies eligible for felony murder were intentional crimes: burglary, arson, rape, robbery and kidnapping. To allow felony murder for an accident seems inconsistent, but Georgia courts hold that this crime of criminal negligence can be the predicate crime for felony murder. That's right: In Georgia, you can be convicted of murder -- society's most heinous crime -- for your unintentional negligence. Count 6 -- criminal attempt: As a society, we punish not only completed crimes but also attempts to commit crimes. It makes sense: suppose a bank robber trips and breaks his leg on his way into the bank with his Glock and his President Nixon mask. He is then arrested without even entering the bank to rob it. We all agree that he cannot escape punishment simply because he's unsuccessful at robbing banks. At the same time, if the would-be robber simply fills up his gas on the way to buy a Glock and a Nixon mask, so he can rob a bank in the future, has he \\"attempted\\" a robbery yet? Where's the line? To the courts, as long as whatever the defendant does is a \\"substantial step,\\" then he's guilty of attempt. Here, the attempt is connected not to the death of his child but rather to the alleged sexual exploitation of another minor -- the target of the text messaging. Counts 7 and 8 -- dissemination of harmful material to minors: To many, these charges seem like they are tacked on, but they are anything but. In fact, they are devastating to the defendant tactically. Here's why:. Harris is now additionally charged with knowingly disseminating and furnishing to a minor female sexually explicit printed matter and photographs -- or, as the detective testified at the preliminary hearing: sexting. The Cobb County detective testified that while Cooper was in the car, Harris sent a photo of his erect penis to an underage girl and was sexting with several women. At that hearing, the defendant had a strong argument that the sexting was improper character evidence (generally not admissible to prove criminality), and more, that evidence that Harris was a creep was not admissible on the neglect or murder charges. But watch what happens now that he's been indicted on these charges: evidence supporting the sexting charges is now relevant. That evidence will at a minimum cause a jury to dislike Harris. At worst, it will be viewed as motive to be rid of his child. Second, of all the charges, these are arguably the easiest to prove, thanks to technology. Did phone 1 send something to phone 2? Was that something considered \\"harmful material\\"? Was a recipient a minor? Most of those elements can be established with phone records and a birth certificate. As for the \\"harmful material,\\" so far, if the allegations are true, it sounds like it could fit. Ultimately, this is hardly a scatter-shot indictment. Each charge plays a vital role, but the most potentially damaging is still the same charge from the preliminary hearing: the felony murder based upon the second-degree criminal neglect. After all, whether you condemn this defendant or sympathize with him, there is a preliminary consensus that at minimum he did something tragically and massively careless. And under modern law, that is apparently what we call \\"murder.\\"","output":"- Justin Ross Harris faces eight counts in the hot-car death of his son, Cooper. - Harris could face the death penalty if convicted of the malice murder charge. - The sexting charges, although likely easy to prove, pose less threat to Harris' freedom. - Felony murder charges based on child neglect could result in a life sentence for Harris. - Each of the eight charges plays a strategic role in ensuring a conviction against Harris. - Georgia law allows for convictions of murder for unintentional negligence. - Evidence supporting the sexting charges will likely impact the jury's perception of Harris."},{"instruction":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: i love the dress layered over a button down shirt .","output":"In the given sentence, the keywords can be identified as the main terms that convey the core meaning or context of the sentence.

Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight.

Tässä tapauksessa on mainittu, että sijoitukset vähenevät tai keskeytyvät takaisin vuoden 1996 tasolle, mikä tarkoittaa, että investointimäärät laskevat merkittävästi verrattuna nykyisiin tasoihin. Tällainen muutos voi vaikuttaa negatiivisesti talouden kasvuun ja aiheuttaa muita taloudellisia ja yhteiskunnallisia haasteita. Investointien vähentyessä yritykset ja yksityiset sijoittajat voivat olla vähemmän halukkaita laajentamaan liiketoimintaansa tai luomaan uusia työpaikkoja. Tämä voi vaikuttaa työttömyysasteisiin ja saattaa vaarantaa taloudellista hyvinvointia laajemmalti. Myös julkinen sektori voi joutua tarkistamaan investointitarpeitaan julkisten palvelujen rahoittamiseksi. Investointien leikkaukset voivat pakottaa hallituksen ottamaan käyttöön säästötoimenpiteitä, jotka voivat heikentää julkisten palvelujen laatua, kuten koulutusta, terveydenhuoltoa ja infrastruktuuria. Sijoitusten vähenemisen taustalla voi olla monia syitä. Esimerkiksi talouskriisi, poliittinen epävarmuus tai muut haasteet voivat vaikuttaa sijoittajien luottamukseen ja riskinottohalukkuuteen. Mikäli investointien leikkaukset tai keskeytyminen on tilapäistä, talous voi toipua ja palautua ajan myötä. Kuitenkin pitkään jatkuva investointien vähentyminen voi aiheuttaa talouden pysähtymisen ja heikentää yhteiskunnan elintasoa. Yhteenvetona on todettava, että sijoitusten vähentyminen tai keskeytyminen vuoden 1996 tasolle voi merkitä huomattavia taloudellisia ja yhteiskunnallisia muutoksia. Taustalla voi olla monia erilaisia tekijöitä, ja niiden vaikutukset voivat ulottua laajalle yrityksiin, julkiseen sektoriin ja yksilöiden elämään.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis? OPT: - yes. - it is not possible to tell. - no.","output":"To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's first examine the two statements in detail. Premise: \\"I don't know whether they'll be far enough up where they can do any good.\\" This premise implies uncertainty about the position of something (presumably an object, person, or group) and whether the position is high enough to have a positive impact or contribute to a desired outcome. The premise expresses doubt about the effectiveness of the subject based on their position or placement. Hypothesis: \\"I don't know if they will be good.\\" The hypothesis conveys uncertainty about the goodness or effectiveness of the subject. It does not specifically mention position or height as factors influencing the subject's potential goodness. Now, let's consider how the premise and hypothesis might relate to one another. The premise focuses on a specific aspect (position) as the factor causing uncertainty about the subject's potential goodness, while the hypothesis simply states that there is uncertainty about the subject's goodness without specifying the reason for the uncertainty. With this in mind, we can assess the options provided: 1. Yes: This option would suggest that the premise directly and surely leads to the conclusion expressed in the hypothesis. However, the premise is more specific in nature compared to the hypothesis, as it emphasizes the position factor. The hypothesis is more general and does not mention the position, which means it could apply to a broader range of scenarios or reasons for uncertainty. Therefore, the premise does not strictly entail the hypothesis. 2. It is not possible to tell: This option leaves room for ambiguity, potentially giving some weight to the idea that the premise might entail the hypothesis, or vice versa. Since the premise is more specific than the hypothesis, it is possible that the hypothesis might be true, even though it does not necessarily directly follow from the premise. 3. No: This option asserts that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. As previously mentioned, the premise focuses solely on the position aspect, while the hypothesis is a more generalized statement that does not consider position as an influencing factor. Based on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is that it is not possible to tell.

When her research grant is not renewed, she is forced to sell Virgil. Despite her being assured that Virgil will be sent to an animal sanctuary, instead he is taken to an Air Force base to be used in a top-secret research project involving platforms designed to simulate the operation of aircraft. Airman Jimmy Garrett (Matthew Broderick) is assigned to the same chimp project; he begins to bond with Virgil and they become attached. Jimmy discovers that Virgil has been taught sign language. Jimmy informs his superior, Dr. Carroll (William Sadler), but Carroll is not interested. Unbeknownst to Jimmy, the chimps trained on the flight simulators will be killed by radiation poisoning. Once they reach a certain level in operating the flight simulator, the chimps will be exposed to a lethal pulse of radiation in the simulator chamber to determine how long a pilot may survive after a nuclear exchange known as the second-strike scenario. When a dead chimp is removed from the simulator, Virgil breaks away from Jimmy and escapes to the room adjacent to the vivarium. Virgil sees the dead body, returns to the vivarium, and screeches to the other caged chimps. Jimmy does not know that Virgil is communicating to the others of their impending peril. Jimmy later becomes aware of the chimps' fate. He searches Virgil's file and phones Teri, who comes to the base. Concerned about his military career, Jimmy initially tells Teri that she should not have come and refuses to tell her anymore about Virgil's fate.

James Hart starts his first year at Harvard Law School in a very bad way. In his contract law course with Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr., he assumes the first class will be an outline of the course. When Kingsfield immediately delves into the material using the Socratic method and asks Hart the first question, Hart is totally unprepared and feels so utterly humiliated that, after class, he throws up in the bathroom. Hart is invited to join a study group with five other students: Franklin Ford, the fifth generation of Fords at Harvard Law School Kevin Brooks, a married man with a photographic memory, but no analytical skills Thomas Anderson Willis Bell, an abrasive individual who is devoted to property law O'Connor (Robert Lydiard)While out getting pizza, Hart is asked by a woman, Susan Fields, to walk her home, due to her feeling uncomfortable with a man who had been following her. Hart returns to her house soon after and asks her on a date, after which they begin a relationship. Their relationship is complex; she resents the time he devotes to his studies, while he expects her to provide him with a great deal of attention and wants a firm commitment. When Hart and his classmates are invited to a cocktail party hosted by Kingsfield, he is stunned to discover that Susan is Kingsfield's married daughter. (She is, however, separated from her husband and eventually gets a divorce.) She and Hart break up and get back together several times.

Here's a detailed step-by-step guide to help you frost a cupcake perfectly: 1. Gather your materials and ingredients: - Cupcakes (completely cooled) - Frosting of your choice (store-bought or homemade) - Piping bag (reusable or disposable) - Coupler (optional, but recommended) - Piping tip (preferably a large round or star tip for beginners) - Spatula, spoon, or butter knife - Scissors (if using a disposable piping bag) 2. Prepare the frosting: - If you're using homemade frosting, be sure it's mixed to a smooth, stable consistency. If it's too stiff or runny, it won't hold its shape when piped onto the cupcake. - If using store-bought frosting, you may need to mix it in a bowl to ensure a smooth consistency. - You can also add food coloring to your frosting at this stage, if desired. 3. Prepare the piping bag: - Place the piping tip inside the coupler, and then place them both into the piping bag, pushing the tip through the hole at the end of the bag. If using a disposable bag, you'll need to cut off a small portion of the tip before inserting the coupler. Make sure the hole is not too big or too small; otherwise, your piping tip may not fit securely. - Fold the top of the piping bag over your hand or a tall glass, creating a cuff to ensure the bag stays open and stable while filling. 4. Fill the piping bag with frosting: - Use a spatula, spoon, or butter knife to scoop the frosting into the piping bag, filling it no more than two-thirds full. Be sure not to overfill, as this will make it difficult to control the flow of frosting. - Once the bag is filled, carefully lift the folded cuff and twist the top portion of the bag to secure the frosting inside. This will prevent the frosting from leaking out the top when you apply pressure during piping. 5. Frosted cupcake method #1: The Swirl - Hold the piping bag at a 90-degree angle, with the tip slightly above the center of the cupcake. - Apply pressure to the bag to release the frosting, moving in a circular motion around the perimeter of the cupcake. - Continue moving inwards, creating concentric circles until you reach the center of the cupcake. - Once you've reached the center, slowly release the pressure on the piping bag and lift it straight up to create a peak. - For variations, you can pipe the swirl starting from the outer edge and moving in, or even applying more pressure to create a higher, more pronounced swirl. 6. Frosted cupcake method #2: The Blob - Hold the piping bag at a 90-degree angle, with the tip slightly above the center of the cupcake. - Apply pressure to the bag, allowing a generous blob of frosting to form on the cupcake. - Slowly release the pressure and lift the piping bag straight up to create a smooth, rounded mound of frosting. - Use the spatula, spoon, or butter knife to smooth out any rough edges or peaks for a polished look. 7. Cleanup and storage: - If you're using a reusable piping bag, be sure to wash it thoroughly with warm soapy water and allow it to air dry before storing it. - For disposable bags, simply cut off the end with the piping tip and discard the bag. - If you have leftover frosting, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week or the freezer for up to 3 months. Remember, practice makes perfect. As you frost more cupcakes and experiment with different piping tips and techniques, you'll develop your unique style and create beautifully decorated treats."},{"instruction":"After all the chemo and everything she is so little and fragile looking but is doing tons better then she was last year .

Raised at the luxurious court of Naples, Eleonora was the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici of Tuscany, later the Grand Duke. On moving into the palace, Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes; the palace was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear. Vasari also built the Vasari Corridor, an above-ground walkway from Cosimo's old palace and the seat of government, the Palazzo Vecchio, through the Uffizi, above the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti. This enabled the Grand Duke and his family to move easily and safely from their official residence to the Palazzo Pitti. Initially the Palazzo Pitti was used mostly for lodging official guests and for occasional functions of the court, while the Medicis' principal residence remained the Palazzo Vecchio. It was not until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo was occupied on a permanent basis and became home to the Medicis' art collection.Land on the Boboli hill at the rear of the palazzo was acquired in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist Niccolò Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the corps de logis of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect Baldassarre Lanci. answer the following question: What is the name of the palazzo for which it was not until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that it was occupied on a permanent basis?

Richie Porte was second, 59 seconds back, with Nairo Quintana third. Tejay van Garderen lies second overall, two minutes 52 seconds behind Froome. Colombian Quintana, a highly regarded climber, had been widely expected to launch a major attack in an attempt to claw back time but he was overtaken by Porte in the final metres of a stage that was nigh on perfect for Team Sky. It was the fifth stage win of 2013 champion Froome's Tour de France career and puts the 30-year-old in a commanding position with 11 stages remaining. All of his main rivals lost significant time on a devastating afternoon, with Quintana now three minutes nine seconds behind in the overall standings, Alberto Contador four minutes four seconds back and defending champion Vincenzo Nibali a massive six minutes 57 seconds adrift of the Team Sky rider. \\"I'm lost for words,\\" said Froome, who was in the news overnight after it was revealed Team Sky believe their computers have been hacked by critics convinced he is using performance-enhancing drugs. \\"I could not believe it when I asked the guys to push on a bit and we were hearing on the radio about the big names being dropped. It was textbook from the team and I'm just over the moon to finish it off for them.\\" Froome could not have made a more decisive statement of his intent to claim his second Tour victory. He sat in with his Team Sky team-mates while Quintana's Movistar team made the early pace up the 15km climb towards the finish. A blistering rate soon saw riders disappearing out of the back of the leading groups, while at one point Froome appeared uncomfortable as he hung on at the back of a team-mate's wheel. But that proved to be nothing more than a ruse, and when Froome made his explosive move there was nothing anybody could do to stay with him - although Quintana's efforts were enough to see him take the white jersey worn by the race's best young rider. The only danger to the Briton appeared to come from fans as they closed in around him on some of the steeper sections of the climb up the Cote de Cauterets, but they soon cleared and he powered to a potentially decisive finish in this year's race. Media playback is not supported on this device Froome's Team Sky team-mate Geraint Thomas is now in fifth place overall after finishing sixth on the stage while fellow Briton Adam Yates crossed the line in seventh after a strong ride up the mountain. \\"The plan was to sit behind Movistar and see how many riders we had left,\\" explained Thomas afterwards. \\"We had four and we all felt good. Froomey said on the radio that he felt good so let's smash it. Personally I felt great and for the team it was even better.\\" It was Bastille Day in France and the first true day of racing in the mountains as the Tour resumed after Monday's rest day. There was a lengthy breakaway involving Cofidis's Kenneth Vanbilsen and Bretagne Seche Environment's Pierrick Fedrigo that lasted most of the 167km stage, but which was never going to make it up the final climb. Vanbilsen picked up all available points at the three category four climbs but with 50 points for the stage winner, Froome now tops the King of the Mountains classification, although second-placed Porte will wear the polka dot jersey on Wednesday. There was also a change in the points classification for the Tour's leading sprinter, with Andre Greipel overhauling Peter Sagan to reclaim the green jersey after the in-form German took third at the day's intermediate sprint. More drama could follow on Wednesday when the race continues in the Pyrenees with a 188km stage that includes the infamous Col du Tourmalet climb. BBC Sport's Matt Slater: \\"July 14 is when France celebrates the revolutionary storming of a notorious prison, the Bastille; today it was the moment Chris Froome's revolutions probably locked up the yellow jersey for a second time in three years. \\"This was a devastating win for Froome and Team Sky, with Grand Tour champions and challengers scattered all over the road up to La Pierre-Saint-Martin. We knew he and his comrades were going well but this was something else. \\"What that something is will of course now be the subject of fierce debate. Froome's critics are convinced he is cheating and they claim they have the data to prove it. \\"His supporters, however, say those numbers only prove he is a special athlete who has got even better with hard work, careful eating and great coaching.

Reasoner was taught to read by his parents before entering school, gaining a strong vocabulary from his mother. Reasoner attended West High School in Minneapolis. During his time at the school, Reasoner developed his interest in journalism. Reasoner took part in covering the John F. Kennedy assassination on Friday, November 22, 1963. Walter Cronkite and Charles Collingwood had been switching back and forth to report on the incident for about four hours after Cronkite initially broke the news at 1:40 p.m. EST. Reasoner took over the anchor chair after Collingwood tossed it to him at 5:49 p.m. EST and opened with the repeat of an announcement by Frank Stanton, the president of CBS, which had already been relayed by Collingwood: He later reported on the arrival of Kennedy's body in Washington, D.C., and provided details regarding Lee Harvey Oswald (who was then accused only of killing Dallas Police Officer J. D. Tippit; he would be accused of killing the president only hours later). Reasoner left the desk when Cronkite returned to anchor CBS Evening News at 6:35 p.m. EST. He reappeared in another studio, approximately two hours later, to narrate a special program called \\"John F. Kennedy -- A Man of This Century\\", and he talked about Kennedy's career and the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson and announced the conclusion of CBS's coverage for that day. (Reasoner also anchored the final coverage of the next day, with a CBS News special titled \\"A Day to Mourn\\".) Reasoner's next appearance came two days later, Sunday, and as Reasoner was at the anchor desk, Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby while being moved in the Dallas City Jail. At that very moment, Roger Mudd was filing a report from Washington, describing the President's funeral arrangements. At this point, CBS abruptly cut back to Reasoner at the newsroom anchor desk with breaking news. At the time CBS picked up KRLD's live feed of the city jail basement, Oswald was lying on the floor and Dallas Police were apprehending Ruby. KRLD's reporter on the scene, Bob Huffaker, was heard to say, \\"Oswald has been shot, Oswald has been shot\\". After the ambulance carrying Oswald sped out of the jail en route to Parkland Hospital, KRLD switched back to CBS in New York, where Reasoner replayed the tape from the beginning so the viewers could see Ruby shooting Oswald. Several minutes later, he reported that the Dallas Police had released Ruby's name. (Reasoner was not at the anchor desk when Oswald was declared dead since he had been replaced by Cronkite.)

Among them is W.P. Inman (Jude Law), a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada (Nicole Kidman), a minister's daughter, and finds their whirlwind courtship interrupted by the American Civil War. Three years later, Inman finds himself in the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia, during the Battle of the Crater. Union soldiers tunneling beneath Confederate fortifications detonate over 300 kegs of gunpowder, in a futile attempt to undermine the position prior to their assault. As the ill-fated attack begins, Oakley (Lucas Black) an old acquaintance of Inman's from Cold Mountain, is impaled on a bayonet and mortally wounded. Inman rescues him from the fighting and takes him to a field hospital. Later that day Oakley dies in the hospital, with Inman and Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson) beside him. The next night, Inman, along with his Cherokee friend Swimmer (Jay Tavare), are sent to flush out surviving Union troops trapped behind their lines. During the raid, a burst of friendly fire kills Swimmer and seriously injures Inman. As Inman lies in the hospital near death, he has a letter from Ada read to him in which she pleads with him to stop fighting, stop marching, and come back to her. Inman recovers, andâwith the war drawing ever closer to an inevitable Confederate defeatâdecides to go home to Cold Mountain. On his journey he meets the corrupt preacher Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who is about to drown his pregnant slave lover.

They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band.

The three guitarists, billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets.

That is one possible reason for a number of encounters in the San Francisco Bay Area recently, where motorists in Stinson Beach and Bolinas have complained about coyotes chasing passing cars, snapping at tires, and even bringing traffic to a halt. Some now believe that the behavior may be caused by the ingestion of the fly amanita mushroom. “It’s a terrifying, yet beautiful thing to behold,” an anonymous commuter told The Pacific Sun. The fly amanita is a poisonous mushroom with hallucinogenic properties that are commonly consumed by coyotes and dogs. Looking much like the classic toadstool, the fly amanita can cause a wide variety of psychedelic effects when ingested and is taken as a recreational drug in many countries. However, the mushroom must first be parboiled before it can be eaten safely. As a result, most dogs or coyotes that eat the mushroom suffer from the effects of poisoning, such as vomiting and nausea. In worst cases, canines who consume the mushroom will experience seizures, bleeding, liver failure, and ultimately death. The psychedelic effects of the mushroom on canines are not well-documented, but experts say that they can be especially excitable after consumption. That fits with the accounts given by drivers on Highway 1, who say that the coyotes have been acting stranger than normal. Most healthy coyotes, as with any other animal with a keen self-preservation instinct, do not dart in and out of traffic trying to bite cars. The psychedelic mushrooms are just one theory, and not exactly the most plausible. Since the hallucinogenic properties of the mushrooms only last temporarily, it may not explain why the coyote encounters have been reported for weeks. Experts with a local animal shelter said that alternate explanations include rabies, which is also unlikely, or that motorists have simply been feeding the coyotes. Feeding any wild animal, least of all a dangerous predator, is never advised.

Learn more ||||| The sleepy beach town of Bolinas has something lively to talk about this week, as reports emerge that a coyote (or coyotes) has been attacking cars along Highway 1 in a manner so bizarre it has residents scratching their heads. The attacks are weird enough that one seemingly outlandish explanation, that the coyotes are eating hallucinogenic mushrooms and vision questing their way into interactions with drivers, is being considered. A report in the Pacific Sun details the late-night encounters had by numerous motorists. \\"A coyote has taken to staring down automobile drivers as they drive through this twisting, turning section of highway,\\" notes the paper, \\"before attacking the car and then skulking off back into the wilderness. The coyote runs up to the cars, usually at night, forcing drivers to stop as the beast stares and sniffs around the vehicle.\\" “It’s a terrifying, yet beautiful thing to behold,” one driver told the Sun. Experts aren't sure what's behind the abnormal behavior, but they are sure of one thing: It's not rabies. It seems that the attacks have been going on for a period of time longer than an animal infected with the virus could be expected to live. Lisa Bloch, director of marketing and communications for the Marin Humane Society, told the Sun that \\"[if] this is going on longer than a week or so, then it’s likely not rabies. And we don’t suspect rabies, just because it is pretty rare.” The attacks have been reportedly occurring for the past three weeks. “We are trying to figure this out,” Bloch helpfully informs us. The Sun notes that the fly agaric mushroom (amanita muscaria) grows in the area and has hallucinogenic properties, and that Bloch recently warned residents about the possible side effects of their pets eating the wild fungus. Bloch, for her part, suggested a more prosaic possibility: Drivers have been feeding the coyotes from their cars. “It’s possible that someone was feeding him and thinking that it’s cool, and magical and mystical to have a coyote eating out of his hand,” she explained. Which, when we consider that this is Bolinas we're talking about, seems in the end the likeliest of explanations. Related: Dogs Make Terrible Stoners, Are Probably Mooching All Your Weed Stash ||||| By Tom Gogola West Marin residents have lately been reporting a strange sight on Highway 1 near the Slide Ranch turnoff. It’s all the talk at Beth’s Community Kitchen in Bolinas and elsewhere: A coyote has taken to staring down automobile drivers as they drive through this twisting, turning section of highway, before attacking the car and then skulking off back into the wilderness. The coyote runs up to the cars, usually at night, forcing drivers to stop as the beast stares and sniffs around the vehicle. The coyote “attacks” have happened a bunch of times, to enough people, to warrant calls to figure out what’s going on with the animal. Or, animals, as the latest grist out of Bolinas has it that there are now two coyotes acting a little weird, or a lot weird: Drive-by coyote stare-downs have now become part of the normative experience for a Bolinas-based individual who makes numerous nighttime airport runs every week. We are not identifying this individual, who fears retribution at the vengeful paws of these bushy-tailed beasts. He would only say, “It’s a terrifying, yet beautiful thing to behold.” The Marin Humane Society has fielded at least one inquiry from a coyote-concerned citizen and is looking into the case of the aggressive coyote, says Lisa Bloch, director of marketing and communications for the society. “We are trying to figure this out.” There are three possible scenarios to explain the behavior, ranging from least probable, kind of fun to consider and most probable. The least probable problem with the coyote, or coyotes, is rabies. This sort of “Old Yeller” type of aggression usually comes at the end-stage of the disease, the “terror stage” or “zombie stage” of rabies, at which point the animal is going to die, Bloch says. These coyote attacks have been going on for at least three weeks. If it were rabies, Bloch says, the coyote would likely be dead by now. “If this is going on longer than a week or so, then it’s likely not rabies. And we don’t suspect rabies, just because it is pretty rare.” Whew, it’s not rabies. It is possible, but not probable, that the coyote has eaten something—perhaps a fly agaric mushroom (amanita muscaria) which has hallucinogenic properties—and has subsequently been tripping its tail off. The cars would therefore be some sort of coyote vision, a dark vision of human interlopers, who must be stopped before the rents get any higher in West Marin. That would be kind of cool. Bloch could not completely rule out the possibility that coyotes are having psychedelic experiences out on the feral fringes of civilization, and in fact she has been counseling dog owners of late on the dangers of poisonous mushrooms in our midst. Coyotes hold a special, spiritual place for many a West Marin resident and Bloch urges those of a coyote persuasion to keep a safe distance from the beast of lore. The animals were eradicated in these parts through the 1950s because of their deleterious impact on cattle, but now that they’re back in force—yip-yip, you need to give the beasts some space. The state estimates that there are between 250,000 and 750,000 coyotes in California. Bloch notes that while the animals are native to the county, “there were not coyotes in Marin for decades” because of a United States Department of Agriculture program that completely annihilated the Marin-based population. “When you indiscriminately kill predators, you are messing with the ecosystem.” Coyotes’ staple diet is mice, and that can get kind of monotonous, especially in a county of such rich, sustainable culinary pleasures. Which brings us to the likeliest scenario to explain what the heck those coyotes are doing up there on Highway 1 attacking cars. Camilla Fox, who founded the organization Project Coyote (projectcoyote.org) is responsible for signs that pop up around West Marin trailheads that say: “A fed coyote is a dead coyote.” The message is: Don’t feed the freaking coyotes. “If there are bad apples out there who are feeding the coyotes, they need to stop,” says Fox. “They can be cited—there’s a law that was specifically enacted to stop people from feeding wildlife.” “One possibility is that the coyote has been fed, and this is a real problem for us in Marin,” Bloch says. “It’s possible that someone was feeding him and thinking that it’s cool, and magical and mystical to have a coyote eating out of his hand.” Or, some dingbats might simply have thrown some baloney out the window in the direction of a coyote, who dutifully scarfed the meat and now wants more where that came from. Animals start acting super-aggressive, Bloch says, once the food-proffering hand has been introduced. So don’t do that, and instead understand that a fed coyote is a dead coyote. “What this means is that basically we want the animals to be afraid of us naturally,” Bloch says. “If they are not afraid of us, they come close to our cars, get hit, fight with domestic dogs and can possibly become aggressive.” The problem for coyotes is that if they turn aggressive, “the coyote is going to be blamed if a dog or, god forbid, a person is mauled.” The only recourse then is to kill the coyote. Bloch is a Tam Valley resident who says the neighbors can and should do a better job at keeping their property coyote-resistant, to limit such unwelcome outcomes. “It’s very frustrating to me—there are lots of coyotes all around, but people are leaving pet food out, small animals are roaming off leash, the cats are out. It’s an easy meal for a coyote.” The Humane Society is working the coyote-chase-car problem, Bloch says, and is asking for the public’s help—if anyone has seen the stare-down coyote near Slide Ranch, give them a holler. “We encourage people to report it right away if they see any kind of behaviors, any wildlife acting strangely, biting the tires of a car. We would go and check it out.” If the Humane Society locates the coyote or coyotes and discovers that they are injured in any way, its next stop would be at the animal rescue operation WildCare in San Rafael. But the Humane Society prefers any option that helps them save the animal while not trapping it—such as when a deer recently found itself in Bolinas Lagoon, like so many DUI drivers before it. “We pulled it out of the lagoon and once we determined the deer was OK, we led it to a quiet place so it could recover on its own.” That would be the preferred scenario for the coyote now menacing traffic on Highway 1. If the animal winds up at WildCare, “It’s not going back into nature,” Bloch says. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Coyotes in the San Francisco Bay Area have been displaying unusual behavior, such as chasing passing cars and snapping at tires.

Your job is to generate answers that are at least THREE words long. The answers need to be context specific and can not be general knowledge or a random guess. CONTEXT: Con estos vuelos consiguieron verificar simultáneamente dos aspectos de la relatividad. En primer lugar el desplazamiento de las frecuencias por efecto de la gravedad, y en segundo, la dilatación del tiempo como consecuencia de la velocidad, predicho también por Einstein (ver el primer capítulo de esta serie). Como los aviones a reacción se encuentran a gran altura durante la mayor parte de su vuelo, el corrimiento gravitacional se encarga de que los relojes de a bordo funcionen un poco más deprisa que los situados en tierra. La velocidad, a su vez, puede acelerar o retrasar adicionalmente los relojes, según que el viaje se desarrolle hacia el Oeste o hacia el Este. Para el viaje hacia el Oeste, los cálculos previos predecían que el reloj adelantaría 275 nanosegundos (mil millonésimas de segundo) después de 49 horas de vuelo, de ellos dos tercios atribuibles a la fuerza de gravedad. Para el viaje hacia el Este se estimó un retraso de 40 nanosegundos en 41 horas de vuelo. Una vez finalizado el experimento se constataron 273 y 59 nanosegundos respectivamente, valores que entran cómodamente dentro del margen de 20 nanosegundos que se dieron los científicos para amortiguar los posibles errores de medición.

In this context, the term \\"entity\\" refers to a particular thing or object that exists or has some form of significance. The question is essentially seeking information about a specific system of fortifications, which would be considered a tangible object or structure. These fortifications were built by the French along the German frontier before World War II with the intention of being impenetrable, meaning they were designed to prevent any invasion or attack from Germany. The question aims to identify the name or title of this particular system of fortifications rather than seeking a description, an abbreviation, a human, a numeric value, or a location. A brief answer to this question would be the \\"Maginot Line,\\" which was a line of concrete fortifications, obstacles, and weapon installations that the French built on the border with Germany during the interwar period. The Maginot Line was named after the French Minister of War, André Maginot, and was primarily intended to protect France against potential German aggression following World War I.

The choice between the two terms often depends on the context in which they are being used. For instance, \\"työjärjestys\\" is often used in the context of parliamentary sessions or formal meetings to describe the predefined sequence of items to be discussed and handled.

(This is not explained in this film but in the sequel, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.) Central to the plot is a poorly-funded national police unit called the Main Force Patrol (MFP, derogatorily called \\"The Bronze\\" by their enemies), which struggles to protect the Outback's few remaining townspeople from violent motorcycle gangs. The MFP's \\"top pursuit man\\" is a young police officer, Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), badge number MFP4073.A member of one of the motorcycle gangs, Crawford Montazano (nicknamed Nightrider), escapes from police custody by killing an officer and stealing his vehicle. MFP officers chase the Nightrider in a high-speed chase that results in several serious wrecks. Among those involved is a cocky motorcycle cop nicknamed Goose (Steve Bisley), who radios Max. Max pursues Nightrider in a high-speed chase which results in Nightrider's death in a fiery crash. After the dangerous chase, Max' police chief, Fifi McAfee, warns Max that Nightrider's gang will be out for him now because of Nightrider's death.Nightrider's gang, which is led by Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne), plans to avenge Nightrider's death by killing MFP officers. Meanwhile, they vandalize property, steal fuel, and terrorize the citizenry. While chewing up a town where the Nightrider's remains arrived by train, the gang brutalizes a civilian couple that tried escaping to the road; the couple is overtaken, then both of them are raped and the car is wrecked. Max and Goose are informed about the incident and go to the crime scene. They find Toecutter's young protegé, Johnny the Boy (Tim Burns), and the girl of the couple in the middle of the wreckage. Johnny's drug-fueled rantings reveal him as a member of Nightrider's gang; Goose looks on Johnny with particular disdain, as his leg was broken during the Nightrider pursuit. However, they do not kill Johnny, but arrest him...

At present, Team GB's team would feature Justin Rose and Luke Donald. Article:","output":"Title: Rory McIlroy Chooses Ireland over Great Britain for the 2016 Olympic Games Article: Four-time major champion, Rory McIlroy, has made the decision to represent Ireland instead of Great Britain at the upcoming 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. The Northern Irish golfer has been caught in a dilemma when it comes to choosing which team to play for, but McIlroy ultimately decided to represent his homeland, not wanting to disappoint his legion of fans from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. The decision made by the 32-year-old golfer has garnered considerable support, with one notable endorsement coming from Team GB's golf coach, Jamie Spence. According to Spence, McIlroy's decision to side with Team Ireland is a commendable one, as it showcases the golfer's loyalty and commitment to his roots. The Northern Irishman, who has spent a significant portion of his professional career on both the European and PGA Tours, had been weighing his options for quite some time. It was a persuasive argument made by his compatriot, Graeme McDowell, that ultimately swayed McIlroy's decision. McDowell highlighted the importance of representing their homeland, stating that it is an honor to don the national colors and showcase the talent that originates from their small island nation on the global stage. With McIlroy committing to Ireland, the current Team GB lineup will feature two of England's finest golfers, Justin Rose and Luke Donald. Rose, a former US Open champion and world number one, will lead the team with an impressive track record, having secured a victory at the 2013 US Open and a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, marking the first Olympic gold in golf since 1904. Luke Donald, on the other hand, is a five-time PGA Tour winner and former world number one, making him a strong contender to represent Great Britain in the upcoming games. While McIlroy's decision to represent Ireland has garnered support from his peers and golf enthusiasts alike, it also highlights the unique challenges faced by athletes from Northern Ireland when it comes to national representation in global events. With Northern Irish athletes being able to choose between representing Great Britain or Ireland, athletes often find themselves at the center of a delicate balancing act. Nevertheless, Rory McIlroy's choice to play for Ireland at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro should be seen as an opportunity for the golfer to connect with his roots and represent his homeland in one of the world's most prestigious sporting events. Golf fans across the globe will surely be keeping a close eye on McIlroy's performance, as he seeks to bring glory home to the Emerald Isle with a potential Olympic gold."},{"instruction":"Q:This article: The story opens with Lazlo missing, and Clam and Raj relating the tale up to this point. The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear. When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect.

On Tuesday, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank was effusive in his praise of President Donald Trump in an interview on CNBC. Plank commended the president, saying “To have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country.” Going further, Plank alluded to Trump’s plan for the wall: “He wants to build things. He wants to make bold decisions and be really decisive.” The CEO liked this action, he said, because he is “a big fan of people that operate in the world of ‘publish and iterate’ versus ‘think, think, think, think, think.” It won’t be long before liberals attempt to shame people into silencing Plank and his business. Since Trump was elected in November, they have gone after brands like New Balance and L.L. Bean for their support of the nation’s leader. We’ll have to see if any lefties post videos of themselves burning their Under Armour clothing, like they did with New Balance. For some reason, it seems unlikely that many of these social media warriors own much sports apparel to begin with.

Plank, in a CNBC interview on Tuesday, lauded Trump’s business acumen. His comments started a #BoycottUnderArmour trend on Twitter and surprised Warriors star Stephen Curry, one of the company’s primary athlete endorsers. Plank and Under Armour clarified Plank’s meaning. “To have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country,” Plank said. “People can really grab that opportunity.” “At Under Armour, our culture has always been about optimism, teamwork, and unity. We have engaged with both the prior and the current administrations in advocating on business issues that we believe are in the best interests of our consumers, teammates, and shareholders. Kevin Plank was recently invited at the request of the President of the United States, to join the American Manufacturing Council as part of a distinguished group of business leaders. He joined CEOs from companies such as Dow Chemical, Dell, Ford, GE and Tesla, among others to begin an important dialogue around creating jobs in America. We believe it is important for Under Armour to be a part of that discussion. “We have always been committed to developing innovative ways to support and invest in American jobs and manufacturing. For years, Under Armour has had a long-term strategy for domestic manufacturing and we recently launched our first women’s collection made in our hometown of Baltimore, MD. We are incredibly proud of this important first step in the evolution of creating more jobs at home. “We engage in policy, not politics. We believe in advocating for fair trade, an inclusive immigration policy that welcomes the best and the brightest and those seeking opportunity in the great tradition of our country, and tax reform that drives hiring to help create new jobs globally, across America and in Baltimore. “We have teammates from different religions, races, nationalities, genders and sexual orientations; different ages, life experiences and opinions.

His stance was much the same when his vague comments about the controversial North Carolina bill drew the ire of some in the LGBTQ community: where he stands is clear per his track record. He thought he was sure where Plank stood based on his track record. So Curry, one of the most popular endorsers of Under Armour products, said he was surprised to see the CEO praising Trump. “I spent all day yesterday on the phone,” Curry said, “with countless people at Under Armour, countless people in Kevin Plank’s camp, my team, trying to understand what was going on and where everybody stood on the issue. Based off the release that KP sent out this morning, and what he told me last night, that’s the Under Armour that I know. That’s the brand I know he’s built and one that, as of Wednesday afternoon, is something that I’m standing on.” Plank explained his stance to Curry on Tuesday, how his comments were meant exclusively from a business perspective. He distanced himself from Trump’s controversial policies and comments that have enranged women, Muslims, Mexicans, African-Americans and the impoverished across the nation. On Wednesday, Under Armour released a statement that explained Plank was part of a collaboration of private industry powers putting their brains together to effect change.

Curry, who has a contract with Under Armour that runs through 2024, said Plank working with Trump isn’t a deal-breaker for him.. He is more concerned about Under Armour adopting Trump’s values, he said. “It’s a fine line but it’s about how we’re operating,” Curry said, “how inclusive we are, what we stand for. He’s the President. There are going to be people that are tied to them. But are we promoting change? Are we doing things that are going to look out for everybody? And not being so self-serving that it’s only about making money, selling shoes, doing this and that. That’s not the priority. It’s about changing lives. I think we can continue to do that.” But would Curry really leave Under Armour, the company that helped launch his empire, if he didn’t like the direction of the company? “If there is a situation where I can look at myself in the mirror and say they don’t have my best intentions, they don’t have the right attitude about taking care of people,” Curry said. “If I can say the leadership is not in line with my core values, then there is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off if it wasn’t in line with who I am. So that’s a decision I will make every single day when I wake up. If something is not in line with what I’m about, then, yeah, I definitely need to take a stance in that respect.” Curry said he and Plank don’t talk politics and he doesn’t have interest in doing so. His relationship with Under Armour is a business relationship and his primary concern is carrying out his own mission. However, he made it clear he did not vote for Trump and is against several of Trump’s actions. “I feel like if you know who I am, you know what I stand for, and I can live with that,” Curry said. “I feel when you see my name, when you see people wearing my stuff, when you see anybody attached to me, that they share that same passion for people that I do. And that’s what I’ve been really serious about using this platform to share. I don’t get in people’s faces and out in the streets with a bullhorn doing it that way. But every opportunity I have to show love, to show respect, to show just that positivity, I feel like that’s my job and that’s what I stand for.” ||||| Plank: We are a team that knows how to win 3:22 PM ET Tue, 7 Feb 2017 | 01:09 Wall Street critics should consider Under Armour's track record of success before counting it out, CEO Kevin Plank told CNBC.

Molloy had joined the company last January.

One of the lessons that we learned and we know, you ask is this the end? No this is not the end,\\" he said.

Our business is so young, our business is really just getting started,\\" he said. \\"This company throws punches. That's what we do and it's how we continue to expect to be able to run again,\\" he said. \\"But there are tweaks. This is not to say the world is rosy.\\" Plank also mentioned his meeting with President Donald Trump to discuss jobs in U.S. Plank described Trump as \\"highly passionate\\" and a pro-business man who is a \\"real asset\\" for U.S. companies.

So, the lesson is this: if the first peppermint makes your throat hurt and a few minutes after ingesting it you feel sick to your stomach, chances are the second one will do the same. I tried one when they first arrived, enjoyed it, but felt a bit yucky about 10 minutes afterwards. I tried another one a few days later, thinking the first time must have been a fluke, but it happened again--only worse. Needless to say it was no fluke, and I won't touch them again.

After December 27, 2020 the comet would leave the inner solar system. Like many other enthusiasts Ken bought a telescope for the event. His friend Mike is interested in that event too, but is too busy to buy a telescope. and a hint : A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.

Answer:","output":"The singer-songwriter who produced his fourth studio album called \\"No Place in Heaven\\" in 2015 is Mika, full name Michael Holbrook Penniman Jr. Mika was born in Beirut, Lebanon, on August 18, 1983. However, due to the complexities of his upbringing and family background, his former nationality isn't limited to just one country. Mika's family had to leave Lebanon due to the civil war, and they moved to Paris, France, where Mika spent some of his early childhood years. As a result, one can argue that Mika's former nationality includes being French. Furthermore, Mika's family later moved to London, England, when he was nine years old, and he spent the rest of his childhood and teenage years in the United Kingdom. Consequently, he also has British nationality. In addition to French and British nationalities, Mika also has American roots, as his father was a banker from the United States. Therefore, Mika's former nationality is a mix of Lebanese, French, British, and American. This diverse background has undoubtedly influenced his music and contributed to the unique sound and style that he is known for today. In summary, the singer-songwriter Mika, who produced his fourth studio album \\"No Place in Heaven\\" in 2015, has a multifaceted former nationality, which includes Lebanese, French, British, and American influences.

The new name was created through a combination of Latin words by a London student who won a competition organized by the company to choose a new name for the product. Smith's Patent Germ Bread was developed by Richard Smith, using a specialized milling technique that retained wheat germ in the flour. This was a unique and innovative process at the time, as most bread manufacturers sifted out the wheat germ due to its tendency to spoil and shorten the shelf life of the flour. Wheat germ, however, contains vital nutrients, which made Smith's Patent Germ Bread a healthier option compared to the regular white bread. In 1886, the company organized a competition for a suitable name that could better represent their nutritious bread. A student from London won the competition with his suggestion of \\"Hovis,\\" derived from the Latin \\"hominis vis,\\" meaning \\"the strength of man.\\" The name reflected the health benefits of the bread and successfully rebranded it in the market. After adopting the new name, Hovis Bread maintained its reputation for being a wholesome, nutritious product, incorporating the wheat germ for its vital nutrients. Over the years, the company has continued to innovate and adapt to emerging health trends and consumer needs by introducing different types of bread, such as whole wheat and granary loaves, as well as products targeting specific dietary requirements like high fiber and gluten-free bread. In summary, Smith's Patent Germ Bread changed its name to Hovis Bread in the 1880s, following a successful rebranding effort that included a competition to come up with a name that better represented the nutritional value of their product. The winning name \\"Hovis\\" was derived from Latin words symbolizing \\"the strength of man,\\" which aptly illustrated the nutritious benefits of the bread containing wheat germ, a vital and innovative ingredient at the time."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given one english sentence.

Were both King Baggot and Jean-Pierre Melville French filmmakers? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we need to analyze the backgrounds and careers of both King Baggot and Jean-Pierre Melville to determine if they can be classified as French filmmakers. Starting with King Baggot, he was an American actor, screenwriter, and director born on November 7, 1879, in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. He began his career on stage and eventually entered the world of cinema in the early 1900s. Baggot worked with several production companies, including the Independent Moving Pictures (IMP) and Universal Pictures. As an actor, he appeared in over 300 films, and as a director, he helmed more than 40 films between 1913 and 1928. Some of his notable works include \\"Ivanhoe\\" (1913), \\"Black Oxen\\" (1923), and \\"Tangled Lives\\" (1918). Since Baggot was born, lived, and worked in the United States, it is evident that he was not a French filmmaker. Jean-Pierre Melville, on the other hand, was indeed a French filmmaker. Born as Jean-Pierre Grumbach on October 20, 1917, in Paris, France, he later adopted the pseudonym \\"Melville\\" in homage to the American writer Herman Melville. He was a prominent figure in French cinema, recognized for his contribution to the development of the French New Wave and the emergence of film noir. Melville directed numerous critically acclaimed films, such as \\"Le Samouraï\\" (1967), \\"Army of Shadows\\" (1969), and \\"Le Cercle Rouge\\" (1970). His works often revolved around themes of crime, loyalty, and existentialism. Throughout his career, Melville collaborated with many famous French actors, including Alain Delon, Jean-Paul Belmondo, and Catherine Deneuve. Consequently, Jean-Pierre Melville can be identified as a French filmmaker. In conclusion, only Jean-Pierre Melville can be labeled as a French filmmaker, while King Baggot was an American filmmaker. Both individuals contributed significantly to the world of cinema, but their nationalities and the cultural contexts that influenced their work were distinct."},{"instruction":"Question: Short general knowledge question: what books did emily dickinson wrote?

Yes or no? Answer: The lack of a historical and global standard for the exact measure of a \\"league\\" can be accounted for by the variable elevation of the observer (i.e., sightings from a ship's deck vs. masthead). Question: what is a league in the sea The answer to this question is:","output":"A league, specifically when referring to distance in the context of sea navigation, is an ancient unit of length that has been used by various cultures during different time periods for measuring distance. It generally refers to the distance a person, or in this case, a ship, can travel in an hour. However, the exact measurement of a league has often varied based on geographical location, historical context, and method of observation. These variations are due to several factors, including the elevation of the observer, as well as the lack of a historical and global standard for the exact measure of a \\"league.\\" The concept of a league originated with the Romans, who measured distances relative to what a person could walk within an hour. The unit was initially known as \\"mille passum,\\" meaning a thousand paces, and was later modified by other cultures to reflect their own standard units of measurement. In England, for instance, a league was equivalent to three miles, while in France, a league was often closer to 2.4 miles. When used in the context of maritime navigation, a league was typically measured based on the distance a ship could travel within one hour. An important aspect to consider when measuring distances over the sea was the observation point. A ship's deck observation would provide a different estimation compared to a view from the masthead. As various cultures had their own perspectives on how to measure a league, further discrepancies were inevitable. The height of the observer played a crucial role in estimating the distance because visibility changes depending on elevation. A sailor standing on top of the mast would have a better line of sight and be able to see further than someone on the ship's deck. This created a situation where the measurement of a league was influenced by the viewing angle, and therefore difficult to standardize globally. Furthermore, throughout history, there were no universally accepted definitions or guidelines when it came to measuring leagues at sea. As a result, the league could vary not only from one culture to another, but also within the same culture at different periods. Some historical sources indicate that a league could range from 1.5 nautical miles to more than 4.6 nautical miles in length. In summary, a league in the sea generally refers to the distance a ship could travel within one hour, but the lack of a historical and global standard for the exact measure of a \\"league\\" can be accounted for by the variable elevation of the observer (i.e., sightings from a ship's deck vs. masthead) and the influence of various cultures and time periods.

Does it follow that \\" Housing issues arise over eviction actions\\"? OPT: *yes *it is not possible to tell *no","output":"Yes, housing issues arise over eviction actions as they are a major concern for both tenants and landlords. Eviction actions occur when a landlord seeks to remove a tenant from their rental property, usually due to a breach in the tenant agreement or failure to pay rent. This process can lead to significant housing issues for several reasons. Firstly, eviction actions can cause immense stress and financial strain on tenants who may struggle to find new housing, especially if they have a history of eviction on their records. This can lead to homelessness, overcrowding in temporary accommodations, or tenants being forced to accept substandard living conditions due to a lack of available or affordable options. Secondly, landlords face challenges when carrying out eviction actions. They must adhere to the appropriate legal processes and provide sufficient notice to tenants before eviction can occur. Failure to do so can result in lawsuits, fines, or other penalties. Additionally, landlords may struggle to find new tenants, particularly if the eviction process leads to negative publicity or damaged property. Furthermore, eviction actions can exacerbate systemic housing issues that exist in certain communities. In areas where there is a lack of affordable housing or high rates of poverty, eviction actions may disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. Finally, eviction actions can also give rise to issues relating to housing discrimination. In some cases, landlords may evict tenants based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or other protected status. This not only infringes on the tenant's rights but can also perpetuate housing disparities within communities and limit access to safe, affordable, and stable housing for marginalized groups. In conclusion, housing issues do arise over eviction actions, as they can lead to homelessness, financial instability, legal challenges, and discrimination. It is essential for governments, landlords, and housing advocates to work together to address these issues, promote equitable housing policies, and ensure the protection of tenants' rights."},{"instruction":"Data: name = Zizzi, eatType = pub, food = Chinese, customer rating = 1 out of 5, familyFriendly = yes.

To use something other than cat litter for a litter box.","output":"Step 1: Determine the alternatives To use something other than cat litter for a litter box, start by researching alternative materials that could effectively control odor, absorb moisture, and be safe for the cat. Consider materials such as: - Paper-based litter - Wood-based litter - Corn or wheat-based litter - Coconut coir or other natural fiber-based litters - Sand or soil Justification: By finding alternative materials, you are expanding your options and choosing an eco-friendly and potentially cost-effective solution. Step 2: Assess suitability and safety Investigate each alternative by delving into customer reviews and researching the pros and cons. In particular, make sure that the alternative material is safe for the cat; it should be non-toxic and not pose any health hazards, such as respiratory problems or ingestion dangers. Justification: Evaluating the safety and effectiveness of each alternative ensures you provide the cat with a litter that doesn't compromise its well-being. Step 3: Test one or more alternatives After narrowing down one or more suitable alternatives, purchase a small quantity and test it in the litter box. Introduce the new material gradually by mixing it with the existing cat litter, allowing the cat to adjust to the change. Justification: Testing the alternative litter on a small scale allows you to evaluate its effectiveness and observe the cat's reactions before committing to a full switch. Step 4: Observe the cat's behavior Monitor the cat's response to the new litter material by observing whether it uses the litter box without reluctance and noting any changes in behavior. If the cat seems uncomfortable or refuses to use the litter box, try another alternative material. Justification: The cat's comfort and acceptance of the new material are essential to prevent litter box avoidance or other behavioral issues. Step 5: Make any necessary adjustments If the cat accepts the new litter material, continue to make adjustments to find the optimal amount or mix for best performance (odor control, absorption, etc.). You may experiment with different brands or blends of the alternative material if needed. Justification: Tweaking the litter mix is necessary to achieve the best results when using an alternative to traditional cat litter, ensuring both you and your cat are satisfied. Step 6: Dispose of the used litter responsibly Finally, when scooping or changing the litter box, make sure to dispose of the alternative material according to any specific guidelines outlined by the manufacturer. Some materials may be compostable or biodegradable, while others may not.

A:","output":"The discovery and use of marijuana, also known as cannabis, dates back thousands of years. The documentation of its use spans various civilizations and cultures, making it challenging to pinpoint an exact moment or person responsible for its discovery. However, we can explore the history of marijuana in several different contexts. First, it is imperative to recognize that humans have used plants and herbs for medicinal and recreational purposes since ancient times. Many of these plants, like marijuana, contain various compounds with psychoactive properties, which can alter one's state of consciousness or perception. Cannabis is believed to have originated in Central Asia, and its earliest recorded use dates back to around 500 BCE, where it was used both as a medicinal plant and a source of fiber for making clothing, rope, and other materials. The plant was cultivated and traded along the Silk Road, making its way into different cultures throughout Asia, Europe, and eventually the Americas. In ancient China, the use of marijuana as a medicinal plant has been documented since 2737 BCE, during the reign of Emperor Shen Neng. The Chinese used it to treat various ailments, such as gout, rheumatism, and malaria. In India, marijuana has been an integral part of the cultural and spiritual practices for centuries. It has been mentioned in sacred texts like the Vedas and used in various rituals and as a remedy for ailments. The Greeks and Romans knew about the psychoactive properties of cannabis, and they used it for therapeutic and recreational purposes. The Greek historian Herodotus mentioned the Scythians' rituals, where they would inhale the smoke of cannabis seeds to induce altered states of consciousness. Concerning the quoted sentence in the question, it provides useful information about the scientific understanding of the components of cannabis. It mentions that the principal psychoactive compound of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and that there are at least 483 other known compounds in the plant and at least 84 other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV). While this information is valuable for understanding the composition and pharmacological properties of the plant, it does not specifically or comprehensively address the history behind the discovery of marijuana. To provide a more complete answer, it would be important to include historical and cultural contexts, as mentioned earlier in this response, alongside the information about the plant's chemical composition. By combining these two aspects, you would offer a detailed and multidimensional understanding of how marijuana was discovered and has been used throughout history."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Your right to contest will depend greatly on \\"when\\" the test was given. Depending on your state of residency and the time of the drug test, your rights can vary drastically. For example, random drug testing in California is not considered legally valid because of its discriminatory basis. Pre-employment testing, however, is entirely valid. An employer can terminate your employment, or restrict any promotions for \\"positive\\" results. Depending on your location, the state can deny you unemployment benefits, working compensation, and disability benefits. This is the first step to formally contesting your results. The human resources department will be able to inform you about any re-testing procedures; and will provide you with the paperwork that is required to proceed. Provide them with all of the relevant paperwork, as well as the medical forms you filled out before you took the test. The process through which this contest is handled will depend greatly on the state of employment. List of everything you consumed. Any prescriptions. As discussed above, a false positive can be triggered by various household foods, vitamins, over-the-counter medications and work-out supplements. But, a false positive can also be the result of human error and may be grounds for a retest. Mix-ups can occur at the laboratory facility where tests are evaluated. The laboratory itself may not be operating up to state standards. Testing methods may be out-of-date or antiquated. Samples could have been contaminated. If you believe that your test results are flawed, or that any of your rights have been violated during the testing process, you should get in direct contact with an employment lawyer in your area. This individual will be familiar with the local laws and regulations regarding drug testing, and will be able to guide you through any legal action that you may take.","output":"In summary, drug testing can be conducted by employers at various stages, including before hiring, annually, in case of reasonable suspicion, after an accident, or randomly. An individual's right to contest the test results depends on the timing of the test as well as their state of residency. For instance, random drug testing is considered legally invalid in California due to its discriminatory nature, but pre-employment testing is permissible. If a test result is positive, employers may terminate employment or withhold promotions, and the state may deny unemployment benefits, workers' compensation, and disability benefits depending on the individual's location. To contest the results, employees can approach their human resources department to obtain information about re-testing procedures and required paperwork. The process of contesting may vary depending on the state of employment. When contesting a drug test, it is essential to list all consumed substances, such as food, vitamins, over-the-counter medications, and supplements, as well as prescriptions to build a strong case. False positive test results can be caused by human error, laboratory mix-ups, outdated testing methods, or contamination of samples. If an individual believes that their test results are flawed or their rights were violated during the testing process, they should consult an employment lawyer who is well-versed in local drug testing laws and can guide them through any legal action that might be necessary."},{"instruction":"Leo: Given the sentence \\"A man is reaching for a pink and black lamp.\\" can we conclude that \\"A man is reaching for a lamp he wants to buy.\\"?

Diamond, Denner and Hansen had recently departed the group Mercyful Fate, and decided to form a new band under the King Diamond moniker, as it was already known from the Mercyful Fate days. In 1986, King Diamond released their debut album Fatal Portrait. Since then the band have released a total of twelve studio albums (most of them concept albums), two live albums, two extended plays, five compilations and five singles. In June 1990, King Diamond began recording fifth studio album at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The drums on the album were played by Snowy Shaw using drum pads. Released on October 30, 1990, The Eye debuted at number 179 on Billboard 200. However, the band did not tour in support of the album, due to lack of label support. Following The Eye, Hal Patino and Pete Blakk were replaced by Sharlee D'Angelo and Mike Wead respectively. However this line-up ended-up not recording any material, as vocalist King Diamond reunited with Mercyful Fate in 1993 (King Diamond would balance recording and touring with both Mercyful Fate and his eponymous band throughout the 1990s). After recording and touring with Mercyful Fate, King Diamond reformed his eponymous band in 1994. With the line-up of King Diamond, Andy La Rocque, as well as guitarist Herb Simonsen, bassist Chris Estes and drummer Darrin Anthony, the band spent September through October, 1994, recording their next album. Released on June 6, 1995, The Spider's Lullabye was the band's first album on Metal Blade Records, as well as their first studio release since Fatal Portrait to not be a concept album. The album went on to peak at number 31 on the Finnish album charts. In March 1996, King Diamond began recording their seventh studio album at the Dallas Sound Lab. Released on October 1, 1996, The Graveyard saw King Diamond returning to writing concept albums. The album also charted at number 23 in Finland. After the album's release, drummer Darrin Anthony was forced to leave the band due to a car accident and was subsequently replaced by John Luke Hebert. On February 24, 1998, King Diamond released the album Voodoo, which charted at number 27 on the Finnish album chart and at number 55 on the Swedish album chart. After the album's release, guitarist Herb Simonsen was replaced by Glen Drover. When Mercyful Fate was put on hold in 1999, King Diamond began recording the album House of God at the Nomad Recording Studio in Carrollton, Dallas, Texas, with their new bassist Paul David Harbour, who had replaced Chris Estes. Released on June 20, 2000, the album peaked at number 60 in Sweden.

The actual dimensions of so-called Langstroth frames differ by region or manufacturer. These modern Langstroth hives have little in common with Rev. L. L. Langstroth's bee hive that was originally patented in 1852 and manufactured until approximately 1920. - Clostridium botulinum is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic, spore-forming, motile bacterium with the ability to produce the neurotoxin botulinum. The botulinum toxin can cause a severe flaccid paralytic disease in humans and other animals and is the most potent toxin known to mankind, natural or synthetic, with a lethal dose of 1.32.1 ng/kg in humans. - A honey super is a part of a commercial or other managed ( such as by a hobbyist ) beehive that is used to collect honey . The most common variety is the \`\` Illinois '' or \`\` medium '' super with a depth of 6 inches , in the length and width dimensions of a Langstroth hive . A honey super consists of a box in which 8 -- 10 frames are hung . Western honeybees collect nectar and store the processed nectar in honeycomb , which they build on the frames . When the honeycomb is full , the bees will reduce the moisture content of the honey to 17 - 18 % moisture content before capping the comb with beeswax . Beekeepers will take the full honey supers and extract the honey . Periods when there is an abundant nectar source available and bees are quickly bringing back the nectar , are called a honey flow . During a honey flow , beekeepers may put several honey supers onto a hive so the bees have enough storage space . Honey supers are removed in the fall when the honey is extracted , and before the hive is winterized , but enough honey is left for the bees to consume during Winter . - Nutrition is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism. It includes food intake, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion. - A tablespoon is a large spoon used for eating or serving. In most English-speaking regions, the term now refers to a large spoon used for serving, however, in some regions, including parts of Canada, it is the largest type of spoon used for eating. By extension, the term is used as a measure of volume in cooking. In this capacity, it is most commonly abbreviated \\"tbsp\\" or \\"T,\\" and occasionally referred to as a \\"tablespoonful\\" to distinguish it from the utensil. The unit of measurement varies by region: a United States tablespoon is approximately 14.8 ml, a United Kingdom tablespoon is exactly 15 ml, and an Australian tablespoon is 20 ml. The capacity of the utensil (as opposed to the measurement) is not defined by law or custom and bears no particular relation to the measurement. - A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. Females in many areas of the world have a higher risk related to the more frequent use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people. Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part. Burns are generally preventable. Treatment depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection.... - Beekeeping is the maintenance of honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, by humans. A beekeeper (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect their honey and other products that the hive produces (including beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly), to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an apiary or \\"bee yard\\". - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity. - Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by a toxin, produced by the bacterium \\"Clostridium botulinum\\". The disease begins with weakness, trouble seeing, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever. Botulism can be spread several different ways. The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water. They produce the botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin is eaten. Infant botulism happens when the bacteria develops in the intestines and releases the toxin. This typically only occurs in children less than six months old, as protective mechanisms develop after that time. Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs. In this situation, spores enter a wound, and in the absence of oxygen, release the toxin. It is not passed directly between people. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the toxin or bacteria in the person in question. Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. The toxin, though not the organism, is destroyed by heating it to more than for longer than 5 minutes. Honey can contain the organism, and for this reason, honey should not be fed to children under 12 months. Treatment is with an antitoxin. In those who lose their ability to breathe on their own, mechanical ventilation may be necessary for months. Antibiotics may be used for wound botulism. Death occurs in 5 to 10% of people. Botulism can affect many other animals. The word is from Latin, \\"botulus\\", meaning sausage. Early descriptions of botulism date from at least as far back as 1793 in Germany. - Interaction is a kind of action that occurs as two or more objects have an effect upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way causal effect. A closely related term is interconnectivity, which deals with the interactions of interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising emergent phenomena. \\"Interaction\\" has different tailored meanings in various sciences. Changes can also involve interaction. - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery. - A wound is a type of injury which happens relatively quickly in which skin is torn, cut, or punctured (an \\"open\\" wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion (a \\"closed\\" wound). In pathology, it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the dermis of the skin. - Aphids, also known as plant lice and in Britain and the Commonwealth as greenflies, blackflies, or whiteflies (not to be confused with \\"jumping plant lice\\" or true whiteflies), are small sap-sucking insects, and members of the superfamily Aphidoidea. Many species are green but other commonly occurring species may be white and wooly, brown, or black. Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions. They are capable of extremely rapid increase in numbers by asexual reproduction. The damage they do to plants has made them enemies of farmers and gardeners around the world. From a zoological standpoint they are a highly successful group of organisms. - Honey is a sugary food substance produced and stored by certain social hymenopteran insects. It is produced from the sugary secretions of plants or insects, such as floral nectar or aphid honeydew, through regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus \\"Apis\\") is the most well-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption. Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar. It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it to sugar and other sweeteners. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years. However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium \\"Clostridium botulinum\\", which can be dangerous to babies, as it may result in botulism. People who have a weakened immune system should not eat honey because of the risk of bacterial or fungal infection. Although some evidence indicates honey may be effective in treating diseases and other medical conditions, such as wounds and burns, the overall evidence for its use in therapy is not conclusive. Providing 64 calories in a typical serving of one tablespoon (15 ml) equivalent to 1272 kj per 100 g, honey has no significant nutritional value. Honey is generally safe, but may have various, potential adverse effects or interactions with excessive consumption, existing disease conditions, or drugs. Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity, depicted in Valencia, Spain by a cave painting of humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Flora is the plant life occurring in a particular region or time, generally the naturally occurring or indigenousnative plant life. The corresponding term for animal life is fauna. \\"Flora\\", \\"fauna\\" and other forms of life such as fungi are collectively referred to as biota. Sometimes bacteria and fungi are also referred to as flora, as in the terms gut flora or skin flora. - A honey bee (or honeybee) is any bee member of the genus Apis, primarily distinguished by the production and storage of honey and the construction of perennial, colonial nests from wax. Currently, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44 subspecies, though historically, from six to eleven species have been recognized. The best known honey bee is the Western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, including the stingless honey bees, but only members of the genus \\"Apis\\" are true honey bees. The study of bees including honey bees is known as melittology. - Nectar is a sugar-rich liquid produced by plants in glands called nectaries, either within the flowers with which it attracts pollinating animals, or by extrafloral nectaries, which provide a nutrient source to animal mutualists, which in turn provide antiherbivore protection. Common nectar-consuming pollinators include mosquitoes, hoverflies, wasps, bees, butterflies and moths, hummingbirds, and bats. Nectar plays an important role in the foraging economics and overall evolution of nectar-eating species; for example, nectar and its properties are responsible for the differential evolution of the African honey bee, \\"A. m. scutellata\\" and the western honey bee. - Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a simple ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847. The name \\"fructose\\" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Miller. Pure, dry fructose is a very sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables.

Jane focuses on creating the kinds of video games that enable players to make a difference in their own lives and the lives of those around them.In 2007, she helped create a video game called A World Without Oil, in which 1, 800 players tried to find new ways to transport themselves in a world without oil.Even after completing the game, the players focused on the problem and its possible solutions.Her next game, Evoke, takes an even more practical way.Game players are mainly young people in Africa.They will learn to create a business that will help stop problems such as poverty and AIDS on a local level.By the end of the game, players will be guided by experts on how to start their own businesses. \\"We can make any future we imagine and we can play any games we want,\\" she said at the TED Conference.\\"So let the world-changing games begin.\\" Answer:","output":"What is the main focus of Jane McGonigal's multi-player online role-playing games (MMORPGs) that she creates at the Institute for the Future?

Options: A. swallow B. headaches C. hydration D. hunger E. vomiting The answer is:","output":"C. hydration"},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: A company has noticed a significant increase in employee turnover in the past six months. Most employees leaving the company have cited poor work-life balance and high workload as the primary reasons. Hypothesis: Implementing flexible working hours and offering remote work options will lead to improved employee satisfaction and reduced turnover rates. Justification: 1. Establish a relevant context: In this case, I considered a situation in the workplace that has been a challenge for many companies - employee turnover. High turnover rates can negatively impact the company's performance, continuity, and overall employee morale. 2. Identify likely factors playing a role in this context: I observed that employees mention the factors causing their decision to leave - poor work-life balance and a high workload. These factors are crucial because they influence the ability to develop a potential solution or hypothesis. 3. Generate a hypothesis aimed at addressing the contextual challenge: Based on the main reasons employees gave for their departure, I proposed that offering flexible work arrangements that can improve work-life balance might increase employee satisfaction and reduce the likelihood of them leaving. 4. Consider the potential outcomes and implications of the hypothesis: If the hypothesis turns out to be accurate, this would suggest that the company could decrease turnover rates and foster a more satisfied and loyal workforce by implementing changes in work structure. The business would benefit from higher levels of continuity, better team cohesion, and potentially increased productivity."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],F={key:0},E={key:1};function R(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
