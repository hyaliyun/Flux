While the given statement about the winter storm blanketing the Midwest and being one of the worst snowstorms in decades suggests that there was a significant amount of snowfall in the region, it does not inherently imply that residents made snowmen and went sledding in the fluffy white snow. There are several possible reasons for this: 1. Safety concerns: If the snowstorm was as severe as described by weather experts, it could have led to dangerous conditions such as extreme cold, slippery roads, and limited visibility, making outdoor activities like snowman-building and sledding risky or even discouraged by local authorities. 2. Accessibility: The severity of the snowstorm might have caused disruptions to transportation systems and closures of public spaces, like parks and sled hills, making it difficult for residents to access locations for winter fun. 3. Comfort level: In the case of such severe winter storms, people might choose to stay indoors to avoid the harsh weather conditions or focus on keeping their homes safe and warm. 4. Regional culture: It is also possible that the residents of the affected area are not inclined to participate in such recreational activities due to their local culture and traditions.

Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline. We might not be quite ready to send humans to Mars, but that hasn’t stopped some bright minds coming up with ideas for what people might live in when they arrive. In a competition for Nasa called the 'Mars Base Challenge', innovators were tasked with designing living space for future astronauts. The winning design is one that intends to give explorers two bedrooms, two bathrooms and other six-sided rooms in a ‘honeycomb’ shape. Michigan-based designer has won a competition to design a home for future astronauts to live in on Mars with his 'Queen B' 3D printed design for a contest run by Nasa and Makerbot. In May this year Nasa's chief scientist Dr Ellen Stofan outlined the space agency's plans for Mars. In a series of talks across the UK she said we'll be there by the 2030s. But she explained there are key developments that must be made first. These include landing on an asteroid and building necessary components. This will ensure the first Mars-walkers survive a return trip to the red planet, she said. The competition was carried out by Nasa in alongside 3D-printing company MakerBot. It took place on Thingiverse, a website where people can share their designs for 3D printers. Contestants were tasked with designing their own abode using a 3D printer that future astronauts might one day live inside. The winning design was by Noah Hornberg from Michigan. Nasa asked entrants to design houses that could tackle Mars’ extremely cold temperature, high radiation levels, lack of oxygen and frequent dust storms. ‘My solution is to use the tessellating hexagon due to its compactness and modular potential,’ Mr Hornberg wrote in his entry. Mr Hornberg's design includes different rooms for people to use such as bedrooms and even a garden. Mr Hornberg says he chose the hexagon shape because it was less likely to break over time than squares. The hexagonal shape also allowed a number of amenities to be fitted into the separate rooms. Most of the time, Mars is clear, dry, cold, and clear. Clouds are very small, wispy and formed by carbon dioxide ice. It never rains on Mars because of the planet has a thin atmosphere and lacks a magnetic shield, the the one that cover Earth. Temperatures at the equator during the day can be as warm as 20°C. But at night, temperatures can drop to -90°C. This dramatic difference in temperature can create huge dust storms that can cover the entire planet for weeks. The maximum wind speeds on Mars recorded by the Viking Landers in the 1970's were about 30 meters per second (60 mph) with an average of 10 m/s (20 mph). ‘I have extrapolated on the idea of a fully functional apartment on Mars with all the modern amenities fit inside 16ft (5 metre) diameter hexagons. 'I think that to present Mars life to people and actually make it appealing to the public, it needs to feel like home and reflect the lifestyle trends of Earth living.’ He says his design, without any appendages sticking out, would be more practical for long-term living. And a hexagonal shape would also be less likely to distort or rupture under pressure than other shapes, such as a square. To stay warm, meanwhile, a large subterranean container would hold water to be heated in an underground electric heater. This would keep the bottom of the house heated, while the creation of steam would allow for steam-powered generators for energy.

Research relevant historical context: Cochinchina was a part of French Indochina, a collection of Southeast Asian territories under French colonization from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century. Towards the end of World War II, political developments in the region led to an atmosphere of uncertainty and a power vacuum. 2. Understand French goals: French authorities wanted to reestablish control over their former colonies after World War II. They aimed to deal with nationalist movements in the area, with the ultimate goal of maintaining their influence in the region. 3. Analyze the situation in 1946: In June 1946, France was trying to negotiate with the Viet Minh, a nationalist political and military movement in Vietnam led by Ho Chi Minh. France wanted to reassert its authority, while the Viet Minh wanted independence. 4. Examine the reason for creating the Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina: In this context, France declared Cochinchina as a separate state, the Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina, as a strategy to undermine the Viet Minh's nationalist efforts and gain the support of non-communist factions in the region. This decision aimed at weakening the Viet Minh and maintaining French presence in Indochina. Now, for the second question: 1. Analyze the constitutional aspect: The constitution of India indeed declares India to be a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. These terms carry specific meanings and convey India's political and social values. 2. Understand the reason for 'The Republic of India' usage: While the constitution explicitly uses all the terms, the country is referred to as 'The Republic of India' because it succinctly captures the essence of the state. The term 'republic' highlights its democratic structure, with elected representatives holding power. The other elements (sovereign, socialist, secular) are implicitly understood. As for your query about whether these questions are the same, I would say they differ significantly. The first question is about French colonial policy and the historical context behind the establishment of a separate state in Southeast Asia. The second question is about the nomenclature of a country based on its constitutional values. While both touch upon political aspects, they address different topics and cannot be considered as the same."},{"instruction":"Sentence: name = The Golden Curry, food = Chinese, priceRange = high, familyFriendly = yes, near = The Bakers Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","output":"To represent the content in the given sentence in data form, I will create a dictionary (also known as a key-value store) with each key representing an attribute and its corresponding value representing the information provided for that attribute.

But wow, this movie was absolutely awful. And that's being generous. First of all, the casting for the movie was terrible.

Prior to his cabinet position, he was a candidate for President of the United States in the Republican primaries in 2016. Born in Detroit, Michigan, and a graduate of Yale University and the University of Michigan Medical School, Carson has authored numerous books on his medical career and political stances. Context: By ninth grade, the family's financial situation had improved, his mother surprising neighbors by paying cash to buy a new Chrysler car, and the only government assistance they still relied on was food stamps. Carson attended the predominantly black Southwestern High School for ninth through 12th grades, graduating third in his class academically. In high school he played the baritone horn in the band, and participated in forensics (public speaking), chess club, and the U.S. Army Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) program where he reached its highest rank--cadet colonel. Carson served as a laboratory assistant in the high school's biology, chemistry, physics school laboratories beginning in 10th, 11th, and 12th grade, respectively, and worked as a biology laboratory assistant at Wayne State University the summer between 11th and 12th grades. In his book Gifted Hands, Carson relates that as a youth he had a violent temper. \\"As a teenager, I would go after people with rocks, and bricks, and baseball bats, and hammers,\\" Carson told NBC's Meet the Press in October 2015. He said he once tried to hit his mother on the head with a hammer over a clothing dispute, while in the ninth grade he tried to stab a friend who had changed the radio station. Fortunately, the blade broke in his friend's belt buckle. Carson said that the intended victim, whose identity he wants to protect, was a classmate, a friend, or a close relative. After this incident, Carson said that he began reading the Book of Proverbs and applying verses on anger. As a result, he states he \\"never had another problem with temper\\". In his various books and at campaign events, he repeated these stories and said he once attacked a schoolmate with a combination lock. Nine friends, classmates, and neighbors who grew up with him told CNN in 2015 they did not remember the anger or violence he has described. In response, Carson posted on Facebook a 1997 Parade Magazine issue, in which his mother verified the stabbing incident. He then questioned the extent of the effort CNN had exerted in the investigation. He has said that he protected white students in a biology lab after a race riot broke out at his high school in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. The Wall Street Journal confirmed the riot but could not find anyone who remembered Carson sheltering white students. Question: What High School did he attend?.

With the growing need for statistical data that reflects the different types of households, it is essential to investigate the percentage of non-households made up of individuals. This article examines the prevalence of different living arrangements other than households made up of individuals, offering insights into the changing dynamics of households across various societies. Living Arrangemennts: Definition and Categories Before delving into the statistics, it is crucial to define the term \\"household.\\" According to the United Nations, a household consists of one or more people living together in the same dwelling who share common living arrangements, pool their financial resources, and exercise some degree of reciprocity. Based on this definition, households can typically be categorized into the following types: 1. One-person households: Also known as single-person households, these are composed of a single individual living alone. 2. Family households: Families living together, which can include couples (married or cohabiting), parent(s) and child(ren), and/or other related members. 3. Multiple-person households: Non-family households with several roommates or unrelated people residing together, typically to share expenses. Non-Households Made Up of Individuals: Shifts and Statistics Given the substantial demographic and socio-economic changes experienced by societies worldwide, a diversity of households has emerged. The prevalence of non-households made up of individuals can be determined by the differences in the three categories mentioned above. In developed countries, it has been observed that there is a growing trend of people living alone or forming non-family households. Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, has reported a continuous rise in one-person households; they comprised 34.1% of all households in the EU-28 countries in 2019. A similar pattern can be observed in the United States: according to the US Census Bureau, the percentage of one-person households reached 35.7% in 2020. In contrast, the developing world presents varying trends. For example, one-person household rates in countries like India and China remain relatively low, emphasizing more traditional family living arrangements. Nevertheless, global urbanization and shifts in cultural values are influencing changes in household formations, even in these societies. As for family households, the US Census Bureau’s 2020 data indicates that 62.7% of US households were comprised of families. In the European context, Eurostat's 2019 figures show that family households represent 64.6% of all households in the EU-28 countries. On the other hand, multiple-person non-family households represent a smaller percentage of households, with a gradual rise in recent years. The US Census Bureau reports 9.7% of all households in 2020 as multiple-person non-family households, primarily consisting of unrelated roommates sharing living costs. Conclusion: The Prevalence of Non-Households Made Up of Individuals In conclusion, the percentages of non-households made up of individuals vary significantly depending on the country or region examined. Taking into account the aforementioned data, we can calculate the percentage of non-households made up of individuals by excluding one-person households from the total percentage: European context (EU-28): - One-person households: 34.1%. - Non-households made up of individuals: 100 - 34.1 = 65.9%. United States context: - One-person households: 35.7%. - Non-households made up of individuals: 100 - 35.7 = 64.3%. While these percentages are specific to the European and American contexts, it is important to acknowledge that there are substantial variations in household structures across different countries. Factors such as cultural norms, socio-economic conditions, and urbanization play influential roles in shaping household trends. By shedding light on these patterns, we better equip policymakers and researchers to devise effective solutions for catering to diverse household needs and ensuring inclusive, sustainable development."},{"instruction":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

She's challenging international rules in order to compete in the ring wearing a hijab, a long-sleeved shirt and leggings. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Amaiya Zafar is a young girl in Minnesota who, like many her age, found a sport she loves and desperately wants to practice it, to learn more about herself and to test just how good she can become. But there are significant barriers standing in Zafar’s way. For one, the sport she fell in love with is amateur boxing. More significantly, she is a 15-year-old Muslim girl who is as devout as she is dedicated and she wants to wear a hijab, a headcovering for Muslim women, under her boxing headgear and uniform. While it’s nearly impossible for her to find opponents in her size and age groups, the bigger roadblock is that international rules that govern the sport do not allow her to wear a hijab in competition. Maybe, the 10th grader thinks, boxing rules should evolve with the times. “I think the rules are old school,” Zafar, who lives in Oakdale, Minn., told The Washington Post. “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with getting them changed.” Her mother, Sarah O’Keefe-Zafar, believes the rule is now having unintended consequences. “I don’t think they ever intended to exclude anybody from the sport,” she told The Post. Against the odds for most young girls, Zafar fell hard for boxing two years ago when she saw the ring at a Minneapolis-area gym. Her father, Mohammad, suggested that she take up fencing, but that wasn’t for Amaiya. “I’ll box before I’ll fence,” she told him. And that was that. He helped her understand the finer points of the sport by showing her videos and teaching her about amateur boxing. Finally, she stepped into a gym and then the ring. “Everyone was like, ‘That’s Amaiya. She’s the small one,’ ” she said. Her parents, meanwhile, went from supportive to enthusiastic. “When she first trained, I came into this as a mom and a nurse,” O’Keefe-Zafar said, “but she was dedicated and trained for over a year without sparring. And I watched her go from a timid little girl to a confident young person.” Finally, she had to prove herself in the ring against an opponent. “All the boys around the ring kept telling him, ‘She’s just a girl. Punch her pretty little face off. You can’t let a girl beat you,’ ” Amaiya Zafar said. After she scored the last jab, she had the last word with the boy and his friends: “I might be a girl, but you hit like a girl.” Eventually, she found acceptance in the ring. “Now they’re my team,” she said, adding that they work out together and that “it’s fun to spar.” And when Zafar, one of three children in her family, takes a hit? “I look at it as something I did wrong defensively,” she said. “I try to learn from it and focus a lot on defense.” Zafar is a boxing purist; she won’t try to become the next Ronda Rousey. “I’m not a wrestler, I’m not a kickboxer. Amateur boxing is not like pro boxing,” she said. Rules about a hijab aren’t the only obstacle in Zafar’s way, though. She now stands 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 106 pounds; she’s always, she says, “the small one” at the gym. There aren’t a ton of possible opponents for women to begin with, let alone those in her height and weight class. In addition, opponents must be within two years of one another. And there’s the hijab. Removing it isn’t an option for a girl to whom faith matters deeply. International boxing rules stipulate that she cover neither her arms nor her legs below the knees and Zafar would like to wear a long-sleeved Under Armour shirt and leggings beneath her tank top and shorts. USA Boxing has requested a provisional ruling from AIBA, the international boxing organization to which USA boxing defers on rules. Neither USA Boxing nor AIBA responded to a number of requests for comment from The Post. Martino cited safety as a consideration for the rules. “If you’re covering up arms, if you’re covering up legs, could there be preexisting injury?” Michael Martino, the organization’s interim executive director, told MPR News’ Laura Yuen in September. “And then if someone got hurt during the event, the referee wouldn’t be able to see it.” While USA Boxing awaits some sort of ruling from AIBA’s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, Martino said there was only so much officials could do. “We have 30,000 amateur boxers in the United States,” Martino said. “So if you make allowances for one religious group, what if another comes in and says we have a different type of uniform we have to wear? You have to draw a line some place.” Jaylani Hussein, executive director of Minnesota’s Council on American-Islamic Relations, told WDAZ.com that USA Boxing’s appeal was the right move. “You know, I think we are looking for an opportunity for this young girl to get a chance to do what all young teenagers [do], especially girls who want to play in this unique sport boxing and the only difference is that she’s a Muslim,” Hussein said. Zafar isn’t the first athlete to fight to wear a hijab during sports. In the spring of 2014, FIFA lifted a ban on players wearing religious head coverings during games. While she waits for the evolution of her sport, she focuses on her training. Boxing is something that is always there for her: “If I’m in a bad mood, emotional or having a bad day, my mom will say, ‘Get your butt out the door and get to the gym.’ ” While her mother says the family is “patient and hopeful” that a rule provision will come down, Zafar is taking her enthusiasm for the sport in another direction, one that brings nearly the same note of excitement to her voice as merely talking about boxing does. “I’m teaching a boxing class at the gym on Saturday mornings,” she said, “and I have eight [students] wearing hijab in the class.” Like her mother, her father sees boxing as a larger part of Amaiya’s life. “As a parent, person of faith and a person who admires integrity, determination and fight, as a father I am bursting with joy to see my daughter so strong in her quest to be the best in her faith and in life,” he wrote to The Post. “She has a competitive endeavor that flows through her actions and produces the most powerful and the most positive energy that is felt by those who know her. She gets respect by her actions and demands her place in a world through resiliency. She holds on to the rope of honor and gives back 110 percent to those she mentors. She lives by example and breathes by determination. This is my daughter Amaiya Zafar and I am her father.” After spending most of her career in traditional print sports journalism, Cindy began blogging and tweeting, first as NFL/Redskins editor, and, since August 2010, at The Early Lead. She also is the social media editor for Sports. What was this article about?","output":"Amaiya Zafar is a 15-year-old girl who loves boxing. She is also a Muslim girl who wants to wear a hijab, a special headscarf, under her boxing gear. However, there are international rules in boxing that say she cannot wear a hijab during a match. Amaiya believes these rules are old-fashioned and wants them to change so she can keep practicing the sport she loves while also following her religious beliefs. Amaiya and her family are waiting for a decision on whether she'll be allowed to wear her hijab while boxing.

Minogue's fourth album, Let's Get to It was released in October 1991 and reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. It was her first album to fail to reach the top ten. While the first single from the album, \\"Word Is Out\\", became her first single to miss the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, subsequent singles \\"If You Were with Me Now\\" and \\"Give Me Just a Little More Time\\" both reached the top five. In support of the album, she embarked on the Let's Get to It Tour in October. She later expressed her opinion that she was stifled by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, saying, \\"I was very much a puppet in the beginning. I was blinkered by my record company. I was unable to look left or right.\\" Her first Greatest Hits album was released in August 1992. It reached number one in the United Kingdom and number three in Australia. The singles from the album, \\"What Kind of Fool\\" and her cover version of Kool & the Gang's \\"Celebration\\" both reached the top twenty of the UK Singles Chart.

They said they would give 384 million unicorn coins to the schools. This made many people, like teachers and students, very happy because they could use the money to buy better books, build bigger classrooms, and help children learn more. But one day, the Treasury suddenly said, \\"Oh no, we made a mistake! We can't give you all those unicorn coins we promised.\\" This made the head teachers, who are kind of like the kings and queens of a school, very upset and worried. They knew that without this money, it would be hard for their schools to do all the things they wanted to, like buy new books or fix broken chairs. The head teachers thought this wasn't fair. They felt like the Treasury was taking away a wonderful gift they thought they were getting. So, they decided to protest, which is like when you tell someone \\"I don't like what you are doing, and I want you to change it.\\" The head teachers hoped that by protesting, they could show the Treasury how much they needed those 384 million unicorn coins. Now, lots of people are talking about this big problem with the money, and they are hoping that the Treasury will listen to the head teachers and find a way to give the schools the money they need. So, we are all waiting to see what will happen next. And that's the story of how the Treasury took back the money they promised to schools in England - a time when head teachers were protesting about a cash crisis."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to French: [1] Text adopted by the Standing Committee, acting on behalf of the Assembly, on 28 June 1991.See Doc.","output":"To translate the given sentence to French, I'll proceed with the following steps: 1.

Do those questions have the same meaning? pick from the following. I. no II. yes","output":"To answer these questions, I will need to perform research on the decomposition process of a dead body and the timeline for when it starts to smell, as well as gather information on what a decomposing body smells like. Step 1: Research the decomposition process and timeline for when a dead body starts to smell. Upon researching, I found that the decomposition process varies depending on various factors like environmental conditions, temperature, and humidity. However, generally speaking, a dead body may start to smell within 24 to 72 hours after death due to the buildup of gases during the early stages of decomposition. Step 2: Research on the description of the odor of a decomposing body. I found that the odor of a decomposing body has been described as a combination of various strong, foul-smelling scents such as feces, rotting meat, and a sweet odor from the gases produced. It is a distinctive smell that is hard to forget. Step 3: Determine if the two questions have the same meaning. Now, I will assess whether both questions have the same meaning. Question 1: \\"How long does it take for a dead body to start smelling?\\" This question is about the time it takes for a dead body to begin emitting a noticeable smell. Question 2: \\"What does a dead body smell like after it's started to decompose?\\" This question is about the description of the smell that the decomposing body emits once it starts to decompose. Upon comparison, I can conclude that the questions do not have the same meaning, as one is focused on the time taken for odor to emerge while the other is about the odor's description.

Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite... Guess a valid title for it!

On 7 October 1949 the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which became commonly referred to as East Germany, was established in the Soviet Occupation Zone. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The OderNeisse line is the international border between Germany and Poland. It was drawn at the Potsdam Conference in the aftermath of the Second World War and is primarily delineated along the Oder and Lusatian Neisse rivers in Central Europe, meeting the Baltic Sea to the north, just west of the Polish seaports of Szczecin and winoujcie (German: \\"Stettin\\" and \\"Swinemünde\\"). All prewar German territory east of the line and within the 1937 German boundaries (23.8% of the former Weimar Republic) were placed under International Law Administrative status, with most of it being made part of newly-Communist Poland. The small remainder, consisting of the territory surrounding the German city of Königsberg (now renamed Kaliningrad, in honour of Soviet head of state Mikhail Kalinin) in northern East Prussia, was allocated to the Soviet Union (as Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian SFSR, today the Russian Federation) after the war (pending the final World War II peace treaty for Germany). The vast majority of the native German population in these territories fled, or was killed or expelled by force. The OderNeisse line marked the border between the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and Poland from 1950 to 1990. East Germany confirmed the border with Poland in 1950, while West Germany, after a period of refusal, finally accepted the border (with reservations) in 1970. In 1990 the newly reunified Germany and the Republic of Poland signed a treaty recognizing it as their border. - West Berlin was a city that existed in the period between the end of the Berlin Blockade on 12 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990 as a political enclave surrounded by East Berlin and East Germany. It was east of the Inner German border and only accessible by land from West Germany by narrow rail and highway corridors. It consisted of the American, British, and French occupation sectors established in 1945 and shared economic, political, legal, and sporting systems with West Germany, but was not \\"de jure\\" part of it. It had a special and unique legal status because its administration was formally conducted by the Western Allies. East Berlin, \\"de jure\\" occupied and administered by the Soviet Union, was the \\"de facto\\" capital of East Germany. The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, physically divided East and West Berlin until it fell in 1989. - North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK ), is a country in East Asia, in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula.

The country is bordered to the south by South Korea, with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two. - The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR \\" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. A union of multiple subnational republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital. - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. - The SKS is a Soviet semi-automatic carbine chambered for the 7.62 × 39mm round , designed in 1943 by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov . Its complete designation , SKS - 45 , is an initialism for Samozaryadnyj Karabin sistemy Simonova , 1945 ( Russian : , 1945 ; Self - loading Carbine of ( the ) Simonov system , 1945 ) . In the early 1950s , the Soviets took the SKS carbine out of front - line service and replaced it with the AK - 47 ; however , the SKS remained in second - line service for decades . It is still used as a ceremonial firearm today . The SKS was widely exported , and was also produced by some former Eastern Bloc nations as well as China , where it was designated the \`\` Type 56 Carbine '' , East Germany as the Karabiner S and in North Korea as the \`\` Type 63 '' . The SKS is currently popular on the civilian surplus market as a hunting and marksmanship semi-automatic rifle in many countries , including the United States , Canada , and New Zealand . Its age and numbers make it very inexpensive to purchase . The SKS was the second firearm after the RPD chambered for the 7.62 × 39mm M43 round , which was later used for the AK - 47 . - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies.

He is most famous for developing the AK-47 assault rifle and its improvements, the AKM and AK-74, as well as the PK machine gun. - The AK-47, or AK as it is officially known (also known as the Kalashnikov) is a selective-fire (semi-automatic and automatic), gas-operated 7.62×39 mm assault rifle, developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is officially known in the Soviet documentation as \\"Avtomat Kalashnikova\\". - East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR, was an Eastern Bloc state during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - The Warsaw Pact, formally the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance and sometimes, informally, WarPac. was a collective defense treaty among the Soviet Union and seven other Soviet satellite states in Central and Eastern Europe in existence during the Cold War. The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CoMEcon), the regional economic organization for the communist states of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO in 1955 per the London and Paris Conferences of 1954, but it is also considered to have been motivated by Soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in Central and Eastern Europe. - The Eastern Bloc was the group of communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, generally the Soviet Union and the countries of the Warsaw Pact. The terms Communist Bloc and Soviet Bloc were also used to denote groupings of states aligned with the Soviet Union, although these terms might include states outside Central and Eastern Europe. - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. - Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov (Russian: ; 9 April 1894 6 May 1986) was a Russian weapons designer; he is one of the fathers of the modern assault rifle. - Central and Eastern Europe, abbreviated CEE, is a generic term for the group of countries in Central Europe, Southeast Europe, Northern Europe, and Eastern Europe, usually meaning former communist states in Europe. It is in use after the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 198990. In scholarly literature the abbreviations CEE or CEEC are often used for this concept. - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015. - The Communist Party of China (CPC) is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The CPC is the sole governing party of China, although it coexists alongside eight other legal parties that comprise the United Front; these parties, however, hold no real power or independence from the CPC. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 the CPC had driven the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, thus leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The CPC is currently the world's second largest political party with a membership of 88.76 million as of 2016 (while the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party appears to have remained the largest with a membership of 110 million as of the previous year, 2015). It also controls the world's largest armed force, the People's Liberation Army. - The Potsdam Agreement was the agreement between three of the Allies of World War II, United Kingdom, United States, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, for the military occupation and reconstruction of Germanyreferring to the German Reich with its pre-war 1937 borders including the former eastern territoriesand the entire European theatre of War territory. It also included Germany's demilitarisation, reparations and the prosecution of war criminals. - The Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a highly militarized strip of land running across the Korean Peninsula. It was established at the end of the Korean War to serve as a buffer zone between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). The DMZ is a \\"de facto\\" border barrier that divides the Korean Peninsula roughly in half. It was created by agreement between North Korea, China and the United Nations in 1953. The DMZ is long, and about wide. What is the relationship between 'sks' and '1970'? Answer:","output":"There is no direct relationship between the SKS rifle and the year 1970. The SKS is a Soviet semi-automatic carbine designed in 1943 by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov. It was used during the Cold War era and was later replaced by the AK-47. The year 1970 is not specifically relevant to the history or development of the SKS rifle."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: It was several years since Adolf Hitler came into power in Germany.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Meditation, an ancient practice rooted in eastern spiritual traditions, has been gaining popularity in the modern world due to its various benefits on mental and physical health. One of the key factors that people look for when engaging in meditation is its ability to help with cognitive function and concentration. Our daily lives are filled with distractions and stressors that can cloud our minds, affecting our ability to focus and make well-informed decisions. Various studies have investigated the impact of meditation on the brain, particularly regarding attention, memory, and overall cognitive function. These studies, utilizing practices such as mindfulness meditation and transcendental meditation, have demonstrated significant improvements in attention span, working memory, and cognitive flexibility in both short-term and long-term practitioners. It is suggested that these improvements may be due to changes in brain structure and function, such as increased cortical thickness and enhanced connectivity between different brain regions. Furthermore, regular meditation practice promotes relaxation and stress reduction, which in turn can help improve concentration and overall cognitive function. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that yes, engaging in regular meditation can indeed contribute to improved cognitive function and concentration."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given five sentences, numbered 1 through 5.

Paul Nicholls was the top trainer for the 10th time in 11 seasons and, considering he had just two successes in valuable Grade One races, did tremendously well to hold on to the title ahead of Willie Mullins. The Grand National, meanwhile, was won by Rule The World, ridden by 19-year-old David Mullins for trainer Mouse Morris. As the first post-McCoy jump racing season draws to a close, here are my thoughts on the significant moments and achievements. A public vote gave the jumps horse of the year accolade to Thistlecrack on Saturday. Yet the Colin Tizzard-trained eight-year-old - named after a field on the West Country farm of owners John and Heather Snook - did not win by the proverbial field, as a string of equine stars shone in what was a vintage campaign. The undisputed champion of long distance hurdling, Thistlecrack beat off competition from a sparkling quartet of Annie Power, Tizzard's Cue Card, Don Cossack and Sprinter Sacre. Anyone of the 'finalists' would have been the worthiest of winners, especially the remarkable Sprinter Sacre, who overcame a heart condition and severe loss of form to regain his Queen Mother Champion Chase title at the Cheltenham Festival. I hope they're all back for next season's marquee events. Cue Card, already successful in the Betfair and King George VI Chases, was very much on course for the Jockey Club's new £1m 'Steeplechasing Triple Crown' when falling at the third-to-last fence in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. We will never know what might have happened had the hugely-popular 10-year-old stayed on his feet, but his legion of fans were quick to note that, when making a triumphant return to the winners' circle at Aintree barely three weeks later, Cue Card had the Gold Cup's second and third-placed horses trailing in his wake. However, Cue Card's unscheduled departure was not the season's only expensive one: had the Willie Mullins-trained Vautour won rather than crashing out - when cruising - of Aintree's Melling Chase, Mullins would have won £112,260 in prize money and beaten Paul Nicholls to be champion trainer. Ouch. Media playback is not supported on this device Lizzie Kelly carved out a significant piece of horseracing history when becoming the first woman to ride the winner of a top-of-the-tree, Grade One jumps race in Britain when guiding Tea For Two to victory at Kempton on Boxing Day. Only a few weeks later, Kelly - again riding for her trainer-step-father Nick Williams - landed Europe's richest handicap hurdle, staged at Newbury in February, on Agrapart. There were further success in National Hunt races for the Ireland-based pair Nina Carberry and Katie Walsh and plenty of others. It means surely that the sport's perennial question - will a female jockey ever win the Grand National? - will be answered sooner rather than later, in the affirmative. The idea has been mooted over recent weeks as Richard Johnson - 'Dickie' throughout jump racing - as it became clear that he was going to land his first title with a display of the same kind of ruthless dominance for which AP McCoy became famous. The new champion, easily the second most successful jump jockey of all time, sailed by the 3,000-winner mark in January, but still needs 1,300 more to catch his old friend and rival, and by my maths, even at his current prolific rate, that would take five-and-half years. At 38, he's among the most senior members of the jockeys' changing-room. So it is possible, but unlikely. Johnson has said it would have been lovely to have beaten McCoy, but he is now just concentrating on defending his crown; the bookies make him long odds-on to beat Aidan Coleman, Sam Twiston-Davies and Co once again. The first two names are easy. Trainer Dan Skelton and his jockey-brother Harry, sons of Olympic gold medal-winning showjumper Nick, both reached a century of winners for the first time. Dan is an former assistant to Paul Nicholls, The 10-time champion trainer is likely to have his work cut out to hold off future challenges to his title from Willie Mullins, but the skills he passed on to his protégé will ensure that the Skeltons are not too far behind. Scotland-born Craig Nichol was the champion conditional jockey [jumps apprentice] and has made a big impression on the northern circuit, but the pendulum among the young riders is likely to swing south now, with David Noonan and Harry Cobden tipped as up-and-coming talents.

That was an astonishing achievement for somebody, however accomplished a sportsperson in another field, to pull off from scratch in a little over 12 months, and amid so much media scrutiny. Pendleton's participation and evident passion about racing has provided a major boost for the sport - especially the point-to-pointing circuit, where she did much of her training - and the fact that she plans to keep on going can only be a plus. With more practice, an even better big-race finishing position may soon be beckoning.","output":"This story is about people racing horses! Johnson became the best jockey this weekend after coming in second place 16 times before. He always lost to McCoy, who won the title 20 times in a row! That's a lot, isn't it? But this time, Johnson was really good and won at last. Paul Nicholls was noted as the top person who trains the horses for racing. He has been the best at this 10 times in 11 seasons! That's like being the best soccer coach almost every year! This other big race, the Grand National, was won by a horse named Rule The World. It's jockey was a young boy, only 19, named David Mullins. Also, there was a public vote, like when we choose our favourite ice cream flavour, and a horse named Thistlecrack was voted the best horse this year. But, it was not an easy decision. There were many very good horses. One of the great ones, Sprinter Sacre, even overcome being sick to become a champion again! Can you imagine being the best at something even when you're not feeling well? That's just amazing! A horse named Cue Card could have been the best if he hadn't fallen during one race. If another horse named Vautour hadn't fallen out in a race, his trainer called Willie Mullins would have got lots of money and had a chance to be the best trainer instead of Paul Nicholls! Lizzie Kelly, who's like the Wonder Woman in racing, made a big win. She was the first woman to win a super important race in Britain. She did it on a horse named Tea for Two! This suggests that very soon a woman jockey might win the Grand National. Last interesting thing we have Richard Johnson. Even if he just won the title, he needs 1300 more wins to catch up with his friend McCoy's record. It's like trying to eat 1300 more cookies than your friend has! He's going to need a lot of time and that's a big challenge! But who knows? He might do it! These are the highlights like the brightest stars in the sky. There were other people who did really well like brothers Dan Skelton and Harry, Craig Nichol and the cycling champion who did really well in a horse race. All these people are pretty awesome in what they do, right? So, remember, next time you see a horse race it's not just about the horses running fast, it's also about the wonderful jockeys who ride them and the people who train those lovely horses!"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What are the worst examples of false advertising you've seen? Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

These companies acquired the exclusive rights to broadcast the matches and related content in their respective countries or regions. Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) is the governing body responsible for organizing the World Cup, and they are the ones who sold the broadcasting rights. The revenue generated from these rights is one of the primary sources of income for FIFA. Typically, the rights are sold on a regional basis to ensure coverage of the tournament in various languages and time zones. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the key broadcasters who acquired the rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup: 1. United States: In the U.S., the English-language broadcast rights were held by FOX Sports, while the Spanish-language rights were held by Telemundo. 2. United Kingdom: The rights were shared between the BBC and ITV, with both networks broadcasting live matches and coverage. 3. Canada: The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and Bell Media-owned TSN and CTV jointly acquired the rights to broadcast the tournament in Canada. 4. Australia: The broadcast rights for the 2018 World Cup were held by SBS, which offered live and delayed coverage on its television and radio networks. 5. Germany: The rights were shared between public broadcasters ARD and ZDF, both providing live coverage and highlights. 6. France: The tournament was broadcast on the TF1 and beIN Sports channels, with TF1 primarily focusing on the French national team matches and beIN Sports covering all matches. 7. Spain: The matches were broadcast on Mediaset España channels, including Telecinco and Cuatro, as well as their respective sports-themed subsidiary channels. 8. Brazil: Globo held the television broadcasting rights, while Grupo Bandeirantes provided radio coverage. 9. India and the Indian subcontinent: Sony Pictures Networks held the rights to broadcast the World Cup in the region. 10. Middle East and North Africa: beIN Sports held the exclusive rights for Arabic-language coverage across the region. 11. Sub-Saharan Africa: Kwesé Sports, SuperSport, and StarTimes were the main broadcasters covering the World Cup matches in Sub-Saharan Africa. It's worth noting that these broadcaster agreements were limited to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The rights for future editions of the tournament – such as 2022 and 2026 – are negotiated and sold separately."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Baptism of Jesus. Yes or no? Answer: In Roman Catholicism, the baptism of Jesus is one of the Luminous Mysteries sometimes added to the Rosary . Question: when was jesus baptized Answer:","output":"Jesus was baptized in the early 1st century AD, though the exact date of His baptism remains a subject of theological debate and historical investigation. According to historical context and the New Testament accounts, Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. The baptism marked the beginning of Jesus' public ministry and is recorded in all four Gospels – Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. However, discrepancies regarding the exact timing of the event exist between different Gospel narratives. It is widely believed that Jesus was baptized when he was around 30 years old, based on clues found in the Gospel of Luke (Luke 3:23). To get closer to a more precise date, we can examine some evidence provided in the Gospels: 1. The Gospel of John mentions that Jesus' baptism occurred before John the Baptist's imprisonment (John 3:22-24). 2. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, collectively known as the Synoptic Gospels, indicate Jesus was baptized before he began his public ministry, which lasted around three years before his crucifixion. 3. The Gospel of Luke records that Jesus was born during the reign of King Herod the Great, who died around 4 BC. 4. Jesus' ministry began during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, who became Roman Emperor in the year 14 AD (Luke 3:1). If Jesus were 30 years old at the start of his ministry, as mentioned in Luke, this would place his baptism approximately around the year 28 AD. 5. Some scholars suggest the baptism may have occurred a few years earlier, around 25 or 26 AD, following the commencement of John the Baptist's ministry in the \\"fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar\\" (Luke 3:1-2). It is essential to note that these dates are open to interpretation, and various factors such as possible discrepancies in the ancient sources, religious traditions, and cultural contexts should also be considered when discussing the date of Jesus' baptism. In conclusion, though it is challenging to pinpoint the exact year of Jesus' baptism, historical evidence and Gospel accounts suggest it occurred in the early 1st century AD, likely between 25 and 28 AD, when Jesus was around 30 years old. However, these dates should be regarded as approximations rather than definitive conclusions."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.watabou.pixeldungeon.

Trick-or-treating is a Halloween tradition where children dress up in costumes and go from house to house collecting candy or other treats. 3. Now, let's examine the timeline given in the statement: Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve is the night before Christmas, and it is typically associated with the celebration of the Christmas holiday, not Halloween. 4. Based on the information gathered, we see that there is a discrepancy between the activity of trick-or-treating and the time mentioned, which is Christmas Eve. Trick-or-treating is a Halloween activity, not a Christmas activity. 5. Therefore, the statement \\"Many children love trick-or-treating on Christmas Eve\\" is not true.

Question: what is the language of mali Answer:","output":"Mali is a diverse and multilingual country located in West Africa, with around 20 different languages spoken across its territories. However, there are two primary languages: French and Bambara. French is the official language of Mali, as it was a French colony until it gained independence in 1960. It is used in government, education, and formal situations. Although a significant percentage of the population doesn't speak or understand French fluently, it serves as a bridge between different ethnic communities and is the most widely recognized language. People who are educated in Mali typically learn French, as it is the medium of instruction in schools and universities. Moreover, French is used for national and international communication, official documents, and as a lingua franca among people from distinct linguistic backgrounds. Bambara, on the other hand, is an indigenous language that belongs to the Mande language family. It is the most widely spoken language in Mali, with approximately 80% of the population speaking or understanding it to some extent. Most Bambara speakers live in the southern and central parts of the country, but the language is understood across the nation and serves as a significant means of communication among various ethnic groups. It is written using both the Latin script and N'Ko script. Bambara has a strong presence in everyday life, particularly in oral traditions, music, and local markets. It is also used in informal settings and communities throughout the country. Other languages spoken in Mali include Fulani (also known as Peul or Fula), Dogon, Soninke, Songhai, Tamashek (spoken by the Tuareg people), and numerous other minority languages. These languages reflect the diverse range of ethnic groups and cultures present within the country, each with their own traditions, beliefs, and cultural expressions. Mali's multilingual nature is a testament to its rich history and cultural diversity. While French remains the official language and is used for formal communication and education, Bambara is the most widely spoken language, enabling connection among different communities. The nation's complex linguistic landscape is a testament to the country's vibrant and diverse cultural fabric, as each language offers a unique insight into the perspectives and experiences of its speakers."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - The Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival is North America's largest documentary film festival, conference and market, held annually in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Solve -10*p - 6 = -7*p for p.","output":"Let's solve the given equation step by step: -10 * p - 6 = -7 * p The objective is to find the value of p that satisfies the given equation. To do this, we need to isolate the variable p by getting all terms containing p on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. Step 1: Add 7 * p to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -7 * p term on the right side: -10 * p + 7 * p - 6 = -7 * p + 7 * p Simplifying the equation, we get: -3 * p - 6 = 0 Step 2: Now, we want to get rid of the constant term -6. To do this, we will add 6 to both sides of the equation: -3 * p - 6 + 6 = 0 + 6 Simplifying the equation, we get: -3 * p = 6 Step 3: Finally, we want to isolate the variable p, which currently has a coefficient of -3. To eliminate the coefficient, divide both sides of the equation by -3: (-3 * p) / -3 = 6 / -3 Simplifying the equation, we get: p = -2 So, the solution for the given equation is p = -2. When -2 is substituted for p into the original equation, both sides of the equation will be equal: -10 * (-2) - 6 = -7 * (-2) 20 - 6 = 14 14 = 14 The equation holds true, confirming that the solution p = -2 is correct."},{"instruction":"Riley brought Quinn forward to introduce him to his friends.

Here's a detailed explanation of how to do this and why it's the better option: Condiments are meant to enhance the taste, texture, or presentation of a dish. They are typically rich and concentrated in flavor, meaning that even a small amount left in the jar can still be valuable. Diluting the condiment with water, as suggested in Option 1, can lead to an undesirable change in flavor or consistency, which defeats the purpose of using the condiment in the first place. Option 1 may also result in a final product that is too watery and unsatisfying. So, to maximize the use of condiments left in the jar, it's best to employ Option 2, using a rubber spatula. Here are the steps to do this: 1. Prepare your work area: Clear some space on your countertop or table, and have a plate, bowl or another container ready to collect the residual condiment. Wash and dry your rubber spatula so that it's clean and ready for use. 2. Open the jar: Remove the lid from the jar, ensuring it's not obstructed or distorted, which can make it difficult to scrape around the edges efficiently. 3. Soften the condiment if needed: If the condiment is too hard or too thick, you may need to soften it a bit to facilitate scraping. You could either allow the jar to sit at room temperature for a while to soften or gently warm the jar in a hot water bath, taking care to avoid overheating or warping the container. Proceed to the next step when the condiment is pliable enough for easy scraping. 4. Scrape from the edges: Start by placing the tip of the rubber spatula along the inner walls of the jar. Firmly press the spatula against the sides of the jar, and with consistent pressure, drag and collect the condiment towards the center of the jar in one motion. Repeat this process around the entire circumference of the jar to ensure that all of the sides are scraped clean. 5. Collect the residual condiment: As you accumulate the residual condiment in the center of the jar, you might want to periodically transfer it to the plate, bowl, or container you prepared earlier. This will help establish a clean surface to continue scraping. 6. Scrape the bottom: Once the sides are clean, focus on scraping the bottom of the jar. With a similar motion, press the spatula flat against the bottom and drag it towards the center, then transfer the residue to your collecting dish. 7. Scrape the corners: Ensure you’ve reached all the corners and tight spaces in the jar, by maneuvering the spatula with an angular approach. When you’ve successfully extracted all visible condiment, you will have a nearly spotless jar, ensuring minimal waste. By using a rubber spatula to meticulously scrape the jar clean, you can get the most out of your condiments without compromising their flavor and texture. This method makes for a frugal and practical approach to maximize the use of every last bit."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

Then, we will multiply both values to get the total number of ways to form a group of 5 men and 2 women. To choose 5 men from 7 men, we can use the combinations formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) C(7, 5) = 7! / (5! * (7-5)!) C(7, 5) = 7! / (5! * 2!) Now, we can calculate 7!, 5!, and 2!: 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 2! = 2 * 1 = 2 Now, we will substitute the obtained values back into the formula: C(7, 5) = 5040 / (120 * 2) = 5040 / 240 = 21 So, there are 21 ways to choose 5 men from a total of 7 men. Next, we need to find out the number of ways to choose 2 women from a total of 3 women: C(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * (3-2)!) C(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * 1!)

When 4-year-old Zoe Pedicone was officially adopted Friday by her foster mother in Wilmington, Delaware, she was surrounded by her favorite characters from the iconic franchise. As her name was officially changed, the family court judge touched a lightsaber to her forehead, Zoe’s new mom, Deanna Pedicone, tells PEOPLE. Get push notifications with news, features and more. “I wanted this day to be everything she ever wanted,” Pedicone told WPVI. “It’s only once in a lifetime that she’ll be adopted, and it’s the only time I’ll be adopting her, so I wanted it to be really special.” Star Wars favorites like Chewbacca, stormtroopers, R2-D2, Rey and Darth Vader were present — all played by volunteers, Pedicone says. The judge even got in on the fun, dressing as Princess Leia. After the formal proceedings, officials dimmed the lights in the Wilmington courtroom and played the Star Wars theme song, according to Wilmington News Journal. Zoe was placed in Pedicone’s care in 2013, and Pedicone told the News Journal that she knew she wanted to make the little girl’s official adoption extra special. “This is her day,” Pedicone told the paper. “She is old enough to remember it, and I want it to be as fun as possible.” Pedicone tells PEOPLE she got Zoe just two weeks after being licensed as a foster parent. “I describe it as the weirdest blind date ever,” she says. “They drop the kid off, they leave 20 minutes later and you sit there and wonder, ‘When is your mom going to come and get you?’ “ “One of the challenges is their story already started, so you have to figure out what the plot is,” Pedicone says. “It’s like the story is already moving and you come in at chapter 10 and you don’t really know what happened before,” she says, “so you start building that relationship and help them move in a direction that is more typical of a family: eating together at a table, sleeping in our own beds, taking a bath and not being frightened by that. … It’s a very thoughtful way to have to parent.” Pedicone says she became specially bonded to Zoe after the little girl went through a medical crisis. Her adoption application was approved in October. “That’s when I cried,” Pedicone says. “I didn’t real how much I worried about her future until someone said your application has been approved.” “The day they approved the application was the day I knew I wouldn’t have to worry about [Zoe] going anywhere,” she says. WATCH: This Man Sees New York for the First Time Through a Bionic Eye Zoe’s love for Star Wars is no secret, Pedicone tells PEOPLE. Her bedroom has a Star Wars wall sticker, an R2-D2 humidifier, a Storm Trooper teddy bear — and, of course, a Jedi lightsaber. “Some friends had sent me this really sweet video of a girl who had gotten adopted with princesses coming to her adoption and said, ‘You should do this,’ ” Pedicone says. “So I asked [Zoe]: If you could have anybody at your adoption hearing, who would you have? She said family and friends. I told her which family and friends were coming and then I said, ‘How about anybody else?’ She said, ‘Darth Vader.’ ” • Need a little inspiration?

He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon. Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander. This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months. Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy. No ancient sources stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual. Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to Troy where \\"Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of Patroclus, the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles\\". Noting that the word eromenos (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial. Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life. However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age. Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions. Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly; showing great self-control in \\"pleasures of the body\\". Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her. Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including Ada of Caria, who adopted him, and even Darius's mother Sisygambis, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Spirtual\\" correctly answer the question \\"What type of sexuality was Alexander speculated to have?\\"?","output":"No, \\"spiritual\\" is not the correct answer to describe Alexander's speculated sexuality.

Therefore the war was intensively linked with the Dutch-Hanseatic War , the Kalmar War with Holstein and the Swedish revolt . After years of changing fortune in warfare Rostock and Stralsund signed a separate peace agreement in 1430. Lübeck, Hamburg, Wismar and Lüneburg, however, continued the war and assisted Holstein to conquer Flensburg in 1431. Thereafter they agreed an armistice in 1432 and started peace negotiations. Meanwhile an anti-Danish revolt broke out in Sweden . In 1434 Eric had to agree an armistice with the Swedes, too. In April 1435 he signed the peace of Vordingborg with the Hanseatic League and Holstein, followed by the peace of Stockholm with Sweden a few months later the same year. The Hanseatic cities were excepted from the Sound Dues but they had to accept Dutch competition in the Baltic trade. The Danish Duchy of Schleswig was ceded to the count of Holstein. Sweden's autonomous rights and privileges were extended. These peace agreements weakened Eric's position dramatically, and in 1439 he got dethroned by Danish, Swedish and Norwegian Privy Councils. What event happened later, the peace of Vordingborg, or the Dano-Hanseatic War?","output":"The peace of Vordingborg happened later than the Dano-Hanseatic War. The war happened from 1426-1435, and the peace of Vordingborg was signed in April 1435, which ended the war. So, first there was a big fight between countries (the Dano-Hanseatic War), and then they made up and agreed to stop fighting (the peace of Vordingborg)."},{"instruction":"Given the question: - Sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse - The plants and floor absorb the the sunlight - The absorbed sunlight is converted to heat - The heat cannot escape the glass - The heat is trapped in the greenhouse - The hot air rises - The colder air at the top is pushed to the bottom What might be the last step of the process?

Automotive spoilers, also known as wings, are specifically designed to generate downforce as air passes around them. This downforce helps improve a vehicle's stability and grip on the road at higher speeds, enhancing its performance and handling.

Article: Scores on a national test released on November 1 show that students in the U.S.A. have improved in math over the last two years, but mostly stayed the same in reading. This year, 422,000 fourth graders and 343,000 eighth graders took the exams between January and March. Students were asked to read grade-appropriate materials and answer questions for the reading test. For the math test, students answered questions about geometry, algebra, number properties, measurement and other topics. The U.S Department of Education released the scores in a report called The Nation's Report Card (NAEP). This year, students earned the highest scores ever recorded on the math exam, which has been given since 1990.Fourth graders scored an average of 241.That is a one-point increase from 2009and a 28-point increase from 1990. Eighth graders made similar progress. Then average score this year was 284,up one point from 2009 and 21 points from 1990. In reading, fourth graders scored an average of 221 points, the same average score since 2007.That score is four points above those from 1992, when the first reading test was given. Eighth graders scored an average of 265 points, up one point from 2009 and five points from 1992. Education experts say reading is a harder subject to improve in the classroom than math. While math is largely learned in classrooms, reading results depend on how much kids read outside of school and how much they read in other subjects, such as history and science. On the NAEP, math scores were the highest among students who have limited use of calculators during math lessons, compared with students who have unlimited use or no use. Reading scores were the highest among students who said they read for fun on their own time almost every day.

I’m sitting in a conference room at a big wooden table, surrounded by my new coworkers and team members in the Getty’s web group. A big monitor is displaying the prototype of the newly designed and almost-built Getty Iris. We’re discussing The Iris logo you see at the top of this page, its multiple iterations, and, quite frankly, the pain involved in trying to get it to look right. Wait-wait-wait, let’s pause for a moment. My name is Will Lanni. I’m a Web production specialist at the Getty, which is a complex way of saying I’m a developer and designer, which is a nice way of saying that I’m basically a “web monkey.” Before I started at the Getty, I worked as a partner in a small web design and development firm for several years. I had some experience working for the Getty—I built the Pacific Standard Time at the Getty site, the Pacific Standard Time Festival site, as well as the interactive Getty Impact map.

Here's a step-by-step process for this task: 1. Assess the bookshelf space: Analyze the dimensions and layout of the bookshelf in order to organize books in the most efficient way. Consider the height, width, and depth of the shelves. This step is vital because knowledge of the physical space is crucial for determining how many books can fit on each shelf. 2. Identify the books: Gather all the books to be organized on the bookshelf. Understanding the physical properties of each book – including size, weight, and dimensions – will help determine the best placement within the bookshelf. 3. Determine organization criteria: Decide on a system for organizing the books, such as by author, genre, or size. Knowing the physical objects (books) and their properties (particularly content and appearance) allows for informed decision-making in this step. 4. Sort the books according to chosen criteria: Physically arrange the books into groups based on the chosen organizational system. 5. Place the books on the bookshelf: Begin placing books on the bookshelf while keeping in mind the physical properties of both the books and the bookshelf to ensure a proper fit. For example, consider the height and depth of each shelf to prevent books from sticking out or being too tall, as well as the overall capacity and strength of the bookshelf to support the weight of the books. 6. Adjust the organization as needed: If certain books don't fit well within the chosen organization system or on a specific shelf, reassess the chosen criteria or reorganize the other books accordingly, keeping the physical properties of the books in mind to ensure optimal organization. 7. Review and finalize the arrangement: Once all books are placed on the bookshelf, examine the overall organization and make any adjustments necessary. The goal is to achieve an aesthetically-pleasing and efficient arrangement of books while prioritizing their physical properties and the bookshelf's constraints. Knowledge of physical objects (the bookshelf and books) is essential for completing this task, as understanding their properties and limitations allows for better planning, organization, and execution of the task."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given an impractical statement.

With its cleverly crafted plot and spine-chilling suspense, the film is bound to leave a lasting impression on horror movie enthusiasts. A fine balance between psychological thrills and gore, Fright plays on our deepest fears and plunges us into a shadowy world that lurks just below the surface of our everyday lives. The movie explores the concept of fear and terror through engaging characters and an immersive atmosphere that sets it apart from conventional horror flicks. The protagonist, portrayed brilliantly by Actor X, grapples with the overriding fear that haunts the narrative and keeps us on the edge of our seats. His nuanced performance reveals layers of vulnerability and strength, adding depth to the character and making him relatable. His connection with the supporting characters, each carefully developed by screenwriter Jane Smith, adds to the overall emotional effect of the film. Director John Doe seems to have an uncanny ability to capture moments of genuine terror using a well-planned blend of special effects and impeccable timing. The jump scares in Fright are not gratuitous; instead, they are well-executed devices serving the purpose of genuine storytelling. The movie's atmospheric cinematography, complemented by an unnerving score, creates a truly immersive experience evoking a sense of unease and dread. The movie gains an additional layer of complexity through social commentary subtly woven into the plot, which addresses the nature of fear and how it can be manipulated and exploited. It adds a thought-provoking aspect to the film and invites viewers to look inwards and examine their own fears.

Firstly, the title mentions \\"Great value,\\" which indicates that the reviewer believes the product offers a good deal in terms of price and features. Additionally, the review itself highlights several key aspects of the product that the reviewer appreciates, including voice commands, auto rerouting, cheerful graphics, and the inclusion of necessary accessories like the mounting bracket and power supply. The reviewer does express a concern with the product's performance due to its use of the WinCE operating system, causing it to be sluggish during power-up and occasionally slow to respond to inputs.

Don't worry, it's very easy, and you can do it with the help of an adult friend. Let's look at the steps to make this delicious treat! 1. Get your oven and pan ready: First things first! We need to heat our oven to the right temperature so that our cake can cook properly. Ask an adult to help you preheat the oven. In the meantime, also get a cake pan ready by greasing it with some butter. 2. Mix the eggs: Now it's time to start making the cake batter. To do this, we need to beat some eggs until they become smooth and yellow. Ask your adult helper to break the eggs and put them in a big bowl, then use a whisk or fork to mix them well. 3. Add sugar to the eggs: Pour some sugar into the bowl with the beaten eggs. Keep mixing everything until the sugar dissolves, and the mixture becomes lighter in color and a little bubbly. It should look like a soft, pale yellow foam. 4. Time for some oil and a touch of vanilla: Now, we want to make our cake more flavorful, so let's add some oil and a little bit of vanilla extract. Pour these two ingredients into the bowl and mix everything together one more time. 5. Gather the dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, we need to mix together some flour, salt, baking powder, and spices. These will help our cake turn fluffy and taste super yummy! Stir them well with a spoon until everything is nicely combined. 6. Combine wet and dry ingredients: Now it's time to bring our wet and dry ingredients together to make our cake batter. Carefully pour the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, and then gently stir everything until it is smooth and well-mixed. 7. Add the magical ingredient – carrots!: Last but not least, it's time to add our star ingredient – the carrots! We need to fold the grated carrots into the mixture. This means you should gently mix the carrots into the batter without stirring too hard, to keep our cake nice and fluffy. And that's it, little chefs! Now you have your carrot cake batter ready. With the help of your adult assistant, pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake it in the preheated oven. Once it's done, let it cool down and enjoy your delicious homemade carrot cake! Remember, baking is super fun, but always have an adult with you to help with the hot oven and sharp objects.

There are a variety of opinions and standards as to when dogs should be retired from breeding. However, you should follow standards you are most comfortable with to protect the health of your dog. Many kennel clubs require a dog to be 8 years or younger to register litters. Many vets suggest that dogs of normal health should be retired from breeding around 8 years old. The strictest standard to retire a dog from breeding is 5 years of age. Consult your vet when considering breeding a dog older than 5 years old. The age of your dog needs to be evaluated with other factors including size and breed. Certain breeds of dogs should be retired from breeding earlier than others. This is because some breeds have physiological issues and other related problems that could cause complications with pregnancy. Chihuahuas and other toy dogs should be retired from breeding around 5 years old. Large breed dogs like standard poodles should be retired from breeding around 5 or 6 years old. Medium sized dogs may be bred longer than small or large breed dogs, depending on specific medical conditions and the opinion of your veterinarian. Many responsible breeders, vets, and kennel clubs suggest that people stop breeding dogs after a certain number of pregnancies. Consider: Some kennel clubs will stop registering litters after a dog has whelped 4 or 6 litters. Many veterinarians advise to retire a dog from breeding after 4 litters. The higher number of pregnancies, the lower the genetic diversity within a certain breed. Many irresponsible breeders, known as puppy mills, produce large numbers of dogs regardless of the health and well-being of the dogs themselves.","output":"People have different opinions about when dogs should stop having babies, but it's important to keep the dog healthy and follow rules set by dog clubs and vets, and it can depend on the dog's size and breed."},{"instruction":"Write a title for this article: Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ’s turnaround efforts were derailed last quarter, as fewer shoppers visited its stores and the teen retailer tried to hold the line on discounts. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 4% in the fiscal first quarter ended April 30, marking a reversal from the preceding quarter, when the company reported its first gain in more than three years. Analysts had expected a 1.5% increase. Executive Chairman Arthur Martinez attributed the decline to “traffic headwinds, particularly in international markets and in our U.S. flagship and tourist stores.” Same-store sales are expected to remain challenged in the second quarter and improve in the second half of the year. The New Albany, Ohio, company said total revenue fell 3% to 685.5 million for the quarter. Its net loss was 39.6 million, or 59 cents a share, compared with 63.2 million, or 91 cents, a year ago. Analysts had expected a loss of 51 cents a share on 709 million of revenue, according to FactSet. As in previous quarters, the company’s Hollister brand performed better than the flagship brand. Hollister sales at stores open at least a year were flat, while that metric fell 8% at Abercrombie. Abercrombie has been hit hard by changing consumer preferences, declining mall traffic and fierce competition from fast-fashion players. After the company’s highly sexual image cultivated by former CEO Mike Jeffries started alienating shoppers, the retailer began updating its merchandise assortment and revamping stores. Mr. Martinez said the company has also pulled back on promotions and is now selling more merchandise at full price. Even as many retailers are anticipating a highly promotional environment in the coming months, Mr. Martinez said he doesn’t expect to change the pricing strategy at Abercrombie. Passing up short-term gains from promotions is a “price that needs to be paid” for the long-term health of the company, he said in an interview. Abercrombie joins a growing list of retailers reporting a weak start to the year. Poor results at department stores and specialty retailers have illustrated consumers’ shift away from brick-and-mortar stores. Amazon.com Inc., meanwhile, has made an aggressive push into fashion and apparel sales. “The traffic situation is a systemic problem for the industry,” said Mr. Martinez. “Our job is to make the most of the traffic we do get.” He said Abercrombie hasn’t ruled out the option of selling merchandise on Amazon. “As our brands come back to their status and health, we will be looking for additional channels to take our products,” he said. “I would never say never to anything, but we have an awful lot of work to do before we can think of anything like that.” Last week, Gap Inc. CEO Art Peck said in response to an investor’s question at the annual shareholder meeting that the company is open to selling merchandise on Amazon and other third parties. Abercrombie has been operating without a chief executive for more than a year. Since Mr. Jeffries departed in December 2014, the company has been run by an office of the chairman, which includes Mr. Martinez. The retailer recently promoted Hollister brand President Fran Horowitz to the role of company president and chief merchandising officer. Ms. Horowitz is seen as a top candidate for the CEO job. On Monday, the company named Target Corp. veteran Stacia Andersen and Victoria’s Secret veteran Kristin Scott to run the Abercrombie and Hollister brands, respectively. Ms. Andersen will replace Christos Angelides, who stepped down from his role in December. The company’s chief operating officer, Jonathan Ramsden, is also departing from his role effective June 15.

Tribal and nationalistic differences were discouraged. But after Muhammad's passing, the old tribal differences between the Arabs started to resurface. Following the Roman–Persian Wars and the Byzantine–Sassanid Wars, deep rooted differences between Iraq, formally under the Persian Sassanid Empire, and Syria, formally under the Byzantine Empire, also existed. Each wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic State to be in their area. Previously, the second caliph Umar was very firm on the governors and his spies kept an eye on them. If he felt that a governor or a commander was becoming attracted to wealth, he had him removed from his position. What is the answer to this question: Who controlled Iraq before the Arabs?","output":"Before the Arabs established control, Iraq was under the rule of the Persian Sassanid Empire. The Sassanid Empire, also known as the Sasanian Empire, was the last kingdom of the Persian Empire before the rise of Islam. Its influence and power were widespread, spanning from 224 to 651 AD. At its peak, it included not just present-day Iran and Iraq, but also territories in the Caucasoid (the Caucasus region), Central Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of the greater Middle East, including Pakistan. Much of Iraq's political, cultural, and religious history before the Islamic conquest was influenced by the Sassanids. However, after the fall of the Sassanid Empire, tensions and power struggles erupted, especially between Iraq and Syria over the establishment of the new capital for the Islamic state, as mentioned in the article. This was in part a re-emergence of the deep-rooted nationalistic and tribal divergences that were, to some extent, subdued under the teachings of Muhammad and the Quran on racial equality and justice.

Which farmer didn't have soil development operate in relative drought on his parcel? Two farmers had neighboring parcels of land. Bob had a nice parcel of old growth forest, while the other farmer, named Bill , had a similar sized parcel covered in grasslands. Hint: Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Bob, the farmer with the old growth forest parcel, did not have soil development operate in relative drought on his parcel.

Several sources indicate that during Muhammad's lifetime a large number of his companions had memorized the revelations. Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above-mentioned understanding of the Quran's early development. The Quran in its present form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad because the search for variants has not yielded any differences of great significance.[page needed] University of Chicago professor Fred Donner states that \\"...there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonantal text of the Qurʾān from what was probably a wider and more varied group of related texts in early transmission. [...] After the creation of this standardized canonical text, earlier authoritative texts were suppressed, and all extant manuscripts—despite their numerous variants—seem to date to a time after this standard consonantal text was established.\\" Although most variant readings of the text of the Quran have ceased to be transmitted, some still are. There has been no critical text produced on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text could be based.

This incident, which happened prior to American entry into the war, is also notable for causing damage to the Statue of Liberty. Hypothesis: The Black Tom explosion took place over 40 years ago","output":"To determine if the hypothesis \\"The Black Tom explosion took place over 40 years ago\\" is true, we must analyze the given facts and then calculate the years that have passed since the incident. According to the text, the Black Tom explosion occurred on July 30, 1916, in Jersey City, New Jersey. This act of sabotage by German agents aimed to destroy American-made munitions intended for supply to the Allies in World War I. It's important to note that this event took place before American entry into the war and caused damage to the Statue of Liberty. Now, to assess the given hypothesis, we need to establish a reference point in time. Since the text does not provide a specific date, we can use the current year, which is 2022, as a reference point to draw a comparison. Calculating the years from the date of the explosion to the present year (2022), we simply subtract the year of the incident (1916) from the current year (2022): 2022 - 1916 = 106 years Given this calculation, we can conclude that 106 years have passed since the Black Tom explosion occurred in 1916. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"The Black Tom explosion took place over 40 years ago\\" is true, as the event actually happened more than double the span of 40 years ago, totalling 106 years ago based on the current year."},{"instruction":"Порангату Translate to English English:","output":"Porangatu Translate to English English: Porangatu"},{"instruction":"How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? holy fuck! this is the fourth DanFraiser bot to follow me in two days!","output":"To analyze the sentiment of the tweet, I would break it down step by step: 1.

You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Output:","output":"SELECT LName FROM Student WHERE Major = 50"},{"instruction":"Write a title for this article: HANOI, Vietnam — Opening a new source of potential friction with China, the Obama administration said Friday that it would step into a tangled dispute between China and its smaller Asian neighbors over a string of strategically sensitive islands in the South China Sea. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, speaking at an Asian regional security meeting in Vietnam, said, “The United States has a national interest in freedom of navigation, open access to Asia’s maritime commons, and respect for international law in the South China Sea.” The United States, she said, was prepared to facilitate multilateral negotiations over how to deal with the islands — something sought by Vietnam, which has had deadly clashes with China over some of them. In 1974, China seized full control of one group of islands, the Paracels, after the two sides fought. In 1988, Chinese and Vietnamese warships traded fire in another, the Spratly Islands, sinking several Vietnamese ships. Mrs. Clinton stressed that the United States was not changing its longstanding neutrality on the competing territorial claims. But China has been adamant that the disputes be resolved through one-on-one negotiations, and the administration’s decision to get involved angered China’s foreign minister, Yang Jiechi. The United States appeared to catch China uncharacteristically flat-footed, lining up expressions of support. Twelve of the 27 countries at the meeting spoke out in favor of a new approach to the South China Sea, prompting Mr. Yang of China to observe that the American effort seemed orchestrated. International concern has been deepening about China’s maritime ambitions, which have expanded with its economic and military muscle. China is particularly covetous of the South China Sea islands — many of them just rocks or spits of sand — because they are rich in oil and natural gas deposits and because they lie so near. In recent months, administration officials said, China has harassed fishing boats and leaned on energy companies who try to make off-shore deals with other countries. It also put the United States on notice that it does not welcome foreign interference, saying it views the South China Sea as a “core interest.” China has particularly bristled over joint American-South Korean naval exercises starting this weekend off the Korean peninsula because some drills are to take place in the Yellow Sea, which China it claims as a military operation zone. Other tensions flared on the familiar front of North Korea, with an official threatening a “physical response” to the joint naval exercises. The United States intends the drills to be a deterrent to North Korean aggression, announcing them after an investigation led by South Korea found the North responsible for torpedoing a South Korean Navy ship, the Cheonan, in March. “This is not defensive training,” said the official, Ri Tong-il, noting that the United States was deploying one of its most formidable nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, the George Washington, in the exercises. “It is a grave threat to the Korean peninsula and also to the region of Asia as a whole.” While the harsh words between North Korea and the United States predictably dominated this meeting of the Association of South East Asian Nations, Mrs. Clinton’s comments about the South China Sea shone a spotlight on a less visible source of conflict in the region. For decades, China has sparred with Southeast Asian nations over control of the South China Sea islands. Earlier this year, it raised tensions with Vietnam by announcing plans to develop tourism in the Paracels. Vietnam’s strategy has been to “internationalize” the territorial disputes with China by bringing in other players for multilateral negotiations to dilute China’s power. Mrs. Clinton’s announcement that the United States would be willing to play a part was a significant victory for the Vietnamese. But it could further irritate Washington’s relations with Beijing. Last March, the Chinese government told two visiting senior Obama administration officials, Jeffrey A. Bader and James B. Steinberg, that it would not tolerate any interference in the South China Sea, an official said. The Unites States tried, with somewhat less success, to marshal support for South Korea in the wake of the sinking of the Cheonan. While many countries expressed condolences for the attack, which killed 46 sailors, few were willing to point a finger at North Korea as the culprit. But North Korea has opened a small window of engagemetn on the issue. Military officers from North Korea and the United Nations Command met on the inter-Korean border on Friday for the second time this month to discuss the sinking. Meeting at the border village of Panmunjom, colonels from both sides “exchanged ideas and further details for convening a joint assessment group” to investigate “the cause of the armistice violations that led to the sinking,” the American-led United Nations Command said. It remained unclear whether North Korea accepted the proposal. North Korea has so far insisted that it conduct its own investigation by sending a team of “inspectors” to South Korea. On Friday, the United Nations Command notified North Korea of plans to hold another joint America and South Korean military exercise: an annual drill from Aug. 16 to Aug. 26. The United States military traditionally does not announce the location of the drill. Mrs. Clinton struck a bleak tone about any easing of tensions with North Korea. She said the United States was still open to talks with Pyongyang if it agreed to give up its nuclear weapons, but concluded, “Under the current circumstances, it appears unlikely that we will be able to make any progress in the near term.” Her stop in Hanoi wrapped up a grueling trip that amounted to a tour of American wars, past and present: from Afghanistan to the demilitarized zone in South Korea, and finally to Vietnam, where, in a sunset ceremony, she watched the remains of three American soldiers killed in the war loaded on an Air Force transport plane to be retuned to the United States. Mrs. Clinton sought to apply lessons from the American experience in the Korean War to Afghanistan. “We saw South Korea struggle to become a functioning democracy — huge amounts of instability, coups, corruption, scandal, you name it,” she said. It’s good to remind ourselves: the United States has stood with countries that went through a lot of ups and downs for a lot longer than eight years.” Choe Sang-hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea, and Ed Wong from Beijing.

Each time they go deep sea fishing, Shelly catches 2 less than five swordfish, and Sam catches one less swordfish than Shelly. If Sam and Shelly go fishing 5 times, how many swordfish do they catch in total? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Let's break down the information given and find the answer step-by-step. 1. Shelly catches 2 less than five swordfish each time they go deep sea fishing. This means she catches (5 - 2) = 3 swordfish each time. 2. Sam catches one less swordfish than Shelly. Since Shelly catches 3 swordfish, Sam catches (3 - 1) = 2 swordfish each time. 3. Now let's find out how many swordfish they catch together in a single fishing trip. Shelly catches 3 and Sam catches 2, so together, they catch (3 + 2) = 5 swordfish in a single trip. 4. They go fishing 5 times, so to find the total number of swordfish they catch across all trips, we multiply the number of swordfish they catch in a single trip (5) by the number of trips (5). 5 × 5 = 25 In conclusion, Sam and Shelly catch a total of 25 swordfish after going deep sea fishing 5 times."},{"instruction":"browse for a product.

Context: WHITE HOUSE/BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said there is a plan to reunite the more than 2,000 children who have been detained apart from their parents. \\"We have a plan to do that,\\" the secretary told reporters at an event in Washington Thursday morning. Shortly before she spoke, a VOA reporter at an immigration court hearing in Brownsville, Texas, said prosecutors dropped misdemeanor charges against 17 migrants. The migrants, who were separated from their children remain detained, but dropping the charges could be a means to reunite them and allow the families to be detained as units. David Bier, an Immigration Policy Analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said if government prosecutors are dropping criminal charges in similar cases across the immigration court system, it calls into question the Trump Administration's 'Zero Tolerance' policy towards immigration. It's \\"an even more clear signal that the whole purpose of bringing these prosecutions is to separate parents from children and not about enforcing the law.\\" he told VOA. The administration's policy requires that anyone who crosses the border illegally face criminal charges. \\"If it continues to be the case that some of these cases or many of them are dismissed by courts – that should be the end of the policy,\\" Bier added. The moves come as the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations, as well as other issues that have divided the country's major political parties. Nielsen repeated her calls for lawmakers to act. \\"I want to be very clear on this. Congress has the authority and responsibility to make the law of the land and to fix the immigration system,\\" the secretary said. \\"We have done everything we can do in the executive branch.\\" The outcome of the votes is uncertain.

(AP)  Early in the fourth quarter, there was nervous pacing along With an opportunity to show a national television audience why they should once again become a BCS buster, a close game on the road was not what the fifth-ranked Broncos had in mind. They looked anxious, but they weren't rattled. \\"We know we are going to have people's best shots,\\" Boise State quarterback Kellen Moore (FSY) said. \\"It's kind of fun playing in tight games I think. Throw in a little pressure and it just shows the resiliency of this team.\\" Moore threw for 354 yards and three touchdowns, and Boise State remained unbeaten and in contention for a BCS bid with a 45-35 victory over Louisiana Tech on Friday night. Tech had pulled within 30-28 early in the fourth quarter on Dennis Morris' (FSY) leaping catch in the corner of the end zone. The Broncos defense buckled down long enough after that for Boise State to pull away with touchdowns on consecutive drives, first on Moore's 12-yard pass to Austin Pettis and then on Jeremy Avery's (FSY) 44-yard touchdown run. \\"We made more plays then they did tonight when it mattered and we were able to finish it out,\\" Moore said. Avery finished with 146 yards rushing, while Titus Young (FSY) caught eight passes for 110 yards, including a 40-yard touchdown for Boise State (9-0, 4-0 Western Athletic Conference). Boise State has scored no fewer than 45 points in each of its four WAC games this season. Still, the Broncos could have used a more dominant victory in their quest to prove they are more deserving than unbeaten and sixth-ranked TCU for a Bowl Championship Series bid. \\"That's how it always is when we play,\\" Boise State coach Chris Peters (FSY)on said. \\"It's never good enough, but it's good enough for us. We are going to try to do better next week and just go from there.\\" Trailing 27-7 at halftime, Tech (3-6, 2-4) made a game of it in the third quarter, starting with Josh Victorian's first career touchdown on Moore's third interception of the season. It was an ill-advised throw under pressure that hung in the air for Victorian, who raced down the sideline and cut inside Moore to cap a 75-yard return. \\"Throwing that stupid pick, I think that really gave them some momentum that they were able to build on and take advantage of,\\" Moore said. \\"I think that certainly kept them in the game and it is definitely something that I shouldn't have done.\\" Moore responded by leading a 15-play drive to set up Kyle Brotzman's (FSY) third field goal, then Tech's offense suddenly came to life. The Bulldogs got their first first down in two quarters on the way to a 73-yard scoring drive capped by Ross Jenkins' (FSY) 9-yard keeper around the right end to make it 30-21. Tech's Matt Nelson (FSY) then caught the Broncos by surprise with an onside kick that he recovered himself. Shortly after, Jenkins found Morris over the middle for 36 yards to the Boise State 12, setting up Jenkins' third-down pass to Morris, who leaped to catch the ball over defensive back Kyle Wilson's head to pull Tech within 30-28. \\"It looked like the game was going to get away from us, but I was really proud at how well we did in the second half,\\" Louisiana Tech coach Derek Dooley said. \\"We didn't make the plays at the end of the game we needed to win, but if we keep fighting the way we've been fighting, we'll play out of it eventually.\\" When Brotzman missed his second field goal of the game on the Broncos' next drive, the crowd was going wild, and it appeared the Bulldogs just might upset the highest-ranked team ever to play at Joe Aillet Stadium. Instead, Boise State put its figurative foot down, forcing a quick punt. Then Moore floated a pass down the sideline to Kyle Efaw (FSY) for his second 40-yard completion of the game, setting up his scoring pass to Pettis to make it 38-28. Soon after, Tech failed to convert a fourth-and-6 on its own 44, setting up Avery's game-clinching run that made it 45-28 with 4:52 to go. Tech managed one more touchdown after that. Jenkins finished 10 of 19 for 114 yards and one interception. Daniel Porter (FSY) rushed for 92 yards and a score for Tech. Moore's three TD passes gave him 27 on the season, eclipsing the 25 he had last year as a freshman. Pettis finished with nine catches for 105 yards. Richie Brockel (FSY) had a 2-yard TD catch in the first half and Doug Martin (FSY) scored on 2-yard run for the Broncos.

He is picked up by a chauffeur, who Bond determines to be an enemy agent. Bond instructs him to leave the main road and, after a brief fight, Bond starts to interrogate the driver, who then kills himself with a cyanide-embedded cigarette.During his investigation Bond sees a picture of a boatman named Quarrel with Strangways. Bond locates Quarrel but finds him to be un-cooperative when he interviews him. Bond also recognises Quarrel to have been the driver of the car that chased him from the airport. Bond follows Quarrel and is about to be beaten by him and a friend when the fight is interrupted by the man from the airport who has been following Bond: he reveals himself to be CIA agent Felix Leiter and that not only are the two agents on the same mission, but also that Quarrel is helping Leiter. The CIA has traced the mysterious radio jamming of American rockets to the Jamaica vicinity, but aerial photography cannot see the exact location of its origin.

Choices: - fibers - ions - seeds - spores A: Answer:","output":"The answer is - spores. Explanation: In the life cycle of a plant, sporophyte is the stage in which the plant is diploid, meaning it has two sets of chromosomes. Meiosis is the process by which these diploid cells (sporophyte) divide to produce haploid cells with just one set of chromosomes. These haploid cells are called spores. They further develop into the gametophyte stage of the plant, which can produce gametes for sexual reproduction. The other options - fibers, ions, and seeds - are not the products of meiosis in the sporophyte stage. This cycle, known as alternation of generations, is the typical reproduction cycle in many plants and some algae. The diploid stage (sporophyte) and haploid stage (gametophyte) alternate, ensuring genetic variation and continuity of species."},{"instruction":"Given the below context: In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Does not live up to the hype! Product review: I was very dissatissfied with the selection of the monologues. The organization of the book was also extremely unproductive. The time I spent with this book was a complete waste.","output":"Considering the specific review provided, the likelihood of me buying the product would decrease. This response is based on a thorough evaluation of the review title and its content. Below is a detailed breakdown of the analysis: 1. Review title: \\"Does not live up to the hype!\\" The title suggests that the product might have received some positive attention or been advertised with high promises. However, according to the reviewer, it fails to deliver on those expectations. The negative sentiment in the title signifies dissatisfaction, thus decreasing the chances of considering the product. 2. Dissatisfaction with the selection of monologues: The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the content of the product they purchased (in this case, a book with a selection of monologues). This implies that the book may not provide what it claims or that the content does not meet the standards of the reviewer. In turn, this detracts from the product's appeal, further lowering the probability of a purchase. 3. Unproductive organization: The review states that the organization of the book is \\"extremely unproductive.\\" A disorganized and poorly structured book poses difficulty in navigation, comprehension, and searchability. This issue is another significant factor contributing to the negative assessment of the product, further decreasing the chances of purchasing it. 4. Time wasted: The reviewer says that the time spent with the book was a \\"complete waste.\\" This statement emphasizes that they did not derive any value from the product and that the investment of time had no favorable outcome. This sentiment is another compelling reason to avoid the product, as consumers generally seek products that offer tangible benefits, usability, or satisfaction. Based on the negative tone and specific drawbacks highlighted in the review, the chances of buying the product are diminished. The reviewer's dissatisfaction, criticism of content selection, disorganization of the book, and the wasted time invested in using the product are all factors that contribute to this decision. Since consumers typically rely on reviews to gain insights and learn from others' experiences, a review like this can significantly influence the decision-making process and decrease the likelihood of purchasing the product."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - Central London is the innermost part of London, England.

Are the coral reefs near Malarn more or less healthy than the reefs near Trainlan? Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision. Hint: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. Answer:","output":"The paragraph does not provide sufficient information to determine if the coral reefs near Malarn are more or less healthy than the reefs near Trainlan."},{"instruction":"Is the following review positive or negative? This is the stylish lounge adjacent to the cozy Jamaican restaurant known as The Breadfruit. I loved the vibe of this place as soon as I walked in the door. Their list of rums is quite impressive so if you are a connoisseur then you simply must go here. They have a menu of fun signature cocktails that were mostly tropical themed... it sort of reminded me of Hula's Modern Tiki Bar in that respect but in this case the rums really are the main focus and any fruit juice or other mixers are meant to enhance and highlight the flavor of the rum itself. The first one I tried was the Spicy Rumtini which was really delicious, though I expected more heat. My husband wanted a Jack and diet coke but was told that they had neither (no whiskey since rums are their thing and they also don't offer soda with artificial sweeteners). However the bartender recommended he try the Tennessee Rum Cider. This drink tasted surprisingly like whiskey but actually is made with a rum called Prichard's Fine (which is made in Tennessee) mixed with an organic apple cider. The second drink that I tried was a Dark and Stormy. I had this drink at Citizen Public House and didn't really care for it but I really enjoyed this one. Now don't get me wrong, I am well aware that CPH mixes up the best cocktails on the planet. But I just happened to like this particular drink here at the Rum Bar better. One of my companions said it was because of the type of rum they use (Goslings). The cocktails were all 8 or 9 and their wines were 10 a glass (but they had Dos Cabezas, yay!) so because of that this would never be someplace I would come drink on a regular basis. Though I certainly don't mind splurging on a premium cocktail every once in a while. I saw they also had a cigar patio so I think this would be the perfect place for a classy bachelor party or b-day.","output":"Step 1: Read the review carefully.

The term is simply the adjective \\"regnal\\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \\"name\\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously. For example, the same person was both King James I of England (along with Ireland) and King James VI of Scotland. - Drake Tungsten was the pseudonym that singer / songwriter Britt Daniel performed under from 1994 to 1996 as a solo artist . - Austin is the capital of the U.S. state of Texas and the seat of Travis County.

What American physicist discovered the positron which explained Chinese physicist Chung-Yao Chao's earlier experiments with gamma rays? The answer is:","output":"Carl David Anderson is the American physicist who discovered the positron, which explained the earlier experiments with gamma rays conducted by Chinese physicist Chung-Yao Chao. Carl David Anderson was born on September 3, 1905, in New York City. He completed his undergraduate studies in physics, chemistry, and engineering at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1927. Anderson then pursued his Ph.D. in Physics, also at Caltech, under the guidance of the renowned physicist and Nobel laureate, Robert A. Millikan. Anderson's groundbreaking discovery of the positron took place during his postdoctoral research in 1932. In his experiment, Anderson used a cloud chamber to examine cosmic rays. The cloud chamber is a device used to visualize the paths of charged particles, such as ions and electrons. When a charged particle passes through the supersaturated gas in the chamber, it ionizes the gas molecules, creating a visible trail. Anderson was studying cosmic rays that were thought to contain highly energetic particles, and he observed that the paths of some particles were bending in the opposite direction than expected. This led him to hypothesize the existence of a new type of particle – the positron. The positron, also known as the antielectron, is the antiparticle of the electron. It has the same mass as an electron but carries a positive charge. When a positron and an electron collide, they annihilate each other, producing a burst of gamma rays. This event aligns with the principles of antimatter, which had been theorized by physicist Paul Dirac in 1928. The discovery of the positron and the validation of the concept of antimatter significantly advanced the field of particle physics. It also provided an explanation for the experiments conducted by Chung-Yao Chao, a Chinese physicist who had been studying gamma rays. Chao observed that the gamma rays he was studying produced particles that behaved in unexpected ways. However, Chao was unable to definitively identify these particles at the time. Anderson's discovery of the positron provided the missing link and explained Chao's gamma-ray experiments, as gamma rays can be produced during the annihilation of positrons and electrons. For his discovery of the positron, Carl David Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936, at the age of 31. This recognition made him one of the youngest recipients of the prestigious award. Anderson continued to contribute to the field of physics throughout his career, later discovering the muon, another fundamental subatomic particle."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer.

The ratio is 5:8, so the total parts are 5 + 8 = 13. Step 2: Determine the value of each part. Now, since there are 78 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices by the total parts to get the value of each part. So, 78 ÷ 13 = 6 slices per part. Step 3: Calculate the number of slices for each person. For Buzz, the ratio is 5, so he gets 5 parts. Since each part is worth 6 slices, he gets 5 × 6 = 30 slices. For the waiter, the ratio is 8, so the waiter gets 8 parts. Since each part is worth 6 slices, the waiter gets 8 × 6 = 48 slices. Step 4: Find the requested value. The problem asks for twenty less than the number of slices the waiter ate. So, we'll subtract 20 from the waiter's slices. 48 slices (waiter's share) - 20 = 28 slices.

Silicone gel breast implants, manufactured by French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP), are displayed at the office of plastic surgeon Denis Boucq in a clinic in Nice December 16, 2011. Plastic surgeon Denis Boucq (R) operates on a patient to remove her silicone gel breast implants, manufactured by French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP), at a clinic in Nice December 21, 2011. Alexandra Blachere, who heads an association of women with faulty breast implants, displays silicone gel breast implants during an interview in Paris December 20, 2011. PARISThe French government urged 30,000 women in France on Friday to seek removal of defective breast implants that a now-defunct company exported worldwide but it said there was no evidence that the product raised the risk of cancer. The government said public healthcare funds would be used to finance the removals, which were recommended because of the risk of ruptures that could cause inflammation and irritation, at a cost which health officials estimated at 60 million euros. Around 30,000 women in France have had breast implants made by the company Poly Implant Prothese SA (PIP), which is accused of using industrial-grade silicone normally used in anything from computers to cookware. PIP, founded by one-time butcher Jean-Claude Mas, produced about 100,000 implants a year before its products were ordered off the market in early 2010. As many as 300,000 women worldwide may have received PIP implants, which were exported to Latin American countries such as Brazil and Argentina, and Western European markets such as Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy. Britain said on Friday it was not following the French recommendation and played down any cancer risks. France has had reports of eight cases of cancer in women with breast implants made by PIP, but health officials stressed at a news conference that the product was not suspected of increasing cancer risk. A health ministry statement said advice from medical experts showed that: \\"There is as of now no increased risk of cancer for women using implants of the PIP brand versus other implants.\\" The statement addressed to French women said new implants would be paid from public funds in cases where the initial implant was inserted for medical reasons, typically for reconstruction after breast cancer treatments. Associations representing women with PIP implants have been demanding that all replacements, including cases of implants that were purely cosmetic, be publicly funded. \\"This announcement is just a smokescreen and the victims of PIP are angry,\\" said Alexandra Blachere, head of the association of PIP implant users in France. \\"PIP implants are dangerous even excluding cancer. The state can't simply order them to be removed and then leave women to get by afterwards.\\" Philippe Courtois, a lawyer for a French association of PIP implant users, gave a cautious welcome to Friday's government announcement, saying: \\"It's a common sense decision even if it unfortunately comes a bit late.\\" CHEAP SILICONE PIP was placed into liquidation in March 2010 with losses of 9 million euros after the French medical safety agency, AFSSAPS, recalled its implants when surgeons reported abnormally high rupture rates. During a subsequent inspection of its manufacturing site, officials found PIP was using a type of silicone that was not approved by health authorities, but was about 10 times cheaper. An investigation found a majority of implants made by PIP since 2001 contained the unapproved gel. A spokesman for the German company TUV Rheinland which provided quality certification of PIP's production facilities until March 2010 said its remit was to check the production process not the content of the silicone. TÜV Rheinland sued PIP in February 2011, claiming it was \\"thoroughly and continuously misled\\" by PIP about a change in the silicone that was used. Authorities in Britain, where women using PIP implants have also announced a court case, also played down any cancer risk. \\"Women with PIP implants should not be unduly worried. We have no evidence of a link to cancer or an increased risk of rupture. If women are concerned they should speak to their surgeon,\\" British Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said. More than 2,000 women in France have filed legal complaints and another 250 women have recently done likewise in Britain, where the authorities have stopped short of recommending implant removals and sought to reassure on cancer risks too on Friday. Several as yet unidentified executives of the company founded by Mas, are expected to face charges of aggravated fraud in an ongoing court case in France, which exposes them to possible sentences of up to five years in prison. French judicial inquiries tends to be extremely protracted and often highly secretive affairs. The PIP scandal was rekindled in recent weeks by the death of a cancer victim who had such implants, prompting prosecutors to open another preliminary inquiry that will assess whether there are grounds for more serious charges of involuntary manslaughter. (Additional reporting by Alexandria Sage in Paris, Jean Francois Rosnoblet in Marseilles, Kate Kelland in Britain, Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt) ||||| PARIS — French health authorities issued an extraordinary guideline on Friday urging 30,000 French women to have defective breast implants removed, deepening concerns in half a dozen countries and adding more unwelcome light to failings in French medical oversight. While trying to dampen fears that the implants were linked to any kind of cancer, the French health minister, Xavier Bertrand, recommended that recipients have an “explant” procedure as a preventive, nonemergency measure, even if there were no clinical indications that the implants had been leaking substandard silicone. Medical experts said they were unable to think of any prior action on implants on the scale of the French decision. The implants — made by a French company, Poly Implants Prothèses, that was closed last year — used an inferior, industrial-grade silicone and are more likely to rupture or ooze than those made from surgical silicone. The French authorities stressed that the leaked gel carries no known link to cancer, focusing instead on how it can irritate body tissues and cause damaging inflammation. Questions over how low-grade silicone could have gone undetected in hundreds of thousands of implants sold in Western Europe, Australia and South America come on the heels of France’s largest public health scandal in years. That involves a diabetes medication, Mediator, that was also used as a diet drug. It remained in circulation despite at least a decade of warnings, and health officials say it may have caused as many as 2,000 deaths. The maker, Servier, has been charged with defrauding the health-care system and is being investigated for consumer fraud and manslaughter. No PIP implants were known to have been used in the United States, but there are concerns over an unknown number of women who traveled to South American for less-expensive implants. So far, no country has reported a rupture rate as high as France’s — 5 percent — and most have issued statements meant to reassure implant recipients. Anxieties rose sharply last month when a French woman whose implant had ruptured died from a rare cancer called anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, and French media reported that she was the eighth woman with the PIP implants to have died of cancer, a figure for which the statistical significance is unclear. On Friday, the health authorities in Britain, where some 40,000 women received the implants, said it was not recommending “routine removal. ” “We recognize the concern that some women who have these implants may be feeling, but we currently have no evidence of any increase in incidents of cancer associated with these implants and no evidence of any disproportionate rupture rates other than in France,” the British agency said in a statement. In Brazil, where about 25,000 implants were used, the National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance recommended that recipients be examined by their doctors. Chile’s Public Health Institute asked doctors who performed implants to contact patients to explain the emerging concerns. The healthy ministry in Venezuela, one of the region’s largest plastic surgery markets, did not comment, nor did that in Colombia, where nearly 15,000 women have had PIP implants. Breast implants have had a contentious history, with critics saying they are overused and that women in the pursuit of a narrowly defined ideal of beauty end up subject to uncertain dangers from silicone leaks, including auto-immune problems and what animal studies suggest are possible links to cancer. In the United States, a 14-year moratorium in the United States on all silicone implants was lifted only in 2006, after two decades of litigation in American courts failed to show a conclusive link to cancer in humans. The United States Institute of Medicine and the Food and Drug Administration eventually determined that there was no evidence that standard silicone implants were harmful. A spokeswoman for the French health products safety agency, known as Afssaps, said it was possible that the rupture rates in other countries were lower because reporting was still low, or because complaints had not yet reached some governments. “We began in March 2010 to alert the authorities in the countries that had imported those implants,” she said. “But the question is whether they passed on the information to the population. We don’t know.” France will foot the bill for the implant removals, but will only pay for new implants in women who had them for reconstructive surgery after breast cancer. Women who choose not to undergo the removal should have an ultrasound examination every six months, the authorities said, and should remove any implant that ruptures. Some foreign doctors expressed approval for the French approach. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"This article talks about a situation where thousands of women in France were urged to seek removal of defective breast implants that were made by a French company called Poly Implant Prothese SA (PIP). These implants used industrial-grade silicone and had a higher risk of ruptures which could cause inflammation and irritation. The French government offered to cover the cost of removal with public healthcare funds, although they clarified that there was no evidence that these implants increased the risk of cancer."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Background: In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms. Paragraph: John spends most of his time on computers. While at work his work computer does not need modern capabilities. So, he still uses Windows 2000 at his office computer. At home it's a complete different ball game. He plays so much computer games at home that he needs a better computer. In his home computer he installed the latest version of Windows.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which computer CPU will not turn off many internal components, office computer or home computer? A:","output":"A: In the home computer, the CPU will not turn off many internal components. This is because the home computer is running the latest version of Windows, which implements more complex CPU power-saving methods compared to Windows 2000 used on the office computer.

Noticing the man's determination to divorce his wife, Gavin decides to tell him the story of one of his clients, a personal friend of his. Oliver Rose, a student at Harvard Law School, meets Barbara at an auction, where they bid on the same antique. Oliver chats Barbara up and they become friends. When Barbara misses her ferry home, the two end up spending the night together at a local hotel. Eventually the two marry and have two children, Josh and Carolyn. Over the years, the Roses grow richer, and Barbara finds an old mansion whose owner has recently died, purchases it and devotes her time to making a home there. However, cracks seem to be forming in the family. As Oliver becomes a successful partner in his law firm, Barbara, who was a doting and loving wife early in the marriage, appears to grow restless in her life with Oliver, and begins to dislike him immensely. Oliver, for his part, cannot understand what he has done to earn Barbara's contempt, despite his controlling, self-centered, and generally dismissive behavior toward her. When Oliver believes he is suffering a heart attack, (actually a hiatal hernia) the day after an argument, Barbara (after her initial shock and concern) realizes she felt a sense of relief that he might be dead. She tells him so, adding that she no longer loves him and wants a divorce and Oliver accepts. Feeling that it might not be wise to represent himself, Oliver hires Gavin as his legal counsel on a retainer.

The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event. - Geir Andersen ( born February 12 , 1964 ) is a Norwegian nordic combined skier who competed from 1983 to 1989 . He won three medals at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships with one gold ( 1984 : 3 x 10 km team ) and two silvers ( 1985 : 15 km individual , 3 x 10 km team ) . Andersen also finished 10th in the individual event at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo . He had six individual victories in his career from 1984 to 1985 . - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing. - The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup is a Nordic combined competition organized yearly by FIS, representing the highest level in international competition for this sport. It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen. - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate. - The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships have been held in various numbers and types of events since 1925 for men and since 1954 for women. Championship events include nordic skiing's three disciplines: cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and nordic combined (the latter being a combination sport consisting of both cross-country and ski jumping). From 1924 to 1939, the World Championships were held every year, including the Winter Olympics. After World War II, the World Championships were held every four years from 1950 to 1982. Since 1985, the World Championships have been held in odd-numbered years. - Nordic skiing pertains to skiing disciplines that use equipment where the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the binding in a manner that allows the heel to rise off the ski, unlike Alpine skiing, where the boot is attached to the ski from toe to heel. Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark skiing. - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline.

Freshwater Lake The man loved to fish for bass, and to be happy, all he needed was a boat, his equipment, and a freshwater lake. This is the option that aligns most closely with common sense in this context for the following reasons: 1. Freshwater lakes are known to be a natural habitat for various species of bass. Both largemouth and smallmouth bass are commonly found in freshwater lakes and reservoirs, which makes this the perfect setting for the man to go fishing. In contrast, options A (river) and E (live in ponds) also contain bass, but they are less commonly associated with bass fishing than a lake environment. 2. Sunshine (C) is a vital factor for a great fishing experience, but it is not directly related to the fishing activity itself. Having a sunny day might make the man happier and provide better fishing conditions, but it is not essential for bass fishing, and is not specifically associated with the pursuit and capture of bass. 3. A music store (D) is not pertinent to the man's interest in fishing. It is unrelated to the context and does not contribute to his enjoyment of bass fishing. Although music could be a source of enjoyment, it does not provide him with the bass fishing experience he desires. In conclusion, choosing option B, the freshwater lake, is the most consistent with common sense, given the man's love for fishing bass and the need for a suitable environment for pursuing his passion. The freshwater lake would provide him with access to the bass species and the best opportunity to stay happy and indulge in his favorite pastime."},{"instruction":"What was the question for this implicit rationale, and corresponding answer?

Think in reds and blacks. Move clusters of the same color. Know that the rest of the rules apply.","output":"Title: Mastering the Art of Spider Solitaire: Delving into the Strategy of the Two-Suit Variation Introduction Spider Solitaire is a popular and challenging card game that requires patience, strategy, and a keen eye for detail. The game comes in three different variations, distinguishing themselves by the number of suits they feature: one-suit (easy), two-suit (intermediate), and four-suit (expert). This article will provide an in-depth dive into the two-suit variation of Spider Solitaire, examining its rules, strategies, and helpful tips on how to play the game effectively. Setting Up the Game First, let's start by dealing out the cards. In this two-suit version, we will be working only with red cards (hearts and diamonds) and black cards (spades and clubs). Shuffle two decks of standard playing cards together, excluding jokers. Lay out ten piles of five cards each, flip the top card face-up in each pile, and place the remaining cards in the draw pile. Moving Clusters of the Same Color Now that the game is set up, the objective is to move cards between piles in descending order, beginning with the king and ending with the ace. However, in this two-suit version, you must focus on creating sequences by paying attention to both the rank and the color (red or black) of the cards. This means players can only move cards onto others of the same color (for example, a red eight can only be placed on a red nine). To optimize your play, look for clusters of the same color. A cluster is a group of cards of the same color in descending order. Moving clusters of the same color will allow you to more easily empty columns, which, in turn, gives you more space to play with and increases your chances of winning. Apply General Spider Solitaire Rules Aside from these specific recommendations, players should remember that standard Spider Solitaire rules apply to the two-suit version: 1. Empty Columns: If a column is emptied, any card or a cluster of the same color can be placed in that column. 2. Dealing New Cards: If you run out of moves, you can deal new cards from the draw pile on top of each column with at least one card. Make sure that all initial face-down cards have been turned face-up before doing this. 3. Building Complete Sequences: The ultimate goal of the game is to create complete sequences of the same suit. In this variation, the sequence must be from King to Ace of either hearts or diamonds for red sequences, and from King to Ace of either spades or clubs for black sequences. 4. Removing Completed Sequences: As you complete strategies, remove them from play by transferring them to a separate area. The game is won when all cards have been sorted into their appropriate sequences and removed from play. Helpful Tips for Winning Two-Suit Spider Solitaire 1. Prioritize unearthing face-down cards: Exposing and utilizing face-down cards should be your primary focus. This not only gives you more options for creating sequences but also uncovers any hidden potential clusters. 2. Be cautious about building on higher cards: While it’s necessary to make progress, building on higher-ranked cards can be risky, as it may limit your moves in the long run. Aim to uncover and use lower-ranked cards as much as possible. 3. Keep track of suits: As you progress through the two-suit version, remember that even though we think in reds and blacks, you must ultimately form sequences of the same suit (hearts, diamonds, spades, or clubs). Knowing which cards belong to each suit can help with planning and increases chances of success. Conclusion The two-suit variation of Spider Solitaire raises the difficulty level by adding more dimensions to the game. By focusing on reds and blacks, moving clusters of the same color, and understanding how to apply the general rules effectively, players set themselves up for success. With practice, patience, and strategic thinking, players will improve their skill and enjoy the gratifying challenge of mastering the two-suit Spider Solitaire."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: It is one of the most annoying words in the English language and it seems there is no escaping it. The word \\"huh?\\" is in worldwide use, a study found. Researchers discovered that languages spoken in countries from Ghana and Laos to Iceland and Italy all include \\"huh?\\", or something that sounds very like it. They said that while the study may sound silly, the word is an absolutely necessary part of speech. Without it and similar words, it would be impossible to show that we haven't heard or understood what had been said and this would lead to constant misunderstandings. But while other words used in the same context, such as \\"sorry\\" or \\"what\\", vary widely across languages, \\"huh?\\" remains unchanged. The Dutch researchers carefully studied ten languages from around the world, including Siwu, which is spoken in Ghana, and an Australian Aboriginal language, as well as Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Mandarin Chinese. They analysed tapes of recorded conversations for words that sounded like \\"huh?\\" and were used to request that whatever had just been said be repeated. All contained a version of \\"huh?\\". The word was also found in another 21 languages. While there were subtle differences in each country, all sounded basically the same. This is surprising because normally unrelated languages will use very different words to describe the same thing. For instance, the Japanese for \\"dog\\" is \\"inu\\", while the French is \\"chien\\". It is thought that languages around the world have developed their own version of \\"huh?\\" because the sound is quick and simple to form, as well as being easily understood. The researchers, said that it might seem unimportant to carry out scientific research into a word like \\"huh?\\" but in fact this little word is an essential tool in human communication. They also have an answer for those who claim that \\"huh?\\" isn't a word. They say that it qualifies because of the small differences in its pronunciation in different languages.

Options: - fire - store - contain food - garage - liquid Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"A flask is a container, and we will evaluate each of the options to determine its purpose: 1. Fire: A flask is not designed to hold fire, as it is typically a smaller, closed container not suited for containing fire or high heat. 2. Store: This option is a bit vague, but a flask does store something. However, this does not specifically describe what a flask is designed to hold. 3. Contain food: A flask is generally not used for containing food, as it is usually designed with a narrow opening, making it difficult to store or consume solid food. 4. Garage: A garage is a structure used to store and protect vehicles, so a flask would not be a suitable container for a garage. 5. Liquid: A flask is primarily designed to hold and store liquid, such as water or an alcoholic beverage. Its size, shape, and design make it suitable for carrying and consuming liquids on the go. In conclusion, based on the analysis of each option, a flask is a container specifically made to hold liquid."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

Break down the tweet content: The user is mentioning that they don't have a specific option and that they are currently using their dad's older device, which might be the reason for not having the mentioned option. 2. Identify keywords and phrases that express emotions: In this tweet, there are no strong keywords or phrases that indicate a specific emotion, such as happiness, sadness, anger, or surprise. 3. Understand the context: The user seems to be communicating to another user (@PatriciaErin) in a conversation-like manner, providing the reason for not having the mentioned option in their device. 4.

Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \\"patchwork\\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry. For most of the Gaelic period, dwellings and farm buildings were circular with conical thatched roofs (see roundhouse). Square and rectangle-shaped buildings gradually became more common, and by the 14th or 15th century they had replaced round buildings completely. In some areas, buildings were made mostly of stone. In others, they were built of timber, wattle and daub, or a mix of materials. Most ancient and early medieval stone buildings were of dry stone construction. Some buildings would have had glass windows. Among the wealthy, it was common for women to have their own 'apartment' called a grianan (anglicized \\"greenan\\") in the sunniest part of the homestead. The dwellings of freemen and their families were often surrounded by a circular rampart called a \\"ringfort\\". There are two main kinds of ringfort. The rath is an earthen ringfort, averaging 30m diameter, with a dry outside ditch. The cathair or caiseal is a stone ringfort. The ringfort would typically have enclosed the family home, small farm buildings or workshops, and animal pens. Most date to the period 500-1000 CE and there is evidence of large-scale ringfort desertion at the end of the first millennium. The remains of between 30,000 and 40,000 lasted into the 19th century to be mapped by Ordnance Survey Ireland. Another kind of native dwelling was the crannog, which were roundhouses built on artificial islands in lakes. There were very few nucleated settlements in Gaelic areas. However, after the 5th century some monasteries became the heart of small \\"monastic towns\\". By the 10th century the Norse-Gaelic ports of Dublin, Wexford, Cork and Limerick had grown into substantial settlements. It was at this time, perhaps as a response to Viking raids, that many of the Irish round towers were built. In the fifty years before the Norman invasion, the term \\"castle\\" (Old Irish: caistel/caislen) appears in Gaelic writings, although there are no surviving examples of pre-Norman castles. After the invasion, the Normans built motte-and-bailey castles in the areas they occupied, some of which were converted from ringforts. By 1300 \\"some mottes, especially in frontier areas, had almost certainly been built by the Gaelic Irish in imitation\\". The Normans gradually replaced wooden motte-and-baileys with stone castles and tower houses. Tower houses are free-standing multi-storey stone towers usually surrounded by a wall (see bawn) and ancillary buildings. Gaelic families had begun to build their own tower houses by the 15th century. As many as 7000 may have been built, but they were rare in areas with little Norman settlement or contact. They are concentrated in counties Limerick and Clare but are lacking in Ulster, except the area around Strangford Lough. In Gaelic law, a 'sanctuary' called a maighin digona surrounded each person's dwelling. The maighin digona's size varied according to the owner's rank. In the case of a boaire it stretched as far as he, while sitting at his house, could cast a cnairsech (variously described as a spear or sledgehammer). The owner of a maighin digona could offer its protection to someone fleeing from pursuers, who would then have to bring that person to justice by lawful means. Gaelic Ireland was involved in trade with Britain and mainland Europe from ancient times, and this trade increased over the centuries. Tacitus, for example, wrote in the 1st century that most of Ireland's harbours were known to the Romans through commerce. There are many passages in early Irish literature that mention luxury items imported from foreign lands, and the fair of Carman in Leinster included a market of foreign traders. In the Middle Ages the main exports were textiles such as wool and linen while the main imports were luxury items. Money was seldom used in Gaelic society; instead, goods and services were usually exchanged for other goods and services. The economy was mainly a pastoral one, based on livestock (cows, sheep, pigs, goats, etc.) and their products. Cattle was \\"the main element in the Irish pastoral economy\\" and the main form of wealth, providing milk, butter, cheese, meat, fat, hides, and so forth. They were a \\"highly mobile form of wealth and economic resource which could be quickly and easily moved to a safer locality in time of war or trouble\\". The nobility owned great herds of cattle that had herdsmen and guards. Sheep, goats and pigs were also a valuable resource but had a lesser role in Irish pastoralism. Horticulture was practised; the main crops being oats, wheat and barley, although flax was also grown for making linen. Transhumance was also practised, whereby people moved with their livestock to higher pastures in summer and back to lower pastures in the cooler months. The summer pasture was called the buaile (anglicized as booley) and it is noteworthy that the Irish word for boy (buachaill) originally meant a herdsman. Many moorland areas were \\"shared as a common summer pasturage by the people of a whole parish or barony\\". Gaelic Ireland was well furnished with roads and bridges. Bridges were typically wooden and in some places the roads were laid with wood and stone. There were five main roads leading from Tara: Slighe Asail, Slighe Chualann, Slighe Dala, Slighe Mor and Slighe Midluachra. Horses were one of the main means of long-distance transport. Although horseshoes and reins were used, the Gaelic Irish did not use saddles, stirrups or spurs. Every man was trained to spring from the ground on to the back of his horse (an ech-leim or \\"steed-leap\\") and they urged-on and guided their horses with a rod having a hooked goad at the end. Two-wheeled and four-wheeled chariots (singular carbad) were used in Ireland from ancient times, both in private life and in war. They were big enough for two people, made of wickerwork and wood, and often had decorated hoods. The wheels were spoked, shod all round with iron, and were from three to four and a half feet high. Chariots were generally drawn by horses or oxen, with horse-drawn chariots being more common among chiefs and military men. War chariots furnished with scythes and spikes, like those of the ancient Gauls and Britons, are mentioned in literature. Boats used in Gaelic Ireland include canoes, currachs, sailboats and Irish galleys. Ferryboats were used to cross wide rivers and are often mentioned in the Brehon Laws as subject to strict regulations. Sometimes they were owned by individuals and sometimes they were the common property of those living round the ferry. Large boats were used for trade with mainland Europe. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what kind of roads did they have?","output":"Gaelic Ireland had roads that were \\"well furnished with roads and bridges.\\" In some places, the roads were laid with wood and stone."},{"instruction":"Man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word. The comedy concerns a character called Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O' Sullivan) who finds himself after a wild party, ending up at the home of two ladies called Jo and Chrissy. Ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate. The obvious ends up happening as he moves in. Man about the house was a pre-cursor to Cooke and Mortimer's spin off show George and Mildred which featured the 2 characters who were landlords to Jo, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with Mildred (the late and much missed Yootha Joyce) in particular getting some of the best lines of the series. A semi-regular character was Larry (Doug Fisher) a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something (and never to return it). The American's did a version called three's company but it doesn't stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original. Thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script.

They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang. As time passes, Vallian manages to kill the bandits one by one. The remaining four keep up their pursuit. Vallian is obviously attracted to Susanna, and she to him. Following a moment of high drama, she succumbs to his advances and they share a passionate kiss. McKaskel never learns of the kiss, but tells Vallian, who is critical of his apparent pacifism, to back off several times. In an encounter with Indians, Susanna learns that her brother, an army officer, has likely been killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Out hunting, Vallian is shot.

He was raised in a rural community of Beaufort called Laurel Bay. Frazier said he was always close to his father, who carried him when he was a toddler \\"over the 10 acres of farmland\\" the Fraziers worked as sharecroppers \\"to the still where he made his bootleg corn liquor, and into town on Saturdays to buy the necessities that a family of 10 needed.\\" Young Frazier was affectionately called \\"Billie Boy.\\" According to an article from The New York Times, \\"over the years, Frazier has lost a fortune through a combination of his own generosity and naivete, his carousing, and failed business opportunities. The other headliners from his fighting days--Ali, George Foreman, and Larry Holmes--are millionaires.\\" Asked about his situation, Frazier became playfully defensive, but would not reveal his financial status. \\"Are you asking me how much money I have?\\" he said. \\"I got plenty of money. I got a stack of 100 bills rolled up over there in the back of the room.\\" Frazier blamed himself, partly, for not effectively promoting his own image. In a 2006 HBO documentary on the fight in Manila, Frazier was interviewed living in a one-room apartment on the second floor of his gym. His daughter Jackie Frazier-Lyde is a lawyer and worked on her father's behalf in pursuit of money they claimed he was owed in a Pennsylvania land deal. In 1973, Frazier purchased 140 acres in Bucks County, Pennsylvania for 843,000. Five years later, a developer agreed to buy the farmland for 1.8 million. Frazier received annual payments from a trust that bought the land with money he had earned in the ring. However, when the trust went bankrupt, the payments ceased. Frazier sued his business partners, insisting his signature had been forged on documents and he had no knowledge of the sale. In the ensuing years, the 140 acres was subdivided and turned into a residential community. The land is now worth an estimated 100 million.

Solve this problem.","output":"Alright, little buddy, let's solve this equation step by step. We want to figure out what 'h' is. We have this equation: -19819 = 398*h - 15839 First, we need to move the -15839 from the right side of the equation to the left side to help us solve for 'h'. To do this, we need to add 15839 to both sides: -19819 + 15839 = 398*h - 15839 + 15839 When we do this, we get: -3980 = 398*h Now, we need to find the value of 'h'. Since 398 is multiplied by 'h', we should do the opposite of multiplication to find 'h'. So, we need to divide both sides by 398: -3980 ÷ 398 = (398*h) ÷ 398 When we do this, we find that: -10 = h So there you have it, the value of 'h' is -10.

His parents were introduced to each other by a friend from Jack's fraternity at the University of Kentucky in September 1934, and married on November 2, 1935. Thompson's first name came from a purported ancestor on his mother's side, the Scottish surgeon John Hunter. Following the success of Hell's Angels, Thompson was able to publish articles in a number of well-known magazines during the late 1960s, including The New York Times Magazine, Esquire, Pageant, and Harper's. In the Times Magazine article, published in 1967, shortly before the \\"Summer of Love\\", and titled \\"The Hashbury is the Capital of the Hippies\\", Thompson wrote in-depth about the Hippies of San Francisco, deriding a culture that began to lack the political convictions of the New Left and the artistic core of the Beats, instead becoming overrun with newcomers lacking any purpose other than obtaining drugs. It was an observation on the 1960s' counterculture that Thompson would further examine in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and other articles. By late 1967, Thompson and his family moved back to Colorado and rented a house in Woody Creek, a small mountain hamlet outside Aspen. In early 1969, Thompson finally received a 15,000 royalty check for the paperback sales of Hell's Angels and used two-thirds of the money for a down payment on a modest home and property where he would live for the rest of his life. He named the house Owl Farm and often described it as his \\"fortified compound.\\" In early 1968, Thompson signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. According to Thompson's letters and his later writings, at this time he planned to write a book called The Joint Chiefs about \\"the death of the American Dream.\\" He used a 6,000 advance from Random House to travel on the 1968 Presidential campaign trail and attend the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago for research purposes. From his hotel room in Chicago, Thompson watched the clashes between police and protesters, which he wrote had a great effect on his political views. The book was never finished, and the theme of the death of the American dream would be carried over into his later work. The contract with Random House was eventually fulfilled with the 1972 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. He also signed a deal with Ballantine Books in 1968 to write a satirical book called The Johnson File about Lyndon B. Johnson. A few weeks after the contract was signed, however, Johnson announced that he would not run for re-election, and the deal was cancelled.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: did he have any children?","output":"There is no direct mention of Thompson having children in the provided text."},{"instruction":"Information: - OpenWire is an open source dataflow programming library that extends the functionality of Embarcadero Delphi and C++ Builder by providing pin type component properties .

Born on December 7, 1910, in New Orleans, Louisiana, Louis Prima experienced considerable success in his career, spanning five decades. He was a well-known singer, trumpet player, and bandleader during the Swing Era, Big Band Era, and beyond. Born into a musical family, Prima was initially trained in the violin. However, he eventually discovered his passion for jazz and switched to the trumpet. By the age of 17, he started playing jazz professionally. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Prima made a name for himself in the music and entertainment industry. He had a unique performing style and a natural, charismatic stage presence. The Jungle Book, based on Rudyard Kipling's stories, follows the life and adventures of Mowgli, a human boy raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. In the film, King Louie is a comical character who rules over a kingdom of apes and desires to learn the secret of \\"man's red fire.\\" When Disney's songwriting team, Richard and Robert Sherman, were tasked with creating music for the film, they decided that King Louie required a jazz-based musical number. They thus specifically approached Louis Prima to lend his voice and style to the character. Prima gladly accepted the offer, and the Sherman Brothers crafted the delightful and catchy \\"I Wan'na Be Like You\\" song, which has become a quintessential element of King Louie's identity. Louis Prima's swing/jazz style and engaging voice turned King Louie into a truly memorable character. He infused the character with a playful, energetic, and lively demeanor that has essentially defined King Louie in the minds of audiences worldwide. Prima's performance as King Louie remains an iconic example of voice acting in the animated film industry, and the character continues to be cherished by generations of fans."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Therefore, I will expound on the significance of crafting concise sentences while also demonstrating the art of writing brief yet meaningful statements. Concision in writing is the art of conveying a message or idea with the least number of words possible, while still retaining clarity and meaning. This skill is particularly useful for capturing the reader's attention, maintaining their interest, and effectively communicating essential information. To craft a brief sentence, it is important to understand the purpose of concision and to apply specific techniques that can help to achieve the desired level of brevity. The significance of crafting concise sentences lies in their increased readability, improved comprehension, and overall effectiveness in delivering a strong message to the audience. When a writer is able to present their thoughts in a succinct manner, it not only saves the reader's time but also enables them to grasp the information quickly and fully comprehend the intended message. To write a brief sentence that retains meaning, one can consider the following tips and techniques: 1. Focus on the core message: Determine the primary idea you wish to convey and eliminate any unnecessary information. By concentrating on the central message, your sentence will efficiently communicate its meaning without unnecessary details. 2. Use strong, precise words: Choose words that accurately reflect the idea you want to communicate, and avoid vague or filler words such as \\"very\\" and \\"really.\\" Strong vocabulary can give your sentence impact and conciseness. 3. Utilize active voice: Writing in the active voice typically results in shorter, sharper sentences. Active sentences have the subject performing the action, ensuring that your writing remains clear and concise. 4. Avoid redundancy: Check for repetitive words or phrases within the sentence and eliminate any duplications. Removing redundancies can greatly shorten the sentence without compromising its meaning. An example of transforming a longer sentence into a concise one is as follows: - Original sentence: In order to preserve the integrity of their products, the company has made the decision to not utilize any form of artificial preservatives within their food items. - Brief and concise sentence: The company avoids artificial preservatives to maintain product integrity. In conclusion, crafting a brief sentence that is also meaningful involves focusing on the core message, using strong and precise words, employing active voice, and eliminating redundancies. Implementing these techniques will enable any writer to deliver a concise sentence that effectively communicates the intended information and captures the reader's attention."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Practice being nude. Move your body in ways that make you feel good. Connect to a time when you felt accepting of yourself. Remember that you're your own worst critic.","output":"Title: Discovering Joy and Self-Acceptance Through Being Nude Hey little buddy! Today we're going to talk about a fun way to feel good and accept ourselves just the way we are. Have you ever noticed how sometimes we wear clothes to cover our bodies, but other times we don't (like when we take a bath or shower)? Well, there's a special secret in being comfortable without clothes on, and that's what we're going to explore! 1. Practicing Being Nude When you're not wearing any clothes, it's called being nude. To feel comfortable and happy in our bodies, we can practice spending some time without our clothes on. Just like how we practiced learning to tie our shoes or ride a bike, this can take a bit of time and effort, but it's worth it. Make sure you are in a private space, like your bedroom or the bathroom, where no one else is around, and make sure it's okay with your grown-up before trying this. 2. Moving Your Body Now that we're practicing being nude, it's time to move our bodies in ways that make us feel good! We can dance to our favorite songs, stretch like we're superheroes, or even jump around like we're on a big trampoline. This helps us connect with our bodies and have fun without any clothes on. 3. Connecting to a Time When You Felt Accepting of Yourself Sometimes, we might remember a time when we felt really good about ourselves, like when we learned to swim or when we got a big hug from someone we love. It's important to think about those happy times and bring that feeling back to help us accept our bodies just the way they are. 4. Remember, You're Your Own Worst Critic You know how sometimes you might be worried about getting a question wrong in class, or think that your drawing isn't as good as your friend's? Well, that's because we can all be our own worst critics. We often judge ourselves harsher than anyone else would. When we're nude, it's important to remember that nobody is judging you or expecting you to be perfect. We can choose to be kind to ourselves and love our bodies just as they are. By practicing being nude, moving our bodies, connecting to happy memories, and remembering to be kind to ourselves, we can discover the joy and self-acceptance that comes from being comfortable in our own skin. Remember, it's okay to try new things and learn about yourself and your body. The most important thing is to be kind to yourself and love who you are."},{"instruction":"The air exploded in a flash of bone and steel and blood. The clash of metal rang through the forest.

Painted by the renowned Italian artist, Leonardo da Vinci, this captivating piece is recognized as one of the most famous and iconic artworks in the world. The Mona Lisa is often praised for the mysterious smile of its subject, its subtle colors, and the masterful technique used by Leonardo in his portrayal of Lisa. The portrait is thought to have been painted between 1503 and 1506, though some experts argue that it may have been created as late as 1517. Regardless, its creation took place during the Renaissance period in Italy, which was marked by a resurgence in art, culture, and learning. The Mona Lisa is a prime example of the prominence of individualism and humanism during this time, as it not only showcases the subject's physical beauty but also her character and emotions. The Mona Lisa has attracted numerous theories and speculations over the years. Some people have questioned the identity of the subject, others have pondered the meaning behind her enigmatic smile, and some have even identified hidden symbols within the work. One widely accepted theory is that the portrait is of Lisa del Giocondo (maiden name Gherardini), who was a Florentine woman and wife to a wealthy merchant named Francesco del Giocondo. This is supported by the fact that the painting is often referred to as “La Gioconda” in Italian, meaning “the joyful one,” which could either be a play on her last name or a reference to her disposition. The Mona Lisa's fame can be attributed to the intricacies of both its subject and its creation. Leonardo da Vinci employed a technique called sfumato in his painting, which involves the blurring of lines and colors to create a gradual transition between different elements. This allowed him to achieve an astonishing level of detail and depth, especially in the subject's facial expression and the landscape visible in the background. Another draw to the Mona Lisa is its rich history and the various events it has endured throughout the centuries. The portrait has been stolen, vandalized, and targeted for destruction on several occasions, but it has always survived to be restored and admired by millions. Napoleon Bonaparte even famously hung the painting in his bedroom for a time, further solidifying its status as a coveted work of art. Today, the Mona Lisa resides in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, where it holds a position of honor and captivates the millions of visitors who travel to see it each year. It stands as a testament to Leonardo da Vinci's mastery of painting, as well as an example of the enduring nature of art, as it continues to intrigue and provoke thought centuries after its creation."},{"instruction":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Will reducing the amount of CFCs released into the atmosphere increase or decrease ozone depletion? Factories around the world produce lots of CFCs which deplete the ozone layer. One year a large number of these factories decided they would implement efforts to reduce the amount of CFCs they release into the atmosphere. As a result the depletion of the ozone layer greatly decreased. However, the companies realized that this was hurting profits too much and reverted their decision. As a result the ozone layer began to rapidly deplete again. Hint: Beginning in the late 1970’s, ozone depletion was recognized as a significant environmental issue. The most dramatic decrease in ozone occurs seasonally over the continent of Antarctica. The size and duration of the ozone hole steadily increased, with the largest hole recorded in 2006. Fortunately, most countries have recognized the danger of CFCs and dramatically curtailed their use in recent years. It is hoped that ozone depletion will slow and that the ozone layer may eventually be restored to its earlier levels.

In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men.

Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

Next, evenly pipe or spread the frosting onto each cupcake with an offset spatula or piping bag to create a base, ensuring the surface is smooth and ready for decoration. To form the bunny ears, gently press two white or pastel-colored marshmallow cut diagonally in half onto the top of each frosted cupcake, adhering the sticky side to the frosting; optionally, you may use a thin layer of frosting to firmly attach the marshmallows. For added detail, dip the marshmallow halves' cut sides into a bowl filled with pastel-colored or white sanding sugar, providing a sparkling and textured finish to the bunny ears. To create the bunny's face, use round or oval-shaped candies such as chocolate chips, M&Ms, or jelly beans for the eyes and nose, gently pressing them into the frosting to ensure they stay in place. For the whiskers, you can use thin licorice strings, candy-coated chocolate sticks, or even edible sprinkles that lay horizontally across the bunny's face, adding three whiskers on each side. You may also add a cute little smile by drawing a semi-circle or inverted 'U' shape just below the nose, using a toothpick to etch it into the frosting or a small squeeze tube of ready-made decorative icing. For a finishing touch, consider adding a cute marshmallow or candy tail at the bottom center of the bunny's face or, alternatively, a small bowtie just below the head made from thinly rolled, colored fondant or a small, ribbon-shaped candy piece.

Premise: The individual is unable to imagine themselves simply being at home, despite having a variety of interests and pursuits they would like to undertake. Hypothesis: The individual would want to work on their sewing if they were at home. Now, let's evaluate their connection. The premise suggests that the person has multiple interests and things they would like to pursue, but it does not explicitly mention sewing or any other specific hobby. It only conveys a general idea that there are various fields the person is interested in. The premise, therefore, leaves room for the hypothesis to be true (if sewing is indeed one of those interests), false, or simply irrelevant. The hypothesis, on the other hand, talks about a particular interest - sewing. It suggests that if the person were at home, they would want to work on sewing. While the hypothesis is specific, it does not directly negate the premise. In essence, one could still have many interests and desire to work on sewing when at home. Given the information, we cannot discern if sewing is one of the mentioned interests in the premise. However, it is possible that sewing could be included as one of those numerous interests. In conclusion, the hypothesis is not necessarily entailed by the premise, but it does not contradict it either. The hypothesis could be true, false, or irrelevant based on the unknown interests of the individual. The relationship between the two statements is indefinite, and we'd need more information about the individual's interests to establish a clearer connection."},{"instruction":"Earth processes have not changed over time.

Hypothesis: A girl rides her bike through the city streets. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Given the premise, which is \\"A girl with extended arms goes down a slide,\\" we cannot directly conclude the hypothesis, \\"A girl rides her bike through the city streets.\\" The two statements involve different actions and contexts. Let's examine each statement in detail and evaluate their connection. Premise: \\"A girl with extended arms goes down a slide.\\" This statement depicts a scenario where a girl is playing on a slide, extending her arms in the process. This could be for various reasons, such as balancing herself or experiencing the thrill associated with sliding. The setting of this premise is most likely a playground or an area with recreational facilities for children. Hypothesis: \\"A girl rides her bike through the city streets.\\" This statement describes a different scenario in which a girl is riding a bicycle through the city streets. It implies that she is traversing an urban location using a two-wheeled vehicle as a means of transportation. There could be several purposes for this action, such as commuting from one place to another, exercising, or simply enjoying an outdoor activity. As we can see, both the premise and hypothesis describe unrelated activities and settings. The premise involves sliding, while the hypothesis involves bicycle riding. The locations are also different; the premise suggests a playground, and the hypothesis implies an urban setting. It is essential to note that while both scenarios involve a girl engaging in some form of physical activity, the two situations are distinct and separate. It is not possible to infer one from the other, and therefore, we cannot conclude the hypothesis based solely on the information provided in the premise. They could be seen as isolated events in the girl's life, existing independently of each other. In conclusion, based on the premise, \\"A girl with extended arms goes down a slide,\\" we cannot arrive at the hypothesis, \\"A girl rides her bike through the city streets.\\" While both situations involve a girl participating in physical activities, they represent separate events, distinct actions, and unrelated locations. To conclude the hypothesis from the premise, we would require more information or a connection between the two scenarios, which is not present in this case."},{"instruction":"Does \\"air\\" mean the same thing in these two sentences?

Hotshot ensign Alan Drake, fresh from the flying academy at Pensacola, Florida, gets off to a bad start with the pilots of an elite squadron, nicknamed the \\"Hellcats\\", to which he has been posted in San Diego. Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\". Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed. Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but no further testing is allowed until Commander Gary's return. Banning had been a childhood friend of Lorna Gary, and is not her first friend to die. She sinks into a deep depression. She also knows that Gary will expect her to hide her feelings and carry on, something that is very much not in her nature. Drake, appreciating the help the Garys gave him when he arrived, visits her at her home, and convinces her she should not suffer alone. They go for walks, drives, and tennis; he amuses her with jokes. Finally, at a restaurant she reaches for his hand and in doing so realizes she is falling for him. She quickly breaks away, and says she cannot see him any more.

She states that she comes from a workhouse in this same slum, and we establish that she is one of the few cops who care what happens to these people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap. Lilly finds a small boy who witnesses one attack, and tells her that a Brother was responsible. As the police don't want to panic the city, the string of murders is explained away as being the result of an outbreak of the rampant influenza virus.

We will do this by subtracting 60 from both sides: 12*x + 60 - 60 = 0 - 60 This simplifies to: 12*x = -60 Step 3: To find out what x is, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 12: 12*x / 12 = -60 / 12 This simplifies to: x = -5 And there's our answer! x is -5 in this equation."},{"instruction":"Text: The pressure-gradient force is the force which results when there is a difference in pressure across a surface. In general, a pressure is a force per unit area, across a surface. A difference in pressure across a surface then implies a difference in force, which can result in an acceleration according to Newton's second law of motion, if there is no additional force to balance it. The resulting force is always directed from the region of higher-pressure to the region of lower-pressure. When a fluid is in an equilibrium state (i.e. there are no net forces, and no acceleration), the system is referred to as being in hydrostatic equilibrium. In the case of atmospheres, the pressure gradient force is balanced by the gravitational force, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium. In Earth's atmosphere, for example, air pressure decreases at altitudes above Earth's surface, thus providing a pressure gradient force which counteracts the force of gravity on the atmosphere. Question: with regard to the pressure gradient force air will always move from low to high pressure?","output":"Imagine you have two balloons, one big and one small. The big balloon has more air inside, so it has higher pressure, and the small balloon has less air, so it has lower pressure. Now, imagine connecting these two balloons with a tiny straw. The air will want to move from the big balloon (high pressure) to the small balloon (low pressure) to try and balance things out. This is how the pressure-gradient force works! So, to answer your question, with regard to the pressure gradient force, air will always want to move from high pressure to low pressure, not the other way around."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"THIS IS A GREAT APP!\\" A:","output":"4"},{"instruction":"Given the following context: After the band released two slow-paced albums in a row, R.E.M.'s 1994 album Monster was, as Buck said, \\"a 'rock' record, with the rock in quotation marks.\\" In contrast to the sound of its predecessors, the music of Monster consisted of distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s glam rock. Like Out of Time, Monster topped the charts in both the US and UK. The record sold about nine million copies worldwide. The singles \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" and \\"Bang and Blame\\" were the band's last American Top 40 hits, although all the singles from Monster reached the Top 30 on the British charts. Warner Bros. assembled the music videos from the album as well as those from Automatic for the People for release as Parallel in 1995.In January 1995, R.E.M. set out on its first tour in six years. The tour was a huge commercial success, but the period was difficult for the group. On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm was only the beginning of a series of health problems that plagued the Monster tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a hernia. Despite all the problems, the group had recorded the bulk of a new album while on the road. The band brought along eight-track recorders to capture its shows, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album. The final three performances of the tour were filmed at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia and released in home video form as Road Movie.R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros.

Verify whether the USS Missouri was present at the specified location: The USS Missouri (BB-63) was indeed present at Pearl Harbor, but we need to determine the time frame to verify if it existed there during the relevant time. 4. Establish the relevant time frame: As the given statement doesn't specify a time frame, we'll consider the two primary periods of importance for Pearl Harbor: the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and the later time when the USS Missouri was added to the U.S. Navy fleet. 5. Examine the history of the USS Missouri: The USS Missouri was commissioned on June 11, 1944, which is a significant time after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Therefore, it was not present at Pearl Harbor during the attack. 6. Check whether the USS Missouri was ever stationed in Pearl Harbor: The USS Missouri was indeed stationed at Pearl Harbor, but this happened after World War II. Given these findings, the statement \\"The USS Missouri existed at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, HI.\\" can be considered true, as the USS Missouri was stationed there after World War II.

There may be a possibility that she wears a pink dress, but it is not a logical conclusion based solely on the information at hand. This is because the first statement captures three main elements: a young blond girl, her emotional state (looking unsure), and her activity (feeding colorful birds outside). The girl's appearance: The statement \\"Young blond girl\\" illuminates two characteristics of the central figure in this scenario — she's \\"young\\" and \\"blond.\\" Her emotional condition: The phrase \\"looks unsure\\" indicates the emotional state of the young girl. It tells us that she does not appear completely comfortable or certain in her current situation.

Moreover, we understand the setting of this action is occurring outside and that the birds are colorful. However, no information about her clothing, and specifically, the color of her dress, has been provided here. Logically, one can't infer something that has not been previously introduced or suggested in the prior premise.

He would later establish the Seljuq Sultanate after conquering Persia and retaking the Abbasid capital of Baghdad from the Buyid dynasty in 1055. Tughril relegated the Abbasid Caliphs to state figureheads and took command of the caliphate's armies in military offensives against the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimid Caliphate in an effort to expand his empire's borders and unite the Islamic world. - Middle Persian is the Middle Iranian language or ethnolect of southwestern Iran that during the Sasanian Empire (224654) became a prestige dialect and so came to be spoken in other regions of the empire as well.

Grandson of al-Muqtadir, he was chosen in place of the deposed Caliph, at-Ta'i, his cousin. Banished from the capital, Baghdad, earlier, he was now recalled and appointed to the office he had long desired. He held the Caliphate for 40 years. It was during his Caliphate that Mahmud of Ghazni arose, threatening the empire; and but for the conflicts that broke out in Mahmud's family upon his death, the Buwayhid kingdom, paralysed by damaging war, would have been swallowed. The global Muslim population had climbed to about 4 per cent as against the Christian population of 10 per cent by 1000. - Turquoise is an opaque, blue-to-green mineral that is a hydrated phosphate of copper and aluminium, with the chemical formula CuAl()(OH)·4.

The city was founded in the 3rd century by Shapur I as a Sasanian satrapy capital. Nishapur later became the capital of Tahirid dynasty and was reformed by Abdullah Tahir in 830, and was later selected as the capital of Seljuq dynasty by Tughril in 1037. From the Abbasid era to the Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran, the city evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center within the Islamic world. Nishapur, along with Merv, Herat and Balkh were one of the four great cities of Greater Khorasan and one of the greatest cities in the middle ages, a seat of governmental power in eastern of caliphate, a dwelling place for diverse ethnic and religious groups, a trading stop on commercial routes from Transoxiana and China, Iraq and Egypt. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages.

His mother, Melanie Leahy, said her talks with Essex Police suggested the cases had taken place in the last 17 years. The Essex NHS Trust said patient safety was a \\"top priority\\". Essex Police told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme it was \\"conducting initial enquiries into a number of deaths which have occurred at the Linden Centre since 2000\\". A full investigation may take place later depending on the outcome. Matthew Leahy was admitted to the Linden Centre in Chelmsford in 2012 aged 20, after his mental health problems had spiralled following cannabis use. He also suffered hallucinations. His mother Melanie said staff told her not to go to see her son for the first seven days, to \\"let him settle on the ward\\". A week later, she was called by a doctor who informed her that her son had hanged himself. She said he had told her in a text earlier that week he was \\"in hell\\". Two years later, an inquest concluded Mr Leahy had been subjected to a series of failings and missed opportunities over a long period of time. \\"Each patient supposedly has a care plan and it came to light that Matthew had no care plan,\\" Ms Leahy explained. \\"He had no key worker, no-one knew anything for two days. There wasn't even any observation sheets.\\" Following the inquest, the coroner suggested the trust hold a public inquiry into his death - but the trust said it would take funding away from front-line services. Ms Leahy said Essex Police had confirmed they were \\"still investigating my son's death but are also looking at... up to 20 patients, all who died by the same means\\". One nurse, who left the trust in mid-2016 after a decade and wished to remain anonymous, said ligature points - features in a room that can be used to kill oneself - had been identified \\"many years before\\" Mr Leahy's death but had not been resolved. \\"If you asked too many questions you were deemed as a troublemaker and things made difficult for you,\\" he said. The Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust said the history of serious incidents at the Linden Centre was of \\"great concern\\". It added it was \\"improving systems to ensure that investigations are carried out rigorously\\". During an inspection of the Linden Centre in August 2015 by the regulator, the CQC, inspectors reported that \\"one patient attempted to strangle themselves with a ligature\\". A year later they found safety was still a concern. \\"The trust must ensure that action is taken to remove identified ligature risks,\\" the report said. Last week, an inquest jury found that another patient, Richard Wade, died in May 2015 at the Linden Centre after staff failed to remove a dressing gown cord that he used to take his own life. Patient suicides have also taken place in other areas of the trust. In 2016, Melanie Lowe was admitted to hospital under the care of the trust after her mental health made her increasingly unstable. She took an overdose with pills from her own washbag, and - when admitted to hospital - remained on constant watch. But her observation levels were later downgraded form constant watch to the minimum level required. Ms Lowe took her own life, suffocating herself. At the inquest last November, the coroner heard evidence of a catalogue of mistakes. Lawyer Rachel Codd, representing Ms Lowe's family, said she had tried to abscond twice while on constant watch, but the locum psychiatrist who reassessed her upon admission did not have access to the observation notes. She added: \\"It seems quite concerning that the trust doesn't seem to be learning from previous mistakes.\\" Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

The movie stars Clive Owen as Mr. Smith, a mysterious loner with exceptional shooting skills, Monica Bellucci as Donna Quintano, a lactating prostitute, and Paul Giamatti as Hertz, the ruthless and determined villain. \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" pays homage to and parodies various action, crime, and thriller movies, blending excessive violence with tongue-in-cheek humor. Its plot revolves around Mr. Smith, who unexpectedly finds himself in the middle of a gunfight when he tries to save a pregnant woman from being killed. Despite his efforts, the woman dies, and Mr. Smith is left to protect her newborn baby from Hertz and his team of assassins. Donna Quintano becomes an inadvertent ally, using her maternal instincts and street smarts to help Mr. Smith keep the baby safe. One of the film's most distinctive features is its highly imaginative and ludicrously violent action sequences. Mr. Smith uses anything and everything as a weapon, including carrots, which he masterfully employs to kill several enemies. The movie's relentless pace, exaggerated fight scenes, and acrobatic gunplay are purposely overdone to create a sense of exhilaration and exuberance. In addition to its frenetic action, \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" is also notable for its quick-witted dialogue and biting humor, which further contribute to its send-up of the action genre. The film often pokes fun at action movie clichés and tropes, such as the calm, collected hitman or the seemingly invincible protagonist. By subverting these conventions, Michael Davis crafts a movie that serves as both a tribute to and a send-up of its cinematic predecessors. In conclusion, \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" is a 2007 film that parodies and celebrates the action genre with its extreme violence, outlandish combat scenes, and dark comedy. Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci, and Paul Giamatti deliver memorable performances as they navigate a world filled with over-the-top mayhem and dangerous assassins.

What is a possible side to this debate?","output":"A possible side to the debate on favoring multilateral aid could be arguing against it in favor of bilateral aid. My approach to developing this point would be: Step 1: Defining the key terms Before diving into different sides of the debate, it’s essential to establish clear definitions of multilateral aid and bilateral aid. Multilateral aid involves multiple countries and international organizations working together to distribute financial assistance to countries in need. Bilateral aid, on the other hand, is the direct assistance provided by one country to another, without including other international organizations or countries. Step 2: Identifying the pros and cons of bilateral aid Once the definitions are established, I would then proceed to list the advantages and disadvantages of bilateral aid in comparison to multilateral aid. Advantages of bilateral aid: - Direct control and oversight: Bilateral aid allows the donor country to have direct control over how the assistance is utilized and to ensure it aligns with the donor's strategic objectives. - Focused objectives: Bilateral aid can target specific projects or sectors within a recipient country, leading to tailored and potentially more efficient assistance. - Strengthened diplomatic relations: Bilateral aid can build and strengthen the relationship between the two countries involved. Disadvantages of bilateral aid: - Limited resources: The resources available through bilateral aid may be more limited compared to multilateral aid, which often receives funds from multiple sources. - Less expertise: Bilateral aid may lack the specialized expertise that international organizations involved in multilateral aid have to offer. - Potential political influence: There may be a concern that donor countries could use bilateral aid to advance their political agendas, potentially benefiting the donor more than the recipient. Step 3: Developing the argument With the advantages and disadvantages of bilateral aid outlined, I would then proceed to build the argument against favoring multilateral aid. This might involve emphasizing the significance of direct control and oversight, the value of having focused objectives, and the strengthening of diplomatic relationships among nations through bilateral aid. Step 4: Addressing potential counter-arguments Finally, I would anticipate possible counter-arguments in favor of multilateral aid, such as its ability to pool resources, achieve global cooperation, and diminish chances of political exploitation. In response, I would emphasize the need to strike a balance between bilateral and multilateral aid, arguing that a mix of both approaches can lead to more effective aid distribution and addressing humanitarian crises, depending on the specific context and objectives at hand."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Man in a black long-sleeve shirt jumping on what looks like a cliff.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A man is looking over the edge of a cliff while sitting.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage. The writer believes that: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - natural shampoos scent does not stay on the hair - chemical shampoos leave hair looking greasy - not enough information - natural shampoo is better for the skin but doesn't clean as well Answer:","output":"natural shampoo is better for the skin but doesn't clean as well"},{"instruction":"Q:This is a correct answer to the following question about Mousepad. Yes or no? Answer: A mousepad with a padded wrist rest. Question: what material is a mouse pad made out of? A:","output":"Your answer indicates a feature of a mouse pad, a padded wrist rest, rather than addressing the question being asked. The question refers to the material that a mouse pad is made out of, not its design or additional features. Now, let's discuss the details of materials used in mouse pads. Mouse pads come in various types, and each type uses different materials, but the most commonly used materials are: 1. Cloth: Cloth mouse pads are popular due to their comfort and ease of use. The top surface layer is usually made of soft fabric, such as cotton, polyester, or nylon, which provides good tracking for optical and laser mice. Underneath the fabric, there is ordinarily a cushioning material, which could be foam, rubber or gel, to provide comfort and ensure the pad stays in place. 2. Hard Plastic or Resin: Hardpad mousepads are designed for quicker movements due to the smooth surface offered by hard plastic, resin, or even aluminium materials. They are more durable compared to their cloth counterparts. 3. Rubber: Most mouse pads have a rubber underside. Rubber is used because of its non-slip characteristics, ensuring the mouse pad remains stable during use. 4. Metal: Metal mousepads, often made of aluminium, are chosen for their sleek look and longevity. They offer a smooth surface and are easy to clean. 5. Glass: Although less common, glass mouse pads do exist. These pads offer excellent precision and quick movement. 6. Leather: Leather mouse pads provide a luxurious feel and aesthetic appeal. They are typically more expensive and require more care than other types of mouse pads. As for the padded wrist rests - they are typically filled with gel or memory foam to provide comfort to the user. They help to reduce wrist strain and discomfort during prolonged computer use. These wrist rests can be part of the mouse pad or can be purchased separately. So, in response to the initial question - a mouse pad can be made from a variety of materials, including cloth, rubber, hard plastic or resin, metal, glass, and even leather. Therefore, the answer 'A mousepad with a padded wrist rest' doesn't address the question 'what material is a mouse pad made out of?' accurately. You might answer it correctly next time like this: \\"A mouse pad can be made out of a variety of materials including but not limited to rubber, cloth, hard plastic, resin, metal, glass, or leather.\\""},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: yeah there's no see the humidity up here too is really bad in the summertime it's really bad it can be seventy five eighty outside but the humidity runs up ninety ninety five percent and boy your just like you're in an oven roasting i'll tell you Sentence 2: The humidity where you are is not as bad as here.

After serving 8 years of a 10-to-25-year sentence for second-degree murder, the doctor walked out of the Lakeland Correctional Facility in Coldwater, Mich., and into the predictable media frenzy. He had only a few offhand, characteristically vinegary remarks for the legions of reporters and camera crews on the scene, but there will be all manner of TV appearances and news conferences in the days and weeks to come, one may be sure. Seventy-nine and not in the best of health himself, Dr. Kevorkian returns on parole to a society that still hasn’t figured out what to do about one of the great unintended consequences of modern science: The growing number of people with profound illnesses whose death can be staved off indefinitely but whose suffering and misery, physical or psychic or both, cannot be meaningfully relieved. The law, medical ethics, religious teachings and the gut feelings of the average Joe or Joan can all be in wildly different places on what’s right and what’s wrong in such cases. It’s fairly well settled that any mentally competent person has the right to refuse medical treatment, even life-saving treatment, and “let nature take its course.” But there is much more widespread disagreement about helping nature along — and that’s the fault line where Dr. Kevorkian stands. When the patient does it himself or herself, say by using the machine Dr. Kevorkian invented, it seems most people would call that suicide — a sin in most religions, but generally not a crime. If anyone else lifts a finger to actively help, even a compassionate doctor whose patient has begged for the help and has no other hope of relief, 49 of the 50 states call that homicide, a stance that the Supreme Court found to be constitutional in two 1997 cases. Oregon is the exception, with a law expressly allowing physicians to assist suicide in certain circumstances, which was passed by referendum in 1994, survived a repeal referendum and has likewise been upheld in the courts. Dr. K’s own sojourns in the legal system have been similarly mixed. As one writer on the subject, Ronald Standler, has pointed out, as long as he listened to good legal advice, Dr. Kevorkian managed to stay out of jail while helping more than 100 people slip the mortal coil at a time of their choosing. Only when he decided to represent himself in court was he convicted and imprisoned. He’s promised not to assist suicides any more; he seems unlikely to want to break parole and go back to jail. But his views on the issue haven’t changed, his associates say, and we’ll doubtless be hearing him expound them quite a bit now that he’s back in circulation.

So as journalists were invited to the Science Media Centre in London to hear how the worldwide rise in temperatures has stalled, the mercury shot up as if on cue to record the hottest day of the year so far. In many ways, this event was long overdue: climate sceptics have for years pointed out that the world is not warming as rapidly as once forecast. A lot depends on how you do the measurements, of course. Each of the last few decades has been warmer than the last. But start your graph in 1998 - which happened to be an exceptionally warm year - and there hasn't been much global warming at all. Gradually the words 'pause' and 'hiatus' which first featured in the blogs have crossed to the media and then to the scientists professionally engaged in researching the global climate. The headline - which the scientists will not thank me for - is that no one is really sure why the rate of warming has stumbled. There are plenty of possible explanations but none of them adds up to a definitive smoking gun. Professor Piers Forster of Leeds University has tried to quantify the different factors involved - what's known as their \\"radiative forcing\\". Between 1998-2012, he reckons, manmade greenhouse gases were still the biggest influence, causing warming of 0.48 of a Watt per square metre (a key measure of energy flows to and from the planet). At the same, he estimates, two other natural influences might have led to some cooling: a relatively quiet Sun might have been responsible for a reduction of 0.16 of a Watt/sq m and volcanic eruptions another 0.06 Watt/sq m. A big unknown is the effect of aerosols - tiny particles released by industrial pollution which could cause a further cooling effect. It is thought that the world's massive industrialisation after World War Two contributed to a slight drop in global temperatures in the late 1940s. But the key factor - according to all the speakers at the briefing - is that whatever solar energy is making it through to the surface, much is being absorbed by the hidden depths of the oceans. The Argo network of automated monitors has been deployed since 2005 to measure the waters as deep as 1,800m. This isn't a very long period but the data are apparently showing some warming - even in this short time frame. And readings from satellites since 2000 show how much energy is arriving at the planet, and how much is leaving, so if the energy left behind is not manifesting itself in rising surface temperatures, then it must be going somewhere - and the deep ocean is the most plausible explanation. On top of that, the scientists say, pauses in warming were always to be expected. This is new - at least to me. It is common sense that climate change would not happen in a neat, linear away but instead in fits and starts. But I've never heard leading researchers mention the possibility before. Professor Rowan Sutton, of Reading University, said computer simulations or models of possible future climate scenarios often show periods of ten years with no warming trend - some even show pauses of 20-25 years. And Professor Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office Hadley Centre, said observations and models showed that on average there were - or would be - two pauses in warming every century. I asked why this had not come up in earlier presentations. No one really had an answer, except to say that this \\"message\\" about pauses had not been communicated widely. So where does this leave us, as greenhouse gases emissions keep rising but the temperature does not? Dr Peter Stott, of the Met Office, pointed out that 12 of the 14 warmest years have occurred since the year 2000 and says that other indicators - like the decline in Arctic sea ice of 12.9% per decade and losses of snow cover and glaciers - still point to a process of manmade warming. But what about another possibility - that the calculations are wrong? What if the climate models - which are the very basis for all discussions of what to do about global warming - exaggerate the sensitivity of the climate to rising carbon dioxide? Dr Stott conceded that the projections showing the most rapid warming now look less likely, given recent observations, but that others remain largely unchanged. A Met Office briefing document, released at the briefing, says that, even allowing for the temperatures of the last decade, the most likely warming scenario is only reduced by 10% - so \\"the warming that we might have expected by 2050 would be delayed by only a few years\\". Overall, it concludes, the pause \\"does not materially alter the risks of substantial warming of the Earth by the end of this century.\\" In other words, global warming is still on. But until the pause can be properly explained, many people will take a lot of convincing - especially if the pause lasts longer than expected. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article discusses the worldwide stall in the rise of temperatures, which has led to a pause or hiatus in global warming. Despite this stall, each of the last few decades has been warmer than the last. The cause of this rate stagnation in warming is unknown, with numerous possible explanations but no definitive answer. Factors that could contribute to the pause include manmade greenhouse gases, natural influences such as a dormant sun, volcanic eruptions, and the effect of aerosols. The article highlights the significant role of oceans in absorbing solar energy, resulting in hidden depths of warming. Additionally, the article mentions that pauses in warming were always expected, not happening in a perfectly linear manner but rather in fits and starts. Computer simulations often show periods of 10 to 25 years with no warming trend. Even as temperatures stall, other indicators such as the decline of Arctic sea ice, losses of snow cover, and glaciers point to a process of manmade warming. The article concludes that global warming is still happening, and the pause does not radically alter the risks of substantial warming by the end of the century.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","output":"He has to stand aside from himself and observe the chief events of his life with philosophic detachment. The above sentence emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and stepping back from one's own experiences to gain a deeper understanding of one's life. The ability to look at one's life from a detached, philosophical perspective is crucial for personal growth and self-awareness. Developing a sense of philosophic detachment requires an individual to approach their experiences with a willingness to analyze them objectively and without getting lost in their emotions or biases. By exploring the chief events of one's life through this lens, an individual can foster more profound personal insights, and potentially, draw valuable conclusions from past experiences. Additionally, engaging in regular self-reflection can gradually help individuals build their capacity for empathy. As individuals become more adept at understanding their emotions and experiences, they can also become more attuned to the emotions, feelings, and perspectives of others. There are several ways to practice self-reflection and develop a sense of philosophical detachment: 1. Journaling: Writing about one's experiences, thoughts, and emotions can help individuals process their feelings and gain a better understanding of their actions and choices. 2. Meditation and mindfulness: Engaging in mindfulness exercises or meditating regularly can help individuals become more aware of their thoughts and emotions, allowing them to step back and observe their experiences with greater detachment. 3. Reading philosophy or self-help books: Reading works by philosophers, psychologists, and other experts can provide valuable insights into the human experience and help individuals gain a deeper understanding of their own lives. 4. Engaging in open and honest conversations: Talking with trusted friends, family members, or therapists can help individuals gain a new perspective on their experiences and assess them more objectively. 5. Practicing self-compassion: Being kind and understanding towards oneself when processing past experiences and regrets is essential to create a non-judgmental environment for self-reflection. In conclusion, cultivating a sense of philosophic detachment allows individuals to develop a deeper understanding of their lives by stepping back and analyzing their experiences objectively. Regular self-reflection, meditation, and engaging with philosophy can help foster this detachment, leading to personal growth, enhanced self-awareness, and heightened empathy for others."},{"instruction":"Test for natural language inference.

The breakup of the Abbasid dynasty meant that the Islamic world fragmented into smaller political states, some of which began expanding into Italy and Sicily, as well as over the Pyrenees into the southern parts of the Frankish kingdoms.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"In the context of the breakup of the Carolingian Empire and the numerous invasions, migrations, and raids that occurred during this period, the specific event that happened 45 years before the year 1000 would be in the year 955. This was the year of the decisive Battle of Lechfeld, a critical event that shaped the course of European history. During the 9th and 10th centuries, Europe underwent significant changes and challenges due to political fragmentation and external threats. The once-powerful Carolingian Empire, which was founded by the legendary Charlemagne, began to crumble under the weight of internal strife and external pressures. This fragmentation led to the rise of smaller, regional powers that attempted to exert control over their territories and defend against foreign invaders. One of the most pressing threats during this time were the Magyars, a nomadic people originally from the Ural region, who migrated to the Carpathian Basin (present-day Hungary) in the late 9th century. The Magyars were skilled horsemen and fierce warriors, known for their lightning-fast raids against the eastern parts of the Frankish kingdoms, particularly Germany and Italy. They were feared for their ability to strike quickly and then disappear, often causing significant damage and instilling a sense of terror in the local populations. The Battle of Lechfeld, which took place in August 955, was a turning point in the struggle against the Magyar invasions. The battle unfolded near the Lech River in present-day southern Germany, a strategic location that allowed the East Frankish King Otto I (also known as Otto the Great) to finally confront the Magyars in a decisive engagement. Otto, the future founder of the Holy Roman Empire, managed to assemble a formidable force that included troops from various Eastern Frankish territories, making it a combined and well-organized army. During the Battle of Lechfeld, Otto's forces successfully routed the Magyar army, causing significant casualties and putting an end to their continuous raids in Western Europe. This victory marked a turning point in European history, as it bolstered Otto's authority and solidified the foundation of the Holy Roman Empire. Furthermore, it halted the Magyars' expansion and eventually led to their Christianization and integration into the surrounding European cultures. The aftermath of the Battle of Lechfeld had lasting implications on the political landscape of Europe. With the Magyar threat neutralized, the Eastern Frankish Kingdom (later the Holy Roman Empire) was able to focus on consolidating its power and territories. Meanwhile, the emergence of regional powers and external threats, such as the Viking incursions and the Islamic expansion, continued to shape the borders and political dynamics of Europe during the Middle Ages. In conclusion, the year 955, which is 45 years before the year 1000, is historically significant due to the Battle of Lechfeld. This conflict represented a crucial turning point in the struggle against the Magyar invasions, ultimately contributing to the rise of the Holy Roman Empire and the stabilization of European politics during a tumultuous period in history."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

On 8 February she entered McMurdo Sound and later that day anchored in a spot near its southern limit which was afterwards christened Winter Quarters Bay.

Scott had decided that the expedition should continue to live and work aboard ship, and he allowed Discovery to be frozen into the sea ice, leaving the main hut to be used as a storeroom and shelter.Of the entire party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any experience with dog-sledges. The results of the men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. In their attempts to find safer ground, one of the group, Able Seaman George Vince, slid over the edge of a cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at the summit of the Hut Point promontory.During the winter months of May–August the scientists were busy in their laboratories, while elsewhere equipment and stores were prepared for the next season's work.

Van Winkle has never known his biological father; he was given the family name of the Dutch man his mother was married to at the time of his birth. When Van Winkle was four, his mother divorced. Afterward, he grew up moving between Dallas and Miami, where his new stepfather worked at a car dealership. Context: In 1985, he was focusing all of his energy on motocross, winning three championships. After breaking his ankle during a race, Ice was not interested in racing professionally for some time, using his spare time to perfect his dance moves and creating his own while his ankle was healing. Ice used his beatboxing and breakdancing skills as a street performer with his friends at local malls during this time. One evening he visited City Lights, a South Dallas nightclub, where he was dared to go on stage by his friend Squirrel during an open-mic. He won the crowd over and was asked by City Lights manager John Bush if he wanted to perform regularly, which he accepted. Ice would be joined on stage with his disc jockey D-Shay and Zero as well as Earthquake, the local disc jockey at City Lights. The Vanilla Ice Posse or The V.I.P. would also perform with Ice on stage. As a performer for City Lights, Ice opened up for N.W.A, Public Enemy, The D.O.C., Tone Loc, 2 Live Crew, Paula Abdul, Sinbad and MC Hammer. In January 1987, Ice was stabbed five times during a scuffle outside of City Lights. After spending ten days at the hospital, Ice signed a contract with the owner of City Lights, Tommy Quon and his management company, Ultrax. Two years later, Ice would open for EPMD, Ice-T, Stetsasonic, and Sir Mix-A-Lot on the Stop the Violence Tour. Quon saw commercial potential in Ice's rapping and dancing skills. Buying studio time with Quon's earnings from City Lights, they recorded songs that had been perfected on stage by Ice and his acquaintances with various producers, including Khayree. The two year production was distributed by an independent record company called Ichiban Records in 1989. \\"Play That Funky Music\\" was released as the album's first single, with \\"Ice Ice Baby\\" appearing as the B-side. Tommy Quon personally sent out the single to various radio stations around the US, but the single was seldom played and when it was, it did not get the reaction Quon was hoping for. When disc jockey Darrell Jaye in Georgia played \\"Ice Ice Baby\\" instead of the single's A-side, the song gained a quick fanbase and other radio stations followed suit. Quon financed 8,000 for the production of a music video for \\"Ice Ice Baby\\", which received heavy airplay by The Box, increasing public interest in the song. Following the success of \\"Ice Ice Baby\\", record producer Suge Knight and two bodyguards arrived at The Palm in West Hollywood, where Ice was eating. After shoving Ice's bodyguards aside, Knight and his own bodyguards sat down in front of Ice, staring at him before finally asking \\"How you doin'?\\" Similar incidents were repeated on several occasions. Eventually, Knight showed up at Ice's hotel suite on the fifteenth floor of the Bel Age Hotel, accompanied by a member of the Los Angeles Raiders football team. According to Ice, Knight took him out on the balcony by himself, and implied that he would throw him off the balcony unless he signed the publishing rights to the song over to Knight; Knight used Ice's money to help fund Death Row Records. Question: did he sign contract with any company. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Robert Matthew Van Winkle, also known as Vanilla Ice, signed a contract with Tommy Quon, the owner of City Lights nightclub, and his management company, Ultrax.

Very exciting start to the 35th Marine Corps Marathon Weekend earlier this morning when the Health and Fitness Expo opened at the Washington Convention Center. Lots of activities and events around \\"The People's Marathon\\" and Art and I are happy to answer questions to make everyone's experience even better. McLean, Va.: So what should we be wearing on Sunday? By 8 a.m., will it be warm enough for shorts and short sleeves? I remember all of the gloves tossed on the ground last year. On the course, are there places (like the water stations) where it's okay to drop a layer of clothing? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: Runners should dress for cold dark early morning arrival at MCM. Sunrise is usually around 7:10 a.m. We will have UPS trucks in Runners Village for runners to check their bags and then pick up at finish. Recommend if cold, stay in clothing as long as you deem necessary. Some shed at the start...others in Runners Village at the trucks. Arlington, Va.: Can you elaborate on the tracking of runners during the race? This year there are no text message; rather, an iPhone/Android app. No one I know that is running can explain to me how exactly it will work. Do you still collect position information at each mile via shoe tags, or do you have to carry the phone during the marathon to use its GPS function? The latter seems onerous; however, the Web site says the new system uses GPS and you need a device to get \\"full functionality.\\" I expect this to be a major friction point on Sunday, so can you clarify the situation? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: The MCM collects split time data every 5k and will be live on the website. The timing device is on the reverse side of the bib. THe iPhone app is a GPS tracking program to locate runner and spectator. Both parties require the app and phone. Harrisburg, Pa.: Are you familiar with the diet being mentioned by Don Imus that suggests that a diet free of sugar may be good. What are your thoughts on a totally sugar free diet?

XOXOART Are you running on a daily basis to prepare for the marathon? How many miles per day? Do you give yourself days off? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: I ran at least 3-8 miles a day and some days I bike. Also, give myself 1 day off a week.

Art, how did you plan out your training schedule? And how did you find time in your busy schedule for it? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: My health guru Az Ferguson, Game On Diet, set-up my running schedule. YOu can find Az on Facebook. He's the best!

XOART D.C.: What time should runners get into their corrals? I like to do a little job about 15 minutes before racing, but wonder if that's possible in such a big race. Also, with the recent course modification, is this year's MCM still certified as a full 26.2 miles? Thanks! Marc Goldman and Art Smith: We recommend moving up to ROute 110 around 7 a.m. JOgging space is availble in Pentagon Parking Lot. Course change is just a step onto the curb instead of on the street.

Title: Burn After Reading Movie plot: Faced with a demotion at work due to a drinking problem, Osbourne Cox angrily quits his job as a CIA analyst and resolves to write a memoir about his life and career. When his pediatrician wife Katie finds out, she sees it as a justifiable opportunity to file for divorce and continue her adulterous affair unimpeded. Taking her lawyer's advice, she copies financial records and several other files from her husband's computer onto a CD. These files contain a rambling, meaningless diatribe by Cox on purported CIA activities. When the CD gets left on the locker room floor of Hardbodies, a local gym, by a careless law firm employee, it falls into the hands of dim-witted personal trainer Chad Feldheimer and his co-worker Linda Litzke, who mistakenly believe the numerical data in the Coxes' bank records, and especially, Cox's diatribes, to be highly sensitive government information. After getting the data traced back to Osbourne, who thinks his memoirs have been stolen, Chad and Linda plan to give the disc back to him for a reward, with Linda planning to use the money to pay for plastic surgery. When a phone call and subsequent meeting with Osbourne provoke a furious reaction and go horribly wrong, Chad and Linda turn over the disc to the Russian embassy, offering more information in return for monetary compensation. With no other data to give them, Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Coxes' home to get more files from their computer. Meanwhile, Osbourne's increasingly erratic behavior, aggravated in part by his encounters with Chad and Linda, prompt Katie to move ahead with the divorce proceedings. She changes the locks on their house, forcing Osbourne to move onto the sailboat they have docked on the Chesapeake Bay. With her husband out of the picture, Katie invites her lover, Harry Pfarrer, to move in. A womanizing, multi-adulterous deputy U.S. Marshal, Harry is coincidentally also secretly seeing Linda. Harry finds Chad, whom Linda sent to find more files on Osbourne, hiding in a wardrobe in the Coxes' home,...

USA TODAY Tonya Harding arrives at the 75th annual Golden Globe Awards. (Photo: Jordan Strauss, Invision via AP) Allison Janney’s Golden Globe-winning portrayal of Tonya Harding’s mother in I Tonya included two constants: drinking and physical abuse of her star figure skater daughter. Harding’s real-life mother, LaVona \\"Sandy\\" Golden, however, told ABC News as part of a two-hour special that she neither consistently abused Harding and the scenes that showed her drinking while Harding skated as a child were inaccurate. “I didn’t abuse any of my children,” Golden said per part of the interview ABC News released ahead of Thursday’s show. “Spanked? Yes, (I) spanked. Absolutely, positively you (have) got to show them right from wrong.” Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story airs on ABC Thursday night (9 p.m. ET). Golden admitted one incident from the movie did occur. “I spanked her once with a hairbrush at a competition,” Golden said. Harding, however, said the abuse wasn’t isolated as Golden contends and the scene where Golden threw a steak knife that lodged in her arm indeed took place. “I was about 10 feet from her,” Harding told ABC News. “It was a steak knife.” Golden said the incident didn't happen. “Why would I throw a steak knife at anybody?” Golden said. “She’s lied so much she doesn’t know what isn’t a lie anymore.” As far as the drinking, Harding told ABC News that she knew at age 11 half a thermos her mother would take to the rink in the morning was filled with “brandy and the rest was coffee.” Golden said it wasn’t actually alcohol. “I would have coffee and sometimes I would put brandy flavoring in it,” Golden said. ||||| Former Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding said that her mother abused her throughout her childhood, including that she once threw a steak knife at her, and that any support from her mother came at an emotional price. “I don’t think that there was more than one day a week, sometimes, that I didn’t get beaten,” Harding told ABC's Amy Robach. But her mother, LaVona \\"Sandy\\" Golden, told ABC News that wasn't the case at all. “I didn’t abuse any of my children,” Golden said. “Spanked? Yes, [I] spanked. Absolutely, positively you [have] got to show them right from wrong.” ABC News Harding and her tumultuous relationship with her mother are receiving new attention in the movie, “I, Tonya,” which was inspired by Harding’s life and includes a scene in which Allison Janney, who plays Golden, throws a steak knife at Harding, played by actress Margot Robbie. Janney won a Golden Globe award Sunday night for her portrayal of Golden. Golden’s new ABC News interview is featured in the two-hour ABC News special “Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story.\\" LaVona Golden Tonya Harding was just 3 years old when she stepped out onto the ice for the first time, and her mother said she knew instantly that her daughter had a talent for figure skating. “Whatever the other people were doing, she turned around right behind them and did the same thing,” Golden said. “She wasn’t supposed to be able to do any of it, but she just went and did it.” “Tonya was my little dynamo,” she added. “I called her my little twinkle, my little star.” LaVona Golden Golden said Harding was the youngest of four children. Harding’s father is Golden’s third husband. She said the family had a modest life together. “Tonya herself called us trailer trash. We were never trailer trash. We had a beautiful new trailer,” Golden said. “We didn’t live in filth or dirt or anything that I would call unusual.” As her childhood progressed, Harding spent most of her days on the ice, practicing and in competitions. Her mother said that she worked overtime to pay for the sport’s expenses, like lessons, costumes and competition fees. LaVona Golden Golden said she had jobs as a waitress, a bartender and a cook, adding, “I was working right around the clock, morning, noon, and night, trying to get the money for her to skate and have lessons…. I had to work sometimes two and three jobs a day trying to make ends meet.” “My mother did pay for skating, but I worked at the rink for my ice time or I worked at the roller rink for my ice time,” Harding told ABC News’ Amy Robach. “It’s a very expensive sport.” Play But Harding said that while her mother helped her pay for skating, that support came with a price. Harding said her mother once hit her in the bathroom at an ice rink, saying, “I remember she dragged me into the bathroom and beat me with a hairbrush, literally.” Golden admitted it. “I spanked her once with a hairbrush at a competition,” said Golden, but claimed that it was an isolated incident. LaVona Golden But Harding alleges that the abuse went far beyond a single swat with a hairbrush. She says that once when she was in high school, her mother threw a steak knife at her, which landed in her forearm. Harding said she tried to leave the house in the middle of a conversation with her mother when she was struck. “And that’s when it happened,” Harding said. “I was about 10 feet from her. It was a steak knife.” However, Golden denies that the incident ever occurred. “Why would I throw a steak knife at anybody?” Golden said, claiming that her daughter has a history of being dishonest. “She’s lied so much she doesn’t know what isn’t a lie anymore.” LaVona Golden Harding became a force of nature on the ice. She skated her way to victory at the 1991 World Figure Skating Championships, where she became the first American woman to land a triple axel in competition, and she went on to compete at the 1992 and the 1994 Winter Olympics. Today, Harding has her own family -- a husband of seven years, and a son. “With my husband and my son, I get my second chance in life to be loved and to be happy,” she said. Golden said she has never met her grandson, and Harding said that’s not going to change. “I don’t want her anywhere near me. I don’t want her anywhere near my son,” Harding said of her mother. “She wants forgiveness. She wants to see me. She wants to make amends. She wants to meet and be part of the family. Hell no.” ||||| And the Golden Globe Award goes to … Allison Janney! The actress took home the statue for best supporting actress in a motion picture at Sunday night’s award show for her role in I, Tonya. Janney portrayed Tonya Harding’s mom, LaVona Fay Golden, in a dramatized version of the true story of figure skater Tonya Harding. Janney thanked screenwriter Steven Rodgers in her acceptance speech for creating a “very distinctive, unique, mother…. of a character.” “What he did is tell a story about class, tell a story about the disenfranchised about a woman who was not embraced for her individuality, tell a story about truth and the perception of truth in the media and the truths we all tell ourselves when we wake up in bed in the morning.” Steve Granitz/WireImage She also gave a shoutout to flu-ridden star Margot Robbie, who played Harding. “Margot, my goodness, she’s a quadruple threat,” Janney said.

Question: What does the tale of Mr Nobody reflect Movie title: Mr. Nobody Movie plot: In 2092, humanity has conquered mortality through the endless renewal of cells. The world watches in fascination as the 118-year-old Nemo Nobody, the last mortal on Earth, edges towards death. Curious to know of life before quasi-immortality, they interview Nemo. Dr. Feldheim, a psychiatrist, uses hypnosis to help Nemo recall some of his memories, while Nemo relates other memories to a journalist. As he is prodded, Nemo makes contradictory statements. He recounts his life at three primary points: at age 9, when his parents divorced, at age 15 when he fell in love, and at age 34 as an adult. All three unfold into their many possible outcomes. Nemo explains that before birth, children remember everything that will happen in their lives. At the moment of conception, the Angels of Oblivion erase their memory. The Angels, however, forget about Nemo, allowing him to \\"remember\\" different possible futures for himself. At age 9, at a railway station, he is forced to choose as his mother leaves on a train while his father stays on the platform. In one case, he manages to board the train while in another he stays with his father. Life with mother[edit] A rebellious Nemo lives with his mother and her new partner, Harry, in Montreal. He sees a new girl, Anna, in his school and is immediately smitten. One day on the beach, Anna asks if he would like to swim with her and her friends. Nemo insults her friends and they barely see each other again. In an alternate story line, Nemo admits to Anna he cannot swim; the two spend time together and fall in love. Anna turns out to be Harry's daughter and the two step siblings begin an illicit affair. They pledge their lives to one another. When Harry and Nemo's mother break up, Anna goes to New York with her father, and they lose touch. Years later, Nemo works as a pool cleaner, hoping to run into Anna by chance. They finally see one another at the train station and immediately recognize each other in a crowd of passers-by. After a passionate reunion, Anna announces she is not ready...","output":"to have a family and still wants to see the world. Heartbroken, Nemo spends his life writing a forbidden love manual and waiting for Anna, who eventually comes back to him, and they grow old together. Life with father[edit] Living with his father, Nemo experiences a range of different outcomes. In one, he becomes a scientist, residing by a lighthouse in search of a way to reverse time while he cares for his wheelchair-bound father. In another, he marries his childhood sweetheart, Elise. They have a rocky marriage, as Elise suffers from bipolar disorder, and the couple later divorces. In one outcome, Nemo steals and crashes Elise's car, which leads to her marrying another man, but they maintain a friendship. In another, he has a near-death experience: Rescued from a submerged car, Nemo discovers that his life was just a dream, and he is in fact 70 years old and married to a woman named Peggy. Upon waking up, Nemo refuses to accept this reality and demands to be taken back to the world from which he came. In another storyline, Nemo never hears from Anna again. He ends up marrying a woman named Jean, and they have three children together. Nemo feels trapped and suffocated in this marriage. One day, he follows a jogger named Anna and sneaks into her basement, where he stays for a while. Here, Nemo listens to Anna's conversation with her husband and becomes convinced that she is the Anna he knew in his childhood. Nemo ultimately dies, and his entire life story is recorded on thousands of tapes that are watched by the humans who have conquered mortality. The tale of Mr. Nobody reflects on the idea of choices, consequences, and the different possible outcomes created by each decision we make in our lives. It examines the concept of what-ifs and the impact each choice can have on an individual's life trajectory. The movie also discusses the themes of love, family, mortality, and the human desire to know and understand the future. The plot showcases the unpredictability of life and the infinite possibilities that arise from the events and decisions we face. Considering these elements and the unique, thought-provoking storyline, investing in a film like Mr. Nobody could be worth it if you are interested in exploring philosophical themes and complex character dynamics. The film is likely to engage audiences and stimulate conversation about the nature of life, love, and the paths we choose."},{"instruction":"Wheely 3 is another great adventure of Wheely the What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","output":"\\"Wheely 3 is another great adventure of Wheely, the car.\\""},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Q: After what life stage does the fusion inside a star end? Choices: - blue giant - yellow dwarf - white dwarf - red giant A: Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's step through the life stages of a star and identify when the fusion inside a star ends. 1. The Star's Beginning: A star is born from a cloud of gas and dust known as a nebula. Under the influence of gravity, the nebula collapses, and as the particles get closer together, interactions between them generate heat. 2. Fusion Ignition: When the core temperature and pressure are high enough, nuclear fusion starts. Hydrogen atoms combine to form helium and generate energy. At this stage, the star is known as a main-sequence star or, in our sun's case, a yellow dwarf. 3. Red Giant: After millions or billions of years, a star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, and the core contracts. The outer layers expand and heat up, turning the star into a red giant. As a red giant, the star begins fusing helium into heavier elements like carbon and oxygen. Fusion is still occurring at this stage. 4. White Dwarf: Eventually, the red giant will shed its outer layers, forming a planetary nebula. The core that remains is a white dwarf, a hot, dense object made mostly of carbon and oxygen. At this stage, fusion has ceased, and the white dwarf simply shines due to the residual heat left from previous fusion stages. So, the fusion inside a star ends at the white dwarf stage. Therefore, the answer is: white dwarf."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given an input list. A list contains several comma-separated items written within brackets.

The band released the album's first single \\"This Is Music\\" in May, and it reached No. 35, their first single to reach the Top 40. It was followed by \\"On Your Own\\" in June which performed even better, reaching No. 28. This single was particularly new for the Verve as it was a soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single \\"History\\", which reached No. 24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: \\"I knew that I had to do it earlier on, but I just wouldn't face it. Once you're not happy in anything, there's no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn't do anything about it. It felt awful because it could have been the greatest time of our lives, with \\"History\\" doing well, but I still think I can look myself in the mirror in 30 years time and say, 'Yeah man, you did the right thing.' The others had been through the same thing. It was a mixture of sadness and regret, and relief that we would have some time away.\\" Ashcroft reunited with Jones and Salisbury just a few weeks after the break-up, but McCabe did not rejoin them. The new band hired former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, but he spent only a couple of days with the band. The band then chose Simon Tong, a school friend credited with originally teaching Ashcroft and Jones to play guitar. The band made no live appearances for all of 1996, apart from a solo performance from Ashcroft supporting Oasis in New York. The rest of the year was spent playing and recording songs for a new album.

The case of BPN was particularly serious because of its size, market share, and the political implications - Portugal's then current President, Cavaco Silva, and some of his political allies, maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO, who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes. In the grounds of avoiding a potentially serious financial crisis in the Portuguese economy, the Portuguese government decided to give them a bailout, eventually at a future loss to taxpayers and to the Portuguese people in general. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why was the case of BPN more serious?","output":"The case of BPN (Banco Português de Negócios) was more serious for several reasons: 1. Size and market share: BPN was a larger bank compared to Banco Privado Português (BPP) in terms of its assets, liabilities, and overall market share. As a result, its failure could have had a more significant negative impact on the Portuguese economy, the financial sector, and its customers. 2. Political implications: The then-current President of Portugal, Cavaco Silva, and some of his political allies, had personal and business relationships with BPN and its CEO. This added to the complexity of the case, as it raised questions about the extent of political involvement and influence in the bank's activities, and could potentially damage the credibility and reputation of the government. 3. Public Perception: The close ties between BPN, its CEO, and leading politicians led to public outrage and a feeling that the goverment may have failed to effectively regulate the financial sector, which could erode public trust in institutions and the political system. 4. Criminal charges: The CEO of BPN was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes. This highlights the severity of the mismanagement and malpractices at the bank, which could have caused more significant damage to the economy if left unchecked. 5. Scale of financial irregularities: The losses accumulated by BPN due to bad investments, embezzlement, and accounting fraud were enormous. To prevent a financial crisis, the Portuguese government had to intervene with a bailout, which eventually led to a future loss for taxpayers and the Portuguese people in general. In conclusion, the case of BPN was more serious compared to BPP due to its size, market share, political implications, public perception, criminal charges, and the scale of financial irregularities it was involved in, all of which had the potential to negatively impact the Portuguese economy and its financial sector."},{"instruction":"Article: India rejected Chinese demands that the torch route be clear of India's 150,000-strong Tibetan exile community, by which they required a ban on congregation near the curtailed 3 km route.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more seeds planted happens, how will it affect MORE vegetables. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case suggests that when one plants more vegetable seeds in the ground, they will yield more vegetables. The process of vegetable gardening involves multiple steps, and the increased number of seeds may have both direct and indirect effects on this process. Let's analyze each step in the gardening process to understand the impact of planting more seeds. 1. Planting vegetable seeds: Planting more seeds initially will occupy more space in your garden. More seeds would take up additional nutrients and water from the soil. 2. Watering the seeds: With more seeds, there will also be an increased need for water to spread evenly among all the seedlings. This means a garden with more seeds will require a more careful watering strategy and potentially more water. 3. Seeds' germination: During the germination and sprouting process, the seeds will compete with each other for nutrients and space. It is possible that seeds with a competitive advantage will grow faster and thrive, while slower-growing seeds may fail to emerge. 4. Pest and weed control: As the plants grow, they are at risk of being attacked by pests or being invaded by weeds. With more seeds and plants occupying the same area, there may be a higher likelihood of disease or pest attacks and weed prevalence. Consequently, you will need to oversee and invest more time in pest and weed management. 5. Thinning out the plants: As the plants grow, spacing the plants is necessary to ensure that they have enough room to grow and enough nutrients to draw from the soil. Thinning out a larger amount of seedlings may require more time and effort. 6. Harvesting vegetables: Assuming that you have properly managed the plants throughout their growing season, you could potentially have a larger harvest of vegetables. A higher yield is expected due to the increased number of planted seeds. In conclusion, planting more seeds can potentially lead to increased vegetable yield, but it also influences the process in multiple ways. It requires more space, attention, and resources to adequately water, maintain, thin, and protect the increased number of plants. Therefore, while the perturbation hypothesis may result in more vegetables, it also causes significant effects (direct and indirect) on the overall gardening process."},{"instruction":"The University of California Board of Regents opted against Regent Ward Connerly #39;s proposal to adopt a multi-racial check box option on admissions applications at its Wednesday meeting at UCLA.

However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. Now, I have a new situation: Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well. As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia.

The following year , Bomp ! marked the 30th anniversary of the original Pebbles album with a spartan , limited - edition , clear - vinyl reissue complete with the original pink cover insert . The Pebbles series played a significant role in the emergence of a \`\` canon '' of garage - rock music and artists in the late 1970s and early 1980s . In his review of the Pebbles series for Allmusic , Richie Unterberger comments : \`\` Though 1972 's Nuggets compilation reawakened listeners to the sounds of mid- ' 60s garage rock , it only focused on the tip of the iceberg . Behind those forgotten hits and semi-hits lurked hundreds , if not thousands , of regional hits and flops from the same era , most even rawer and cruder ... .

Following on the heels of the success of the Pebbles series , dozens of other series of garage rock compilation albums have been started , with numerous albums being released each year for several decades . - AIP Records is a record label that was started by Greg Shaw's Bomp! Records, being launched in 1983 to continue the Pebbles series. The abbreviation AIP stands for \\"Archive International Productions\\". The first 10 volumes in the Pebbles series had been released by BFD Records of Kookaburra, Australia (most likely a fictitious label name to avoid copyright infringement lawsuits) in 1979-1980 and have been kept in print by AIP for many years. Including those in the companion Highs in the Mid-Sixties series which concentrated on American regional music scenes there are over 50 LPs covering some 800 obscure, mostly American \\"Original Punk Rock\\" songs recorded in the mid-1960s primarily known today as the garage rock and psychedelic rock genres that were previously known only to a handful of collectors. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - A psychedelic drug is a drug whose primary action is to alter cognition and perception, typically by agonising serotonin receptors. - Garage rock (shortened as \\"garage\\"; sometimes '60s punk\\" or \\"garage punk\\") is a raw and energetic style of rock and roll that flourished in the mid-1960s, most notably in the United States and Canada. The term derives from the perception that groups were often made up of young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage, although many were professional. The phrase \\"garage band\\" is often used to refer to musical acts in this genre. - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Garage punk is a rock subgenre that evokes characteristics identified with punk rock. Its progenitors are with the North American garage rock bands in the early 1960s. The term is sometimes used interchangeably with \\"garage rock\\" or \\"garage revival\\". Another movement that is widely categorized as \\"garage punk\\" drew heavily from stripped-down 1970s punk rock and Detroit proto-punk, taking shape in the indie rock underground between the late 1980s and early 1990s. - The Highs in the Mid-Sixties series is a group of 23 compilation albums of garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings that were issued by AIP Records in the mid-1980s. This series is a companion to the \\"Pebbles\\" series of similar music; the title is technically preceded by \\"Pebbles Presents:\\". The title sounds like it might have come from a weather report, although \\"Highs\\" intends to mean \\"the best\\" (and is also an apparent drug reference), while the recordings on these albums were originally released in the mid-1960s. - Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution. This is usually only for a limited time. The exclusive rights are not absolute but limited by limitations and exceptions to copyright law, including fair use. A major limitation on copyright is that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the underlying ideas themselves. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.

Answer:","output":"The missing first step in this process, which describes the formation of an earthquake, is \\"The formation of cracks within the Earth's lithosphere or crust\\". It is the first step in the process, as tectonic activities and Earth's internal heat can lead to the formation of these cracks or fault lines, which set off the described chain of events. So the complete process would be: - The formation of cracks within the Earth's lithosphere or crust - The cracks get very long and big in some places - The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks - The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - The cracks continue to develop - The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks - The pressure and movement around the cracks causes the rocks to crumble in some places - A lot of energy is released - The energy causes seismic waves - The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake.

Gas flow stops at the damaged Gulf of Mexico natural gas well. A fire broke out Tuesday when crew members hit an unexpected pocket of gas. It's a reminder that offshore work is \\"inherently risky,\\" former regulator says.","output":"Title: Unforeseen Hazards Remind Us of the Inherent Risks in Offshore Drilling Introduction A recent incident in the Gulf of Mexico involving a damaged natural gas well has underscored the inherent risks associated with offshore drilling. The accident resulted in a fire on the platform and drill, rendering it \\"probably a write-off,\\" according to one analyst. This event highlights the unpredictable nature of offshore work and serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers associated with oil and gas extraction. Gas Flow Stops at the Damaged Gulf of Mexico Natural Gas Well The affected well, located in the Gulf of Mexico, experienced a sudden stop in gas flow after a fire broke out on the platform on Tuesday. The incident reportedly occurred when crewmembers struck an unexpected pocket of gas while working on the well. This unforeseen hazard ultimately led to the destruction of the platform and drill, emphasizing the unpredictable nature of offshore drilling operations. Analyst: Platform and Drill \\"Probably a Write-off\\" As the damage to the platform and drill was extensive, industry experts have commented on the likelihood of the platform and drill being deemed a write-off. This essentially means that both the platform and drill are damaged beyond repair, constituting a substantial financial and environmental loss. In addition to the immediate economic ramifications, this event highlights the inevitable sacrifices often associated with offshore drilling for both communities and the environment. Offshore Work is \\"Inherently Risky,\\" says Former Regulator While offshore drilling has been touted as an essential aspect of maintaining global energy supplies, this latest incident has brought the dangers of the industry to the forefront of public debate. According to a former regulator, offshore work is \\"inherently risky,\\" making accidents like this not only possible, but to some extent, expected. Many offshore drilling locations are fraught with challenges, such as unpredictable weather, remote locations, and the need for specialized equipment and training. The combined effects of these factors raise the risk of incidents like fires, oil spills, and other accidents that can lead to bodily harm, environmental damage, and the destruction of expensive equipment. Moreover, these incidents can cause significant delays and drive up costs, ultimately affecting both the industry and consumers. Conclusion: Prioritizing Safety and Awareness in Offshore Drilling Operations The recent incident involving the damaged Gulf of Mexico natural gas well is a sobering reminder of the potential dangers associated with offshore drilling. It is essential for companies and regulators to prioritize safety and environmental awareness in all stages of oil and gas extraction. While advancements in technology and improvements in risk management techniques have significantly reduced the frequency of accidents, the unpredictable nature of offshore operations demands continued vigilance. To mitigate the risks inherent to offshore drilling, companies must invest in state-of-the-art equipment and ensure that crew members are thoroughly trained to anticipate and manage unforeseen challenges. Additionally, regulators must maintain strict oversight and continue to update policies to reflect emerging risks and industry trends. Ultimately, as the world continues to rely on fossil fuels, the risks associated with offshore drilling are unlikely to disappear completely. However, through increased awareness, ongoing dialogue, and a commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, the industry can make strides toward minimizing these risks and better protecting the people and ecosystems involved."},{"instruction":"Translate to Romanian: Today, the violence happening in Egypt also shows that things are difficult.

If everyone has a car and drives anywhere they want to go, there will be serious traffic problems on the road. Luckily, trains are a good form of public transport. British people use trains a lot. This is especially so for people who are travelling from London to Paris. Every day about 20 trains leave London. They travel at a very high speed and people feel glad that the trains take only 2 hours and 30 minutes to reach Paris. It's much faster to travel by train than by bus or by car.

They discover that their grandfather has just died and he has left them a motel in his will. Their father, John, tries to persuade them not to go, but the sisters ignore him and head off, accompanied by their friends: Tanya, Ben, Bill, and Bill's girlfriend, Amy. Sam is the first to arrive, and while drinking wine in Room 6, two inbreds forcefully enter and attack Sam, where with a collection of duct tape, an iron bar, and an axe, they bind Sam's legs with the tape, place the iron bar beside her ankles, and use the axe head to force the bar through both her ankles. Afterwards, the three are in a boat, where the inbreds tie a badly beaten Sam's legs to a concrete block, and dump her into the water, where she is still alive as the concrete block pulls her beneath the water, where she drowns. The rest drive to the motel and meet the caretaker, an old lady who appears kind. After finding a lake on their property, the group of friends take a swim, not noticing that Sam's dead body is floating in the lake beneath them. After the swim, the friends return to their trailer, where they set up a small campsite. Bill and Tanya go out to the woods to get some firewood, and end up having sex (much to the chagrin of Amy). After encounters with large, strange-looking, unkempt men, the friends are terrified. Bill, Tanya, and Amy are butchered, while the remaining friends escape but are picked up by a mysterious, pushy cop. He tricks them into coming back to the motel where everything slowly falls into place. It is later revealed that the cop and caretaker are all a part of the evil scheme to make Brielle and Kelli a part of their devious plans.

Review: You are showing it with a handle and there is none. It is made good but it is not like in the picture. Answer: Answer:","output":"The product review in question is not positive. The reasons for this are outlined in two parts: Firstly, the title \\"Disappointed!!\\" already indicates a negative sentiment. The title of a review often summarizes the sentiment of the reviewer and in this case, expressing disappointment typically suggests an unfulfilled expectation or a negative experience with the product. Secondly, the content of the review provides specific reasons for the user's disappointment. The reviewer expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the product didn't come with a handle even though the picture showed it did. This suggests that the product did not meet the customer's expectations based on the information provided during the purchase process. Misrepresentation of a product in its description or image can lead to a breach of trust and disappointment, which are displayed in this review. The customer, while indicating that the product was \\"made good\\", firmly asserts that it doesn't match what was shown in the picture. Although this is a partial positive comment indicating that the quality or craftsmanship may be acceptable, it does not negate the overall negative sentiment. In summary, while there is an element of positivity regarding the quality of the product, the overall tone and message of the review is negative.

A regulation board is ​ 17 ⁄ inches (451 mm) in diameter and is divided into 20 radial sections. Each section is separated with metal wire or a thin band of sheet metal. The best dartboards have the thinnest wire, so that the darts have less chance of hitting a wire and bouncing out. The numbers indicating the various scoring sections of the board are also normally made of wire, especially on tournament-quality boards. The wire ring on which the numbers are welded can be turned to facilitate even wear of the board. Boards of lesser quality often have the numbers printed directly on the board. What do the numbers on a dartboard mean?","output":"In the game of darts, the numbers on a dartboard represent different scoring sections, which help players accumulate points when their darts land on specific areas of the board. The dartboard is divided into 20 radial sections, each marked with a number from 1 to 20. Each radial section comprises three distinct zones: 1. Single Area: This largest area includes the outer portion of the radial section and the least valuable scoring area. When a player's dart lands in this area, they receive points equal to the number assigned to that section. 2. Double Ring: This narrow ring is located along the outer edge of the scoring area, just inside the outer wire frame. If a player's dart lands in the double ring, the value of the section is doubled (e.g., landing in the double ring of the section numbered 5 will award 5 x 2 = 10 points). 3. Triple Ring: Similar to the double ring, this narrow ring is positioned about halfway between the outer edge and the center of the board, dividing the single area from the center of the dartboard. If a dart lands in this ring, the player receives triple the points of the section (e.g., landing in the triple ring of section 8 will award 8 x 3 = 24 points). Additionally, the dartboard features two circles in the center, which are: 1. Bullseye or Outer Bull: The larger outer circle is worth 25 points when a dart lands in it. 2. Double Bull or Inner Bull: The smaller inner circle represents the highest-scoring area on the board and is worth 50 points when a dart lands inside it. Having numbers 1 to 20 on a dartboard adds strategy to the game, as players must carefully aim for the highest-scoring areas while trying to avoid lower-scoring sections and the metal wires that surround them."},{"instruction":"Objective: how to get rid of acne Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"Alright kiddo, let me explain this to you in a simple way.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more oxygen is inhaled happens, how will it affect less oxygen travels into the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis that you have proposed involves an increase in the amount of oxygen inhaled while simultaneously hypothesizing that less oxygen actually enters the body. To analyze this hypothesis and determine whether it has any direct or indirect effects on the process, let us first understand the normal process of respiration in humans, specifically in the context of the processes you've described. 1. Breathing in (inhalation): A person takes in air, which contains oxygen, through their nose or mouth. The air travels through the nasal or oral cavity and down the trachea before it reaches the bronchi and bronchioles in the lungs. This part of the process is primarily governed by the diaphragm's contraction, which increases the volume of the thoracic cavity and creates a pressure gradient, allowing air to flow into the lungs. 2. Oxygen diffusion: At this stage, the small air sacs (alveoli) present in the lungs transfer oxygen from the inhaled air into the bloodstream through passive diffusion across the respiratory membrane. The oxygen binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells which are then transported by the blood circulation to the various tissues and cells within the body. 3. Cellular respiration: Oxygen is then used by the cells to produce energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through cellular respiration. This process involves breaking down glucose, a simple sugar molecule derived from the food we consume, in the presence of oxygen, to generate ATP, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O). 4. Breathing out (exhalation): The carbon dioxide produced during cellular respiration is transported back to the lungs through the bloodstream and is eventually released from the body by exhaling. The diaphragm relaxes, and the thoracic cavity compresses, allowing CO2 to exit the body through the nose or mouth. Now, let us analyze the hypothetical situation in which more oxygen is inhaled, but less oxygen enters the body: If more oxygen is taken in during inhalation, but less oxygen actually enters the body, several factors could be responsible, such as decreased lung capacity, dysfunction in the respiratory membrane, or issues with blood circulation. However, for the purpose of this hypothesis, we will focus on the possibility of decreased oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream. Assuming this perturbation occurs, its most direct effect on the process would be a reduction in the overall cellular respiration efficiency. With less oxygen available in the bloodstream, cells will not have enough oxygen to carry out cellular respiration at its optimal efficiency. As a result, the rate of glucose breakdown to produce ATP will decrease. This may lead to fatigue, weakness, and a general inability to perform physical tasks effectively. Moreover, when oxygen levels are inadequate for cellular respiration, cells may resort to anaerobic respiration, a less efficient process that produces ATP without oxygen by breaking down glucose into lactic acid. However, this alternative energy production process cannot fully meet the body's energy demands and is less efficient. Indirectly, the perturbation may also impact the exhalation of CO2. With less oxygen entering the body and inefficient cellular respiration, the production of CO2 by the cells may fluctuate. Consequently, the amount of CO2 being transported back to the lungs and exhaled may also vary. In summary, if more oxygen is inhaled but somehow, less oxygen enters the body, it could have several direct and indirect effects on the respiration process. Direct effects may include reducing the efficiency of cellular respiration and causing the body to resort to inefficient anaerobic respiration. Indirect effects might involve changes in CO2 production and exhalation."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given the beginning and the middle of a three-part story.

Types and methods of notation have varied between cultures and throughout history, and much information about ancient music notation is fragmentary. Even in the same time period, such as in the 2010s, different styles of music and different cultures use different music notation methods; for example, for professional classical music performers, sheet music using staves and note heads is the most common way of notating music, but for professional country music session musicians, the Nashville Number System is the main method. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - A string quartet is a musical ensemble of four string players two violin players, a viola player and a cellist or a piece written to be performed by such a group. The string quartet is one of the most prominent chamber ensembles in classical music, with most major composers, from the mid to late 18th century onwards, writing string quartets. - MILAN (\\"milan(e)\\" is French for kite) is a European anti-tank guided missile. Design of the MILAN started in 1962, it was ready for trials in 1971, and was accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire guided SACLOS (semi-automatic command to line-of-sight) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit has to be aimed at the target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability. - Giulietta e Romeo is a dramma per musica by composer Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli with an Italian libretto by Giuseppe Maria Foppa after the 1530 novella of the same name by Luigi da Porto . The opera premiered at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 30 January 1796 . Giulietta e Romeo was composed by Zingarelli in only eight days and it is considered by many scholars to be his best work . The opera remained a part of the Italian repertory well into the nineteenth century and the role of Romeo was a favourite vehicle for Maria Malibran until c 1830 . - Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms and/or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \\"play back\\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments. - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet. - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.

For the University of Virginia's ambitious football team, the quest to reach that elite status faces a major milestone today as they prepare to confront the fast and aggressive University of Miami team at Scott Stadium. As fans and supporters eagerly await this high-stakes matchup, many can't help but analyze the strategies UVA will incorporate to secure a victory against a rival that possesses deadly speed and undeniable talent. The team's coaching staff must devise a game plan that accurately capitalizes on the strengths of the Virginia players while neutralizing the speed of the Miami Hurricanes. One crucial aspect of tackling Miami's speed is ensuring strong performances from the Cavaliers' defensive unit. By maintaining an aggressive front, UVA's seasoned defensive line can aim to disrupt Miami's offensive timing and plays right from the source: their skilled quarterback. This disruption can help prevent Miami from connecting on deep passes - plays that could prove costly to the Cavaliers. Another key to neutralizing Miami's speed is a carefully coordinated and disciplined line-backing corps. The Virginia linebackers must remain focused on preventing short and intermediate passes, anticipating the Hurricanes' routes, and closing down any gaps. By establishing a solid defense against the run game, the Virginia linebackers can aim at forcing Miami into less favorable passing situations. The Virginia secondary, comprising experienced cornerbacks and safeties, also plays a significant role in containing Miami's speedy wide receivers and tight ends. Working cohesively, the secondary unit should look to eliminate their opposition's explosive plays and limit any potential for big gains. In addition to the defense, UVA's offensive strategy is crucial in determining the outcome of the game. By controlling the clock through a balanced and sustained offense, Virginia can limit Miami's time on the field. Time of possession plays a critical role in this game as it will minimize any opportunities for Miami to capitalize on their speed and explosiveness. Using a diverse mix of short passes, quick runs, and play-action calls, Virginia's coaching staff must strive to keep Miami's defense guessing and off balance. A productive ground game, complemented by an efficient passing game, is essential in applying continuous pressure on Miami's formidable defense. Furthermore, the Virginia special teams unit can make a significant impact on the game. A disciplined, productive special teams performance - ranging from pinpoint accurate field goals to punts that limit Miami's return opportunities - can provide the Cavaliers with a critical advantage in both field possession and momentum. Ultimately, Virginia's ambitious football team faces a daunting challenge at Scott Stadium today as they strive to stake their claim among college football's elite. With a well-executed game plan grounded in aggressive defense, disciplined offense, and impactful special teams play, the Cavaliers can hope to neutralize Miami's speed and secure the monumental victory that propels them towards greatness."},{"instruction":"Use stream of consciousness to answer the following. \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\" is a song written in October 1962, with lyrics by Noël Regney and music by Gloria Shayne Baker.

Options: - united states - florida - country - where it is hot - california Explain why a human would choose \\"florida\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"Florida\\" as the answer to the question above due to several factors that make the state an ideal vacation and retirement destination, particularly when considering the aspects of a long coast, peninsula, and panhandle mentioned in the question. Florida, located in the southeastern region of the United States, is a state that embodies all of these geographic features. The following reasons explain why Florida is a well-suited choice for the given question: 1. Geographic features: As a peninsula, Florida is surrounded by water on three sides, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Gulf of Mexico to the west, and the Straits of Florida to the south. This unique location provides an extensive coastline, estimated to be around 1,350 miles (or 2,170 kilometers). Additionally, the state's panhandle region extends to the west along the Gulf of Mexico, further adding to its long stretch of coast. 2. Climate: Florida's climate typically ranges from subtropical to tropical, with average temperatures remaining warm throughout the year. This makes it an attractive destination for those looking for a vacation spot or retirement location with consistently pleasant weather. Many people from colder regions also choose Florida for seasonal retreats during winter months to escape the harsh cold temperatures in their hometowns. 3. Beaches and oceanside activities: Florida's extensive coastline and numerous beautiful beaches offer a wide range of oceanside activities for vacationers and retirees. Sunbathing, swimming, surfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, and fishing are just a few of the available leisure activities. Moreover, the state's pristine shoreline attracts beachgoers from all around the world to soak in the ocean views, relax on the sand, and enjoy the warm waters and marine life of Florida's coasts. 4. Attractions and entertainment: Florida is home to various popular tourist attractions such as Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, the Kennedy Space Center, The Everglades National Park, and many other historical and cultural sites. This ensures that visitors and residents alike have a plethora of entertainment options to choose from, making Florida an appealing destination for a diverse demographic. 5. Retirement communities: Many seniors find Florida an attractive retirement location due to the abundance of retirement communities and active adult lifestyle options available. These communities often feature amenities such as golf courses, fitness centers, social clubs, and organized events, all designed to provide an engaging and vibrant living experience for retirees. Additionally, low property taxes, no state income tax, and access to quality healthcare facilities further contribute to Florida's reputation as a popular retirement destination. In summary, Florida is chosen as the preferred answer to the question because it encompasses all the mentioned aspects of a peninsula, panhandle, and long coast, along with its warm climate, diverse recreational opportunities, and a strong preference for vacation and retirement living. While some other options, such as California, might also offer a long coastline and great vacation opportunities, Florida's unique combination of geographic features, attractions, and favorable living conditions positions it as the most fitting answer."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1973, nine-year-old Troy Carmichael (Zelda Harris) and her brothers Clinton (Carlton Williams), Wendell (Sharif Rashed), Nate (Chris Knowings), and Joseph (Tse-Mach Washington) live in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.

Sam never reported the offense to the police because he feared the gang's retribution and was also forced to keep quiet by the gang leader, Marcus. The movie opens with Sam visiting Trife's grave late in the evening on the anniversary of his death. As Sam mourns and catches glimpses of Trife's family visiting the grave earlier, a mysterious man appears out of nowhere. The man, dressed in black and donning a creepy face mask, watches closely as Sam pours his heart out to Trife. Sam finally notices the man, feels an immediate sense of unease, and hastily tries to leave the graveyard. The mysterious man corners Sam and pulls out a knife to stab him – claiming vengeance for Trife and insisting Sam must pay for his silence. Sam wrestles the knife away from the man and runs to find help, managing to catch the license plate of the attacker's vehicle. Sam returns home and recounts the strange incident to his older sister, Ellie, the only person who knows about his secret. Ellie, a budding investigative journalist, decides to help Sam uncover the truth about the man at Trife's grave.

So, you see those letters and numbers? We're going to make it simple and find what 'a' is. Now we have, -611*a - 426*a + 578*a on one side and 159*a + 70452 on the other side. I want you to think of the '*a' like apples. So, we have three groups of apples on one side of the problem and one group of apples on the other side. First, let's combine our groups of apples on the left side. Here's what we do: (-611 - 426 + 578) apples = (159) apples + 70452 Doing the math, we find that it's (-1037 + 578) apples. This simplifies to -459 apples on the left side of the equation. So we now have: -459 * a = 159 * a + 70452 Now, we want to get all of the 'a' terms on one side and the numbers on the other. Let's move the 159 * a from the right side to the left side by subtracting 159 * a from both sides: -459 * a - 159 * a = 70452 Combine the 'a' terms again on the left side: -618 * a = 70452 Now, to find what 'a' is, we can divide both sides by -618: a = 70452 / -618 When we do the division, we get: a = -114 So, our answer is that 'a' equals -114.

Cyprus on Monday said banks would remain closed until Thursday, as the government sought more time to shore up support for the levy on accounts and raced to avert a collapse of its financial sector. It also put off for another day a debate on ... ||||| NICOSIA/ATHENS Euro zone ministers urged Cyprus to let smaller savers escape a levy on bank deposits, before a parliamentary vote on Tuesday that will either secure the island's financial rescue or threaten default. A weekend announcement that Cyprus would impose a levy on bank accounts as part of a 10 billion euro (13 billion) bailout by the European Union broke with previous practice that depositors' savings were sacrosanct. The euro and stock markets fell on concern that developments in tiny Cyprus could reignite the financial crisis in the 17-nation euro zone, while angry Cypriots staged protests outside their heavily guarded parliament. Before Tuesday's vote, which is too close to call and would send reverberations across the currency area if lost, euro zone finance ministers held an evening teleconference and said depositors with less than 100,000 euros should be protected, officials said. Under the deal struck in Brussels on Saturday, bank deposits under that level would have faced a levy of 6.7 percent, ripping up the protection savers thought they enjoyed on insured deposits up to that limit, while those above would be stung for 9.9 percent. The finance ministers said they favored a higher, 15.6 percent hit for richer savers, so more modest accounts could be spared. That would look similar to a deal the Cypriots, fearing the destruction of their banking model which lures money from rich Russians and others, baulked at in Brussels at the weekend. It was not clear if Nicosia will accept it now but if it does, it would still raise 5.8 billion euros from the bank levy as planned, a Greek finance ministry source said. \\"All Eurogroup ministers said today they wished there was no tax below 100,000 euros but you can't force a country to not do that,\\" the Greek source told Reuters. \\"Cyprus doesn't want to impose a large tax above 100,000 because the money will flow out. Two thirds of deposits are from abroad.\\" The decision to target bank accounts stunned Cypriots, and police sealed off parliament as about 400 people staged a noisy protest outside, aggrieved that their small island of one million people should be singled out for such treatment. Demonstrators honked horns and waved placards reading \\"Hang the Banksters, Hands off People's Savings\\" and \\"Merkel go home and stay\\". Residents emptied cash machines over the weekend and investors feared a precedent had been set that could reignite turmoil in the single currency area that the European Central Bank has calmed in recent months with its pledge to do whatever it takes to save the euro. The parliamentary speaker said debate on the bank levy would be delayed until 1600 GMT (11 a.m. EST) on Tuesday to buy more time to build consensus. Banks, shut on Monday for a bank holiday, will remain closed on Tuesday and Wednesday to avert any panic. The Greek source said the vote would go ahead on Tuesday as planned. CHANGE COMING The euro zone had already indicated changes would be acceptable as long as the return of around six billion euros was maintained. \\"It is up to the government alone to decide if it wants to change the structure,\\" European Central Bank policymaker Joerg Asmussen, who was pivotal in the weekend negotiations, told reporters in Berlin. \\"The important thing is that the financial contribution of 5.8 billion euros remains.\\" On the streets of Nicosia, ordinary Cypriots blamed European leaders, especially German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Protesters had inked the word \\"No\\" on the palms of their hands. \\"Europe is for its people and not for Germany,\\" one placard said. \\"They are treating us like guinea pigs,\\" said Takis Georgiou, 49. \\"The government has lost its credibility in the eyes of the people. We'd be better off leaving the euro and returning to the pound, we don't want to end up like Greece.\\" On markets, the euro fell before recovering some losses. European stocks dropped two percent before recouping most of the lost ground - denoting only modest levels of concern - with banks taking the heaviest blow. Approval in Cyprus's 56-member parliament is far from a given: no party has an absolute majority and three parties say outright they will not back the tax. \\"The most important question is what would happen the following day if the bill isn't voted,\\" Cyprus central bank governor Panicos Demetriades told parliament. \\"What would certainly happen is that our two big banks would need to be consolidated. This doesn't mean that they would be completely destroyed. We will aim for this to happen in a completely orderly way.\\" ONE-OFF Brussels has emphasized that the measure is a one-off for a country that accounts for just 0.2 percent of European output. The worst fear is that savers in other, larger European countries become nervous and start withdrawing funds, although there was no immediate sign of that on Monday. \\"If I were a saver, certainly in Spain or maybe Italy, I think I'd be looking askance at these measures and think this could yet happen to me,\\" said Peter Dixon, global financial economist at Commerzbank. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who has talked with his EU counterparts, was monitoring developments closely and expected a \\"fair\\" solution, Washington said. Cyprus's banking sector dwarfs the size of its economy and has been severely hurt by exposure to its much larger neighbor Greece. Moscow is considering extending an existing 2.5 billion euro loan to help bail the island out and said the fact it had not been consulted about the bailout could come into play. \\"We will consider the issue of restructuring of the loan taking into account our (future) participation in the coordinated actions with the European Union to help Cyprus,\\" Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told Reuters. President Vladimir Putin criticized the bank levy as setting a dangerous precedent. \\"Putin said that such a decision, should it be made, would be unfair, unprofessional and dangerous,\\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades, a conservative elected just three weeks ago, said in a TV address that the tax was an alternative to a disorderly bankruptcy. It was painful, but \\"will eventually stabilize the economy and lead it to recovery\\".

Facing eroding support, the new president, Nicos Anastasiades, asked Parliament to postpone until Monday an emergency vote on a measure to approve the bailout terms, amid doubt that it would pass. The euro fell sharply against major currencies ahead of the action, as investors around the world absorbed the implications of Europe’s move. In an address to the nation, Mr. Anastasiades painted an apocalyptic picture of what would happen if Cyprus did not approve the strict terms: a “complete collapse of the banking sector”; major losses for depositors and businesses; and a possible exit of Cyprus from the euro zone, the 17 countries that use the euro as their currency. He said he was working to persuade European Union leaders to modify their demands for a 6.75 percent tax on deposits of up to 100,000 euros, a move that would hit ordinary savers. “I understand fully the shock of this painful decision,” he said, speaking with a grim look on his face as he stood between the Cypriot and European Union flags in the presidential palace. “That is why I continue to fight so that the decisions of the Eurogroup will be modified in the coming hours.” The Eurogroup is made up of the 17 euro zone finance ministers. By size, Cyprus’s economy represents not even half a percent of the combined output of the 17 euro zone countries. Yet the impact of this weekend’s decision by European leaders to impose across-the-board losses on bank depositors — from the richest Russian oligarchs, who have increasingly deposited their money in Cyprus’s banks, to the poorest Cypriot pensioners — in return for 10 billion euros, or 13 billion, in bailout money could not be more far-reaching. After five years of bailouts financed largely by European taxpayers, wealthy European nations have decreed that when a bank or country goes broke, bond investors and perhaps even bank depositors will pay a significant portion of the bill. The change is driven in no small part by the growing reluctance by residents of nations like Germany — whose chancellor, Angela Merkel, faces an election this year — to continue to finance bailouts of troubled neighbors like Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, and now Cyprus. The resulting turmoil could create a wave of investor contagion that will challenge Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, to make good on his promise to do whatever it takes to protect the euro. On Sunday, it was clear that a majority of Cyprus’s 56 lawmakers would not approve the terms of the bailout, which would lead to a likely loss of the rescue money that Cyprus so desperately needs. The government extended a bank holiday it had imposed over the weekend, meaning banks will not open Tuesday as planned. There was talk that they might not open Wednesday, either. In response, the European Central Bank applied more pressure to have the deal approved, sending two representatives to Cyprus on Saturday night to assure Cypriot banks that the central bank was “here for them — as long as the bill goes through Sunday or Monday morning before financial markets in Europe open,” said Aliki Stylianou, a press officer for the central bank of Cyprus. Mr. Anastasiades’s cabinet gathered early Sunday with the heads of the central bank and the finance ministry to discuss how to carry out the levy, should it pass. But some analysts expressed skepticism about the measure’s long-term effects even if Cyprus approves it. “Whether the Parliament approves the measure or not, the effect will be the same,” said Stelios Platis, the managing director of MAP S.Platis, a financial services firm, and a former economic adviser to Mr. Anastasiades. “As soon as banks in Cyprus reopen, people will rush to take all their money out” because they do not believe it will not happen again. To some degree, this policy shift was foreshadowed last month when Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the finance minister for the Netherlands who was recently tapped to lead the Eurogroup, forced investors of a failing Dutch bank to pay their share by writing down 1.8 billion euros’ worth of high-risk bonds to zero. But it is one thing to wipe out bond investors and quite another to force a loss on bank depositors, including Cypriot savers who had their deposits insured and, like people all over the world, had the impression that a government-backed savings account was inviolable. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sue Hall runs a wedding business in Cyprus: \\"Most of the money in my business deposit account belongs to couples who are to get married\\" A crucial vote in Cyprus' parliament on a bailout that has sparked huge public anger has been delayed until Tuesday. President Nicos Anastasiades has been meeting MPs in Nicosia and has indicated he wants the terms amended. The 10bn-euro (13bn; £8.6bn) bailout agreed with the EU and IMF had demanded that all bank customers pay a one-off levy and led to heavy cash withdrawals. The president's party has 20 seats in the 56-member assembly and needs other parties' support to ratify the deal. Asian and European stock markets fell amid uncertainty in Monday's trading. If Cyprus' president wants to change something regarding the levy on bank deposits, that's in his hands Joerg Asmussen, European Central Bank governing council Q&A: Cyprus bailoutRussian anger at levy Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday called the proposed levy \\"unfair, unprofessional and dangerous\\", his spokesman said. Russian banks and businesses have significant deposits in Cyprus. 'People betrayed' The debate and vote in Cyprus' parliament has now been postponed until 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Tuesday. It was initially to have been held on Sunday. President Anastasiades is at present holding talks with ministers and lawmakers at the parliament building in Nicosia, which has been cordoned off to prevent protests. The BBC's Mark Lowen, in Nicosia, says there are suggestions Mr Anastasiades is looking at lowering the cost to those with smaller savings. Under the currently agreed terms, depositors with less than 100,000 euros in Cyprus accounts would have to pay a one-time tax of 6.75%. Those with sums over that threshold would pay 9.9%. Analysis Reform of how to mend broken banks, which has been negotiated globally and in Europe since the crash of 2007-8, has been based on two central principles. First, that the savings of ordinary people should be protected, up to a high threshold - or 100,000 euros in the European Union for example. And that financial institutions which lend to banks by buying their bonds should incur losses when banks are bailed out: bondholders should, to use the jargon, be bailed in, as part of resolution plans. So what is seen by many as profoundly shocking about the terms of the rescue of Cyprus by the rest of the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund is that both of these principles have been broken. Join Robert for a Twitter Q&A 16:00-1630 GMT Our correspondent says the president may want to lower the former rate to 3%, while raising the levy on the larger depositors to 12.5%. An EU source told Agence France-Presse there could be a three-way split on the level of levy, grouped into accounts holding less than 100,000 euros, between 100,000 and 500,000 and more than 500,000. Joerg Asmussen, a member of the European Central Bank's governing council, said there could be a change to the deal. He said: \\"It's the Cyprus government's adjustment programme. If Cyprus' president wants to change something regarding the levy on bank deposits, that's in his hands. He must just make sure that the financing is intact.\\" German government spokesman Steffen Seibert echoed his comments, saying: \\"How the country makes its contribution, how it makes the payments, is up to the Cyprus government.\\" Mr Anastasiades insists that without the bailout Cyprus could face bankruptcy and a possible exit from the eurozone. He said on TV on Sunday: \\"I fully share the unhappiness caused by a difficult and painful decision.\\" He also said it was the worst crisis since Turkey invaded in 1974. The banks are closed on Monday for a national holiday and could remain shut on Tuesday to avoid mass withdrawals. Opposition leader George Lillikas, an independent, said the president had \\"betrayed the people's vote\\". Russian capital Under the bailout's current terms, depositors will be compensated with the equivalent amount in shares in their banks, and Mr Anastasiades promised that those who kept deposits in Cypriot banks for the next two years would be given bonds linked to revenues from natural gas. Cyprus announced the discovery of a field containing between 5 and 8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas under the Mediterranean Sea in 2011 but Turkey disputes its drilling rights. Reports have suggested that eurozone leaders, particularly in Germany, insisted on the levy because of the large amount of Russian capital kept in Cypriot banks, amid fears of money-laundering. However, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he and the International Monetary Fund had been in favour of \\"respecting the deposit guarantee for accounts up to 100,000\\" euros. He said it was the Cypriot government, the European Commission and the European Central Bank that had decided on the levy terms and that \\"they now must explain this to the Cypriot people\\". Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday: \\"Assessing the possible decision of imposing additional tax by Cyprus on deposits, [President] Putin said that this decision, if taken, would be unfair, unprofessional and dangerous.\\" Unprecedented levy Depositors with under 100,000 euros deposited must pay 6.75% Those with more than 100,000 in their accounts must pay 9.9% Depositors will be compensated with the equivalent amount in shares in their banks The levy is a one-off measure Cyprus bailout - Your stories UK to help troops Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said: \\"It looks simply like the confiscation of other people's money.\\" The Moody's ratings agency estimates that, at the end of 2012, Russian banks had placed 12bn in Cypriot banks, with corporate deposits at 19bn. So Russian corporate and individual investors could lose up to 2bn. The Russian government also gave Cyprus a 2.5bn euro loan in 2011. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the Interfax news agency on Monday that Moscow would consider extending the loan period and restructuring the repayments. The proposed savings levy has drawn criticism from economic analysts. Michael Hewson, of CMC Markets, told the Press Association: \\"If European policymakers were looking for a way to undermine the public trust that underpins the foundation of any banking system they could not have done a better job.\\" It is clear that negotiators of the bailout in Brussels drastically underestimated the reaction in Cyprus, says our correspondent, Mark Lowen. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Renaissance Capital's Ivan Tchakarov: \\"Russians are not happy about the bailout levy\\" A tiny eurozone economy feels it is being blackmailed by the most powerful, and the growing resentment will do nothing to foster European solidarity, he adds. If the levy goes ahead, it will affect many non-Cypriots with bank accounts, including UK expatriates. However, depositors in the overseas arms of Cypriot banks will not be hit. Bank of Cyprus UK and Laiki Bank UK both confirmed on their websites that there would be no impact. Chancellor George Osborne said the UK would compensate any government employees and military personnel whose bank accounts were affected. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In 2013, Cyprus faced a financial crisis as its banking sector was severely damaged by exposure to Greece and sought a bailout from the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The EU and IMF agreed to provide a €10 billion (13 billion) bailout, which included a one-off levy on all bank deposits in Cyprus. The levy demanded a 6.75% tax on deposits up to €100,000 and a 9.9% tax on deposits over that amount. This unprecedented move sparked public outrage in Cyprus, as it affected all bank depositors, from the wealthiest to the poorest. The crisis raised fears that the turmoil could spread to countries such as Spain and Italy. Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades asked parliament to postpone an emergency vote on a measure to approve the bailout terms, as there was doubt over whether it would pass."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"Stocks on Wall Street opened lower, with department stores Kohl's and Macy's down sharply after they reported weak holiday sales.\\"","output":"Title: Wall Street Takes a Hit as Kohl's and Macy's Report Weak Holiday Sales The beginning of the new year has not been promising for two of America's largest department stores, Kohl's and Macy's, as they recently reported weak holiday sales. Consequently, stocks on Wall Street opened lower as investors reacted to the disappointing results. These dismal numbers are not just a temporary setback for the retailers, but also a reflection of the challenges in the retail sector, especially for brick-and-mortar giants. Kohl's and Macy's, among other retailers, have been facing stiff competition from e-commerce platforms, which have changed the consumers' shopping habits and preferences. The increasing popularity of online shopping in the past couple of years has led to a steady decline in in-store sales, and the trend continues to persist with the rise in consumer expectations for convenience, discounts, and seamless shopping experiences. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses and overall economy further accelerated the challenges faced by these traditional retailers. The imposed lockdowns and social distancing norms pushed more consumers to shop online, causing unprecedented stress on physical store sales. Although both Kohl's and Macy's did witness some growth during the gradual reopening of the economy, they still struggle to keep their business afloat amidst stiff competition from e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and Target. The holiday season, usually known for higher sales and more significant foot traffic in the malls and stores, was anticipated to be a silver lining for these retailers, providing them with an opportunity to bounce back. However, given the weak sales report, the holiday season evidently failed to deliver on these expectations. Besides the impact of increased online shopping, the supply chain disruptions caused by ongoing global shipping and logistics issues may have also contributed to lower in-store availability of merchandise. This disappointing start to the year affected the stock market as well. Wall Street experienced a lower opening, as investors registered concern over the performance of these traditional retail giants. The weak sales numbers cast a shadow over the retail sector, raising questions about the future of brick-and-mortar stores. If consumer preferences continue to shift towards online platforms, it may force traditional retailers to develop new strategies to stay competitive in an increasingly digital market. On a broader macroeconomic level, this downturn in the retail sector could contribute to a slower economic recovery after the pandemic. As the Omicron variant poses another threat to global health and business, the negative performance of the department store sector might set a pessimistic tone for 2022. In conclusion, the weak holiday sales reported by Kohl's and Macy's signal that the future of brick-and-mortar retailers, once considered the backbone of American retail and consumerism, might be in jeopardy. The unprecedented challenges posed by the growth of e-commerce and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbate the situation for large department stores. As investors and market watchers observe the decline in the value of these retail giants, it would be imperative for these businesses to adapt to the changing market landscape and customer preferences to recover and perhaps even flourish in the years to come."},{"instruction":"Gálveztown was the HMS \\"West Florida\\", which the Continental Navy schooner USS \\"Morris\\" captured at the Battle of Lake Pontchartrain, which was then in the British province of West Florida. \\"West Florida\\" became the Gálveztown, supposedly under the command of Bernardo de Gálvez, the Spanish governor of Louisiana (New Spain).

The work was well done, for the amount paid. Color matched and dents were not to be seen. However, I did notice a few scratches on my driver side fender area that I know were not there before I dropped it off. The estimated time when I dropped it off was 2 days at latest, but in actuality it was 6 days later before I was able to pick it up! In addition, as I picked my car up, no one really took the time to let me know about the work they did nor did they give a brief overview. Instead, after paying inside, a worker who did not really speak English, drove my car to the front and basically handed me my keys and nodded. On top of that, upon entering my car, I noticed my trip mileage had been resetted; I do not know why this would be necessary to fix outside body work, unless someone is trying to cover their tracks for taking a drive in it. After about five min from leaving the lot, my car turned off on me while I was driving! I luckily was close to the slow lane and was able to pull to the side.

Of course the guys at the shop denied of touching anything and even when I pointed out the fact that my trip mileage was resetted, he didn't have an answer.

Yes or no? Answer: The international release of the single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart . Question: what is the song heart shaped box about Answer:","output":"\\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, released in 1993 as the lead single from their third and final studio album, \\"In Utero.\\" The song was written by the band's frontman, Kurt Cobain, who also contributed to the music and lyrics. While the international release of the single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart, the meaning and interpretation of the song have been a subject of much debate and speculation among fans and music critics alike. Kurt Cobain never explicitly stated the meaning behind \\"Heart-Shaped Box,\\" which has left fans exploring a variety of interpretations for the song. Some of the most common theories about the meaning of \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" include: 1. Love and Relationships: Many people believe that the song is about the complexities of love and relationships, with the heart being a prevalent symbol of love. The \\"heart-shaped box\\" could represent the vulnerability and emotional turmoil of being in love, with the box acting as a metaphor for the fragility and complexity of human emotions. 2. Drug Addiction: Another interpretation of \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" relates to Cobain's struggles with drug addiction, specifically heroin. The lyrics \\"I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\\" might refer to the self-destructive nature of addiction and the desire to save someone you love from the harmful effects of substance abuse. 3. Cobain's Relationship with Courtney Love: Some fans have speculated that \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" was written about Cobain's relationship with his wife, Courtney Love, and the difficulties they faced as a couple. It is said that Love had given Cobain a heart-shaped box as a present, which could have inspired the song's title and imagery. The lyrics of the song could be interpreted as Cobain's reflection on their tumultuous relationship. 4. Exploring the Dark Side of Human Nature: Another possible interpretation of the song is that it explores the darker side of human nature, including aspects such as depression, addiction, and unhealthy relationships. The imagery in the lyrics and the accompanying music video directed by Anton Corbijn contain elements of surrealism, and the juxtaposition of beautiful and grotesque images can leave a lasting impression on the listener. 5. Confronting Mortality and Suffering: The song could be interpreted as a reflection on the inevitability of suffering and death. The line \\"I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks\\" might suggest a sense of entrapment and existential angst, while the references to cancer and the blackened emotional state could represent the pain and fear that come with facing one's mortality. In conclusion, \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is a complex and multi-layered song that can be interpreted in various ways. The song may be about love and relationships, drug addiction, Cobain's relationship with Courtney Love, the dark side of human nature, confronting mortality and suffering, or a combination of these themes. While its meaning remains open to interpretation, \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" stands as a powerful and evocative example of Nirvana's masterful songwriting and Cobain's poignant lyrical style."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

The first stamp marking the opening of the White Olympics was issued on January 25th, 1932 in the United states to celebrate the 3rd White Olympics. From then on, issuing stamps during the White Olympics became a tradition. To observe the 4th Winter Olympic Games, a group of stamps were published in Germany in November, 1935. The five rings of the Olympics were printed on the front of the sportswear. It was the first time that the symbol appeared on stamps of the Winter Olympics. In the 1950s, the stamps of this kind became more color1ful. When the White Olympics came, the host countries as well as the non-host countries published stamps to mark those Games. China also published four stamps in February, 1980, when the Chinese sportsmen began to march into the area of the Winter Olympics. Japan is the only Asian country that has ever held the White Olympics. Altogether 14,500 million stamps were sold to raise funds for the sports meet.

Now, let's analyze each part step-by step: Step 1: Analyze the advantage observed In the premise, the nature of the advantage is not specified. In the hypothesis, the advantage is specifically described as seeing better weapons. Since the premise does not provide any specific information about the advantage, we cannot confirm that it refers to the better weapons mentioned in the hypothesis. Step 2: Analyze their actions upon seeing the advantage In the premise, the action is that they rushed in after observing the advantage. In the hypothesis, the action is that they ran in after seeing better weapons. Rushing in and running in are similar actions, so this part of the hypothesis aligns with the premise. Conclusion: Although the actions align between the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise, because the nature of the advantage is not specified in the premise. It is possible that the advantage observed is related to better weapons, but it could also refer to a different advantage entirely.

André Gomes, full name André Filipe Tavares Gomes, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder. Born on July 30, 1993, in Grijo, Portugal, Gomes began his football career with the youth ranks of Porto, where he spent nearly a decade. After spending time with the Porto's youth team, Gomes moved to S.L. Benfica in 2011. He made his professional debut for the senior team in October 2012. After an impressive season, he signed with Valencia CF in the summer of 2014, initially on a loan agreement. This loan agreement was then turned into a permanent transfer in June 2015. During the 2014-15 season, André Gomes proved to be an essential player for Valencia CF, playing in La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and UEFA Europa League. His versatility in midfield allowed him to score 12 goals across all competitions, becoming one of the key contributors in the team. His solid performances at Valencia CF drew the attention of FC Barcelona, who ultimately signed him in July 2016 for an initial fee of €35 million, plus potential add-ons.

A senior administration official summed it up in a text message (using Axios style): \\"Can't go into election next year with 'accomplishments' only being: ||||| Lawmakers are bracing for chaos in December as they plunge into several high-stakes legislative fights. Both chambers are expected to be in session for roughly 15 days before leaving town until January, but the looming battles could push their exit date closer to Christmas. Republicans want to get a key agenda item, tax reform, to President Trump’s desk by the end of the year. ADVERTISEMENT That would be a daunting task even under the best of circumstances — but Republicans are also facing a Dec. 8 deadline to avoid a government shutdown, with fights over immigration and health care also crowding the agenda. Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamTrump sends mixed signals on Syria amid calls for action GOP senator: Pruitt should face the press Graham: Pruitt's ethics controversies don't look good MORE (R-S.C.) said the deadlines could be just what Republicans need to get things accomplished. “I think that’s maybe the only way we can get it done,” he told The Hill. “We’re the ultimate do-your-homework-at-the-last-minute crowd.” Here’s what to watch for as Congress prepares for an end-of-the-year sprint. Tax reform Senate Republicans are rushing to pass their tax plan this week after it was voted out of the Senate Finance Committee along party lines. They have a narrow path to getting the bill through the Senate.

Meanwhile, several GOP senators have raised concerns about the impact the tax plan could have on the deficit. The Senate plan can add up to 1.5 trillion to the debt over the next decade. If the Senate is able to pass its own bill this week, Republicans will still need to work out a deal in conference committee and pass the final legislation. Finding a deal won’t be easy, as the House and Senate bills differ in significant ways. The House bill, for example, would scale back the state and local tax deduction, while the Senate bill would end it entirely. Time is of the essence, with a special election in Alabama on Dec. 12 that could leave Senate Republicans with only a one-seat majority. Health care Tied closely to the tax plan is a renewed fight over health care. The Senate GOP plan would repeal ObamaCare’s individual mandate, which requires most Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. But GOP Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsTrump sends mixed signals on Syria amid calls for action GOP senator: Pruitt should face the press Collins: Trump should get credit for China tariffs MORE (Maine), a key vote on the tax plan, is warning that linking the mandate repeal and the tax fight is a mistake that could make it harder to get a bill through Congress. \\"My concern is that if we combine the health-care issues with tax reform we make it far more controversial,\\" she told reporters before lawmakers left town for Thanksgiving.

Democrats, however, are warning that they won’t help pass that bill, which would need 60 votes, if Republicans link it to the tax plan.

John Cornyn John CornynA year in, Trump’s pick makes waves at high court Senate panel requests info on Trump aides for Russia probe GOP ponders how to fill rest of 2018 MORE (R-Texas) has predicted that funding could end up in the December spending bill. Government funding One of the first deadlines lawmakers face is Dec. 8, when government funding will expire. With Congress returning on Nov. 27, they’ll have less than two weeks to craft legislation to avoid a shutdown. In the Senate, tax reform is expected to consume much of the first week. Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanTrump sends mixed signals on Syria amid calls for action Ryan: ‘Responsible nations’ can’t tolerate chemical attack in Syria House GOP super PAC contacts more than 300K voters in midterm push MORE (R-Wis.) has floated that lawmakers might need to pass a short-term continuing resolution to give appropriators more time to reach a long-term agreement. But Ryan said the stopgap bill would only last a few weeks. He wants to pass a full 2018 fiscal year funding bill by the end of December. Complicating the timeline for passing a long-term funding bill are the spending caps. Current spending levels are higher than the 2018 caps set by the 2011 Budget Control Act. Without a deal to raise the caps, across-the-board spending cuts would be triggered automatically in late January. Congressional leaders are eyeing a deal to raise budgetary caps by as much as 200 billion over two years, but the agreement is still being ironed out. Immigration The fate of an Obama-era immigration program has emerged as one of the largest hurdles to getting a government funding deal. The Trump administration is nixing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows certain undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children to work and go to school without the fear of deportation. The deadline for deciding what to do about DACA isn’t until mid-March, but Democrats are demanding that Congress take action before the end of the year. Trump and Senate Republicans decided during a closed-door meeting last month that immigration would not be part of the spending bill, but House Democrats plan to force the issue. Without Democratic support, it could prove difficult for House Republicans to pass legislation preventing a government shutdown. Several liberal senators are also pledging to oppose a funding bill without a DACA agreement. Intelligence reforms Lawmakers face an end-of-the-year deadline to renew a key surveillance program, but they face opposition from privacy hawks. Both chambers have taken steps toward reauthorizing, and reforming, the National Security Agency’s warrantless surveillance program, which is set to expire on Dec. 31. The provision authorizing the surveillance program, known as Section 702, allows the government to collect emails and text messages sent by foreign spies, terrorists and other foreign targets overseas. Both the House Judiciary Committee and Senate Intelligence Committee have voted to advance their own proposals, but both measures are expected to face a contentious floor fight. The Freedom Caucus in the House is pledging to oppose the Judiciary panel’s bill over what they argue are unacceptable breaches of Fourth Amendment protections. Meanwhile, Sens.

Flood Insurance Congress will need to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program by early December. The House passed its bill, the product of months of negotiations between conservatives and Republicans from coastal states, earlier this month. The legislation would renew the program for five years, update federal flood mapping requirements and seek to bolster an emerging private flood insurance market. But the Senate has yet to take steps toward reauthorizing the program or lay out a path forward for potential legislation. Lawmakers have until Dec. 8 to work out an agreement after a roughly three-month extension was included in the government-funding and debt-ceiling deal passed in September. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"As 2017 draws to a close, the US Congress faces several high-stakes legislative battles with a packed agenda in December. Among the key issues are Republican efforts to pass a tax reform bill, with Senators Susan Collins and Ron Johnson emerging as potential holdouts. The consensus view is that Collins wants to give her support, and Johnson can be swayed by Senator Steve Daines, as they share similar concerns. Meanwhile, the government faces a shutdown if Congress doesn't craft legislation to keep it funded past the December 8 deadline. Other challenges involve healthcare reform, spending caps, immigration, intelligence reforms, and flood insurance. In the tax reform battle, GOP leaders had hoped to get 50 votes prior to Thanksgiving, but this did not materialize. Nevertheless, even the most pessimistic sources believe the political urgency to produce a result will override the holdouts' concerns. Republican Senators seem unfazed by the poor polling for this tax package, seeing it as necessary to avoid entering the 2018 election season with no major accomplishments. The healthcare debate is closely tied to the tax plan, as the Senate GOP tax proposal seeks to repeal the Obamacare individual mandate. Senator Susan Collins has voiced her concerns about linking the mandate repeal with the tax reform, potentially making it more challenging to get the bill through Congress. The Trump administration has signaled that they are open to dropping the Obamacare provision if it proves to be an obstacle in passing the legislation. The ultimate fate of this healthcare policy may depend on a deal between GOP leaders and legislative proposals from Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray. Government shutdown looms as a threat if Congress fails to craft legislation by the December 8 deadline. Speaker Paul Ryan has suggested that a short-term continuing resolution might be necessary to give appropriators more time to reach a long-term agreement. Immigration issues, particularly the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, complicate negotiations on government funding, as Democratic demands for action on DACA conflict with the Republican agenda. Congress also faces an end-of-year deadline to renew the National Security Agency's Section 702 surveillance program, which has been met with opposition from privacy advocates. Competing bills are up for consideration in the House and Senate, with members of the Freedom Caucus and Senators such as Rand Paul and Ron Wyden pushing for alternative legislation. Lastly, the National Flood Insurance Program is up for reauthorization by early December. The House has passed a bill to renew the program for five years, but the Senate has yet to take any action, and lawmakers only have until December 8 to reach an agreement."},{"instruction":"What is the final step of the following process: - The organism must die to begin the process - The soft tissue decomposes - The bones are left behind - Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil The answer to this question is:","output":"The final step of this process is the exposure and discovery of the fossil."},{"instruction":"Add spaces: solo,bigtits,chubby,toys,electro,blowjob,amateur","output":"Okay!

Aliquippa Police Chief Donald Couch Jr. said the loaded .22-caliber revolver was found Monday morning inside a backpack, but they are sure the student meant no harm. Superintendent David Wytiaz told parents that another student told a teacher about the weapon inside a backpack. Administrators at Aliquippa Elementary School secured the firearm and turned it over to Aliquippa police. “It's a very unique situation,” Police Chief Donald Couch Jr. said. “As far as the circumstances, how it got there, I can't go into that.” Police have contacted the child's mother and her boyfriend to determine whether any criminal charges are warranted. The gun came from the boy's home and is registered to someone born in 1914 who police think is dead. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf visited the school that day at around 2:15 p.m. “I can stress that at no time were any students in danger,” Couch said. “We are definitely sure there was no ill will by the student towards anyone.” Wytiaz reiterated that point. “We believe at this point, there was no threat made or anything like that,” Wytiaz said. “The gun was removed without anyone seeing it.” Channel 11’s Gordon Loesch reported the child who had the gun is 5 or 6 years old. The boy’s family told Channel 11’s Courtney Brennan that the boy wasn’t being aggressive. He simply was trying to protect his younger brothers. “For them to say he’s aggressive, that’s a lie,” said his godmother, Nicole Lutle. “It’s not that this child was bad. It’s not that this child had a temper because all of that is a lie.” According to Lutle and other family friends, the boy found the gun on a bed inside his apartment in the Linmar Terrace housing complex Sunday night. “He picked it up because he didn’t want his little brother to get to it,” Lutle said. “He knew his little brother wouldn’t go through his book bag, so he put it in his book bag and forgot it was in there. The boy’s younger brother is 3 years old. “He’s a very sweet kid. He wasn’t taking the gun to school to hurt anyone,” Lutle said. Lutle doesn't condone what happened but said this kindergartener and his siblings need help. “We have to show these kids more love because if we don’t show them, what do they think they have?\\" she said. On Tuesday, several parents told Channel 11’s Gordon Loesch that they’re angry and fearful after the incident. “My son, they all ride the bus together. I feel really scared for him,” said Darryce McCoy. A letter was sent home to parents Tuesday, but some said they should have been notified sooner. “That’s not good enough.

It was found in a 5-year-old's backpack in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, after a classmate told the teacher about it. These kids are in kindergarten. And there was a loaded gun in a kindergarten student's backpack. Terrifying. The boy was suspended, but I don't think he should have been. He has a very good reason why he brought the gun to school. The child said he found it on a bed in his house and didn't want his 3-year-old brother to get it, so he packed it in a place he thought was safe. The child's grandmother, Nicole Lutle, spoke to WPXI and said: He put it in his book bag and forgot it was in there .... For them to say he’s aggressive, that’s a lie. It’s not that this child was bad. It’s not that this child had a temper because all of that is a lie. This whole story is worrisome on so many levels. I have 5-year-old twins who are in kindergarten. The thought of either of them somehow handling a loaded gun scares me to my core. The thought of them being in a classroom where another child brings in a gun is equally frightening. I am so thankful this story didn't turn out worse. But I also do not think this child should be suspended -- his parents should be. They should be charged somehow. If what this child said was true, he was protecting his 3-year-old brother. He didn't want him to get the gun, which was reportedly loaded and lying on a bed in their home. That decision may have saved this boy's brother's life. Of course there are so many ways this could have played out and thank everything everywhere that no one was harmed. Kids and guns do not mix in my opinion. Ever. Not even at a shooting range -- the story of a 9-year-old accidentally killing her firing range instructor is proof of that. But I just can't stop thinking about a loaded gun lying on a bed with a 3- and 5-year-old in the home. I can't stop thinking that what this kid did was sincerely what he thought was the right thing. What do you think? Should the child be suspended? Should any action be taken against the parents?

The caps do not self digest as do those of Coprinellus and Coprinopsis . Some also have brown spores rather than black . These fungi are often drab - colored , difficult to identify , and inedible , and so they are sometimes considered uninteresting . However they are quite common and can occur at times when there are few other mushrooms to be seen . The first report of a gilled mushroom fruiting underwater is Psathyrella aquatica . The genus name Psathyrella is a diminutive form of Psathyra , derived from the Greek word meaning \`\` friable '' , psathuros ( ) - Psathyrella aquatica is a species of fungus from Oregon, first described in the journal \\"Mycologia\\" in 2010. It represents the first ever report of a basidiomycete fruiting underwater. - The Agaricaceae are a family of basidiomycete fungi and include the genus \\"Agaricus\\", as well as basidiomycetes previously classified in the families Tulostomataceae, Lepiotaceae, and Lycoperdaceae. - Coprinus comatus, the shaggy ink cap, lawyer's wig, or shaggy mane, is a common fungus often seen growing on lawns, along gravel roads and waste areas. The young fruit bodies first appear as white cylinders emerging from the ground, then the bell-shaped caps open out. The caps are white, and covered with scalesthis is the origin of the common names of the fungus. The gills beneath the cap are white, then pink, then turn black and secrete a black liquid filled with spores (hence the ink cap name). This mushroom is unusual because it will turn black and dissolve itself in a matter of hours after being picked or depositing spores. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Coprinus is a small genus of mushroom-forming fungi consisting of \\"Coprinus comatus\\" (the shaggy mane) and several of its close relatives. Until 2001, \\"Coprinus\\" was a large genus consisting of all agaric species in which the lamellae autodigested to release their spores. (The black ink-like liquid this would create gave these species their common name \\"inky cap\\".) Molecular phylogenetic investigation found that \\"Coprinus comatus\\" was only a distant relative of the other members of \\"Coprinus\\", and was closer to genera in the Agaricaceae. Since \\"Coprinus comatus\\" is the type species of \\"Coprinus\\", only that species and its close relatives \\"C. sterquilinus\\" and \\"C. spadiceisporus\\" retained the name of the genus. - Basidiomycota is one of two large divisions that, together with the Ascomycota, constitute the subkingdom Dikarya (often referred to as the \\"higher fungi\\") within the kingdom Fungi. - Mycologia is a peer-reviewed scientific journal that publishes papers on all aspects of the fungi, including lichens. It first appeared as a bimonthly journal in January 1909, published by the New York Botanical Garden under the editorship of William Murrill. It became the official journal of the Mycological Society of America, which still publishes it today. It was formed as a merger of the \\"Journal of Mycology\\" (14 volumes; 18851908) and the \\"Mycological Bulletin\\" (7 volumes; 1903-1908). The \\"Mycological Bulletin\\" was known as the \\"Ohio Mycological Bulletin\\" in its first volume. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The Psathyrellaceae are a family of dark-spored agarics that generally have rather soft, fragile fruiting bodies, and are characterized by black, dark brown, rarely reddish, or even pastel-colored spore prints. About 50% of species produce fruiting bodies that dissolve into ink-like ooze when the spores are mature via autodigestion. Prior to phylogenetic research based upon DNA comparisons, most of the species that autodigested were classified as Coprinaceae, which contained all of the inky-cap mushrooms. However, the type species of \\"Coprinus\\", \\"Coprinus comatus\\", and a few other species, were found to be more closely related to Agaricaceae. The former genus \\"Coprinus\\" was split between two families, and the name \\"Coprinaceae\\" became a synonym of Agaricaceae in its 21st-century phylogenetic redefinition. Note that in the 19th and early 20th centuries the family name Agaricaceae had far broader application, while in the late 20th century it had a narrower application. The family name Psathyrellaceae is based on the former Coprinaceae subfamily name Psathyrelloideae. The type genus \\"Psathyrella\\" consists of species that produce fruiting bodies which do not liquify via autodigestion. \\"Psathyrella\\" remained a polyphyletic genus until it was split into several genera including 3 new ones in 2015. \\"Lacrymaria\\" is another genus that does not autodigest its fruiting bodies. It is characterized by rough basidiospores and lamellar edges that exude beads of clear liquid when in prime condition, hence the Latin reference, \\"lacryma\\" (tears). - An agaric or is a type of mushroom fungus fruiting body characterized by the presence of a pileus (cap) that is clearly differentiated from the stipe (stalk), with lamellae (gills) on the underside of the pileus. \\"Agaric\\" can also refer to a basidiomycete species characterized by an agaric-type fruiting body. Archaically agaric meant 'tree-fungus' (after Latin \\"agaricum\\"); however, that changed with the Linnaean interpretation in 1753 when Linnaeus used the generic name \\"Agaricus\\" for gilled mushrooms. - Coprinopsis is a genus of mushrooms in the family Psathyrellaceae. \\"Coprinopsis\\" was split out of the genus \\"Coprinus\\" based on molecular data. The species \\"Coprinopsis cinerea\\" (=\\"Coprinus cinereus\\") is a model organism for mushroom-forming basidiomycota, and its genome has recently been sequenced completely. - Coprinellus is a genus of mushroom-forming fungi in the family Psathyrellaceae.

Some parents were killed, others were unharmed when soldiers came calling. Investigators examined period between 1977 and 1989, 'peak' adoption period. Reports says many more could have been taken, investigation underway. Article:","output":"Title: Tragic Truth: Children Stolen for Foreign Adoption in the 20th Century Revealed by Report Introduction In recent years, reports have been surfacing about the dark history involving the stealing and trafficking of children for adoption in various countries across Europe and North America. A new investigative report has recently shed light on this tragic issue and the heart-wrenching stories of innocent families torn apart during the peak adoption period between 1977 and 1989. This astonishing discovery has unveiled the untold horrors faced by countless children and their families, and pushed for a thorough investigation into this deeply rooted problem. Paragraph 1: Countries and Adoption Trends The report highlights cases in countries like the United States, Sweden, Italy, and France, where desperate couples seeking to adopt a child often unwittingly became accessories to this illicit industry. The children, many of whom were unaware of their backgrounds, were taken from their families and put up for adoption against the wishes of their birth parents. The investigation focuses on the peak adoption period between 1977 and 1989, with the report surmising that so many more children may have been taken from their families during this time. Paragraph 2: Parents' Survival Rates In chilling detail, the report describes the events that unfolded when soldiers came calling to take these innocent children from their homes. Some parents were tragically killed, further illustrating the brutality of these abductions. The parents who were spared met with other unimaginable horrors, as they were forced to watch their children being taken away from them. In the aftermath, several distraught families spent years desperately searching for their loved ones. Paragraph 3: Ongoing Investigations An ongoing investigation has been launched to determine the extent of these abductions and to identify those involved in these criminal activities. As the truth continues to unravel, it is becoming increasingly apparent that this problem is rooted far deeper than initially thought. It also speaks volumes to the corruption and lack of oversight in the adoption process in the past. Conclusion: Hope for Justice With this new report, light has been shed on one of the most tragic cases of child abduction and human trafficking in modern history. As the investigation progresses, victims and their families can finally begin to seek justice, and governments worldwide need to address and learn from these painful lessons of the past. The ongoing investigation will hopefully aim to reunite families that were systematically separated and ensure that measures are put in place to prevent future tragedies of this nature."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)?

Define advertising: Advertising is a form of communication intended to persuade an audience (viewers, readers, or listeners) to take some action (purchase a product, attend an event, etc.) It typically involves the promotion of products, services, or ideas, using paid media space. 2. State governments: State governments are the governing bodies of individual states in a country, with their own legislative, executive, and judiciary branches. 3. Channel of communication: A channel of communication refers to a medium or pathway through which information is transmitted from one party to another. Now, let's evaluate the given statement using our definitions. \\"Advertising offers a channel of communication between two state governments.\\" - Advertising typically targets specific audiences, promoting products, services, or ideas but does not specifically mention communication between two state governments as a primary purpose. - State governments usually communicate using official channels (like diplomatic means, correspondence via respective departments, or intergovernmental meetings) rather than advertising space.

India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.\\" Answer: A:","output":"The desired solution in the context of Indian independence was to address the demands and concerns of both the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League while ensuring a peaceful transition of power. The steps taken in an attempt to reach this solution were: 1. Recognizing the pressing need for Indian independence: The Labour government, led by Clement Attlee, made it a priority to address Indian independence following their election in 1945. 2. Acknowledging the differing positions of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League: Congress wanted a unified secular Indian state, while the Muslim League sought a separate Muslim state in Muslim-majority regions. 3. Assessing the urgency of the situation: With increasing civil unrest and potential for civil war, the British government realized that a swift resolution was necessary, leading to Attlee promising independence by 1948 and Lord Mountbatten bringing the date forward to 15 August 1947. 4. Partitioning India based on religious demographics: To address the concerns of both parties, the British drew borders to broadly separate Hindu and Muslim areas, which ultimately led to the creation of two independent states, India and Pakistan. 5. Ensuring the independence of other nations previously under British influence: Burma and Sri Lanka gained their independence in 1948, with India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka becoming members of the Commonwealth. However, it is important to note that the desired solution did not entirely mitigate the issues at hand, as it led to mass migrations, violence, and the loss of lives among the Hindu and Muslim communities."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Polish.

The two executives had a phone conversation last week, the sources said. Discussions involving lower-level officials of the two companies are also ongoing. Page and Cook are expected to talk again in the coming weeks, though no firm date has been set, the sources said on Thursday. One of the sources told Reuters that a meeting had been scheduled for this Friday, but had been delayed for reasons that were unclear. The two companies are keeping lines of communication open at a high level against the backdrop of Apple's legal victory in a patent infringement case against Samsung, which uses Google's Android software. Last Friday, a jury awarded Apple 1.05 billion in damages and set the stage for a possible ban on sales of some Samsung products in a case that has been widely viewed as a \\"proxy war\\" between Apple and Google. One possible scenario under consideration could be a truce involving disputes over basic features and functions in Google's Android mobile software, one source said. But it was unclear whether Page and Cook were discussing a broad settlement of the various disputes between the two companies, most of which involve the burgeoning mobile computing area, or are focused on a more limited set of issues. Competition between Google and Apple has heated up in recent years with the shift from PCs to mobile devices. Google's Android software, which Apple's late founder Steve Jobs denounced as a \\"stolen product,\\" has become the world's No.1 smartphone operating system. The popularity of the software has been in tandem with patent infringement lawsuits involving various hardware vendors who use it, including Samsung and HTC. The latest complaint was filed by Motorola Mobility, now a unit of Google, against Apple at the U.S. International Trade Commission claiming some features of Apple's devices infringe on its patents. A previous lawsuit between the two in a Chicago court was thrown out by a federal judge, who said neither side could prove damages. Apple in recent months has moved to lessen its reliance on Google's products. Apple recently unveiled its own mobile mapping software, replacing the Google product used in the iPhone, and said it would no longer offer Google's YouTube as a pre-loaded app in future versions of its iPhone. Cook took the helm at Apple a year ago, and Page stepped into the top job at Google a few months before that. The conversation between Page and Cook last week did not result in any formal agreement, but the two executives agreed to continue talking, according to one source. Google's Larry Page, who sat out several public speaking engagements earlier this summer because of an unspecified medical condition affecting his voice, has continued to run Google's business. Apple and Google declined to comment on any discussions. (Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic and Poornima Gupta with additional reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Jonathan Weber, Martin Howell and Leslie Gevirtz) ||||| CNET confirms that Google CEO Larry Page and Apple CEO Tim Cook have held at least one conversation and plan to talk again in bid to settle lingering patent disputes. Maybe Google got the hint after watching what happened to Samsung last week, but CNET has confirmed that the CEOs of Apple and Google have held at least one conversation in a bid to resolve the myriad intellectual property and patent disputes between the companies. Apple's CEO Tim Cook and Google's Larry Page talked before last week's verdict in the Samsung-Apple trial and plan to talk in a few weeks, according to a person familiar with dealings. The news of the conversations between the two CEOs was first reported by Reuters. Reuters also reported that talks are also taking place between the companies at a lower echelon. Google declined comment. We've reached out to Apple and will update the post when we hear back. But you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind's blowing. After its one-sided court victory last week over Samsung in a landmark copy infringement lawsuit, Apple has added incentive to press its legal claims against other computer makers who use Google's Android operating system. When the Samsung decision got announced last Friday afternoon, Google immediately attempted to distance itself from the case, declaring that most of the patents in question \\"don't relate to the core Android operating system.\\" Given the lopsided nature of Samsung's legal defeat, Google may believe the prospects of an Apple lawsuit are higher than they were just a week ago. \\"Theoretically they could hold Google responsible for all of the harm that Android allegedly causes to Apple, but it's a much more difficult story to tell to a judge and, especially, a jury,\\" noted Florian Mueller, a legal analyst who writes a widely-read blog about intellectual property and patent law. \\"It's also more difficult to get an injunction against someone who doesn't compete with you directly, only indirectly.\\" Meanwhile, the repercussions of Apple-Samsung are still reverberating. Earlier this week, the Korea Times reported that Samsung and several U.S. carriers were seeking to find ways to modify their designs to avoid further legal entanglements with Apple. Of more direct concern to Apple, the paper also reported considering warming up to Microsoft and reducing its reliance upon Google's Android platform.\\" The companies are already involved in litigation through Google's ownership of Motorola Mobility. A couple of weeks back, Motorola Mobility filed another lawsuit against Apple in a move to block the company from importing the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and certain Macs. This was part of a longer back-and-forth patent fight that's raged for years between Apple and Motorola. At the same time, the companies were able to reach a tentative deal a few days ago to license out certain Motorola patents to Apple. |||||Summary:","output":"Google CEO Larry Page and Apple CEO Tim Cook have had behind-the-scenes talks about intellectual property issues, including mobile patent disputes.

Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että Euroopan komission ja muiden EU:n toimielinten tulee huolehtia siitä, että elintarviketurvallisuuteen liittyvät kysymykset ja varotoimet otetaan huomioon kansainvälisissä neuvotteluissa ja sopimuksissa. Ennalta varautumisen periaate on keskeinen osa tätä prosessia, sillä se tähtää mahdollisten terveys- ja ympäristövaikutusten minimoimiseen ennen kuin niistä aiheutuu suurempaa haittaa. Komission ja muiden EU-toimielinten rooliin kuuluu myös jäsenvaltioiden ja Euroopan unionin politiikkojen koordinointi elintarviketurvallisuuden alalla. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että toimielinten tulee etsiä yhteisiä lähestymistapoja ja ratkaisuja sekä auttaa jäsenmaita toteuttamaan tehokkaita ja yhtenäisiä politiikkoja tällä alueella. Koordinoinnin avulla varmistetaan, että Euroopan unionissa pyritään johdonmukaisesti ja tehokkaasti parantamaan elintarviketurvallisuutta koskevia normeja ja valvontaa. Samalla se mahdollistaa resurssien jakamisen ja osaamisen vaihdon sekä kansallisen ja EU-tason politiikkojen välisen synergian hyödyntämisen. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että Euroopan komission ja Euroopan toimielinten rooli elintarviketurvallisuuden erityistapauksessa keskittyy ennalta varautumisen periaatteen neuvottelemiseen kansainvälisten sopimusten puitteissa sekä jäsenvaltioiden ja Euroopan unionin politiikkojen koordinointiin. Tämä toiminta auttaa vahvistamaan EU:n elintarviketurvallisuuden tason ja turvaamaan kansalaisten hyvinvointia ympäristön ja terveyden suojelun osalta."},{"instruction":"Please write a short summary for the following article: Key Members of Both Parties Criticize Holder Decision to Look Into Alleged CIA Abuse of Detainees Senior Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill voiced their dissatisfaction Tuesday with Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.'s decision to appoint a special prosecutor to examine CIA interrogators' alleged abuse of terrorism suspects earlier this decade. Leading Republicans denounced the appointment of John H. Durham, a career prosecutor, saying it will hinder intelligence-gathering in the fight against terrorists, while top Democrats criticized the investigation as too limited. They renewed calls for an independent review of most of the controversial anti-terrorism policies adopted by George W. Bush's administration. Holder had no new comment Tuesday on the matter. The attorney general issued a lengthy statement Monday explaining his decision and acknowledging that it could engender \\"controversy.\\" But he concluded that he had no other choice than to order a preliminary review of about 10 cases of alleged detainee abuse. House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) decried that in a statement Tuesday, saying: \\"The men and women who protect this country should never have to worry that they will face criminal prosecution as a result of a political election. The Obama administration's decision smacks more of a witch hunt designed to satisfy political allies than a strategy to keep the American people safe.\\" Boehner added that the inquiry will \\"have a chilling effect on the ability of our intelligence professionals to do their jobs.\\" His words echoed the sentiments of senior Senate Republicans, eight of whom wrote a letter of protest to Holder on Monday evening. \\"We fear that the true cost of this endeavor will ultimately be borne by the American people, who rely on the intelligence community, operating without distraction, to protect them from the many threats, known and unknown, that our country faces in this post-9/11 world,\\" the group wrote. Those signing the letter included Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl (Ariz.); Christopher S. Bond (Mo.), the ranking Republican on the intelligence committee; and Jeff Sessions (Ala.), the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee. They also questioned why the case was handed to Durham instead of an internal Justice Department lawyer, saying that previous independent prosecutors have taken \\"an expansive view of their investigative authority.\\" Democrats largely applauded Durham's appointment, but some urged that the inquiry extend beyond the actions of the interrogators who were accused of going further than the Bush administration's guidelines allowed when questioning detainees. A key area of concern for many Democrats is learning what Bush's most senior advisers knew about the interrogation policies. \\"The abuses that were officially sanctioned amounted to torture, and those at the very top who authorized, ordered or sought to provide legal cover for them should be held accountable,\\" said Sen. Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), a senior member of the intelligence and judiciary panels. Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) cited Monday's release of a 2004 report from the CIA inspector general on the treatment of detainees in renewing his call for a \\"commission of inquiry,\\" an independent review of all Bush-era policies against alleged terrorists. \\"Who justified these policies? What was the role of the Bush White House? How can we make sure it never happens again?\\" he said. Leahy's proposed commission has been opposed by Republicans and has divided Democrats, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) endorsing the approach and Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.) opposing it. President Obama rejected the call for such a panel in the spring, saying he wanted his administration to \\"look forward\\" and not spend time in a partisan dispute about the previous administration. Liberal legal scholars and activists also said Holder did not go far enough in pushing the investigation, leaving off the hook top Bush advisers as well as Justice Department lawyers whose legal memos created the foundation for the harsh techniques employed in the interrogations. \\"It's pretty clear that his intention is not to investigate the lawyers and Cabinet-level officials who approved the program in the first place,\\" said Georgetown University law professor David Cole, referring to Holder. \\"If that's what's done, then it's really a matter of scapegoating rather than true accountability.\\" Cole, who wrote a book that looks at the Justice Department's \\"torture memos,\\" gave the attorney general credit for bucking the president's desire to move forward. But he added, \\"It seems to me a good-faith application of the law would go much farther.\\" \\"It's a good first step, but it's not, in and of itself, enough,\\" said Tom Parker, the policy director for terrorism and human rights at Amnesty International, referring to the preliminary inquiry. \\"We're certainly pleased to see the most egregious cases getting attention, but we don't think it goes far enough.\\"","output":"Senior Democrats and Republicans expressed dissatisfaction over Attorney General Eric H.

Question: What was Die Alpen? Context: Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the first of many to present the Alps as a place of allure and beauty, banishing the prevalent conception of the mountains as a hellish wasteland inhabited by demons. Rousseau's conception of alpine purity was later emphasized with the publication of Albrecht von Haller's poem Die Alpen that described the mountains as an area of mythical purity. Late in the 18th century the first wave of Romantics such as Goethe and Turner came to admire the scenery; Wordsworth visited the area in 1790, writing of his experiences in The Prelude. Schiller later wrote the play William Tell romanticising Swiss independence.

Pre-process the tweet text: Before analyzing the sentiment of the text, I need to pre-process it. This includes converting the text to lowercase, removing punctuations, and removing unnecessary words or stop words. Here's the pre-processed text: \\"off pick car finally\\" 2. Analyze the sentiment: To determine whether the tweet is positive or negative, I need to analyze the sentiment of the pre-processed text. I will do this by assessing the strength of the words in the tweet. 3. Assign scores to words: I'll use a sentiment lexicon (a list of words with assigned sentiment scores) to determine the sentiment score of each word in the tweet. Positive words will have a positive score, while negative words will have a negative score. In the absence of actual values from a predetermined lexicon, I will assign approximate sentiment scores to the words for this demonstration. Here are the approximate scores for each word in the tweet based on their sentiment: off = 0 (neutral) pick = 0 (neutral) car = 0 (neutral) finally = 1 (positive) 4. Calculate the overall sentiment score: I'll sum up the sentiment scores for each word in the tweet to get an overall score. If the overall score is greater than zero, I'll classify the tweet as positive. If it's less than zero, I'll classify the tweet as negative. If the overall score is equal to zero, it will be classified as neutral. Overall Sentiment Score = 0+0+0+1 = 1 5.

The four leagues universally included in the definition are Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), and the National Hockey League (NHL). Other prominent leagues include Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Canadian Football League (CFL). - The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner. Originally commissioned in 1892 as the \\"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\\", the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston, thenGovernor General of Canada, who awarded it to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC, and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, it was established as the \\"de facto\\" championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the \\"de jure\\" NHL championship prize in 1947. - The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. - The Kaministiquia River is a river which empties into western Lake Superior at the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario. \\"Kaministiquia\\" (\\"Gaa-ministigweyaa\\") is an Ojibwe word meaning \\"(river) with islands\\" due to two large islands (McKellar and Mission) at the mouth of the river. The delta has three branches or outlets, reflected on early North American maps in French as \\"les trois rivières\\" (the three rivers): the southernmost is known as the Mission River, the central branch as the McKellar River, and the northernmost branch as the Kaministiquia. Residents of the region commonly refer to the river as the Kam River. - Lake Superior is the largest of the Great Lakes of North America. The lake is shared by the Canadian province of Ontario to the north, the US state of Minnesota to the west, and Wisconsin and Michigan to the south. It is generally considered the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area. It is the world's third-largest freshwater lake by volume and the largest by volume in North America. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Fort William was a city in Northern Ontario, located on the Kaministiquia River, at its entrance to Lake Superior. It amalgamated with Port Arthur and the townships of Neebing and McIntyre to form the city of Thunder Bay in January 1970. Since then it has been the largest city in Northwestern Ontario. The city's Latin motto was \\"A posse ad esse\\" (From a Possibility to an Actuality) featured on its coat of arms designed in 1900 by town officials, \\"On one side of the shield stands an Indian dressed in the paint and feathers of the early days; on the other side is a French voyageur; the center contains an elevator, a steamship and a locomotive, while the beaver surmounts the whole.\\" - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - Peter John Goegan ( b. March 6 , 1934 in Fort William , Ontario - d.

It includes most of subarctic Ontario. Its western boundary is the Canadian province of Manitoba, which disputed Ontario's claim to the western part of the region. Ontario's right to Northwestern Ontario was determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1884 and confirmed by the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. In 1912, the Parliament of Canada by the Ontario Boundaries Extension Act gave jurisdiction over the District of Patricia to Ontario, thereby extending the northern boundary of the province to Hudson Bay. - Northern Ontario is a primary geographic and administrative region of the Canadian province of Ontario; the other primary region being Southern Ontario. The geographic region lies north of Lake Huron (including Georgian Bay), the French River, Lake Nipissing, and the Mattawa River, while the administrative region has several boundaries further south that vary according to federal and provincial government policies and requirements, such as a part of Nipissing District that lies south of the Mattawa River. - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - Thunder Bay is a city in, and the seat of, Thunder Bay District, Ontario, Canada.

Answer: Animals may also be 'grazed' upon; female mosquitos land on hosts briefly to gain sufficient proteins for the development of their offspring. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking for the type of organism that feeds on other animals through grazing. The example provided involves mosquitos landing on hosts to gain proteins. Step 2: Evaluate the answer The answer given provides the example of female mosquitos feeding on hosts. However, the term \\"grazing\\" is typically reserved for organisms that feed on plants and vegetation. Therefore, the answer may not be entirely satisfactory in addressing the question. Step 3: Provide a more appropriate answer In the context of grazing on other animals, the term \\"predator\\" or \\"carnivore\\" would be more fitting than \\"grazer.\\" Predators feed on other animals for sustenance and can include organisms like lions, wolves, or birds of prey.

Not size, of course. I've been in some of the grandest houses in America, and it's readily apparent that no one lives there. Earlier this year, I had dinner in a mud hut in Ethiopia, where we sat on chairs next to the hostess's bed --- a home that had more warmth than any house I've been in since. Now John Edwards is exploring what makes a house a home in his just-released Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. There Edwards writes, \\"This is a book about homes, the values they rest on, the dreams they are filled with, and the people they have shaped. The houses and circumstances are different, but much of what you find inside will be familiar.\\" Whether you're sitting in an airport right now, waiting to fly to your childhood home for Thanksgiving, or in your own home waiting for the s to arrive, you know what he's talking about. We've lived in our townhouse for 21 years. The loose windows make noise in the wind. The fireplace is so shallow it holds only one log. The kitchen window offers a view of the world passing by. It's where friends sit on the kitchen counter drinking wine while dinner is being fixed. I lived there for only 18 years, but it will always be my true home. Even the lamp in the west living room window, which I could see far down the road when driving home late at night, still shines. While all this talk about childhood memories can be warm and comforting, home is whom you're with, not where you are. As Edwards writes, \\"Home is family. Home is safety. Home is faith.\\" Happy homecoming!

Fact 2: Dioxins are the byproducts of combustion processes. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"what can high temperatures cause?\\" with the following options: - symptoms - dioxins - Rise - Pollution - anemia - Allergies - disease - sweating A:","output":"Given the two facts provided - Fact 1: High temperatures can cause an object to combust and Fact 2: Dioxins are the byproducts of combustion processes - we can infer that high temperatures can cause the production of dioxins and ultimately lead to pollution. To answer the question \\"what can high temperatures cause?\\" more comprehensively, let's analyze each of the provided options in relation to the two facts given: 1. Symptoms: Although high temperatures can induce certain symptoms such as sweating or dehydration, this option is not directly related to the given facts about combustion and dioxin production. 2. Dioxins: As stated in Fact 2, dioxins are byproducts of combustion processes. Given that high temperatures can cause an object to combust (Fact 1), it is logical to conclude that high temperatures can result in the production of dioxins. 3. Rise: This option is vague, but if it refers to a rise in temperature, then it could be indirectly related to the facts provided. High temperatures leading to combustion can cause a localized spike in temperature, leading to a rise in the given area. However, this is not a direct consequence of high temperatures as specified in the facts. 4. Pollution: Dioxins, being byproducts of combustion, are known to be harmful to both human health and the environment. Given that high temperatures lead to combustion and the subsequent production of dioxins, it is reasonable to conclude that high temperatures can cause pollution. 5. Anemia: The term anemia refers to a medical condition with a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. While high temperatures could potentially exacerbate anemia symptoms, such as fatigue, there is no direct correlation to the facts provided on combustion and dioxins. 6. Allergies: Allergies are immune system responses to specific substances or environmental factors. High temperatures can contribute to certain allergic reactions, such as those involving pollen, but this option is not directly tied to the facts provided about combustion and dioxin production. 7. Disease: Diseases are typically caused by pathogenic organisms or various other factors. While high temperatures can play a role in disease transmission or the exacerbation of certain symptoms, the given facts on combustion and dioxins do not directly link high temperatures to disease. 8. Sweating: Sweating is a natural response to high temperatures as the body attempts to regulate its internal temperature. While this option is relevant to high temperatures, it is not directly linked to the facts provided on combustion and dioxin production. In conclusion, given the two facts provided, high temperatures can cause the production of dioxins (option 2) and subsequently lead to pollution (option 4). These two options are the most closely related to the given facts about combustion and dioxin production."},{"instruction":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Wearing white is an incredibly easy but effective way to resemble an angel. Wear a long white dress, a white jumpsuit, or white pants with a white shirt. To create a traditional angel look, wear loose clothing – alternatively, wear tighter clothes for a modern look. If you want to stand out, wear a coloured belt or singlet to break up your white clothes. Jewellery is the perfect addition to your angel outfit. Consider wearing silver or gold rings, bracelets, necklaces, earrings, or hairpieces to make your outfit sparkle. For an extra sparkly look, wear silver jewellery that has small crystals in it. The crystals will glitter in the light and look pretty. Wearing white or silver shoes is a great way to make your outfit look cohesive. Wear shoes that you already have or go thrift shopping to find a new pair. Sandals, sneakers, heels, and boots are all good options. If you’re going to be doing a lot of walking, make sure to wear comfy shoes, as it’s hard to feel like an angel if you have sore feet! Bags are great accessories and are also handy for storing your phone, keys, wallet, and other personal items. Consider wearing a white backpack, carrying a handbag, or carrying a clutch to complete your outfit. Be careful where you put your white bag, as white has a habit of attracting dirt! Head to a dress up shop to find the perfect pair of angel wings and a halo. These will make any outfit look truly angelic!

Title: The Witches of Eastwick Movie plot: Alexandra Medford (Cher), Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon), and Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer) are three dissatisfied women living in the picturesque town of Eastwick, Rhode Island. Alex is a sculptor and single mother of one daughter; Jane is a newly divorced music teacher unable to have children; while Sukie has six daughters and works as a columnist for the Eastwick Word, the local newspaper. The three friends all have lost their husbands (Alex's died, Jane's divorced her, and Sukie's abandoned her). Unaware that they are witches, the women unwittingly form a coven where they have weekly get-togethers and share their fantasies about ideal men. A mysterious man (Jack Nicholson) arrives in town and stirs up trouble by buying the town's landmark property: the Lennox Mansion. The arrival of this enigmatic stranger fascinates the townsfolk, all except for Felicia Alden (Veronica Cartwright), the devoutly religious wife of newspaper editor Clyde Alden (Richard Jenkins), Sukie's boss. Felicia senses that this man (whose name is easily forgotten) is up to no good. One night, at one of Jane's music recitals, the strange man appears and makes a spectacle of himself, which leads to more gossip. After the recital, Jane receives a bouquet of flowers with the initial D written on it. This sparks Sukie's memory, finally revealing the man's name as Daryl Van Horne. However, as chaos over the name spreads through the crowd, Sukie's bead necklace inexplicably breaks and falls to the floor, causing Felicia (who had mocked Daryl's name) to trip down a large staircase and break her leg. The following day, Daryl sets out to seduce Alex. As he converses with her, he says insensitive, disgusting, and rude things every time he speaks. Appalled, she tells him off, refuses his amorous advances, and begins to walk out. Before she opens the door, he speaks to her, manipulating her emotions until she eventually agrees. The next morning, Daryl visits the shy and insecure Jane. As the two sit down and share polite conversation, Jane...

It's crucial to do this accurately since the financial crisis in Greece is a significant historical event. The Greek financial crisis began in late 2009. It was triggered by the turmoil of the world-wide Great Recession, structural weaknesses in the Greek economy, and revelations that previous data on government debt levels and deficits were underreported by the Greek government. This crisis resulted in a significant rise of the Greek government-debt, which led to a crisis of confidence, indicated by a widening of bond yield spreads and risk insurance on credit default swaps compared to other countries, especially Germany.

As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Paragraph: Year 2022 would be an interesting year when three comets would get scientists' attention - Comet A, Comet B, and Comet C. Comet A and C are very faint, but Comet B is very bright. Comet A would enter the inner solar system on February 10, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 20, 2022. Comet B would enter the inner solar system on February 18, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 26, 2022. Comet C would never enter the inner solar system.

Maine Coons are susceptible to many dangers, like cars or predators, when they go outdoors. In addition to this, Maine Coons are a large and beautiful breed that are expensive to purchase. While it's rare, people do steal Maine Coons they see outdoors. For your cat's safety, keep it as an indoor cat only. A clean litter box is important to any cat. Maine Coons in particular, due to their long hair, require a clean litter box. Debris from litter can easily get caught in their fur, so clean your litter box daily. Each day, scoop any feces or clumps of urine out of the litter box and add a small amount of fresh litter. Swap the litter out completely once every two to three weeks. When you do so, make sure to scrub out the inside of the box and let it dry before replacing the litter. Maine Coons are one of the most social cat breeds. They do not do well without daily attention. Make sure to give your Maine Coon plenty of love to keep it happy. Maine Coons may follow you around. You can pet them on occasion, but if you're busy they're generally happy to observe you. It's a good idea to pet them and snuggle at the end of the day, when you have time. In addition to keeping your cat active, playing can help you bond with your Maine Coon. Maine Coons, due to their friendly demeanor, generally do well with young children. However, interaction should be supervised. Maine Coons are tolerant of children, as long as kids are taught to handle them gently. Encourage your kids to treat your cat with respect. Let them know they should only handle your cat when it comes to them and should not attempt to grab or restrain a Maine Coon. Young children may sometimes try to dress up an animal, or place it in a toy like a toy high chair or stroller. Maine Coons are more tolerant of this behavior than many house cats, but you should still keep an eye on your kids when they play with your Maine Coon.

Answer:","output":"No, the answer \\"more abundant\\" does not accurately represent a specific protein found within a virus's phospholipid envelope. Instead, a more appropriate answer to this question would be \\"Matrix protein (M protein)\\" or \\"Envelope protein (E protein).\\" These proteins have specific biological functions and are present in the phospholipid envelope of some enveloped viruses. Matrix proteins (M proteins) are structural proteins found in the phospholipid envelope of viruses such as Influenza virus and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acting as connectors between virus's envelope and the nucleocapsid core. M proteins provide structural support and assist in the assembly of new virions. Envelope proteins (E proteins) are also integral components of a virus's phospholipid envelope, primarily involved in host-cell recognition and fusion. This protein plays a crucial role in the early stages of viral infection by facilitating the entry of the virus into the host cell. An example of such envelope proteins can be found in the respiratory syncytial virus and Dengue virus. It is essential to note that not all viruses have a phospholipid envelope; some viruses are non-enveloped and consist of only a protein capsid surrounding their genetic material."},{"instruction":"Write a positive tweet.","output":"\\"🌞 Today is a beautiful day, full of sunshine, smiles, and silly fun!

Allow me to suggest some tips that may help you stick to your decisions creating long- lasting positive change in your life. Telling other people about your plan can help in many ways. First, it is always easier to stick to a decision when you have other people supporting you. Your friends are less likely to tempt you with whatever it is you are trying to control if they know that you made a decision about it. Telling other people about your decision is also helpful in that it keeps us to the pressure on you to try and stick to you plan of action. Choose a measurable and specific decision. Instead of deciding to \\"look better\\" or \\"have a better relationship with so and so\\", choose a more definable decision. Deciding to \\"eat a vegetable every day\\" or \\"go out for coffee once a week with John\\" is much easier to track and assess than a general decision to \\"be a better person\\". Build a reward system. Connected to the last tip of choosing a measurable and specific decision is that when you do accomplish this specific behavior you decided to do, give yourself small rewards along the process. For example, for every week of healthy eating treat yourself with something special. Creative visual aids. A colleague of mine decided one year for his New Year's decision to be more frugal.

Movie title: The Warrior Movie plot: In 1375, a small political envoy travels to China to meet the Ming Emperor. Mistaken for spies, the envoy is arrested. Their prisoner transport is attacked by Mongol marauders, who kill the Chinese guards and allow the Koreans to live. All the Korean ambassadors have died, leaving the inexperienced general to take charge. The soldiers arm themselves and quickly discover that the Mongols have kidnapped the Ming Emperor's daughter. They ambush the Mongols and rescue the princess. Yeo-sol, the former slave of an ambassador, defeats the injured Mongolian general Rambulwha in single combat, but allows him to live and escape.The Koreans flee with the Princess, determined to return her safely to the Ming Emperor to atone for their diplomatic failure. The Mongols pursue, hoping to recover the Princess and marry her to the Yuan Emperor so that he may legitimize his claim over all China. Koreans head for a seaside fortress that the Princess tells them about, where they expect to find safe haven. Along the way, the Koreans pick up a group of Chinese peasants who are also fleeing from the Mongols.Fighting their way through Mongol search parties, the group experiences many internal conflicts stemming from social class, love, and honor. The lower-class soldiers chafe under their poor treatment in comparison to the soldiers of the upper-class. They have little confidence in their young general, and prefer taking orders from their veteran sergeant, Dae-Jung. The Princess has difficulty adjusting to the rough necessities of her position on the run. The General and Yeo-sol become nemeses, competing for the affections of the Princess and exchanging blows on several occasions.The group reaches the fortress, only to find it an abandoned ruin. As the group prepare to mount a last stand, the Princess attempts to give herself up to the Mongols. Yeo-sol and the General recover her, and Yeo-sol is captured. Rambulwha offers a place in his army for Yeo-sol, but as the Mongols mount an offensive, Yeo-sol returns to the Koreans. In the... Answer:","output":"During the final battle in the movie \\"The Warrior,\\" multiple factors backfire on the Koreans, which intensifies the challenges they have to face while trying to protect the Ming Emperor's daughter and return her safely. Some of the key backfires and issues the Koreans encounter during the final battle are: 1. High level of internal conflicts: Throughout the journey, the group faces numerous internal issues and conflicts. These include disparities in social class between the upper-class soldiers and the lower-class ones, which lead to a lack of unity and discontent among the ranks. Tensions are also high between the young general, who lacks the confidence and trust of his soldiers, and the veteran sergeant Dae-Jung, with the soldiers preferring to listen to the latter. Additionally, the romantic rivalry between the general and Yeo-sol for the Princess's affection further undermines the group's cohesion. 2. The fortress being an abandoned ruin: Upon reaching the fortress, they had hoped to find a safe shelter, but instead, they discover that the fortress is not viable for retreating or defending themselves against the pursuing Mongols. The desolate and vulnerable circumstances leave the group ill-prepared for the impending attack. 3. The Princess's attempted sacrifice: Recognizing the desperation and struggle the group faces, the Princess decides to offer herself up to the Mongols in the hope of saving her defenders. However, this move, although well-intentioned, nearly backfires when both Yeo-sol and the general risk their lives to rescue her. In the process, Yeo-sol gets captured by the enemy, putting everyone in even greater danger. 4. Yeo-sol's temporary capture: Although Yeo-sol ultimately returns to the Koreans' side after being captured by the Mongols, his initial capture still represents a significant setback for the group. Rambulwha, the Mongolian general, tries to convince Yeo-sol to join forces with the Mongols, creating a temporary uncertainty about his loyalty. The group remains vulnerable, striving to defend themselves without Yeo-sol's assistance. In summary, the backfires experienced by the Koreans during the final battle are a combination of internal conflicts, external circumstances, and briefly compromised loyalty. These factors make the situation challenging and the battle even more intense, but the Koreans ultimately persevere."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Okay!

Step 1: Understand the situation Adam is spinning a bucket of water in a circle, without any water spilling out. Step 2: Identify the forces involved In this case, the main force to consider is centripetal force, which acts towards the center of the rotation and keeps the bucket and water in circular motion. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between speed and centripetal force Centripetal force is given by the formula: F_c = mv^2/r, where m is the mass of the object (the bucket and water), v is the velocity (or speed) of the object, and r is the radius of the circle. Step 4: Determine the effect of increasing the speed If Adam spins the bucket faster, the velocity (v) in the equation increases.

Consequently, Frederick of Prussia sought more substantial assistance from Britain, as his forces in Germany were left without any outside military support."},{"instruction":"Possible answers: (A). Her wish to save sweet potatoes in Kenya. (B). Her great interest in genetic engineering. (C). Her love for sweet potatoes. (D). Her interest in plant life. Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Scientist Florence Wambugu works with farmers in Kenya, a country in East Africa. She helps them grow bigger and better crops. Wambugu is especially interested in finding simple ways to produce more food. In the past ten years, Wambugu has spent much of her time studying sweet potatoes, which are an important food in her part of Kenya. A virus kept attacking the plants. It stopped the sweet potatoes from growing well. Because of the virus, some farmers lost three quarters of their crops. Wambugu went to war against the virus. Her research for a way to save the sweet potatoes led to a lab in St. Louis, Missouri. The lab mainly works on genes , the chemical \\"computer programs\\" found in the cells of living things. Genes tell a plant to produce pink flowers or an animal to grow black hair. Now scientists have found ways to move genes from one living thing to another. That process is called genetic engineering. Wambugu spent three years in the lab. As a result, she created a sweet potato plant that could fight off the virus. Wambugu tested her research in Kenya, and her plants produced wonderful sweet potatoes. That's just the beginning, Wambugu believes. Genetically modified foods, she thinks, could help farmers in poor countries grow badly needed crops, thus, fewer people will go hungry. Question: What caused Wambugu to set up a lab in St. Louis, Missouri? Answer: A:","output":"Her research for a way to save the sweet potatoes led to a lab in St. Louis, Missouri."},{"instruction":"Kraken Editions is pleased to announce that we will maintain our prices for the year 2010 in the USA.

Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"1. Identify the subject: The subject in the statement is \\"Cunard Line,\\" which is a British-American cruise line. 2. Determine the claim: The statement claims that Cunard Line provides an opportunity to book flight tickets at the lowest possible price. 3. Gather information about the subject: Cunard Line is a cruise line, operating luxury ocean liners that provide transportation and leisure experiences primarily across the Atlantic Ocean. They offer various amenities, entertainment, and accommodations for their passengers. 4. Compare the claim with the subject's core function: The core function of Cunard Line is to offer ocean cruises, not flights. Therefore, their main focus would be on providing passengers with the best possible experience onboard their cruise ships. 5. Assess the validity of the statement: Based on the available information, it is not accurate to say that Cunard Line gives an opportunity to book flight tickets at the lowest possible price, as their primary business is cruise operations, not flight bookings.

Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth. Marlin felt the lines in his own face, the gray in his hair, the chill in his bones. He was too old for this. He set a half dollar on the bar and started for the door. \\"Don't get in a huff,\\" the bartender said. Marlin looked back. \\"Kraamer lives about a mile west of town.

Joe loves the farm and all the things he gets to play around and play on. One day, Joe's father told him not to get near a tractor that was sitting in the field. His father was worried that Joe would climb on it and hurt himself. Joe went out to the field and was feeding the horses and cows. When he was done, he saw the tractor his father told him not to get near. He knew that climbing on the tractor wouldn't hurt anything, so he did. He climbed on to the seat and sat there. Then, he pretended he was his father and pretended that he was driving the tractor. Joe's father saw him playing on the tractor and called for him. Joe heard his father calling for him and got off the tractor really fast. When he did that, he fell off and hurt his arm. Joe was in pain and his father came running to check on him and picked him up and sat him on a bench and asked him why he did that. Joe looked at his father and said, \\"I wanted to be like you.\\" Joe's father gave him a hug and asked him if he wanted to ride with him on the tractor. Joe did and after he got a bandage on his arm, he and his father rode in the field on the tractor. Do you have any questions?","output":"As an AI, I do not have personal emotions or experiences, but I will try to address any questions or concerns you might have about the story. 1. Why did Joe's father initially tell him not to go near the tractor? Joe's father told him not to go near the tractor because he was worried about Joe's safety. Tractors are large, heavy machines, and there was a risk that Joe could injure himself while climbing on or playing around it. 2. Was Joe aware of the potential risks associated with the tractor? Although Joe knew his father had warned him not to go near the tractor, he might not have fully understood the potential dangers associated with it. His curiosity and desire to be like his father may have led him to disregard the warning. 3. How could Joe's father have more effectively communicated the risks to him? Joe's father could have explained the specific dangers associated with playing on the tractor, describing how heavy the machine is, and pointing out other hazards like sharp or moving parts. By educating Joe about the risks, he may have been less likely to disobey. 4. How did Joe's father react when he found Joe playing on the tractor, and why? Joe's father was initially alarmed and upset when he saw Joe disobeying his instructions. However, when he understood that Joe wanted to be like him, it softened his reaction, and he chose to give Joe a hug and turn the situation into a learning opportunity. 5. How did their interaction on the bench help build their father-son relationship? Instead of being solely focused on scolding, Joe's father showed empathy and understanding, acknowledging Joe's intentions were not malicious. By offering to give Joe a tractor ride, his father turned a potential conflict into a bonding moment, strengthening their relationship. 6. How was Joe's curiosity and desire to imitate his father a vital part of his learning process? Children often learn best by imitating the behavior of role models, such as their parents or guardians. Joe's curiosity and desire to imitate his father demonstrate his eagerness to learn new skills and engage with his surroundings. This behavior is essential for his development, both personally and as a future farmer. 7. What lesson can be taken from this story? This story highlights the importance of proper communication, understanding, and empathy in parent-child relationships. Parents must effectively communicate potential risks while also being supportive and fostering their children's growth and curiosity. Additionally, children should learn to trust and follow their parents' guidance, understanding that their advice stems from love and a desire for their safety."},{"instruction":"Information: - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. - Mento is a style of Jamaican folk music that predates and has greatly influenced ska and reggae music. Mento typically features acoustic instruments, such as acoustic guitar, banjo, hand drums, and the rhumba box a large mbira in the shape of a box that can be sat on while played. The rhumba box carries the bass part of the music. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada. - Jimmy Cliff, OM (born James Chambers; 1 April 1948) is a Jamaican ska & reggae musician, multi-instrumentalist, singer and actor. He is the only living musician to hold the Order of Merit, the highest honour that can be granted by the Jamaican government for achievements in the arts and sciences. - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. - \`\` The Harder They Come '' is a reggae song by the Jamaican singer Jimmy Cliff . It was first recorded for the soundtrack of the movie by the same name , in which it is supposed to have been written by the film 's main character , Ivanhoe Martin . \`\` The Harder They Come '' has been covered by many artists and was ranked # 350 on Rolling Stone 's \`\` 500 Greatest Songs of All Time '' . The song is the entrance music for heavyweight boxer Samuel Peter and was played live by Jimmy Cliff on an episode of The Colbert Report . - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles. The island, in area, lies about south of Cuba, and west of Hispaniola (the island containing the nation-states of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Jamaica is the fourth-largest island country in the Caribbean, by area. - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938 November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle. - Toots and the Maytals, originally called The Maytals, are a Jamaican musical group and one of the best known ska and rock steady vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience.

(Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules.

Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes.

He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven.

In reality, these big fish have more to fear from us than we do from them. For many years, people killed countless great white sharks in the waters around the United States. But thanks to conservation efforts, great whites are making a comeback in the U.S. Two recent studies show that the population of these sharks is rising along the east and west coast. Why is the growing population of a killer fish something to celebrate? \\"When you fish too many of them, you start to lose balance in the environment,\\" says shark researcher Tobey Curtis. As the biggest killer, sharks help keep the populations of fish, seals, and other creatures they eat from growing too large. In spite of their importance, great white sharks had long been hunted for their meat and their fins . Then, in 1997, the U.S. government passed a law that didn't allow the hunting of great whites. Afterwards, the numbers of these sharks in the U.S. waters started to increase. The law wasn't the only thing that has helped great whites. Conservationists have also played a part in the sharks' comeback. The research group OCEARCH is using a method called tagging to help change people's attitudes about great white. They let the public follow each shark as it travels the world's oceans. OCEARCH also gives each tagged shark a name to help people form a closer connection with the big fish. The group's most well-known shark is named Katharine. She was tagged last year near Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Since then, thousands of people have tracked Katharine's movements on Twitter and the OCEARCH website. This helps people see sharks in a new way. Chris Fischer, the founder of OCEARCH believes learning to appreciate great whites will encourage people to do more to protect them. Question: The main purpose of the passage is to _ . Options: A: introduce an experiment result B: make an advertisement for OCEARCH C: remind us that big killers are dying out D: inform us that great whites are making a comeback Answer:","output":"D: inform us that great whites are making a comeback"},{"instruction":"Title: Keep moving... nothing to see here....

There are three scenarios: 1. White Dwarf: If the core of the star has a mass below the Chandrasekhar limit (approximately 1.4 solar masses), it will become a white dwarf. A white dwarf is a dense, cooling stellar remnant composed mostly of carbon and oxygen. It no longer undergoes nuclear fusion and cools down over time, eventually becoming a black dwarf, although this process takes longer than the current age of the universe. 2. Neutron Star: If the core of the star has a mass between the Chandrasekhar limit and the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (approximately 2 to 3 solar masses), the core will collapse further under its own gravity and become a neutron star. A neutron star is an extremely dense object consisting almost entirely of neutrons, and it is the result of the pressure from the core's own gravity overcoming the repulsive forces between its protons and electrons. 3. Black Hole: If the core of the star has a mass above the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, it will continue collapsing and form a black hole. A black hole is a region of spacetime with an extremely strong gravitational field, so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. The boundary of a black hole is known as the event horizon, and its core is called the singularity, where the laws of physics break down."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - Portland Bill is a narrow promontory (or bill) at the southern end of the Isle of Portland, and the southernmost point of Dorset, England. One of Portland's most popular destinations, the popular attraction Portland Bill Lighthouse is found in the area. The surrounding coast of Portland, namely Portland Bill and Chesil Beach, have been notorious for the many vessels that became shipwrecked in the area over the centuries. The dangerous coastline, which features shallow reefs and the Shambles sandbank, was proven more hazardous due to the strong tidal race known as the Portland Race. - Stop motion (hyphenated stop-motion when used as an adjective) is an animation technique that physically manipulates an object so that it appears to move on its own. The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a fast sequence. Dolls with movable joints or clay figures are often used in stop motion for their ease of repositioning. Stop motion animation using plasticine is called clay animation or \\"clay-mation\\". Not all stop motion requires figures or models; many stop motion films can involve using humans, household appliances and other things for comedic effect. Stop motion using objects is sometimes referred to as object animation. - Norman Rossington (24 December 1928 21 May 1999) was an English actor best remembered for his roles in \\"The Army Game\\", the \\"Carry On\\" films and the Beatles' film \\"A Hard Day's Night\\". - The Adventures of Portland Bill was a British stop motion animated children 's television series made in 1983 . It was set in a fictional lighthouse on the Guillemot Rock , just off the coast from the fictional village of McGuillycuddy . Norman Rossington provided the voice of all the characters , with Portland Bill acting as the narrator of each episode . - Object animation is a form of stop motion animation that involves the animated movements of any non-drawn objects such as toys, blocks, dolls, etc. which are not fully malleable, such as clay or wax, and not designed to look like a recognizable human or animal character. - Children's television series are television programs designed for and marketed to children, normally broadcast programming scheduled for broadcast during the morning and afternoon when children are awake. They can sometimes run during the early evening, allowing younger children to watch them after school. The purpose of the shows is mainly to entertain and sometimes to educate. - Chesil Beach , sometimes called Chesil Bank, in Dorset, southern England is one of three major shingle structures in Britain. Its toponym is derived from the Old English \\"ceosel\\" or \\"cisel\\", meaning \\"gravel\\" or \\"shingle\\". - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - Clay animation or claymation is one of many forms of stop motion animation.

Test flight was piloted by remote control from Tyndall Air Force Base.","output":"Title: Reconditioned Jets Help Train Pilots with Target Practice Hey kids! Today, we are going to learn about something really interesting called \\"reconditioned jets\\" and how they help train pilots. First, let's understand what a \\"reconditioned jet\\" is. When a jet gets old or is not used anymore, people fix and improve it to make it safe and good to use again. This is called \\"reconditioning\\". These reconditioned jets are very helpful because they can be used for training pilots without using new planes. Now, let's talk about how pilots train with these reconditioned jets. When a pilot is learning how to fly, they need to practice a lot, just like when you learn how to ride a bike. One of the important things that pilots need to learn is \\"target practice\\". It helps them become better pilots by teaching them how to aim and hit a target when they need to. Recently, there was a special test flight with a reconditioned jet. The cool part about this is that the jet was flown by remote control, just like when you play with a remote-controlled toy car. The test flight took place at a place called Tyndall Air Force Base, which is a special place where they teach pilots how to fly. During the test flight, the reconditioned jet flew around, acting as a target for other pilots who are training. Just like how you might practice kicking a ball at a soccer net, the pilots practiced aiming and hitting the reconditioned jet as a target. This helps the pilots get better at flying and learn how to work together as a team. So, as you can see, reconditioned jets are really helpful in teaching pilots how to fly and do their job well. These jets are great because they save money and resources since they use old planes instead of new ones. This way, pilots get to practice and become super skilled at their job, keeping our skies safe and sound."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the location that had a high discharge of 111 cubic feet per second? White Deer Hole Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale mountain region, entirely in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. South and North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain are composed of sedimentary Ordovician rock, while the valley rock is Silurian, with a small Devonian region closer to the river, in the north. The watershed has no deposits of coal, nor natural gas or oil fields. The creek is in a narrow mountain valley with steep slopes in its upper reaches. In its middle and lower reaches it has steep mountain slopes to the south, and a wide valley with rolling hills and gentle slopes to the north. The channel pattern is transitional, with a trellised drainage pattern.From 1961 to 1995, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) operated one stream gauge on White Deer Hole Creek at the Gap Road bridge (upstream of Elimsport), for the uppermost 18.2 square miles (47 km2) of the watershed. The highest yearly peak discharge measured at this site was 4,200 cubic feet (120 m3) per second and the highest yearly peak gauge height was 11.83 feet (3.61 m), both on June 22, 1972, during Hurricane Agnes. The lowest yearly peak discharge in this time period was 135 cubic feet (3.8 m3) per second and the lowest yearly peak gauge height was 4.29 feet (1.31 m), both on November 26, 1986. The USGS also measured discharge at Allenwood, very near the creek's mouth, as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975. The average discharge was 70.4 cubic feet (1.99 m3) per second, and ranged from a high of 111 cubic feet (3.1 m3) per second to a low of 33 cubic feet (0.93 m3) per second. There are no other known stream gauges on the creek. Answer:","output":"The location that had a high discharge of 111 cubic feet per second is Allenwood, very near the creek's mouth."},{"instruction":"How will Trump or Clinton presidency affect foreign students?

The first question, \\"How will Trump or Clinton presidency affect foreign students?\\", is a broad inquiry into the impact of both Trump and Clinton's presidencies on foreign students.

(February 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino), a defense attorney in Baltimore, is in jail on a contempt of court charge after punching Judge Henry T. Fleming (John Forsythe) while arguing the case of Jeff McCullaugh (Thomas G. Waites). McCullagh was stopped for a minor traffic offence, but then mistaken for a killer of the same name and has already spent a year and a half in jail; Fleming has repeatedly stymied Kirkland's efforts to have the case reviewed. Though there is strong new evidence that Jeff is innocent, Fleming refuses McCullaugh's appeal due to its late submission and leaves him in prison. After being released, Arthur takes another case, that of a transgender Ralph Agee (Robert Christian), arrested for small crime and becoming a victim of the legal system. Arthur pays regular visits to his grandfather Sam (Lee Strasberg) in a nursing home, who is progressively becoming senile. It is revealed that Arthur was abandoned by his parents at a young age, and it was Sam who raised him and put him through law school. Arthur also begins a romance with a legal ethics committee member, Gail Packer (Christine Lahti). Arthur has a friendly relationship with Judge Francis Rayford (Jack Warden), who takes him on a hair-raising ride in his personal helicopter, laughing as he tests how far they can possibly go without running out of fuel, while a terrified Arthur begs him to land. Rayford, a veteran of the Korean War, is borderline suicidal and keeps a rifle in his chambers at the courthouse, a 1911 pistol in his shoulder holster at all times, and eats his lunch on the ledge outside his office window, four stories up. One day, Arthur is unexpectedly requested to defend Fleming, who has been accused of brutally assaulting and raping a young woman.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"In the given scenario, less leaves falling on the ground could affect the process of nest building in birds. This perturbation can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here's a detailed explanation: A bird's nest-building process consists of several stages, as described in the initial question. One of the critical steps involves using leaves, mud, and spider webs to hold the sticks together, essentially forming the nest's structure. When fewer leaves are available on the ground, birds will have a more challenging time finding adequate materials to create a stable and secure nest. However, the lack of leaves does not directly impact the primary steps of picking a high spot and collecting sticks and grasses. It only affects the step where the leaves are utilized as a binding material. The shortage of leaves might force birds to look for alternative materials to maintain the structural integrity of their nests. These alternatives could include other plant materials or even human-made items such as plastic or fabric scraps. While these alternatives can serve as substitutes, their properties might not be as efficient as leaves in providing support and insulation to the nest. In summary, the supposed perturbation of having less or smaller nests resulting from fewer leaves falling on the ground indirectly impacts a step of the process. The lack of leaves affects the nest-building process by altering the availability of ideal binding materials, which can subsequently influence the overall quality and stability of bird nests."},{"instruction":"Question: Read the below conversation.

The listener's response would typically look like this: \\"Sure, these shoes cost XX.XX.

The original sentence is an example of a reduced form, where the verb 'to be' has been omitted, a common occurrence in informal settings and casual conversation. In this case, the verb 'to be' is understood rather than stated explicitly. The sentence still retains its meaning and is generally understood by English speakers without any confusion. By adding \\"are\\" to the original sentence, it becomes a complete sentence with a subject (\\"People\\") and a verb (\\"are milling about\\") while retaining the same meaning. This makes it a true sentence since it reflects an accurate and grammatically-structured representation of the original statement. In summary, both sentences – \\"People milling about after a show\\" and \\"People are milling about after a show\\" – convey the same event and meaning, where people engage in aimless or relaxed movements and interactions following a show. Although the original sentence omits the verb 'to be,' this does not impede the intended meaning, and the addition of 'to be' in the form of \\"are\\" in the second sentence further clarifies the statement and is therefore considered a true sentence."},{"instruction":"Find the right ending to this passage.

Passage:During the Napoleonic wars, Île de France became a base from which the French navy, including squadrons under Rear Admiral Linois or Commodore Jacques Hamelin, and corsairs such as Robert Surcouf, organised raids on British merchant ships. The raids (see Battle of Pulo Aura and Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811) continued until 1810 when the British sent a strong expedition to capture the island. The first British attempt, in August 1810, to attack Grand Port resulted in a French victory, one celebrated on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. A subsequent and much larger attack launched in December of the same year from Rodrigues, which had been captured a year earlier, was successful. The British landed in large numbers in the north of the island and rapidly overpowered the French, who capitulated (see Invasion of Isle de France). In the Treaty of Paris (1814), the French ceded Île de France together with its territories including Rodrigues and Seychelles to Great Britain. The island then reverted to its former name, 'Mauritius'.","output":"Task: Determine whether information from more than one term in the context passage is needed to answer the question.

Context: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it's best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don't forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

Today, we'll talk about something important that happened on May 5th, 2011 in the United Kingdom. Do you know what a vote is? It's when people make a choice about something. On this day, the people living in the United Kingdom (UK) were asked if they wanted to change the way they choose their leaders in something called a \\"General Election.\\" That sounds interesting, right? Let's learn more! A \\"General Election\\" is a big, important event where grown-ups in the UK make choices on who they want to be in charge of making decisions for their country. These people are called Members of Parliament, or MPs for short. Can you imagine? It's like choosing a class leader at school who will make the rules! But, before May 5th, 2011, some people in the UK thought that there was a better way to choose these leaders in the General Election. They believed the old way was not fair for everyone. So, they decided to ask everyone if they wanted to change it, like when you and your friends might vote to decide if you should change the game you are playing during recess. This special vote was called a \\"referendum.\\" During a referendum, everybody gets to make a choice, just like in the General Election, but this time they were choosing whether to change the way the MPs were chosen. It's like if your teachers asked you and your classmates if you want to change the way you pick your class leader, and everyone gets to share their opinion. On May 5th, 2011, the grown-ups in the UK had to answer a big question: \\"Do you want to change how MPs are elected in General Elections?\\" It was just like solving a puzzle at school! They had to think carefully and decide what they believed was best for their country. After the special vote ended, they counted everyone's answers. Guess what, little friends? Most people decided not to change the way they choose MPs in the General Election. So, the old way of choosing leaders stayed the same, and that's how it still is today in the UK. This story about the special vote on May 5th, 2011, teaches us that everyone's opinion is important. When we listen to each other and make choices together, we make our communities better for everyone - just like deciding what game to play at recess! Now, what do you think? If you could vote on something at school, what would you like to change?

Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him.

During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

This is because the absolute values of the numbers are the same as the numbers themselves in this case, and if the absolute value of x is greater than the absolute value of y, then x is greater than y. So, (A) must be true. (B) y^2 > x^2 As we established in option (A), x > y. When you square both sides of this inequality (since both x and y are positive), you get x^2 > y^2. This is the opposite of what option (B) states, so (B) is false. (C) x^3 > y^2 Since x > y and both x and y are positive, when you cube x, it will also be greater than y^2. Cubing a positive number doesn't change the direction of the inequality, so (C) must be true. (D) –x < y Since x > 0, -x will be negative.

Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E.

White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

She was 98 and lived in Hartsdale, N.Y. The death was confirmed by her daughter, Helen Tunick. Though no longer a household name, Ms. Carroll was at midcentury a regular headliner in the country’s best-known theaters and nightclubs. She appeared often on “The Ed Sullivan Show” and had her own short-lived sitcom, “The Jean Carroll Show,” also called “Take It From Me,” broadcast on ABC in the 1953-54 season. A monologist who wrote nearly all her own material, Ms. Carroll found her humor in the stuff of everyday experience: clothing, shopping, social life and family. “The thing that attracted me to my husband was his pride,” one of her best-known bits went. “I’ll never forget the first time I saw him, standing up on a hill, his hair blowing in the breeze  and he too proud to run and get it.” Ms. Carroll, who began her career as a vaudeville dancer in the 1920s, is widely credited with having blazed the trail for legions of female stand-up comics who came after her, including Phyllis Diller, Joan Rivers and Lily Tomlin. In Ms. Carroll’s day, the world of stand-up comedy was thought to be no fit place for a woman. There were female entertainers before her, of course, but few specialized in the solo nightclub acts for which Ms. Carroll became famous. Minnie Pearl, for instance, inhabited a carefully cultivated stage persona. (Ms. Carroll, by contrast, was unabashedly herself.) Fanny Brice appeared mostly in burlesque houses and on radio. Sophie Tucker, though she spiced her acts with risqué humor, was best known as a singer. Perhaps only Moms Mabley, who began performing solo comedy routines in the 1910s, can be considered Ms. Carroll’s true predecessor. But because of her race, Ms. Mabley was confined for much of her career to the network of black vaudeville houses familiarly known as the chitlin circuit, playing to wider audiences only late in life. Genteel by today’s standards, Ms. Carroll’s humor was radical in its day  radical, that is, in the hands of a lone woman with a microphone in front of her and an audience at her command. For a female comic to wield that sort of power was unheard of then, especially in the smoke-filled universe of nightclubs. When Ms. Carroll came to prominence, no woman was expected to sustain a comedy act by herself; traditionally (think of George Burns and Gracie Allen), a woman had a straight man beside her as a counterweight. Nor was she supposed to be hugely attractive: The combination of feminine wit and beauty seemed too potent a cocktail to foist on the American public. Many 20th-century female comics, like Ms. Diller, Lucille Ball and Totie Fields, cultivated public personas that were variously frazzled, madcap or disarmingly dowdy. What was more, they often used their looks as the butt of self-deprecating jokes. Ms. Carroll did none of these things. Extremely attractive, she appeared alone onstage in a shimmering evening dress, dripping diamonds and mink. That in itself was subversive, as were her monologues about being driven crazy by spouse and children, a time-honored staple of male comics. As appropriated by Ms. Carroll, however, the subject discombobulated some audience members. “I used to do that routine about my daughter being a hippie with the dirty sneakers and dirty blue jeans, but why a beard?” Ms. Carroll said in an interview in “Funny Women: American Comediennes, 1860-1985” (McFarland, 1987), by Mary Unterbrink. “And you know, people would actually come to me and say, ‘Does your daughter really have a beard?’ I’d say, ‘No, I made her shave it, but I let her keep the mustache.’ ” Ms. Carroll was born Celine Zeigman in Paris on Jan. 6, 1911, and came to the United States with her family at 18 months. Reared in the Bronx, she began her career in her early teens after a talent agent spotted her dancing in an amateur show. Soon after, she joined the vaudeville circuit as part of a two-boy, two-girl dance act. A natural verbal clown, she later joined the act of the comedian Marty May. In the early 1930s, Ms. Carroll met Buddy Howe, an acrobatic dancer. Joining forces as Carroll and Howe, they toured the country with a dance act punctuated by humorous patter written by Ms. Carroll. The couple married in 1936 and spent the next three years touring Britain. After the United States entered World War II and Mr. Howe was drafted, Ms. Carroll continued as a solo comic, to wide acclaim. On his discharge from the Army, Mr. Howe was prudent enough to realize that the act was better without him and became a talent agent instead. From 1945 to 1959, Ms. Carroll was also a scriptwriter for the CBS radio serial “Our Gal Sunday.” She released an album, “Girl in a Hot Steam Bath,” on the Columbia label in 1960. Mr. Howe, who became chairman of the Creative Management Agency, died in 1981. Ms. Carroll, who was known in private life as Celine Howe, is survived by Ms. Tunick of Carmel, N.Y., and two granddaughters, Susan Hamilton of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and Andrea Ramos of Carmel. Ms. Carroll’s comic gifts were perhaps nowhere more evident than they were one night in May 1948 at the old Madison Square Garden, when she performed at a benefit for the United Jewish Appeal. Israel had been declared a state that month, and after hearing impassioned speeches and the playing of “Hatikvah,” most of the audience was in tears. Then came Ms. Carroll’s turn. It was a delicate spot for a comic to be in, as Mr. Howe recounted in interviews afterward. Unfazed, Ms. Carroll leaned into the microphone. “I’ve always been proud of the Jews, but never so proud as tonight,” she said. “Because tonight I wish I had my old nose back.” Summary:","output":"Jean Carroll, a trailblazing female stand-up comedian from the 1940s and 1950s, passed away at the age of 98. Known for her wit, timing, and unique blend of humor and glamour, Carroll featured regularly in well-known theaters and nightclubs. She also made numerous appearances on “The Ed Sullivan Show” and had her own short-lived sitcom, “The Jean Carroll Show.” Carroll paved the way for many female stand-up comedians, such as Phyllis Diller, Joan Rivers, and Lily Tomlin. She broke the mold for women in comedy, who were often expected to be part of a duo and downplay their attractiveness. Instead, Carroll performed solo on stage, dressed in elegant evening gowns, and wrote her own humorous material based on everyday experiences."},{"instruction":"Paragraph: The film is set in Igloolik in the Eastern Arctic wilderness at the dawn of the first millennium . http://atanarjuat.com/legend/legend_film.php The wind is blowing over a bleak snowy landscape while a man tries to herd away some marauding dogs .

Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess. Does lake Mahoe have more or less chemicals in it than lake Tresco? Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Lake Mahoe has more chemicals in it than Lake Tresco. The presence of the large farm next to Lake Mahoe, where various crops are grown, suggests that there may be a significant use of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides. When rainwater falls, it can pick up these chemicals and create runoff that carries them into nearby bodies of water, like Lake Mahoe. In contrast, Lake Tresco is located near a school, and there is no mention of any agricultural activity in its vicinity. Therefore, it is less likely to have the same level of chemical exposure as Lake Mahoe. As the hint states, high levels of chemicals from agricultural runoff can lead to excessive growth of water plants and algae, which in turn can create dead zones where aquatic life cannot survive. Additionally, contaminated water can infiltrate groundwater and cause issues when it is consumed by humans."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - The Armenian Highlands (also known as the Armenian Upland, Armenian plateau, Armenian tableland, or simply Armenia) is the central-most and highest of three land-locked plateaus.

The answer is:","output":"No, the correct answer is not “turning to silt.” The process you described in your statement, whereby water causes rocks to crack by turning to ice in their openings, is actually called “freeze-thaw weathering” or “ice wedging.” This is a type of mechanical weathering, which contributes to the gradual breakdown of rocks into smaller pieces. Freeze-thaw weathering occurs mainly in environments where the temperature frequently fluctuates above and below the freezing point of water. Here's a more detailed explanation of the process: 1. Water seeps into the small openings, cracks, or pores in rocks. These openings can be a result of natural processes like fracturing, erosion, or pre-existing weathering. 2. When the temperature drops below the freezing point, the water inside these small openings turns into ice. As water freezes, it expands by approximately 9%, exerting tremendous pressure on the rock surrounding it. 3. The force of this expansion causes the cracks to widen and the rock to weaken. This can lead to the disintegration of the rock over time as the process repeats itself through multiple freeze-thaw cycles. 4. In most cases, the broken-down rock material accumulates at the base of the rock or as part of a slope. This debris, known as talus or scree, can vary in size from tiny grains to large boulders. 5. The rock debris may continue to be weathered and eroded through other processes, such as wind and water erosion, chemical weathering, or even further freeze-thaw weathering. To address the term \\"silt,\\" it refers to fine-grained sediment or soil particles, often resulting from the weathering and erosion of rock. However, it is not the process responsible for causing rocks to crack. The term \\"silt\\" is simply a description of the sediment's size and texture, rather than being an active force in the weathering process. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question \\"how does water crack rocks?\\" is not \\"turning to silt,\\" but rather through the process of freeze-thaw weathering, in which the expansion of water as it turns to ice causes the rocks to crack and break apart."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: - The organism must die to begin the process - The soft tissue decomposes - The bones are left behind - Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil What might be the last step of the process?

But I can use this background: Recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions. When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk. What is an answer for this question: Which friend breathes more fresh air on a daily basis? A:","output":"Based on the given information, Rob breathes more fresh air on a daily basis.

The report into the first fatal crash caused by a self-driving vehicle also disclosed that the modified 2017 Volvo XC90’s radar systems observed the pedestrian six seconds before impact but “the self-driving system software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle with varying expectations of future travel path.” At 1.3 seconds before impact, the self-driving system determined emergency braking was needed. But Uber said, according to the NTSB, that automatic emergency braking maneuvers in the Volvo XC90 were disabled while the car was under computer control in order to “reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior.” The report gives new fuel to opponents in Congress who have stalled a bill designed to speed the deployment of self-driving cars on U.S. roads and puts a spotlight on the fact that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is also investigating, does not test self-driving vehicles or certify them before they are deployed on U.S. roads. Uber Technologies Inc, which voluntarily suspended testing after the crash in the city of Tempe, said on Wednesday it planned to end testing in Arizona and focus on limited testing in Pittsburgh and two cities in California. Uber aims to resume its self-driving operations this summer, likely with smaller routes and fewer cars, the company said. The company did not directly comment on the NTSB findings but noted it recently named a former NTSB chairman, Christopher Hart, to advise on Uber’s safety culture. “As their investigation continues, we’ve initiated our own safety review of our self-driving vehicles program,” the company said on Thursday, adding it planned to announce changes in the coming weeks. All aspects of the self-driving system were operating normally at the time of the crash, and there were no faults or diagnostic messages, the NTSB said. Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking her bicycle outside the crosswalk on a four-lane road when she was struck by the Uber vehicle traveling 39 miles per hour (63 kph). A safety operator behind the wheel appeared to be looking down, and not at the road, moments before the crash, according to video from inside the car released by police. The operator told the NTSB she was not looking at a mobile phone but monitoring the vehicle’s self-driving systems. Tempe police said on Wednesday it had completed its investigation and turned the findings over to prosecutors to review. Police did not release the results of the probe. The NTSB said the Uber vehicle required the operator to intervene and take action, but the system was not designed to alert the operator. The report said the operator engaged the steering wheel less than a second before impact and began braking less than a second after impact. The report noted that Herzberg tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana, and that she did not look in the direction of the vehicle until just before impact. ‘RECKLESS’ William Wallace, senior policy analyst for Consumers Union, the advocacy division of Consumer Reports, called Uber “reckless” and said the NTSB report “makes it clear that a self-driving car was tested on public roads when it wasn’t safe enough to be there, and it killed a pedestrian.” He added that the system “was far too dangerous to be tested off a closed track.” Some cities expressed hesitation about immediately allowing Uber to return to testing. Pittsburgh mayoral spokesman Timothy McNulty said the mayor still “wants a full federal investigation of the accident and for Uber to agree to his demands specific to Pittsburgh testing before he would welcome them back to the city.” Sacramento, California, is interested in having Uber and other developers test in the city but wants to ensure the companies follow all regulations. “The NTSB report really shines a light on the importance of safety and security of vehicles, so I think it hardens our stance a little bit on safety and security,” said Louis Stewart, Sacramento chief innovation officer. A spokesman for Ontario’s Ministry of Transportation said on Thursday it would ensure it was satisfied with the steps Uber has taken to ensure the safety of its automated vehicles, before resuming testing in Toronto. Arizona’s governor in March suspended Uber’s permit for the testing, citing safety concerns. Uber has said it considers self-driving technology important to the future of its ride services, although it is not clear how it fits into the plans of new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi. He has revamped the company structure and cut expenses as Uber prepares for an initial public offering next year. The NTSB did not say when it would release its final report on the accident. The agency typically issues its final conclusions at least a year after an accident. It is also investigating a series of crashes involving Tesla Inc’s semi-autonomous “Autopilot” system after faulting the system last year after a fatal crash in Florida.

The calculation ultimately wasn’t acted on as the car’s built-in automatic emergency braking system was disabled and the safety operator responsible for performing such a maneuver didn’t apply the brakes until after the collision, the National Transportation Safety Board said in its preliminary report on the March 18 accident in Tempe, Ariz., near Phoenix. The crash marked the first pedestrian death involving a self-driving car and ignited a broader discussion about whether the driverless technology that auto and tech companies are racing to develop is ready for the real world. It also illustrates the challenges Uber has faced in developing software that can detect hazards on the road and respond appropriately, as the ride-hailing company chases rivals such as Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo and General Motors Co.’s Cruise Automation, which aim to deploy robot taxis that could pose as a threat to Uber’s business. Uber was testing a fleet of Volvo Cars sport-utility vehicles that come equipped with automatic emergency braking and other safety features. The vehicles, however, were modified by the ride-hailing company, which equipped them with cameras, sensors and onboard computers. An operator rides in each vehicle, prepared to take the wheel to ensure safety as needed. The NTSB said the Uber vehicle’s sensors detected the pedestrian walking across the road with a bicycle six seconds before impact. At first, the self-driving system’s software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, then as a vehicle and finally as a bicycle with varying expectations of where the bike was headed. The NTSB said the vehicle was traveling at 43 miles an hour before impact. At that speed, six seconds is enough time for a vehicle to stop, said Todd Humphreys, an associate professor who specializes in robotic perception at the University of Texas at Austin. He said stopping time in those conditions could have occurred within less than three seconds. It was 1.3 seconds before impact that the system decided emergency braking was needed, the NTSB said. According to Uber, the NTSB said, Volvo’s built-in automatic braking system had been disabled during testing to “reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior.” The safety operator began braking less than a second after impact, the NTSB said. “The vehicle operator is relied on to intervene and take action,” the report said. “The system isn’t designed to alert the operator.” Uber’s decision to deactivate the vehicle’s automatic-braking system and leave it in the hands of the safety operator, who in turn wasn’t given an alert, were mistakes, Mr. Humphreys said.

Warning: Graphic content. PHOTO: CHRIS CARLSON/ASSOCIATED PRESS “This was an absolutely inexcusable design decision,” Mr. Humphreys said in an email. “Over those critical 1.3 seconds, the car could have slowed down from 43 to 24 mph before the collision.” That would have given the pedestrian a better chance of surviving the collision, he said. It is common for developers to disable built-in vehicle features such as automatic braking to avoid multiple systems issuing conflicting commands, said Raj Rajkumar, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who founded and later sold an autonomous-car software startup. The problem with Uber’s approach, he said, is the company didn’t replace Volvo’s system with its own automatic emergency braking. Instead, Uber relied on the safety operator, who was seemingly distracted and didn’t receive a warning to brake or swerve, he said. “Uber’s software designers punted the final action to the operator; except that no alert was generated,” Mr. Rajkumar said in an email. At the very least, Uber’s autonomous software should have predicted the potential collision and slowed the vehicle or slammed on the brakes, he said. A video released around the time of the crash showed the safety operator glancing down toward the center console of the vehicle several times before impact. In an interview with NTSB investigators, the operator said she had been monitoring the self-driving system interface. In addition to being responsible for intervening in the driving of the vehicle, the safety operator is also monitoring diagnostic messages that appear on a digital screen in the center console and tagging events for further review, the NTSB said. Many autonomous vehicle developers begin with two safety operators and move to one as their systems become more advanced. Uber moved from two to one after more than a year of planning and continues to use two in some scenarios, the company said. “We decided to make this transition because after testing, we felt we could accomplish the task of the second person—annotating each intervention with information about what was happening around the car—by looking at our logs after the vehicle had returned to base, rather than in real time,” the company said. Mr. Humphreys said the operator shouldn’t be expected to interact with the screen if it means not looking at the road. “A second Uber employee should have been in the car to interact with the system interface,” he said. The pedestrian was dressed in dark clothing and was walking a bicycle across the road, not at a crosswalk, according to the report. NTSB also said the pedestrian tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana, though it didn’t say that played a role in the crash. Volvo, in statement, said it was helping with the investigation, noting its driver-assistance system was disengaged. An Uber spokeswoman Thursday said the company has worked with the NTSB and started its own review, bringing on former NTSB head Christopher Hart to advise on its safety culture. She said the company in the coming weeks will detail changes it plans to make. On Wednesday, Uber said it was closing down its self-driving vehicle program in Arizona, two months after the state barred it from road-testing self-driving technology. —Austen Hufford contributed to this article.

Step 2: Evaluate the options - Automobile: Though automobiles can have heaters installed, families do not usually spend a lot of time in one as their main living space. - City hall: This is a government building and not a personal living space. - House: A house is the most likely option because it is the family's main living space. - Public building: This is not a personal living space either. - Office: Similar to the automobile, some people have heaters in their offices, but a family is unlikely to share an office as their main living space.

From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies, writing more than 140. He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder. Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: \\"you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable.\\" Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including \\"Le lever du soleil sur le Nil\\" (\\"Sunrise over the Nile\\", 1898) and \\"Hymne à la paix\\" (\\"Hymn to Peace\\", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein. He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, \\"One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence, of oratorio.\\" He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach... The answer to this question is:","output":"Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré)."},{"instruction":"What happens next in this paragraph?

They could even become the debtor's boss.;","output":"[i] Start by doing research on collection agencies and understanding their tactics. Advantages of some collection agencies may include having sophisticated techniques for collecting debts, while disadvantages could involve negative public relations or aggressive tactics. To beat them at their own game, learn about their methods and how to counter them effectively. [ii] Since there is no collateral, you are in a unique position when it comes to negotiating. A collection agency may be more willing to negotiate a settlement or payment plan if they understand that there is a higher risk for them when collecting unsecured debt. Keep this in mind when they call and try to be assertive in negotiations, knowing that you hold more power than they may want you to believe. [iii] Be cautious when dealing with collection agencies and protect yourself from potential scams. Do not provide personal or financial information over the phone or via email. Instead, request formal documentation and validate the debt and agency before engaging in conversations. It's wise to consult with a financial advisor, attorney, or credit counselor for guidance and to ensure you are well-informed about your rights and options. [iv] Practice effective communication and avoid emotional confrontations with collection agents. Remember that they are doing their job, but that you have a choice in how you handle the interaction. If they become overly aggressive or use scare tactics, maintain your composure and remember your rights. Document any abusive or harassing behavior and report it to the appropriate authorities, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or your state attorney general. Aside from these key points, here are some additional strategies to help you beat collection agencies at their own game: 1. Familiarize yourself with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), which outlines your rights and the restrictions placed on collection agencies. 2. Request validation of the debt to ensure that it is yours and that the collection agency has not made an error in attempting to collect the debt from you. 3. Negotiate a payment plan or settlement that is manageable for your financial situation, and be prepared to propose an alternative if the collection agency's initial offer is not satisfactory. 4. Keep thorough records of every interaction with the collection agency, including dates, times, and the names of the representatives you speak with. This documentation can serve as evidence if the collection agency breaks any laws or regulations. 5. Monitor your credit report to ensure the collection agency is accurately reporting your debt and all relevant information. If you believe an error has been made, dispute it with the credit reporting bureaus. By taking these steps, you can assert control over the situation and level the playing field against collection agencies. Protecting your rights, understanding the nuances of their tactics, and maintaining clear and factual communication will ultimately help you beat collection agencies at their own game."},{"instruction":"Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","output":"No, the answer you provided explains how tropical cyclones form, not how they are named. To answer your question about how tropical storms and hurricanes are named: 1. Identify the responsible organization: Hurricane and tropical storm names are determined by regional meteorological organizations. For example, in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific regions, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is responsible for naming these storms. 2. Understand the naming system: Names are chosen and maintained in lists that are used in rotation. Each list typically consists of 21 names, alternating between male and female names, and are reused every six years. The names are typically easy to pronounce, so they can be clearly communicated to the public. 3. Know the criteria for naming storms: When a tropical cyclone forms, it is given a name once it reaches tropical storm strength, which is defined by sustained winds of at least 39 miles per hour (63 kilometers per hour). If a tropical storm strengthens further and reaches hurricane status (sustained winds of 74 miles per hour or 119 kilometers per hour), it retains its name. 4. Account for retired names: If a hurricane causes significant damage or results in a high number of casualties, its name may be retired from the list and replaced with a different name at the discretion of the WMO. So, in conclusion, the process of naming hurricanes and tropical storms involves a well-organized system maintained by responsible organizations like the WMO, utilizing predetermined lists of alternating names, and accounting for retired names when necessary."},{"instruction":"How is \\"In addition, and in keeping with what we have always contended, the report also questions the condition of meeting the convergence criteria to receive Fund money and also opposes the Commission's proposal that benefiting from the Fund means meeting the conditions of the Stability Pact.\\" said in German?","output":"To translate a complex sentence from English to German, one should proceed step by step in a systematic way.

In this way the North American Indians produce pemmican(dried meat ground into powder and made into cakes), the Scandinavians make stockfish and the Arabs dried dates. All foods include water--cabbage and other leaf vegetables contains as much as 93% water, potatoes and other root vegetables 80%, lean meat 75% and fish, anything from 80% to 60%, depending on how fatty it is. If this water is removed, the activity of the bacteria which cause food to go bad is checked. Fruit is sun-dried in Asia Minor, Greece, Spain and other Mediterranean countries, and also in California, South Africa and Australia. Various methods are used, but in general, the fruit is spread out on trays in drying yards in the hot sun. Nowadays most foods are dried mechanically. The method of such dehydration is to put food in chambers through which hot air is blown at temperatures of about 110degC at entry to about 43degC at exit. This is the usual method for drying such things as vegetables, minced meat, and fish. Dried foods take up less room and weigh less than the same food packed in cans or frozen, and they do not need to be stored in special conditions. For these reasons they are invaluable to the climbers, explorers and soldiers in battle, who have little storage space. They are also popular with housewives because it takes so little time to cook them. Usually it is just a case of replacing the dried-out moisture with boiling water.

These factors include the context of the review, the reviewer's attitude, and the clarity of their message. Based on these criteria, I will break down my analysis: 1. Context: The context in which the review has been placed is crucial. If this review is for a specific app or product, it may be relevant but lacks specificity. In the case of a more general topic, such as a review for an app store or mobile device, the request for an additional sponsored app might make more sense, but it would still be useful for the reviewer to specify which kind of sponsored app they have in mind. 2. Attitude: The tone of the review sounds more like a suggestion or a feature request rather than a review of the existing product or service. There's no indication of whether the reviewer enjoyed or disliked the current offering, which makes it difficult for others to gauge their experience. A valuable review would typically share their opinion on the product or app. 3. Clarity: The message conveyed in the review is quite vague, as it doesn't explain the reasoning behind the request or provide sufficient detail to understand the reviewer's preferences or expectations. An effective review should be clear, concise, and informative, allowing prospective users to grasp the reviewer's sentiment and form their own opinions based on this feedback. With these factors in mind, I would give the review a rating of 2 out of 5. While the suggestion of adding an additional sponsored app could be useful in certain contexts, the review lacks specificity and fails to provide any insight into the reviewer's experience with the existing product or service. Additionally, the lack of clarity in the message prevents it from being a valuable source of information. For these reasons, the review falls short of being helpful or informative and receives a low rating."},{"instruction":"Q:Combine facts and answer this: The 1934 Texas Tech Matadors represented the college in what city?

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. If the iron dissolves at a higher rate due to the perturbation, the increased availability of dissolved iron may lead to a higher chance of reaction with free oxygen and subsequently, result in more rust (iron oxide) forming. The increased rate of iron dissolution affects the overall process by potentially promoting more rust formation."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Who will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","output":"To answer the question of who will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm, let's analyze the situation step by step: 1. Bobby has a large order of potatoes and has increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. This means that there is a higher concentration of nitrogen-based fertilizers being applied in Bobby's fields. 2. Kenny is mainly growing tomatoes, which are not in season right now. As a result, his use of fertilizer is low compared to Bobby's usage. Thus, there is less nitrogen-containing fertilizer being used on Kenny's farm. 3. Heavy rain has been falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms, which causes rainwater to dissolve fertilizer in the soil. This leads to runoff carrying the dissolved fertilizer into nearby bodies of water, such as ponds, rivers, and ultimately the ocean. 4. In the ponds near their farms, the dissolved nitrogen from the fertilizers accelerates the growth of algae. When these algal blooms die, decomposers break down the dead algae, consuming all available oxygen in the water. As a result, the water becomes a dead zone where nothing can grow due to a lack of oxygen. Considering the above points, the answer to the question would be: Kenny will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near his farm, primarily because he is currently using less fertilizer than Bobby. Bobby's increased use of fertilizer, combined with the heavy rain, leads to a higher probability of creating dead zones in nearby water bodies due to nutrient runoff."},{"instruction":"In order to stand, he must first win his centre-right Republicans party's primary in November. Mr Sarkozy said he \\"felt he had the strength to lead the combat at such a tormented moment in our history.\\" No-one doubts his energy, but a number of obstacles must be overcome if he is to fight his way back to the Elysee. Nicolas Sarkozy served as French president from 2007 to 2012, and the country he left behind as he walked from the Elysee was not a happy one. The campaign promises of a land where people could \\"work more to earn more\\" had vanished. Unemployment was back near 10%; the deficit ballooning; and the much-vaunted \\"rupture\\" with the country's uncompetitive past as much a dream as five years previously. Mr Sarkozy could argue - with some justice - that all his plans to rewire the economy had gone down the drain by the 2008 world crisis. But still the man with all the answers turned out to be mainly mouth. Profile: Nicolas Sarkozy Nicolas Sarkozy may want to be the centre-right candidate next April, but sadly for him others have the same idea. There are in fact 10 other runners in the November primary, most of whom have no chance whatsoever and are merely putting down markers for the future. A couple are serious rivals. There is Mr Sarkozy's former Prime Minister Francois Fillon - the man who learned to swallow hard and keep looking impassive through whatever his master's latest putdown. And then there is Alain Juppe - another former prime minister. Right now Mr Juppe is in fact the favourite to win in the November primary - so Mr Sarkozy has a tough and potentially bitter fight ahead. Mr Sarkozy's enemies have always given themselves heart from the thought that if all else fails to bring him down, justice will. The list of \\"affaires\\" in which the former president is embroiled is long and very complicated. Two stand out. In the first, Mr Sarkozy is accused of knowingly exceeding campaign funding limits in the 2012 election. In the second, he is said to have put pressure on a judge to reveal details on another case in which he was implicated. In both of these affairs, Mr Sarkozy is \\"mis en examen\\" - in other words he is formally the target of a judicial investigation that might well end in a trial. Were that to happen in the weeks to come, his chances would be scuppered. Luckily for Mr Sarkozy, the wheels of French justice grind exceeding slow. Still - the law is a weak spot. Investigations Nicolas Sarkozy faces Bling is such an annoying, meaningless expression - but Mr Sarkozy undoubtedly suffered from his supposed affinity for a certain kind of lifestyle. He came to be viscerally loathed by a large part of the population - not just as a political figure, but for the kind of man he was. In truth, his lifestyle was not that different from other French leaders'. Carla Bruni was no liability: in fact she is quite admired. Far more problematic was Nicolas Sarkozy's odd personality: impulsive, cocky, braggadocio masking some inner insecurity. Many people didn't like it, and they still don't. If Nicolas Sarkozy ends up against Francois Hollande in 2017 (and it is perfectly possible), it will be an exact re-run of 2012. Could there be a more crying indictment of French politics? And a more potent argument for Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front?

Go for sunglasses that have UV protection and glare protection. Look for sunglasses in brightly colored frames, such as peach, bright blue, or pink. This can add another level of summer to your look. Brimmed hats are great for staying cool in hot weather, as they protect your face from the sun and keep your body cool in the heat. Look for hats made of cotton or woven materials. Hats with a wide brim all the way around, sun hat style, or baseball hats are ideal for staying cool in hot weather. Many people suffer from swollen, sweaty feet in hot weather. You can prevent this by wearing shoes that are comfortable and not constraining. Look for shoes with comfortable soles made of breathable materials like canvas or cotton. Avoid shoes that are made of non-breathable material like leather, rubber, or other man-made materials.

Egyptian security forces help the lifeless body of Giza Police Chief General Nabil Farag, who was killed after unidentified militants opened fire. Police Chief General Farag had been on an operation with security forces deployed early morning to the town of Kirdasa to drive off suspected Islamists taking control of the town near Giza Pyramids, Egypt. Security troops backed up by helicopters, had stormed into the area, an Islamist stronghold, to carry out arrests after the torching of a number of police stations and the killing of an estimated 11 officers in clashes that followed the removal of President Mohamed Morsi in July. Kerdasa police station was abandoned after it was hit with rocket propelled grenades and gunfire on August 14 - the same day security forces moved against protests by supporters of the deposed president, killing hundreds. Police forces had not been allowed in Kerdasa since then. General Nabil Farrag, the assistant security director of the Giza Province, is dragged from a car after he was shot during an operation against gunmen. General Nabil Farrag died shortly after being brought to a hospital. Security forces captured 14 Islamist fugitives wanted for alleged involvement in violence in the village and at the six-week long Islamist sit-in outside Cairo University in support of ousted president Mohammed Morsi. The Egyptian Interior Ministry said the police chief was shot by gunmen positioned on the roofs of schools and mosques which the militants had taken over. At least one other police officer was injured in Thursday's violence, state TV reported. It said police forces took control of the area and imposed a curfew. As police and rebels fired at each other, Egyptian explosives experts were working to defuse bombs found on the public metro. Specialists defused two primitive bombs which has been planted 100 metres from Helmeyet el-Zaytoun station in northeast Cairo. Security troops stormed into the area to arrest people accused of torching police stations and killing an estimated 11 security officers. Egyptian soldiers wait for instructions as they gather in a street during an operation against gunmen in the underfire Kerdasa district. Residents of the area said yesterday they were not in control of the area but do not want police there. Egyptian soldiers take cover behind an armoured personnel carrier as they keep watch during an operation against gunmen in the Kerdasa district. Egyptian security forces take cover during clashes with suspected militants, who have been fighting with police since Morsi was ousted. Egypt has suffered outbreaks of violence and attacks on police and civilians following Morsi's exit. Violence between his supporters and security forces included massive attacks on police stations, security officers and churches. At least 1,000 people have died in the violence with most deaths coming during the security forces' dispersal of two pro-Morsi sit-ins in Cairo on August 14. About 100 police officers also died in the clashes. Nearly 2,000 Islamist activists and politicians have been arrested since Morsi's removal. Smoke rises during the fierce battles between Egyptian security forces and suspected militant, in the town of Kirdasa, near Giza Pyramids. Kerdasa, known for producing and selling luxury fabrics is 14 km from Cairo and known to be an Islamist stronghold. Residents of the area said yesterday they were not in control of the area but do not want police there. 'We don't trust them as we know they will come to arrest people we know and respect whom they blame on the violence that we know was done by outsiders, not by our respectable sheikhs,' Ahmed Aly, a resident, told Reuters on Wednesday. Egyptian security forces had on Monday stormed the town of Delga in Minya province, about 300 km south of Cairo, clearing barricades that was set by Morsi's supporters there who were almost in control of the town. Forces arrested 56 residents. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article is about an Egyptian police chief named General Nabil Farag who was shot by some bad people. He was trying to help make a place called Kerdasa safe again. Kerdasa is near a famous place called the Giza Pyramids in Egypt. Some time ago, 11 policemen were killed there, and since then, the police have been trying to find the bad people who did it. When General Farag was shot, he was wearing special clothes to protect him, called a bulletproof vest, but it didn't work this time. His friends, the other police officers, carried him away. They want to make Kerdasa safe for everyone and stop the bad people from doing more bad things. There have been a lot of problems in Egypt since a man named President Mohamed Morsi was removed from his job. Some people liked Morsi, and some people didn't. After Morsi was removed, lots of people were angry, and some did very bad things, like hurting other people and burning buildings. The police have been working hard to make things better, but it's still not safe for everyone yet."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A man and woman are having a conversation while sitting on a tree stump in the woods.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The stump is from a redwood.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Here are the steps: The original equation is: -37 = 2*j - 49 Step 1: Re-arrange the equation by adding 49 to both sides. This operation is justified because adding the same number on both sides of an equation doesn't affect its solution. The purpose here is to isolate '2j' on right side and get rid of any constants from that side. This gives: -37 + 49 = 2*j Which simplifies to: 12 = 2*j Step 2: Now, let's isolate 'j' by dividing both sides by 2. This operation is justified because dividing both sides by the same number does not affect the solution. The aim is to find the value of 'j'. So, we get: 12 / 2 = j Which simplifies to: j = 6 So, the solution to this equation is j = 6."},{"instruction":"By 1885, a new summer retreat was contemplated.

(Stephen Shugerman/Getty Images) The woman who rejected Donald Trump’s sexual advances — referred to as “Nancy” in an obscenity-laced video obtained by The Washington Post — has been identified as Nancy O’Dell, a television personality whom he reportedly tried subsequently to have fired as host of the Miss USA pageant. In the 2005 video clip, the Republican presidential nominee recalled his failed attempts to seduce a married woman. “I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it,” he said. On Friday night, “Access Hollywood” reported that the woman who rebuffed Trump’s advances was that show’s former host, O’Dell. Trump’s crass remarks were made to O’Dell’s then co-anchor, Billy Bush, as the two men arrived for a cameo appearance by Trump on the soap opera “Days of Our Lives.” In this video from 2005, Donald Trump prepares for an appearance on \\"Days of Our Lives\\" with actress Arianne Zucker. He is accompanied to the set by \\"Access Hollywood\\" host Billy Bush. The Post has edited this video for length. (Obtained by The Washington Post) Two years later, Trump tried to have O’Dell fired as host of the Miss USA pageant, reportedly because she was pregnant, although the video suggests he may have had other motives, as well. After the video was released, TMZ quickly revived its previous reporting about Trump’s attempt to have O’Dell dismissed from the Miss Universe pageant in 2007. “A source tells TMZ that the enigmatic real estate developer wanted to drop O’Dell as host because he doesn’t like the way pregnant women look,” the site reported at the time. O’Dell went on to host the pageant despite Trump’s objections, TMZ wrote, because NBC executives had the final decision-making power. O’Dell is a television veteran who got her start as a news reporter in South Carolina, where she grew up. She spent a decade as the host of “Access Hollywood” and is now the co-anchor of “Entertainment Tonight” on CBS. She can frequently be seen interviewing celebrities on the red carpet before major award shows. In 2005, O’Dell married tech executive Keith Zubchevich. Two years later, she gave birth to a daughter. O’Dell released this statement on Saturday: “Politics aside, I’m saddened that these comments still exist in our society at all. When I heard the comments yesterday, it was disappointing to hear such objectification of women. The conversation needs to change because no female, no person, should be the subject of such crass comments, whether or not cameras are rolling. Everyone deserves respect no matter the setting or gender. As a woman who has worked very hard to establish her career, and as a mom, I feel I must speak out with the hope that as a society we will always strive to be better.” Early Saturday morning, shortly after midnight, Trump released a short video apologizing for his remarks. He is slated to debate Hillary Clinton on Sunday evening. O’Dell is scheduled to return to the air on Monday. ||||| Trump Tried to Dump Because of Baby Bump Trump Tried to Dump Because of Baby Bump NBC announced today that \\"Access Hollywood's\\" Nancy O'Dell will host next month's Miss USA Pageant, but if it had gone Donald Trump's way, that wouldn't be the case.A source tells TMZ that the enigmatic real estate mogul wanted to drop O'Dell as host because he doesn't like the way pregnant women look.

Wicked Games is featured on the soundtrack for the film directed by whom?","output":"Wicked Games, a song by musician The Weeknd, is prominently featured on the soundtrack of the 2011 film \\"Drive.\\" The film is directed by the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. Nicolas Winding Refn is known for his visually striking films and unique storytelling style. Born in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1970, Refn made a name for himself in the film industry with his initial success coming from \\"Pusher,\\" a crime drama film released in 1996. He went on to explore the crime and underworld genre with two sequels, \\"Pusher II\\" and \\"Pusher III.\\" Before directing \\"Drive,\\" Refn directed movies like \\"Bronson,\\" a biographical crime film based on the life of notorious British prisoner Charles Bronson, and \\"Valhalla Rising,\\" a historical adventure film set in the early Middle Ages. These films played a crucial part in shaping his distinct visual and narrative style. In \\"Drive,\\" Refn combined elements of crime dramas and action-packed car chases with an atmospheric and moody style. Starring Ryan Gosling as the lead character - a skilled getaway driver - the film became an instant classic, garnering a significant fan following. The soundtrack, which features the song \\"Wicked Games\\" by The Weeknd, equally contributed to the film's neon-soaked, 1980s-inspired ambiance that captured audiences’ hearts. The Weeknd, a Canadian singer, songwriter, and record producer, emerged on the music scene in the early 2010s with his debut mixtape \\"House of Balloons.\\" His dark and moody R&B sound, coupled with his enigmatic persona, has allowed him to garner both commercial and critical success. The inclusion of \\"Wicked Games\\" in \\"Drive\\" not only adds depth to the film's atmosphere but also serves as a testament to The Weeknd's unique musical style. Furthermore, Nicolas Winding Refn has continued to work on visually-striking films such as \\"Only God Forgives\\" and \\"The Neon Demon.\\" His ability to create memorable films with gritty narratives complemented by vivid cinematography has established him as a talented director in the industry."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision.

In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him.

The location shots are fascinating and show a Bolton very much in transition - there are a number of scenes of apparent dereliction but this serves to show the town being rebuilt - and the idea that the old must make way for the new is right at the heart of this film. A slightly miscast James Mason leads an enjoyable ensemble in a story about a fuss over a herring that spirals into a full-blown generational conflict, then a pleasingly schmaltzy resolution. Though I'm a bit too young to remember it fully, the minutiae of Lancashire life in the 60s is all here: cashing up on a Friday, songs round the piano, the Sunday constitutional, good neighbourliness, the trepidations of courtship, the massive importance of self-respect, and I was pleased to see Naughton's funniest lines from the play left intact.

One cannot help but feel disheartened by the premise itself; the movie attempts to throw together an inefficient mix of genres that ultimately creates a haphazard mess. This painfully thin plot tries to merge elements from science fiction, comedy, and romance but fails to deliver anything remotely noteworthy in the end. The film centers around the protagonist, Tim Tumble, portrayed by the otherwise charismatic Pete Passé, whose performance regrettably falls utterly flat here. Tim Tumble, a washed-up inventor, stumbles upon a time-travel device that leads him to the future, where he meets the absurdly one-dimensional love interest, Faye Falter, brought to life -or should I say, barely given any life- by the stunning yet underused Lena Languish. The couple then embarks on a series of unamusing misadventures in a world rendered by the laughably deficient special effects and set designs. \\"The Haphazard Horizon\\" sorely lacks substance, and the dialogue makes it even more unbearable. The screenwriters appeared to be bereft of inspiration when trying to fill the scenes with wit or emotion. Forced punchlines, cliché-loaded exchanges, and monotonous character development further seal this movie's downfall. Supporting actors in the film were met with a similarly tragic fate, as the likes of Sam Slumber and Tina Tiresome had little to offer to keep viewers engaged. Their performances, unfortunately, add more weight to the already sinking ship that is \\"The Haphazard Horizon.\\" The palpable lack of on-screen chemistry among the leading and supporting actors fails to provide even a fleeting moment of engagement. Moreover, the film's soundtrack bears no mention whatsoever, as it comprises forgettable tunes that struggle to add any sense of emotion or excitement. The absence of a memorable score ultimately further exacerbates the film's inability to create a significant textual element for the viewer. Perhaps the only saving grace that \\"The Haphazard Horizon\\" can claim is its unintentional ability to serve as a teaching moment for aspiring filmmakers, demonstrating the perils of poor decisions across the board – from the concept stage and casting to screenwriting, visual effects, and soundtrack composition. In conclusion, \\"The Haphazard Horizon\\" is a regrettable misfire that fails to grasp the attention or evoke any positive emotions in its audience. It stands as a solemn reminder that a film must have more going for it than a promising cast and high production values. Substance and cohesion are essential to any piece of art, and this movie woefully proves to lack those vital qualities. Save your hard-earned money and time, and give \\"The Haphazard Horizon\\" a hard pass, lest you be left to dwell in cinematic disappointment."},{"instruction":"Please answer a question about the following article about Turner Classic Movies: In 2000, TCM started the annual Young Composers Film Competition, inviting aspiring composers to participate in a judged competition that offers the winner of each year's competition the opportunity to score a restored, feature-length silent film as a grand prize, mentored by a well-known composer, with the new work subsequently premiering on the network.

To expand on the given phrase, let me provide some additional context and information. Water lilies are aquatic plants that grow in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving water bodies. They are characterized by their large, round leaves that float on the water surface and their beautiful, colorful flowers that bloom in various shades of white, pink, yellow, and purple. Water lilies serve as a popular subject matter for art, and they hold cultural significance in many societies. Ducks, on the other hand, are known for being a common type of waterfowl that can be found in various parts of the world. They are characterized by their webbed feet, which allow them to swim efficiently, and their unique quacking sound. Ducks are often found in freshwater bodies, making them perfect companions for water lilies in an illustration. In the context of the translated phrase \\"Water lily and ducks for coloring\\", it refers to a subject matter for coloring pages or art activities, engaging people of all ages, particularly children, in a creative and educational process. Coloring water lilies and ducks allows individuals to experiment with color combinations, learn more about these plants and animals, and practice their artistic skills. Coloring pages featuring water lilies and ducks provide an opportunity for parents and educators to introduce children to the natural world, teaching them about the beauty and importance of these species in their ecosystem. They are also a way for people to connect with nature, especially those who live in urban environments and have limited access to natural habitats. Furthermore, art activities such as coloring provide several benefits, such as: 1. Enhancing fine motor skills: Coloring involves the use of hands and fingers, which helps to improve dexterity and strength in these muscles. 2. Promoting creativity: Coloring pages provide a canvas for individuals to express themselves and experiment with their artistic abilities. 3. Boosting cognitive development: Choosing colors and applying them to the right areas of the coloring page can help to improve focus, concentration, and problem-solving skills. 4. Providing relaxation and stress relief: Coloring has been shown to have a calming effect on the mind, allowing individuals to unwind and take a break from daily stresses. In conclusion, the translated phrase \\"Water lily and ducks for coloring\\" refers not only to specific plant and animal subjects in an artistic setting but also to the opportunity for individuals to immerse themselves in a creative and educational activity that offers multiple benefits."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: The promotion of research and innovation in Europe is being supported financially by the Horizon 2020 programme , which is also open to participation worldwide .

As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

Zola Taylor, Elizabeth Waters and Emira Eagle each approached Morris Levy, the music impresario who retained possession of Lymon's copyrights and his royalties, claiming to be Lymon's rightful widow; Lymon had neglected to divorce either of them. The complex issue resulted in lawsuits and counter-lawsuits, and in 1986 the first of several court cases concerning the ownership of Lymon's estate began. Trying to determine who was indeed the lawful Mrs. Frankie Lymon was complicated by more issues. Waters was already married when she married Lymon; she had separated from her first husband, but their divorce was finalized in 1965, after she had married Lymon. Taylor claimed to have married Lymon in Mexico in 1965, but could produce no acceptable evidence of their union. Lymon's marriage to Eagle, on the other hand, was properly documented as having taken place at Beulah Grove Baptist Church in Augusta, Georgia, in 1967; however, the singer was still apparently twice-married and never divorced when he married Eagle. The first decision was made in Waters' favor; Eagle appealed, and in 1989, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court reversed the original decision and awarded Lymon's estate to Eagle. However, the details of the case brought about another issue: whether Morris Levy was deserving of the songwriting co-credit on \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\". Although early single releases of \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" credit Frankie Lymon, Herman Santiago and Jimmy Merchant as co-writers, later releases and cover versions were attributed to Lymon and George Goldner. When Goldner sold his music companies to Morris Levy in 1959, Levy's name began appearing as co-writer of \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" in place of Goldner's. Lymon was never paid his songwriting royalties during his lifetime; one result of Emira Eagle's legal victory was that Lymon's estate would finally begin receiving monetary compensation from his hit song's success. In 1987, Herman Santiago and Jimmy Merchant, both then poor, sued Morris Levy for their songwriting credits. In December 1992, the United States federal courts ruled that Santiago and Merchant were co-authors of \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\". However, in 1996 the ruling was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit on the basis of the statute of limitations: copyright cases must be brought before a court within three years of the alleged civil violation, and Merchant and Santiago's lawsuit was not filed until 30 years later. Authorship of \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" currently remains in the names of Frankie Lymon and Morris Levy. Question: what were his posthumous troubles?. Whats the answer?","output":"Frankie Lymon had posthumous troubles, which means problems that happened after he died. These troubles were mainly about his money and who it should go to. Three women, Zola Taylor, Elizabeth Waters, and Emira Eagle, each said they were his wife and should get his money. There were many court cases to figure out who was the real wife. After a lot of back and forth, in 1989, the courts gave Frankie's money to Emira Eagle. Another problem was about who really wrote his famous song \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love.\\" The people who said they wrote it were Herman Santiago, Jimmy Merchant, and later, Morris Levy. There were more court cases to figure this out, too. In 1996, the court decided that Frankie Lymon and Morris Levy should be the ones who get credit for writing the song."},{"instruction":"the biggest is not always best: the same goes for the charter yacht.

Identify the meaning and context of the phrase \\"an apple a day.\\" 2. Research the origin, history, and cultural significance of the phrase. 3. Summarize the key findings and provide a concise answer. Step 1: Identify the meaning and context of the phrase \\"an apple a day.\\" \\"An apple a day\\" is a common proverb, which is often followed by the phrase \\"keeps the doctor away.\\" The saying implies that eating an apple daily may improve one's health and prevent illnesses, thereby reducing the need for medical attention. Step 2: Research the origin, history, and cultural significance of the phrase. Upon researching the phrase, I discovered that its origin can be traced back to 19th century Wales. The original proverb goes, \\"Eat an apple on going to bed and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread.\\" The phrase evolved over time and underwent several variations until it became known as \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\\" The idea behind the proverb is based on the nutritional benefits of apples, which are rich in vitamins, fiber, and antioxidants that contribute to overall health. Furthermore, the phrase has been culturally significant for promoting a balanced and healthy diet, even though it primarily focuses on apples. Step 3: Summarize the key findings and provide a concise answer. \\"An apple a day\\" comes from a 19th-century Welsh proverb, originally phrased as \\"Eat an apple on going to bed and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread.\\" Over time, the phrase evolved to its popular modern form: \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\\" The saying emphasizes the nutritional benefits of apples and encourages a healthy diet for maintaining good health and preventing illnesses."},{"instruction":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Good Day Philadelphia and Fox 29 reporter Steve Keeley was doing a live broadcast on the east coast storm from Salem County, New Jersey.

One day, they wanted a reporter named Steve Keeley to tell people about a big snowstorm happening on the east coast of the United States. Steve went to a place called Salem County in New Jersey to see the snowstorm for himself. He stood by the side of a road in a town called Woodstown, where he could show everyone at home what was happening. While Steve was talking about the storm, there was something coming his way that he didn't notice. A big machine called a snow plow train was approaching. Snow plow trains help clear the roads when there's a lot of snow so that cars can still drive safely. As the snow plow train got closer and closer, it pushed a whole bunch of snow in front of it, like a big wave. And guess what happened next? That's right! The big wave of snow crashed into Steve!

Relevance to the world: Countries are political and geographical entities that make up most of the world's landmass. They are crucial in understanding political, economic, and social systems of the world, as well as their cultural diversity. The other options such as thought, universe, and galaxy may be part of a broader understanding of existence, but they don't specifically relate to the composition of the world itself in terms of political divisions and geography. 2. Comprehensiveness: When considering the other choices, \\"countries\\" covers the widest aspect of the world's makeup. Thought, while an essential element of human existence and culture, is a concept and cannot tangibly fill the world. Water, on the other hand, covers about 71% of Earth's surface, but it doesn't capture the essence of human societies and structures. 3. Tangible presence: Countries have physical boundaries and governments, making them tangible components of the world. Though thoughts are present in every human mind, they are intangible and more difficult to quantify as something the world is \\"full of.\\" As for the universe and galaxy, their existence transcends the scope of the world, encompassing vast cosmic expanses beyond Earth. 4. Focused on Earth: By referring to \\"the world,\\" the question implies a focus on Earth and its constituents. Countries, being geopolitical divisions of Earth, are directly relevant to the world. The concepts of the universe and galaxy, however, encompass vast celestial bodies and space outside of Earth, expanding far away from what this question intends to address. Therefore, \\"countries\\" is the best answer because it directly relates to the political and geographical makeup of Earth and is more comprehensive, tangible, and focused than the other options provided."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: M: By how much?

All the passers-by stop to have a look. You ought to see it.\\" I told her I would, but I soon forgot about the tree. Three days later, I was jogging down the street when a splash of bright orange caught my eyes. For an instant, I thought someone's house had caught fire. Then I remembered the tree. I approached the tree to look at it closely. There was nothing remarkable about the shape of the tree. It was a medium-sized maple. But Mrs. Gargan had been right about its colors. Like the mess of an artist's palette , the tree blazed a bright crimson on its lower branches and burned with vivid yellows and oranges in its center, and deep red at its top. Through these colors were light green leaves as yet untouched by autumn. Walking closer I noticed several bare branches near the top, their small black branches scratching the air like claws. The fallen leaves lay like a red carpet around the trunk. As I was amazed at this beauty, I thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson's comments about the stars. \\"If the constellations appeared only once in a thousand years, imagine what an exciting event it would be. But because they're up there every night, we barely give them a look,\\" he made a remark in Nature. I felt the same way about the tree. Because its beauty will last only a week, it should be especially precious to us. And I had almost missed it.

This is due to several factors that can shape their experiences there. Reasons why teenagers might hate high school: 1. Pressure to perform: High schools can be incredibly competitive environments. Teenagers are under constant pressure to excel academically, athletically, and socially. This can create a lot of stress and anxiety for them. 2. Social pressure: High schools are composed of diverse social groups, and fitting in can be a challenge for many teenagers. Experiencing cliques, bullying, or exclusion can make teenagers dread going to school. 3. Difficulties with teachers: Some teachers may not have a good rapport with their students or may have teaching styles that don't resonate with teenagers, which can lead to disinterest and frustration. 4. Lack of choice: High schools often have set curriculums that don't allow teenagers to explore their interests fully. This can cause boredom or resentment toward attending school. 5. Early start times: Teenagers are known for staying up late and having to get up early for school, which can make mornings particularly difficult. However, despite these challenges, there are significant incentives for teenagers to attend high school: 1. Education: Attending high school is an essential stepping stone to higher education, such as college or university, and ultimately to a successful career. Acquiring a high school diploma is vital for employment and higher learning opportunities. 2. Developing social skills: High school is an environment where teenagers learn how to interact with different kinds of people, build relationships and develop essential social skills that will benefit them later in life. 3. Networking: High school friendships can turn into lifelong relationships or connections that become crucial later in life – both personally and professionally. 4. Extracurricular activities: High schools offer a wide range of extracurricular activities like sports, clubs, and arts programs, which allow teenagers to develop skills and explore their interests outside the classroom. 5. Life lessons: Attending high school helps teenagers learn essential life skills, such as time management, decision-making, collaboration, and problem-solving – all of which are useful in their future careers and personal lives. In conclusion, while high school can certainly be a challenging experience for teenagers, it remains the place they have the most incentive to attend due to the educational, social, and personal development benefits they gain. Other options like fast food restaurants, malls, jobs, and nightclubs may be appealing to teenagers in various ways, but they don't provide the same long-term advantages that high school attendance does."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: it was that bad huh Here is a hypothesis: It could have been worse right? Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the given premise and hypothesis. Premise: \\"it was that bad huh\\" Hypothesis: \\"It could have been worse right?\\" Step 2: Determine the context of the premise and hypothesis. The premise is referring to something being bad, while the hypothesis is referring to the possibility of the situation being worse. Step 3: Identify the logical structure. The premise provides a statement, essentially addressing the situation as bad. The hypothesis, however, does not directly make a claim about the statement but rather suggests considering an alternative perspective on the situation's severity. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise. While the premise confirms that the situation is bad, the hypothesis goes a step further and offers another thought that the situation could be worse. It's important to note that the hypothesis is not a direct conclusion of the premise but rather an additional perspective or consideration. In conclusion, the hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise. The truth of the premise (the situation being bad) does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (the possibility of the situation being worse). They can coexist, but a relationship where the truth of one guarantees the truth of the other does not exist."},{"instruction":"- sport is racquetball - nationals is 1st singles -rrb- 1997 , 1998 , 2000 , 2006-2008 -lrb- - residence is dallas , texas - caption is van hees at 2007 us open , memphis tennessee - plays is right handed - highestranking is 1st 2005 - medaltemplates is women 's racquetball - titles is 0 - birth date is 5 july 1977 - nationality is canadian - image is christie van hees at 2007 us open racquetball championships.jpg - birth place is kelowna , british columbia Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood...

Trump ripped Cruz for his Canadian birth and undisclosed campaign loans, before blasting Cruz's attacks on \\"New York values\\" in a series of tweets. Trump kept up questions on whether Cruz's birth in Canada disqualifies him to be president, alluding to previous warnings that lawsuits could bring him down and the GOP with him if he's the nominee. Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2016 He then pivoted to Cruz's failure to disclose a big loan from Goldman Sachs, where his wife worked, for his 2010 Senate run, accusing him of being in the pocket of the banks as a result.

Because the company was important and busy, it gave work to more than 50 people. So, these people had jobs that helped them earn money to buy things like food, clothing, and toys. One day, something sad happened. The price of oil went down, which means it didn't cost as much to buy oil as it used to.

You see, they needed to make money by working for others who needed their knowledge and skills to design and build great things. But because the price of oil was now low, the people who used to hire the engineering company didn't need them as much anymore. So, what happened next was very sad. The engineering company didn't have enough money to pay all the 50 people who worked there. That means those people lost their jobs and had to go find another place to work. But that's not all! Even more people might lose their jobs at the company. This is because the people who run the company asked some special helpers called administrators to come and find ways to save the company. These administrators are smart and will try their best to help the company stay open. But it might mean that more people will lose their jobs if the company can't make enough money. Everyone in the city of Aberdeen felt sad about the engineering company and the people who lost their jobs. But they also hoped that the company would find a way to keep going. And who knows?

Before cleaning your bong, you'll need to round up some supplies, including: a sink or basin; coarse salt, rice, or baking soda; rubbing alcohol, vinegar, or another cleaner; clean water; and latex gloves. Empty the bong and rinse and fill it with warm water.","output":"Begin the cleaning process. Once you've gathered all the necessary supplies, it's time to start cleaning your bong. Start by wearing the latex gloves to keep your hands safe from any harsh chemicals that might be present. Then, follow these steps: 1. Disassemble the bong: Carefully remove all the detachable parts such as the bowl, stem, and any additional accessories. This will make it easier to clean each component thoroughly. 2. Empty the bong: Pour out any remaining water or residue from the bong’s main chamber and downstem. Make sure to do this over a sink or basin to prevent any mess. 3. Rinse with warm water: Fill the bong with warm water, swish it around, and then empty it. This will help remove any loose debris and soften any stuck-on grime, making it easier to clean. 4. Add the cleaner: Now that you have rinsed your bong, pour your chosen cleaner (rubbing alcohol, vinegar, etc.) into the bong, filling it about halfway. Be sure to use enough cleaner to effectively cover all the surfaces that need to be cleaned. 5. Add the abrasive: Add your chosen abrasive, such as coarse salt, rice, or baking soda, to the bong. This will help to break up and remove any hard-to-reach residue inside the bong. 6. Shake it up: Plug the openings of your bong with your fingers or use plastic wrap secured with rubber bands. Shake the bong vigorously for several minutes to mix the cleaner and abrasive, ensuring that they reach and clean every area of the bong. Be cautious when shaking your bong as you want to avoid any accidents caused by dropping or breaking it. 7. Soak the components: While your bong is soaking, place the smaller components like the bowl and stem in a separate container and cover them with your cleaner as well. Allow them to soak for at least 20 to 30 minutes to loosen any remaining residue effectively. 8. Scrub the components: After the soaking process, use pipe cleaners, cotton swabs, or a small brush to scrub away any remaining grime on the bong components. Pay special attention to the smaller chambers and openings where residue can accumulate. 9. Rinse thoroughly: Rinse your bong and its components under warm water until all the cleaner and abrasive have been removed. Double-check for any lingering residue and repeat the process if necessary. 10. Dry your bong: Make sure to dry your bong and all its components thoroughly by allowing them to air dry or by gently patting them with a clean, soft cloth. Be cautious when handling your wet bong to avoid any accidental damage. 11. Reassemble and enjoy: After your bong and its components are fully dry, reassemble it and enjoy a fresh, clean smoking experience. Maintaining the cleanliness of your bong is essential for optimal performance and flavor. Regular cleaning will also prolong the lifespan of your bong and its components. Aim to clean your bong at least once a week or more, depending on the frequency of use."},{"instruction":"Western France, Spain, and other areas skew time zones and shift clocks, in effect observing DST in winter with an extra hour in summer.

In some cases, like the Lutheran Church of Sweden, it is the denomination leader title. Like popes, patriarchs, metropolitans, cardinal bishops, diocesan bishops, and suffragan bishops, archbishops are in the highest of the three traditional orders of bishops, priests, also called presbyters, and deacons. An archbishop may be granted the title, or ordained as chief pastor of a metropolitan see or another episcopal see to which the title of archbishop is attached. Episcopal sees are generally arranged in groups in which the bishop who is the ordinary of one of them has certain powers and duties of oversight over the other sees. He is known as the metropolitan archbishop of that see. In the Roman Catholic Church, canon 436 of the Code of Canon Law indicates what these powers and duties are for a Latin Rite metropolitan archbishop, while those of the head of an autonomous (\\"sui iuris\\") Eastern Catholic Church are indicated in canon 157 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. As well as the much more numerous metropolitan sees, there are 77 Roman Catholic sees that have archiepiscopal rank.

Andrea Cardosa, 41, of Perris, was sentenced in Riverside County Superior Court on three charges of committing lewd acts on a child. She avoided a potential life sentence by pleading guilty last month. Prosecutors dropped more than a dozen other counts. Guilty: Andrea Michelle Cardosa, an educator who was confronted with allegations of abuse in a phone call by a former student who then posted the conversation on YouTube, has been jailed for 10 years. Pleaded guilty: Cardosa was charged with abusing a former student at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside beginning when the girl was 12. The abuse lasted from 1997 to 2001, prosecutors said. Old photo: Andrea Cardosa has been accused by a former student of sexually abusing her when she was 12. Cardosa was charged with abusing a former student at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside beginning when the girl was 12. The abuse lasted from 1997 to 2001, prosecutors said. In court papers, prosecutors said Cardosa molested the girl more than 100 times in a locker room and Cardosa's car, and at the home of Cardosa's sister. In a recording that was posted online in January 2014, the former student telephoned Alhambra High School, where Cardosa was assistant principal, and confronted her. The now 29-year-old mother Jamie Carrillo said that she made the video post as the statute of limitations has run out for her to be able to prosecute and that she didn't want Cardosa around other children. In the call, she tells the woman, who identifies herself as Ms Cardosa, that she did something terribly wrong at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside 15 years ago. Ms Carrillo then asks what the woman would do if a student told her that she was having a sexual relationship with a teacher to which she replies that she would involve law enforcement. 'You should be so ashamed and so disgusted with yourself,' the caller said. 'I am. I am,' Cardosa said. 'I regret it every day. Every day.' Cardosa later resigned. Confession: The then 28-year-old Jamie Carillo posted a YouTube video where she confronted the woman who allegedly sexually abused her in middle school. Took her on trips: Ms Carrillo said that the teacher (pictured right) took her on out of town trips and made her feel 'special' More than one: After Jamie Carillo (pictured) posted her video on YouTube, a second alleged victim came forward to say that she had also been abused. She asks: 'So how is that any different from what you did when I was at Chemawa Middle?' To which the convicted molester answered: 'It's not.' Ms Carrillo goes on to tell her attacker that she has children of her own and that her former teacher's actions ruined her life and that she is 'disgusting'. When she hangs up the phone, Ms Carrillo shows that she made the call on the screen and reads out the number. She says: 'And I'm shaking like a leaf... not even an ''I'm sorry.'' Or anything. Just that she regrets it.' Horrific abuse: The 29-year-old alleges that her former teacher (left) abused her when she was a student at a California high school. Alhambra Unified School District Superintendent Laura Tellez-Gagliano released a statement saying the YouTube link was emailed to the school and they passed it to the Alhambra Police Department. Ms Carrillo said that the coach kissed her in the locker room and put her hand down the then 12-year-old's pants. The former student then said Ms Cardosa, who is believed to have been in her mid-twenties at the time of the assaults, organized out of town trips so that she could have sex with the underage girl. The 29-year-old said: 'Everything was stolen from me. She just completely manipulated me into thinking that I needed her and I wanted it.' Cardosa molested the girl over 100 times, and acts were committed in a locker room, Cardosa's car, and at the home of Cardosa's sister, where the two were almost discovered. The ex-student spoke at Cardosa's sentencing. 'I will stand up for my 12-year-old self who did not have anyone to fight for her,' the woman, now 28, said in a written victim-impact statement she read in court. 'It is never OK for an adult to betray the trust of a child.' Another former student came forward after the recording appeared online. Brianna, now 18, told detectives that she met Cardosa when she was a student at a middle school in Perris. She said Cardosa drove her to a secluded area in 2010, where she tried to kiss her and inappropriately touched her. Cardosa was charged with abusing that victim from 2009 to 2010 while she was a 15-year-old student at Tomas Rivera Middle School in Perris. A statement was read in court on behalf of that woman, who described having nightmares and trust issues. 'How will I ever trust anyone around my son?' she said in the statement. The victims also have sued the Riverside Unified and Val Verde Unified school districts. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This is a story about a woman named Andrea Cardosa. She used to be a school official in California. Imagine if you were at school and there was a teacher or someone who worked there that you really didn't like because they did bad things - that's what Andrea Cardosa was like. She did some very inappropriate, bad things to two girls when they were her students. One of those girls, named Jamie Carrillo, decided many years later that she wanted to talk to Andrea Cardosa about the bad things that happened. So, Jamie called Andrea, but she also made a recording of their conversation and posted it on YouTube where lots of people could see it. In the video, Jamie told Andrea that she did something terribly wrong. Andrea admitted that she did do something bad and expressed regret for her actions. Because of Jamie's video, a court decided that Andrea should go to prison for 10 years because of the bad things she did. This is a way for her to pay for her actions. Another student also said that Andrea did bad things to her as well. This made the court even more sure that they made the right decision to send Andrea to prison. We can learn from this story that it's very important to tell someone when a person is doing bad things, so that person can be stopped."},{"instruction":"Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Waterman, priceRange = less than £20, customer rating = low, area = city centre","output":"The Waterman, a city centre restaurant with a customer rating on the low side, offers meals at an affordable price range of less than £20."},{"instruction":"Don't even ask me why I watched this!

Researchers in psychology think that there are also two groups of people people who prefer warm colours and people who prefer cool colours. The warm colours are red, orange and yellow. Where there are warm colours and a lot of light, people usually want to be active. People think that red, for example, is exciting. Sociable people, those who like to be with others, like red. The cool colours are green, blue and violet. These colours, unlike warm colours , are relaxing. Where there are cool colours, people are usually quiet. People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue. Red may be exciting, but one researcher says that time seems to pass more slowly in a room with warm colours than in a room with cool colours. He suggests that a warm colour, such as red or orange is a good colour for a living room or restaurant. People who are relaxing or eating do not want time to pass quickly. Cool colours are better for offices or factories if the people who are working there want time to pass quickly. Researchers do not know why people think some colours are warm and other colours are cool.

We get: -17*h + 13*h = -13*h + 13*h + 8 which simplifies to: -4*h = 8 Now, to get rid of the multiplication, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of h, which is -4: (-4*h) / -4 = 8 / -4 This simplifies the equation to: h = -2 So, the value of h is -2."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],N={key:0},D={key:1};function z(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
