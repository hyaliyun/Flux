Therefore, ( ED = EF = frac{a}{2} ), where ( a ) is the length of the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangles ( triangle ABE ) and ( triangle ACF ). 3. **Similarity of Triangles:**    - Triangles ( triangle AEF ) and ( triangle ABC ) are similar by AA similarity criterion (both have a right angle and share angle ( widehat{BAC} )).    - Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal:       [      frac{EF}{a} = frac{AE}{AB} = cos widehat{BAC}      ] 4. **Using the Equilateral Triangle Property:**    - Given ( triangle DEF ) is equilateral, we have ( EF = frac{a}{2} ).    - Substituting ( EF = frac{a}{2} ) into the similarity ratio:      [      cos widehat{BAC} = frac{EF}{a} = frac{frac{a}{2}}{a} = frac{1}{2}      ]    - Therefore, ( cos widehat{BAC} = frac{1}{2} ), which implies ( widehat{BAC} = 60^circ ). 5. **Conclusion:**    - Since ( widehat{BAC} = 60^circ ) and ( triangle DEF ) is equilateral, it follows that ( triangle ABC ) must also be equilateral. This is because in an equilateral triangle, all angles are ( 60^circ ) and all sides are equal.

Step 4: Analyzing the product a_{n}a_{n+1}a_{n+2}: - For odd n, we have a_{n}a_{n+1}a_{n+2}=Qcdot a_{n+2}=2cdot a_{n}=2times 3=6.  - For even n, the calculation is a_{n}a_{n+1}a_{n+2}=Qcdot a_{n+2}=2cdot a_{n}=2times frac{2}{3}=frac{4}{3}.  - This shows that a_{n}a_{n+1}a_{n+2} can be either 6 or frac{4}{3} depending on whether n is odd or even, respectively.

A king (or crowned checker) is a checker that has been flipped an odd number of times. How many kings will there be on the board after the last student steps away?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**:    We have a 8 times 8 chessboard with 64 checkers numbered from 1 to 64. Each student flips the checkers whose numbers are divisible by their order number. The task is to find out how many checkers are flipped an odd number of times, as only these will be considered “Queen” checkers. 2. **Divisors and Flips**:    Each checker is flipped each time a student whose order number is a divisor of the checker's number. Therefore, the number of times a checker is flipped is equal to the number of divisors of its number. 3. **Odd Number of Flips**:    A number has an odd number of divisors if and only if it is a perfect square. This is because divisors generally come in pairs (e.g., for 12: 1 and 12, 2 and 6, 3 and 4), except when a number is a perfect square (e.g., for 9: 1 and 9, 3 and 3 - here 3 is counted once). 4. **Perfect Squares between 1 and 64**:    We need to identify all perfect squares between 1 and 64:    - (1 = 1^2)    - (4 = 2^2)    - (9 = 3^2)    - (16 = 4^2)    - (25 = 5^2)    - (36 = 6^2)    - (49 = 7^2)    - (64 = 8^2) 5. **Count of Perfect Squares**:    There are 8 perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64). 6. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, the number of checkers that are flipped an odd number of times, and hence are \\"Queen\\" checkers, is:    [    boxed{8}    ]"},{"instruction":"We recorded the following conversation among sailors this year: Cook: When I was as old as the sailor is now, I was twice as old as him.

Therefore, the cook is (2x - x = x) years older than the sailor.       Hence, (c = 2x + x = 3x).     - From the engineer: \\"I am 4 years older than the sailor.\\"       Thus, (e = 2x + 4). 3. **Checking Ages and Conditions:**     - According to the sailor, the cook's age (c = 3x) is odd, meaning (x) must be odd (since an odd number multiplied by an odd number is odd).     - The least common multiple (LCM) of the three ages ((2x), (3x), (2x+4)) is given as the captain's (kapitány) birth year. 4. **Determining the Captain's Birth Year:**     - Calculate LCM of (2x), (3x), and (2x + 4):       - When (x) is odd.       - Consider the specific cases: 5. **Case I:**     - Assume (x + 2) is divisible by 3:       Then the LCM would be (2x(x+2)).       - Check possible values:         If (x = 25), then (y = 2 cdot 25 cdot 27 = 1350).         If (x = 31), then (y = 2 cdot 31 cdot 33 = 2046).       None of these are realistic birth years since 2046 is in the future. 6. **Case II:**     - Assume (x + 2) is not divisible by 3:       Then the LCM would be (6x(x+2)).       - Calculate value ensuring (x) is odd:         For (x = 17), (z = 6 cdot 17 cdot 19 = 1938).           - This fits a plausible historical period as a birth year.

Now let's calculate her total expenses: Entrance fee: 10 20-ticket bundle: 22 Lunch: 8 to 15 Souvenir: 5 to 12 Total expenses without lunch and souvenir: 10 + 22 = 32 Jeanne has 50 for the day, so after the entrance fee and tickets, she has 50 - 32 = 18 left for lunch and a souvenir. If she spends 8 on lunch, she would have 18 - 8 = 10 left for a souvenir, which is within her souvenir budget of 5 to 12. Regarding the time constraint, Jeanne has 3 hours before the scheduled activity and 1 hour for the activity itself. Since the total ride time for all attractions is 1.5 hours, she can fit all the rides before the scheduled activity if she manages her time well. In summary, Jeanne should buy the 20-ticket bundle for 22, spend up to 8 on lunch, and up to 10 on a souvenir. She should plan to visit all the attractions before the scheduled activity, keeping in mind that the total ride time is boxed{1.5}  hours. This way, she can maximize her enjoyment while staying within her budget and time constraints."},{"instruction":"f x < m1 or x > m+1 is a necessary but not sufficient condition for {x}^{2}2x3 > 0, then the range of values for the real number m is ________.","output":"**Analysis** This problem primarily tests the application of necessary and sufficient conditions. Solving the problem by considering the relationship between inequalities is crucial. By combining the definition of necessary and sufficient conditions with the relationship between inequalities, we can proceed with the solution. **Step-by-step Solution** 1. First, solve the inequality {x}^{2}-2x-3 > 0. Factor the quadratic expression to obtain (x-3)(x+1)>0. The critical points are x=-1 and x=3. By analyzing the intervals, we find that the solution is x>3 or x<-1. 2. Given that x < m-1 or x > m+1 is a necessary but not sufficient condition for {x}^{2}-2x-3 > 0, we consider the possible values for m. Since the solution intervals must at least satisfy the given necessary condition, we have:  begin{cases} m+1 leq 3  m-1 geq -1 end{cases}  3.

When he is rowing upstream, the current is against him, so his effective speed is ( (3.3 - c) ) km/hr. According to the problem, it takes him twice as long to row upstream as to row downstream. This means that the distance covered upstream in a certain time is half the distance covered downstream in the same time, because distance is speed multiplied by time.

The distance covered downstream in time ( t ) is ( (3.3 + c) cdot t ), and the distance covered upstream in time ( 2t ) is ( (3.3 - c) cdot 2t ).

Since q > 1, this implies that a_{n+1} > a_{n} for all n. This means that each term in the sequence is greater than the preceding term, which by definition means that the sequence {a_{n}} is increasing.

Given that all terms of {a_{n}} are positive, we can divide both sides of the inequality by a_{n} (which is positive) without changing the direction of the inequality, yielding frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}} > 1. This fraction is equal to q, the common ratio of the sequence. Therefore, we have shown that q > 1. This demonstrates the necessity of the condition for the sequence to be increasing. Since we have established both the necessity and sufficiency of the condition \\"q > 1\\" for the sequence {a_{n}} to be increasing, we conclude that \\"q > 1\\" is a necessary and sufficient condition for the sequence to be increasing.

In the third hour, 3 customers order the 3 egg omelettes. In the last hour, 8 customers order the larger omelettes. Theo needs 84 eggs to make all the omelettes. How many eggs are in the larger omelettes?","output":"Let's calculate the total number of eggs used for the 3 egg omelettes first: In the first hour, 5 customers order the 3 egg omelettes, so that's 5 customers * 3 eggs/customer = 15 eggs. In the third hour, 3 customers order the 3 egg omelettes, so that's 3 customers * 3 eggs/customer = 9 eggs. Now, let's add the eggs used in the first and third hours for the 3 egg omelettes: 15 eggs (first hour) + 9 eggs (third hour) = 24 eggs. Since Theo needs 84 eggs in total to make all the omelettes, we can subtract the eggs used for the 3 egg omelettes to find out how many eggs were used for the larger omelettes: 84 eggs (total) - 24 eggs (3 egg omelettes) = 60 eggs for the larger omelettes. Now, let's find out how many larger omelettes were ordered: In the second hour, 7 customers order the larger omelettes. In the last hour, 8 customers order the larger omelettes. Adding these up gives us the total number of larger omelettes ordered: 7 larger omelettes (second hour) + 8 larger omelettes (last hour) = 15 larger omelettes. Finally, we can divide the total number of eggs used for the larger omelettes by the number of larger omelettes to find out how many eggs are in each larger omelette: 60 eggs (for larger omelettes) / 15 larger omelettes = 4 eggs per larger omelette.

For each cell, the number of cells in the same row or column that are of the same color is strictly less than the number of cells in the same row or column that are of the opposite color. 2. **Introduce the Key Concept:**    Let ( A ) denote the number of unordered pairs of cells which are (i) in the same row or column, and (ii) of opposite colors. 3. **Establish the Hypothesis:**    The hypothesis implies that for any given cell, there are more cells of the opposite color in the same row or column than cells of the same color. This means that for each cell, there are at least ( m + n ) such pairs containing that cell. 4. **Calculate the Total Number of Pairs:**    Since there are ( m times n ) cells in total, and each cell is counted in ( m + n ) pairs, the total number of such pairs is:    [    A ge m times n times (m + n)    ]    However, since each pair is unordered and counted twice, we divide by 2:    [    A ge frac{m times n times (m + n)}{2}    ] 5. **Upper Bound on the Number of Pairs:**    Each row can contribute at most ( n^2 ) pairs to ( A ) (since there are ( n ) cells in a row and each can pair with ( n-1 ) others of the opposite color).

Find the locus of the center of the moving circle.","output":"Firstly, the center of Circle M is at the origin (0,0) with a radius of 1. Circle N, on the other hand, can be rewritten as (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 4^2 - 12 by completing the square which gives the center at (4,0) and a radius of 2. For the moving circle to be tangent to both M and N, its center must lie on the line that is equidistant to both centers of the fixed circles. This means that the locus of points for the center of the moving circle will form a perpendicular bisector to the segment connecting the centers of M and N.  Now, let's find the equation of the locus of the moving circle's center. The midpoint of the segment from (0,0) to (4,0) is (2,0). A line perpendicular to this segment will be vertical and pass through (2,0). However, as the moving circle also needs to be externally tangent to both circles, its center must move along a path that allows its radius to be exactly equal to the distance between itself and each of the fixed circles' radii. Considering the fixed radius of Circle M, the radius of the moving circle plus the radius of M will equal the distance from the moving circle’s center to the origin, hence the equation (x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = (r + 1)^2. Similarly, considering the fixed radius of Circle N, we have (x - 4)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = (r + 2)^2, underlying the tangency condition with Circle N. By subtracting the second equation from the first, we eliminate r, yielding -8x + 12 = 2r + 1. If we express r from the first equation and substitute it into the latest equation, we get -8x + 12 = 2sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 1. Solving for y^2, we obtain:  y^2 = left(frac{8x - 13}{2}right)^2 - x^2.  Expanding and simplifying,  y^2 = 4x^2 - 52x + 169 - 4x^2,   y^2 = -52x + 169.  If we solve this equation for x while considering the distance to the origin and to (4,0), we find that the locus will be a hyperbola. More specifically, this is a horizontal hyperbola centered at (2,0) with asymptotes at y = pm 2(x - 2). To get its standard equation, we add 52x to both sides, divide by 169, and rewrite as follows:  frac{(x - 2)^2}{1^2} - frac{y^2}{13^2} = 1.  This equation is a standard form of a hyperbola centered at (2,0), with vertices at (-1,0) and (5,0) and asymptotes at y = pm 2(x - 2). However, since the locus must be nearest to Circle M, only the left branch of the hyperbola will be the solution.  Therefore, the locus of the center of the moving circle is the left branch of the hyperbola:  frac{(x + 2)^2}{1^2} - frac{y^2}{13^2} = 1,  with the final answer, as stated in the provided solution, being the left branch of the hyperbola, boxed{frac{(x + 2)^2}{1^2} - frac{y^2}{13^2} = 1}."},{"instruction":"Betal marks  2021  points on the plane such that no three are collinear, and draws all possible segments joining these.

By the construction, D is already lying on this line as a radical center of Gamma, omega_B, and omega_C.    - **Proof Step 2:** Using the homothety, the points U and V (determined from reflections) create a cyclic quadrilateral that further confirms this property.        - **Proof Step 3:** By properties of homothety of triangle DEF and triangle T_a T_b T_c, with H and O as inci-centers, the concurrency of the radical axes follows from the shared homothety center. Thus, the common chords of omega_A, omega_B, and omega_C are concurrent on the line OH.

A can complete the job in 15 days, so in one day, A can do 1/15 of the job. B can complete the job in 20 days, so in one day, B can do 1/20 of the job. When A and B work together in one day, they can do: (1/15) + (1/20) of the job. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 60 (the least common multiple of 15 and 20). So, converting the fractions to have a common denominator: A's work in one day = (4/60) of the job (since 15 * 4 = 60) B's work in one day = (3/60) of the job (since 20 * 3 = 60) Together in one day, they can do: (4/60) + (3/60) = (7/60) of the job. Now, if they work together for 3 days, they will complete: 3 * (7/60) = (21/60) of the job. To simplify (21/60), we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3: (21/60) ÷ (3/3) = (7/20) of the job. So, after 3 days of working together, A and B will have completed 7/20 of the job. To find the fraction of the work that is left, we subtract the work completed from the whole job (which is 1): Fraction of work left = 1 - (7/20) = (20/20) - (7/20) = (13/20).

We can use the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle BEF:    [    BE^2 = BF^2 + EF^2    ]    where BF = frac{1}{2}AB = 6.5 and EF = frac{1}{2}BC = 5.    [    BE^2 = 6.5^2 + 5^2 = 42.25 + 25 = 67.25    ]    Hence, BE = CF = sqrt{67.25}. 3. **Summing the squares of the medians:**    [    AD^2 + BE^2 + CF^2 = 144 + 67.25 + 67.25 = 278.5    ]    Thus, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the medians is boxed{278.5}."},{"instruction":"What is the sum of all the integers from 100 to 2000?","output":"To find the sum of all integers from 100 to 2000, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: [ text{Sum} = frac{text{First term} + text{Last term}}{2} times text{Number of terms} ] 1. **First Term**: 100 2. **Last Term**: 2000 3. **Number of Terms**: To find the number of terms, calculate the difference between the last term and the first term, then add one (since both ends are inclusive): [ text{Number of Terms} = 2000 - 100 + 1 = 1901 ] Plugging in the values: [ text{Sum} = frac{100 + 2000}{2} times 1901 = frac{2100}{2} times 1901 = 1050 times 1901 = boxed{1996050} ] Conclusion: The sum of all integers from 100 to 2000 is 1996050."},{"instruction":"Find the slope of the line given by the equation 4x + 7y = 28.","output":"To find the slope of the line described by 4x + 7y = 28, we first convert the equation into slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b.

Let A be the intersection of e and f, and g be a line intersecting e at point E, f at point F, and circle k at points G and H. 1. **Identifying the Tangent Segments**:    The lengths of the tangent segments drawn from a point to a circle satisfy the secant-tangent theorem. For point E, the tangent segment to k can be obtained as:    [    b = EB = sqrt{EG cdot EH}    ]    Similarly, for point F:    [    c = FC = sqrt{FG cdot FH}    ] 2. **Distinguishing Tangent Segment Lengths**:    Assume, without loss of generality, that b > c. Both E and F are distinct points, not on the segment GH. 3. **Drawing Parallel Lines and Segment Calculation**:    Through point F, draw a line parallel to BC intersecting e at point D. Thus, BD = CF = c. Using the distances EB = b and BD = c, we can obtain ED by:    [    ED = begin{cases}     b - c & text{if the segments are in opposite directions}     b + c & text{if the segments are in the same direction}    end{cases}    ] 4. **Angle Consideration for Constructing D**:    Since DF makes a 45^circ angle with e, point D can be located at distances ED = b pm c from E along e at 45^circ or 135^circ to DF. After determining D, e can be established through E and A as the midpoint. 5. **Secondary Construction with Circle and Tangents**:    Draw the Thales’ circle t over GH. From points E and F, draw tangents ET and FT such that ET = b and FT = c. Then draw circles centered at E with radii b - c and b + c, to intersect DF accordingly. 6. **Drawing Squares and Perpendicular Lines**:    Over segment EF, construct a square such that h is the circumscribing circle. From the intersections of circle h and circles with radii b pm c centered at E, locate point D. Determine e as the line through E and D. Draw f perpendicular to e at F. The intersection A determines the midpoint of BC. 7. **Final Construction and Reflections**:    Measure EB along e and draw a line through B parallel to DF, intersecting f at C. Reflect A over BC to find O, the center of circle k. The circle k will be centered at O with radius OB. 8. **Conditions and Validity**:    The construction is valid if E and F are off the segment GH. The condition that circles intersect relies on whether:    [    h geq b - c quad text{and} quad h geq b + c    ]    Here, h = sqrt{2} EF will determine the existence of intersection points. 9. **Completing the Construction**:    Once D is determined, draw e and f such that they are perpendicular, intersect at A, and touch k at B and C. Ensure k as the circle centered at O passing through B. Verify b and c constraints with circle properties ensuring it passes E and F tangentially at found radii. 10. **Concluding the Construction**:     The accuracy follows, knowing any circle passing through GH meets conditions for tangency at B and C. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Using 1 times 2 dominoes to cover a 4 times 4 chessboard, how many covering schemes are there?","output":"To solve the problem of covering a 4 times 4 chessboard with 1 times 2 dominoes, we can approach the problem systematically using various strategies.

Each section has an even number of squares. 2. Any 1 times 2 domino covering crosses one of these lines and must occupy an even number of positions on both sides of the line. We consider three distinct cases:    - **Case 1**: No domino crosses the line ( AB ).      For no domino to cross the dividing line, each 4 times 2 section must be tiled independently. Let's denote the number of ways to cover a 4 times 2 board with 1 times 2 dominoes as ( F_4 ). Each 4 times 2 section can be covered in ( F_4 ) ways, so the total number of ways to cover without any domino crossing the line is:      [      F_4 times F_4      ]      Calculating ( F_4 ), we get:      [      F_4 = 5      ]      Therefore:      [      F_4 times F_4 = 5 times 5 = 25      ]    - **Case 2**: Two dominoes cross the line ( AB ).

The problem states that one of the numbers is raised to the power of the other number, resulting in X, and the second number raised to the power of the first number results in Y. So: X = A^B = 375^25 Y = B^A = 25^375 To find the difference between X and Y, we would subtract Y from X: Difference = X - Y = 375^25 - 25^375 However, without a calculator that can handle such large exponents, it's not feasible to calculate these values exactly. But we can infer that since 375 is much larger than 25 and the exponents are also significantly different, X will be much larger than Y, making the difference practically equal to X. Lastly, the sum of both numbers is: Sum = A + B = 375 + 25 = 400 So, the sum of both numbers is boxed{400,}  and the difference between X and Y is approximately equal to X, which is a number too large to calculate exactly here."},{"instruction":"Assume that a real polynomial  P(x)  has no real roots.

This behavior confirms that f(x) has a local maximum at x=1, which is consistent with the problem statement. Case 2: When a=3, the derivative is f'(x)=9x^{2}-12x+3=3(3x-1)(x-1).

This indicates that the train itself is longer than the distance covered in 20 seconds. Therefore, the train has not completely crossed the bridge in the given time. The length of the bridge must be longer than the remaining part of the train that has not yet crossed.

So, the remaining lemons on the first tree are: 15 (initial) - 7 (Sally) - 12 (Tom) = -4 lemons. Since you can't have negative lemons on a tree, this means they picked all the lemons from the first tree, and there are 0 lemons left. **Second Tree:** - Initially, there were 20 lemons. - Mary picked 9 lemons.

Since the hall is a rectangular prism, we need to cover the floor, the ceiling, and the four walls. The area of the floor (which is the same as the area of the ceiling) is: Length × Width = 20 m × 15 m = 300 m² Since the ceiling has the same dimensions as the floor, its area is also 300 m². Now, let's calculate the area of the four walls. There are two sets of opposite walls, each set having the same dimensions. The area of the two longer walls is: Height × Length = 5 m × 20 m = 100 m² Since there are two such walls, the total area for the longer walls is: 2 × 100 m² = 200 m² The area of the two shorter walls is: Height × Width = 5 m × 15 m = 75 m² Since there are two such walls, the total area for the shorter walls is: 2 × 75 m² = 150 m² Now, let's add up all the areas to get the total area to be covered with the mat: Floor + Ceiling + Longer Walls + Shorter Walls 300 m² + 300 m² + 200 m² + 150 m² = 950 m² The cost of covering 1 square meter with the mat is Rs. 20.

We need to prove two statements: 1. The terms of the sequence are pairwise coprime. 2. The limit of the following series is 1:  sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{T_k}.  **Part I: Proving Pairwise Coprimeness** 1. Consider two arbitrary but distinct terms of the sequence, (T_k) and (T_m), with (k > m). 2. According to the given recurrence relation,  T_{k} - 1 = T_{k-1} (T_{k-1} - 1).  3. Substitute ( (T_{k-1}-1) = T_{k-2} (T_{k-2} - 1) ) and continue in a similar fashion until ( T_m ) appears. We get:  T_{k} - 1 = T_{k-1} cdot T_{k-2} cdot ldots cdot T_{m} (T_{m} - 1).  4. Generally, a common divisor of (T_k) and (T_m) would also divide the difference (T_k - A T_m) for any integer (A). By choosing:  A = T_{k-1} cdot T_{k-2} cdot ldots cdot T_{m+1} (T_m - 1),  the difference becomes:  T_k - A T_m = 1.  Thus, ( gcd(T_k, T_m) = gcd(T_m, 1) = 1 ), proving that (T_k) and (T_m) are coprime (pairwise coprime as desired). **Part II: Determining the Limit of the Series** 1. Since (T_n geq 2), from the recurrence relation, we have:  T_{n+1} - 1 = T_n (T_n - 1) geq T_n.  2. This implies (T_{n+1} geq T_n + 1). 3. Starting from (T_1 = 2), it follows that (T_n geq n + 1). 4. Thus, each term (T_n neq 0), validating the definition of the series. 5. Using the recurrence relation, rewrite:  frac{1}{T_k} = frac{T_k}{T_{k+1} - 1} - frac{1}{T_{k+1} - 1}.  From this, we can rearrange it as:  frac{1}{T_k} = frac{1}{T_k - 1} - frac{1}{T_{k+1} - 1}.  6. Summing these equations from (k=1) to (n), we get:  sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{T_k} = sum_{k=1}^{n} left( frac{1}{T_k - 1} - frac{1}{T_{k+1} - 1} right).  This results in a telescoping series:  sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{T_k} = left( frac{1}{T_1 - 1} right) - left( frac{1}{T_{n+1} - 1} right) = left( frac{1}{1} right) - left( frac{1}{T_{n+1} - 1} right).  7. As (T_n) tends to infinity as (n to infty),  frac{1}{T_{n+1} - 1} to 0.  Thus,  sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{T_k} to 1.  **Conclusion:** The sequence is pairwise coprime, and  sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{T_k} to 1 , text{as} , n to infty.

D: If a and b are two equal real numbers, then left(abright)+left(a+bright)i is a purely imaginary number.","output":"Let's analyze each option step by step: **Option A**: We are given vectors overline{{e}_{1}}=(2,-3) and overline{{e}_{2}}=(frac{1}{2},-frac{3}{4}). To check if they can serve as a basis for all vectors in a plane, we need to see if they are linearly independent. We notice that overline{{e}_{1}} = 4overline{{e}_{2}}, which means overline{{e}_{1}} and overline{{e}_{2}} are linearly dependent because one can be expressed as a scalar multiple of the other. Therefore, they cannot serve as a basis for all vectors in a plane, making option A correct. **Option B**: If overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b}, then the angle theta between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is either 0 or pi. The magnitude of the projection of overrightarrow{a} onto the direction of overrightarrow{b} is given by |overrightarrow{a}|cos(theta). Since cos(0) = 1 and cos(pi) = -1, the magnitude of the projection is |overrightarrow{a}| in both cases. Hence, option B is correct. **Option C**: A number z is purely imaginary if its real part is 0. The condition z + overline{z} in mathbb{R} only ensures that the sum of z and its conjugate is real, which is always true since z + overline{z} = 2Re(z), where Re(z) denotes the real part of z. This does not necessarily mean z is purely imaginary. For example, when z = 0, we have z + overline{z} = 0 in mathbb{R}, but z is not purely imaginary; it is real. Therefore, option C is incorrect. **Option D**: If a and b are two equal real numbers, then a = b. Substituting a = b into left(a-bright)+left(a+bright)i, we get left(a-aright)+left(a+aright)i = 0 + 2ai. If a = b = 0, then this expression simplifies to 0, which is a real number, not purely imaginary. Thus, option D is incorrect. Since the question asks for the incorrect statement, the correct options are C and D. However, the final statement in the solution incorrectly identifies both C and D as correct options when in fact they are the incorrect statements as per the question's request. The correct answer should identify the incorrect statement(s), which are C and D.

Let's analyze these conditions step by step. 1. **Condition Analysis:**    - The first condition implies that the difference quotient ( frac{f(x+a) - f(x)}{a} ) is an integer only when ( a = 1 ). This suggests that the function ( f ) has a specific behavior when incremented by 1.    - The second condition implies that ( f(x) ) is close to a linear function ( cx ) with a bounded deviation. 2. **Function Transformation:**    - Define ( g(x) = f(x) - lfloor c rfloor x ). This transformation helps us focus on the fractional part of ( c ). Note that ( g(x) ) will also satisfy the given conditions because ( lfloor c rfloor x ) is a linear function and does not affect the integer difference quotient condition. 3. **Bounding ( g(x) ):**    - Since ( |f(x) - cx| < 2023 ), we have ( |g(x) - {c}x| < 2023 ), where ( {c} ) denotes the fractional part of ( c ). 4. **Behavior of ( g(x) ):**    - If ( {c} < frac{1}{2} ), then ( g(x) ) is bounded within a range that grows slower than ( x ). This would imply that ( g(x) ) can only take a limited number of values as ( x ) increases, leading to a contradiction because ( g(x) ) must be injective to satisfy the first condition.    - Similarly, if ( {c} > frac{1}{2} ), then ( h(x) = x - g(x) ) would also be bounded within a range that grows slower than ( x ), leading to a similar contradiction. 5. **Special Case ( {c} = frac{1}{2} ):**    - Let ( c = n + frac{1}{2} ) for some integer ( n ). Consider the function ( f(x) = leftlfloor frac{x}{2} rightrfloor + nx + 1 ). We need to check if this function satisfies the given conditions.    - For ( a = 1 ), ( frac{f(x+1) - f(x)}{1} ) is an integer.    - For ( a > 1 ), ( frac{f(x+a) - f(x)}{a} ) is not an integer because the floor function introduces a non-linear behavior that disrupts the integer difference quotient. 6. **Verification:**    - For ( f(x) = leftlfloor frac{x}{2} rightrfloor + nx + 1 ), we have ( |f(x) - (n + frac{1}{2})x| < 2023 ) because the floor function and the constant term ensure the deviation is bounded.

Speed of the man's train = 15 kmph Speed of the goods train = 97 kmph Relative speed = Speed of the goods train + Speed of the man's train Relative speed = 97 kmph + 15 kmph Relative speed = 112 kmph Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second to be consistent with the length of the goods train, which is given in meters. 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds (since 1 km = 1000 m and 1 hour = 3600 seconds) So, 112 kmph in meters per second is: 112 kmph = 112 * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) 112 kmph = 112000 meters / 3600 seconds 112 kmph = 31.11 meters/second (rounded to two decimal places) Now we have the relative speed in meters per second, and we can calculate the time it takes for the goods train to pass the man using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance to be covered is the length of the goods train, which is 280 meters. Time = 280 meters / 31.11 meters/second Time ≈ 8.99 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{8.99}  seconds for the goods train to pass the man."},{"instruction":"Find all the solutions to [sqrt{(3 + 2sqrt{2})^x} + sqrt{(3  2sqrt{2})^x} = 6.]","output":"Let y = sqrt{(3 + 2sqrt{2})^x}.

On one hand, the number of such words is n^m because each position in the word can be any of the n letters. 3. On the other hand, since ( m < n ), such words cannot contain all the letters of the alphabet. Therefore, all these words belong to the union:     [     A_1 cup A_2 cup ldots cup A_n     ]     where ( A_i ) is the set of all words of length m that do not contain the letter a_i. 4. Note that the intersection of k sets of type A_i is the set of words written in an alphabet of n-k letters, and thus it consists of (n-k)^m words. 5. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we obtain:     [     |A_1 cup A_2 cup ldots cup A_n| = sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k-1} binom{n}{k} (n-k)^m     ]     Here, |A_1 cup A_2 cup ldots cup A_n| represents the total number of words of length m that are missing at least one letter from the n letters. 6.

The total age of the 12 men before the replacement is 12 * (average age before replacement). Since the average age is increased by 2 years when the two men are replaced, the new average age is (average age before replacement + 2). The total age of the 12 men after the replacement is 12 * (average age before replacement + 2). The difference in the total age before and after the replacement is equal to the combined age of the two new men minus the combined age of the two men who were replaced.

The areas of triangles ABD and BCD are respectively denoted as S and T. Find the maximum value of S^2 + T^2.","output":"We have a quadrilateral ABCD with sides AB = CD and AD = DC = CB = 1. We are trying to maximize S^2 + T^2, where S is the area of triangle ABD and T is the area of triangle BCD. To proceed, we note that due to the side lengths being equal, both triangle ABD and triangle BCD are isosceles. We can express the areas of these triangles in terms of the base and height. For the isosceles triangle triangle ABD with base AB and height h_1 (the height from D onto AB), the area S is given by  S = frac{1}{2} times AB times h_1.  Similarly, for triangle BCD with base CD and height h_2 (the height from A onto CD), we have  T = frac{1}{2} times CD times h_2.  Since AB = CD, we have  S^2 = left( frac{1}{2} times AB times h_1 right)^2 = frac{1}{4} times AB^2 times h_1^2   T^2 = left( frac{1}{2} times CD times h_2 right)^2 = frac{1}{4} times CD^2 times h_2^2.  We want to maximize S^2 + T^2, which is  S^2 + T^2 = frac{1}{4} times AB^2 times h_1^2 + frac{1}{4} times CD^2 times h_2^2.  Remembering that AB = CD, we can write AB = CD = a (since we don't have the specific length for AB or CD, just that they are equal). We thus have  S^2 + T^2 = frac{a^2}{4} times (h_1^2 + h_2^2).  Now, we must consider how to maximize h_1^2 + h_2^2. Given that in an isosceles triangle, the height also bisects the base, so we have two right-angled triangles inside each of the isosceles triangles ABD and BCD. Let's take triangle ABD for instance. We apply the Pythagorean Theorem in one of the right-angled triangles formed by the base AB, height h_1, and side AD=1:  h_1^2 + (frac{AB}{2})^2 = AD^2   h_1^2 = AD^2 - (frac{AB}{2})^2 = 1^2 - (frac{a}{2})^2 = 1 - frac{a^2}{4}.  Similarly, for triangle BCD, we have  h_2^2 = BC^2 - (frac{CD}{2})^2 = 1 - frac{a^2}{4}.  Therefore,  S^2 + T^2 = frac{a^2}{4} times [2 times (1 - frac{a^2}{4})].  Expanding the expression, we get  S^2 + T^2 = frac{a^2}{4} times (2 - frac{a^2}{2}) = frac{1}{2} times a^2 - frac{1}{8} times a^4.  Taking the derivative with respect to a and setting it to zero to find the extremum, gives  frac{d}{da}(S^2 + T^2) = a - frac{1}{2} times a^3 = 0.   a - frac{1}{2} times a^3 = 0   a(1 - frac{1}{2} times a^2) = 0.  Solving for a, we get a=0 (which does not make sense for the length of a side) or a^2 = 2. Therefore, the maximum occurs when a^2 = 2, and thus  S^2 + T^2 = frac{1}{2} times 2 - frac{1}{8} times (2)^2 = 1 - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2}.

To find the percentage increase, we subtract 1 (or 100%) from 2.9 to account for the original height, and then multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage: Percentage increase in height = (2.9 - 1) * 100% Percentage increase in height = 1.9 * 100% Percentage increase in height = 190% Therefore, the height of the cone was increased by boxed{190%} ."},{"instruction":"Given that tanalpha and tanbeta are the two roots of the equation x^2 + 3sqrt{3}x + 4 = 0, and alpha, beta in (frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}), find the value of alpha + beta (   ).

Therefore, the total distance covered in 11 hours is the sum of the distances covered each hour: ( 660 = r + (r + 20) + (r + 30) + ... + (r + 100) ) This is an arithmetic series with the first term ( a_1 = r ) and the 11th term ( a_{11} = r + 100 ).

Each of the remaining 9 subsets shares an element with (X). Thus, each element in (X) appears in at least (4) subsets:        - When considering subsets with cardinality (3), it is essential that one of the elements of each subset occurs in at least (3) of the remaining subsets.     - Verification is necessary if less than 4 is possible. Suppose each element occurs no more than 4 times, respective sets count distribution aren't fitting (30) divisible by (10). 5.  **Contradict** assumption for minimum other than 4**:    [    n times 10 = 10 , (30)    ]    - No integer resolution confirms 4 is divisible within these sets.

Therefore, the standard equation of the hyperbola is x^{2} - frac{y^{2}}{9} = 1.   Therefore, the equations of the asymptotes of the hyperbola are y = pm 3x.   The coordinates of the right vertex of the hyperbola are A(1,0), which are also the coordinates of the focus of parabola L,   Therefore, the standard equation of parabola L is y^{2} = 4x.

The problem asks if there exists an ( n ) such that within this sequence, each digit from 0 to 9 appears the same number of times. To solve this, we demonstrate that there is consistently more occurrences of the digit 1 than 0, thus showing that such an ( n ) does not exist.  First Method: Inductive Proof 1. **Base Case:**    - Consider the sequence up to the first few numbers: ( 12345678910 ). Here, the digit '0' does not appear at all initially, whereas the digit '1' appears at least once.    - Therefore, for small initial segments, it is evident that '1' appears more often than '0'. 2. **Inductive Step:**    - Assume that up to some ( k )-digit number, we already know that the digit '1' appears more often than '0'.    - We will analyze how adding numbers from ( 10^k ) to ( 10^{k+1}-1 ) affects this count.    - Consider the sequence of numbers from ( 10^k ) to ( 10^{k+1} - 1 ). This can be broken into blocks of ( 10^k ) numbers each. 3. **Analysis of Blocks:**    - In each block, for example, starting from ( 100, 101, ldots, 199 ) and so forth, ignore leading digit counting initially.    - When evaluating the counts of remaining digits, we effectively count numbers from ( 0 ) to ( 99999 ), and within this range (omitting the leading digit), each digit appears uniformly.    - However, when we restore the leading digits back to their positions, numbers starting with '1' will become significantly higher because the next block of numbers will likely include '1' more frequently in the beginning places than '0'. 4. **Conclusion from Inductive Step:**    - Observe that the count of the digit '1' continues to be more than '0' through successive ranges.    - This implies as the sequence extends, the additional numbers inserted contribute more '1's more frequently than '0's. Therefore, by induction, assuming the first few blocks show '1' appears more and showing subsequent ranges maintain this pattern proves that across any ( n ) extended from these ranges, '1's will outnumber '0's.  Second Method: Correspondence Argument 1. **Correspondence Setup:**    - Match each '0' in the sequence to a '1' that precedes it. Suppose '0' appears within some ( X ) at position ( m+1 ) from the end.    - Then we consider number ( X-9 cdot 10^m ), which ends with '1'. This correspondence matches the '0' from ( X ) with this '1'. 2. **Opposite Construction:**    - Construct the reverse correspondence by matching each '1' in the sequence within some ( X ) at the ( m+1 ) position with '0' that appears in ( X+ 9 cdot 10^m ). 3. **Inspection Insight:**    - If the sequence had all natural numbers infinitely large, the opposite correspondence would show potential balance.    - However, for any finite sequence up to some ( n ), setting up such correspondence fails to confine within sequence bounds as described. 4. **Limits and Observations:**    - This argument demonstrates no such ( n ) can exist without invoking higher powers of ten exceeding realistic bounds of sequence length.    - Counting practical ranges repeatedly shows higher instances of '1' due to starting patterns in new decade ranges.

This implies that for any four points ({a, b, x, y}), there must be a red triangle among them. 3. **Implications of the Assumption:**    Since ( ab ) is not red, the edges ( xy ) must be red. Additionally, either ( ax ) and ( ay ) must be red, or ( bx ) and ( by ) must be red. This ensures that among any four points, three of them form a red triangle. 4. **Red Subgraph:**    This implies that the complete graph ( K_n ) minus the edge ( ab ) (denoted as ( K_n - {a, b} )) must be red.

By setting A_1 = (1-alpha, 1-alpha) and B_1 = (-alpha, alpha) for some alpha in [0,1], we satisfy the conditions of the problem. The coordinates ensure points are on the respective segments and the ratios hold. 4. We need to find the equation of the line passing through A_1 and B_1. The slope m of the line A_1B_1 is calculated as:    [    m = frac{alpha - (1-alpha)}{-alpha - (1-alpha)} = frac{2alpha - 1}{-2alpha}    ] 5.

Without loss of generality, assume a_1 geq a_2 geq a_3. 2. **Empty Set Cases**:    - If P_{1} = emptyset and P_{2} = emptyset, then P_{3} = mathbb{R}^{3}, which means all distances can be realized within P_{3}, contradicting our assumption. Hence, this scenario is impossible.    - If P_{1} = mathbb{R}^{3}, then P_2 = emptyset and P_3 = emptyset. Similarly, all distances can be realized in P_1, making this scenario impossible. 3. **Non-empty Set Case**:    Assume P_1 neq emptyset. Let X_1 in P_1.    - Consider the sphere S centered at X_1 with radius a_1. Since set P_1 cannot realize the distance a_1, the sphere S does not fully lie in P_1.    - Hence, the sphere S must intersect either P_2 or P_3. Without loss of generality, assume it intersects P_2. Let X_2 in P_2 cap S. 4. **Construction of a Circle**:    - The circle left{Y in S mid d(X_2, Y)=a_2right} lies in P_3 because P_2 cannot realize distance a_2.    - Given that a_1 geq a_2, we infer X_2 must be a point such that the circle is valid within P_3. 5. **Distance Realization**:    - The radius r of the circle described by left{Y in S mid d(X_2, Y)=a_2right} is given by:      [      r = a_2 sqrt{1 - frac{a_2^2}{4 a_1^2}}.      ]    - Notice that r is derived from the geometry of a triangle inscribed in a sphere.

Hallie's hourly wage earnings: - On Monday, she works for 7 hours at 10/hour, so she earns 7 * 10 = 70. - On Tuesday, she works for 5 hours at 10/hour, so she earns 5 * 10 = 50. - On Wednesday, she works for 7 hours at 10/hour, so she earns 7 * 10 = 70. Total earnings from hourly wage over the three days: 70 (Monday) + 50 (Tuesday) + 70 (Wednesday) = 190.

Also, the number 99 can be written as:     [     99 = 100 - 1     ] 6. **Digits of the resulting number**:     Since (A > C), the difference (A - C) is a positive integer. The digits of (99 times (A - C)) will always ensure that:     - The middle digit is 9.     - The sum of the other two digits equals 9.     To show this more explicitly, we consider the decimal representation generated by multiplication by 99:     [     99 = 100 - 1     ] 7. **Breaking down the components**:     Let us verify by direct computation if desired. If we write:     [     99(A - C) = (A-C-1) cdot 100 + 90 + (10 + C - A)     ]     This ensures that the middle digit is 9:     [     9     ]     And the sum of the other two digits is:     [     (A-C-1) + (10 + C - A) = 9     ] 8. **Conclusion**:     Therefore, the difference between any three-digit number and its reverse, where the digits are taken in reverse order, will always yield a number whose middle digit is 9 and the sum of the other two digits is 9.

This means every vertex in ( A_i ) is connected to every vertex in ( A_{i+1} ). 5. **Finding paths:**     - Any two vertices within the same set ( A_i ) can be connected with paths of length 100 by alternating through adjacent sets back and forth.     - This construction ensures:         - Paths of exactly 100 edges exist between any two vertices.         - No cycles form with lengths less than 101, as they would require cycling through all the sets, thereby forming a cycle of exactly 101 edges. 6. **Conclusion:**     - The odd ( n ) that cannot be allowed is precisely 101 due to this cycle formation.     - For any ( n ) greater than 101, it’s easy to see configurations where having more than 101 vertices can potentially create cycles of the forbidden odd-length ( n ).     - For ( n ) less than 100, the construction ensures no prohibited cycles because of the graph’s guaranteed structural properties.

To find the union A cup B: - Since A covers [3, 7) and B covers (2, 10), combining these intervals gives us everything from 2 to 10, excluding 2 and including 10. Hence, A cup B = (2, 10). To find the complement of A in the real numbers, complement_R A: - complement_R A includes everything not in A. Since A = [3, 7), complement_R A is (-infty, 3) cup [7, +infty). To find B cap (complement_R A): - The intersection of B with complement_R A means we look for elements common to B and not in A. Since B = (2, 10) and complement_R A = (-infty, 3) cup [7, +infty), their intersection is (2, 3) cup [7, 10).

Since the reference solution mentions consulting the solution to Problem 7.3, let's redefine it here for clarity. We want to find all three-digit numbers overline{abc} such that the number minus the sum of its digits results in a number consisting of identical digits. Mathematically, we require: [ overline{abc} - (a + b + c) ] to be of the form overline{ddd}, where all digits d are the same. We notice a few steps: 1. Let overline{abc} be a three-digit number. 2. The sum of digits is a + b + c. 3. Subtracting the sum of digits from the number we get: [ 100a + 10b + c - (a + b + c) = 99a + 9b ] Clearly, 99a + 9b = 9(11a + b). For the result to be a number consisting of identical digits like 111, 222, ... up to 999, 9(11a + b) must be one of these forms. Let's analyze all possible satisfactory conditions: - The values 9(11a + b) should be 111, 222, ..., 999. Each of these must be divisible by 9, which implies that the possible curious numbers' digits need to sum accordingly. Going step-by-step, we find that the permissible digits in (a, b) for values between 100 and 999 result in 30 possible combinations.  Thus, adhering to conditions, there are [ boxed{30} ] curious three-digit numbers. **Part b**: How many four-digit curious numbers exist? Let overline{txyz} be a four-digit curious number.

For the four-digit case, let's write a formula: [ 1000t + 100x + 10y + z - (t + x + y + z) = 999t + 99x + 9y ] Factoring 9 out of this expression yields: [ 9(111t + 11x + y) ] Here, we see that 9(111t + 11x + y) must be a number consisting of identical digits like 999, 2222, etc. Evaluating possibilities, we derive: Use 999, since others (2222, 3333, ... 8888) aren't divisible by 9. Hence: [ 111t + 11x + y = 111 ] We solve for variables t, x, y.

To prove this statement, we analyze the properties associated with the digits of a perfect square. Specifically, the problem involves checking the consequences of a number being perfect square and its digits being classified as all even or all odd.  1. **Possible Digit Groups by Parity:**    There are two groups of digits:    - Even digits: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8    - Odd digits: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 2. **Sum of the Digits Modulo 9:**    The crucial observation is about the sum of the digits of a perfect square:    - The sum of the digits of any number (in this case, a perfect square) modulo 9 gives a remainder that is either 0, 1, 4, or 7. This is because squares of the integers 0, 1, 2, ..., 8 modulo 9 take on these values. 3. **Sum Calculation for Each Group:**    - **Even Digits:**      [      text{Sum of digits of the set } {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} = 0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20      ]      When 20 is divided by 9, the remainder is:      [      20 div 9 = 2 quad text{(remainder)}      ]      Thus, 20 equiv 2 pmod{9}.            Since the sum 20 equiv 2 pmod{9} is not one of the allowed remainders (0, 1, 4, 7), it means a number composed exclusively of the digits 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and forming a perfect square cannot exist.          - **Odd Digits:**      If a square number ends in an odd digit, the digit before the last one must be even. Counting specifically (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) would lead to one of an analyzed case.       We deduce that it forms a parity error:            [      text{Sum of an odd set - (no even before last digit)}      ]      We understand this permutation must fail proof check by last assumption.

They cost 3 for small glasses and 5 for large ones. He has 50.  If he buys 8 small ones and leaves with 1 in change, how many large ones did he buy?","output":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Total Money Spent on Glasses**: Peter had 50 and was left with 1. Thus, the total amount spent on glasses is calculated by subtracting the remaining amount from the total amount he had.    [    50 - 1 = 49    ]    So, he spent 49 on glasses. 2. **Money Spent on Small Glasses**: Each small glass costs 3, and Peter bought 8 of them. The total cost for the small glasses is found by multiplying the cost per small glass by the number of small glasses bought.    [    8 times 3 = 24    ]    Therefore, Peter spent 24 on small glasses. 3. **Money Spent on Large Glasses**: To find out how much was spent on large glasses, we subtract the amount spent on small glasses from the total amount spent on glasses.    [    49 - 24 = 25    ]    Hence, 25 was spent on large glasses. 4. **Number of Large Glasses Bought**: Knowing that each large glass costs 5, and Peter spent 25 on them, we can find the number of large glasses by dividing the total spent on large glasses by the cost of one large glass.

Prove: (1) After a finite amount of time, there will no longer be any black squares on the paper; (2) The black squares will disappear no later than at time t = n.","output":"1. **Define the Initial State:**    Consider an infinite grid of squares and suppose we color n squares black initially. 2. **Recoloring Rule:**    At each time step t, each square k will be recolored based on the majority color among itself, its right neighbor, and its top neighbor. This means, square k will be black if at least two out of these three squares are black. 3. **Bounding the Black Squares:**    We can always draw a m times m square around the n black squares such that all black squares are contained within this bounding m times m square. After this, color all the white squares inside this m times m square black. This setup ensures that at the next step the number of black squares does not decrease and remains within the m times m square. 4. **Inductive Proof for Step 1:**     - **Base Case (n = 1):** If there is only one black square, it is clear that in the next step, it can only turn white, and hence the grid will have no black squares.     - **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume for n = k-1, the grid turns completely white after some finite number of steps.     - **Inductive Step:** For n = k black squares, consider that there is at least one black square in the leftmost column and one in the bottom row within the bounding box.       - Apply the recoloring rule: The left black square does not affect the right neighbor; the bottom black square does not affect the top neighbor.       - Thus, after each step, the number of black squares reduces by at least one black square either from the bottom row or the left column.       - Since there were k black squares initially, after k steps, at most one black square remains, and eventually, it will turn white as well.       - Conclude that after removing the rows and columns step-by-step, no black squares will remain after finite steps. 5. **Conclude in Terms of the Number of Steps:**    - Since each application potentially reduces the number of black squares exactly as deducted, the number of steps required to turn the whole grid white will not exceed t = n. Thus, the black squares will disappear, proving that after a finite number of steps, there will be no black squares. **Conclusion:**  boxed{}"},{"instruction":"The polynomial ( Q(x) = x^3 + px^2 + qx + d ) has the property that the mean of its zeros, twice the product of its zeros, and the sum of its coefficients are all equal.

Rearrange the inequality:    [    a_i - a_j geq frac{a_i a_j}{25}    ]    [    25(a_i - a_j) geq a_i a_j    ]    [    25a_i - 25a_j geq a_i a_j    ] 5. For ( i = n ) and ( j = n-1 ), we have:    [    25a_n - 25a_{n-1} geq a_n a_{n-1}    ]    [    25(a_n - a_{n-1}) geq a_n a_{n-1}    ]    [    a_n a_{n-1} leq 25(a_n - a_{n-1})    ] 6. Let ( a_n = a_{n-1} + k ) where ( k geq 1 ). Then:    [    (a_{n-1} + k) a_{n-1} leq 25k    ]    [    a_{n-1}^2 + k a_{n-1} leq 25k    ] 7. Since ( k geq 1 ), we can bound ( a_{n-1} ):    [    a_{n-1}^2 + k a_{n-1} - 25k leq 0    ] 8. Solving the quadratic inequality ( a_{n-1}^2 + k a_{n-1} - 25k leq 0 ) for ( a_{n-1} ):    [    a_{n-1} = frac{-k pm sqrt{k^2 + 100k}}{2}    ] 9. Since ( a_{n-1} ) must be a positive integer, we consider the positive root:    [    a_{n-1} leq frac{-k + sqrt{k^2 + 100k}}{2}    ] 10. For ( k = 1 ), we get:     [     a_{n-1} leq frac{-1 + sqrt{1 + 100}}{2} = frac{-1 + 10.05}{2} approx 4.525     ]     Thus, ( a_{n-1} leq 4 ). 11. Repeating this process for ( a_{n-2}, a_{n-3}, ldots, a_1 ), we find that each subsequent element must be significantly smaller, leading to a contradiction if ( n > 9 ). 12. Therefore, ( n leq 9 ). 13. To provide an example of such a set with 9 elements, consider ( A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 600 + k} ) where ( k in mathbb{N} ). This set satisfies the condition ( |x - y| geq frac{xy}{25} ) for any two distinct elements ( x, y in A ). The final answer is ( boxed{ n leq 9 } )."},{"instruction":"A board meeting requires arranging five women on indistinguishable rocking chairs and five men on indistinguishable stools in a row of ten seats.

According to the agreement, the servant was to receive Rs. 600 and a uniform after one year of service. However, the servant only worked for 9 months (which is 3/4 of a year) and received Rs. 400 and a uniform. If the servant had worked for the full year, he would have received Rs. 600. Since he worked for 3/4 of the year, we would expect him to receive 3/4 of the agreed salary, which is (3/4) * 600 = Rs. 450. However, the servant received Rs. 400, which is Rs. 50 less than the prorated salary of Rs. 450.

This is because the absolute value |x-a| measures the distance between any point x and the point a on the number line. 2. **Finding the Maximum Difference**: To find the maximum value of |x-4|-|x+5|, we need to consider when this difference is maximized. This occurs when x is equidistant from 4 and -5, or in other words, when x is at a point that maximizes the difference between these two distances. However, upon further inspection, we realize that the maximum difference actually occurs when x is at its extreme, specifically when x leqslant -5, not -4 as previously mentioned. This is a correction to the initial analysis. 3. **Calculating the Maximum Difference**: When x leqslant -5, the expression |x-4|-|x+5| reaches its maximum value. To find this maximum value, we can substitute a value of x that is less than or equal to -5 into the expression.

In the given problem, we are dealing with a rhombus ABCD with a side length of n and an apex angle A of 60^circ. The rhombus is divided into smaller equilateral triangles, and we need to find the number of trapezoids formed using these segments. 2. We start by determining the number of \\"internal trapezoids\\" f(n).  3. Each (k,r) trapezoid can be seen as one k-level triangle minus one (k-r)-level triangle. Each k-level triangle cuts out k-level trapezoids in 3(k-1) ways. 4. Calculate the number of k-level triangles: For k-level upward triangles, the horizontal coordinate P at the lower left endpoint can take values from 0, 1, ldots, n-k. Therefore, they have (n-k+1) values. Similarly, the vertical coordinate can also take (n-k+1) values. Hence, there are (n-k+1)^2 k-level upward triangles. By symmetry, there are (n-k+1)^2 down triangles too. 5. Thus, the number of k-level triangles is 2(n-k+1)^2, and hence the number of internal trapezoids can be calculated as follows: [ f(n) = 6 sum_{k=1}^{n} [n-(k-1)]^2 (k-1) = 6 sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-i)^2 i ] 6. We simplify the summation as follows: [ f(n) = 6n sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^2 - 6 sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^3 ] 7. Using known summation formulas: [ sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^2 = frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6}, quad sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^3 = left( frac{n(n-1)}{2} right)^2 ] 8. Substituting them into f(n): [ f(n) = 6n cdot frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} - 6 left( frac{(n-1)n}{2} right)^2 = frac{n^2(n^2-1)}{2} ] 9. Next, we calculate the number of \\"external trapezoids\\" g(n). 10. For external trapezoids, each i,j pair (1 leq j < i leq n) gives: [ text{Triangles with point } M_{ij} text{ having an external intersection} = (n-j) cdot frac{j(j+1)}{2} ] 11. Summing over all valid j values: [ g(n) = 4 sum_{j=1}^{n-1} frac{j(j+1)}{2}(n-j) = 2 sum_{j=1}^{n-1} [(n-1)j^2 + nj - j^3] ] 12. Simplifying using summation formulas: [ g(n) = frac{n(n+2)(n^2-1)}{6} ] 13. Therefore, the total number of trapezoids is: [ s(n) = f(n) + g(n) = frac{n^2(n^2-1)}{2} + frac{n(n+2)(n^2-1)}{6} = frac{n(n^2-1)(2n+1)}{3} ] 14.

From the information given, we know that: A = 10 (since Lisa took 10 photos of animals) S = F - 10 (since she took 10 fewer scenery photos than flowers) We also know that the total number of photos Lisa took last weekend is 45, so: A + F + S = 45 Substituting the known values for A and S, we get: 10 + F + (F - 10) = 45 Combining like terms, we have: 2F = 45 - 10 + 10 2F = 45 Dividing both sides by 2 to solve for F, we get: F = 45 / 2 F = 22.5 Since the number of photos must be a whole number, we can infer that Lisa actually took 22 photos of flowers and 12 photos of scenery (since 22 - 10 = 12). Now, we can find the ratio of the number of photos of flowers to the number of photos of animals: F : A = 22 : 10 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: (22/2) : (10/2) = 11 : 5 Therefore, the ratio of the number of photos of flowers to the number of photos of animals is boxed{11:5} ."},{"instruction":"Let (left(1+x+x^{2}right)^{150}=sum_{k=0}^{300} c_{k} x^{k}), where (c_{0}), (c_{1}), ldots, (c_{300}) are constants.

This means ( ax_1 equiv ax_2 pmod{n} ) implies ( x_1 equiv x_2 pmod{n} ). This holds if and only if ( gcd(a, n) = 1 ).    - **Surjectivity:** Since ( M ) is a finite set with ( n ) elements, an injective function from ( M ) to ( M ) is also surjective. Therefore, ( f_a ) is bijective if and only if ( gcd(a, n) = 1 ). 2. **Prove that ( a^{n(n-1)} - 1 ) is divisible by ( n^2 ) when ( n ) is a prime number and ( f_a ) is bijective:**    - Given ( n ) is a prime number and ( f_a ) is bijective, we have ( gcd(a, n) = 1 ).    - By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer ( a ) such that ( gcd(a, n) = 1 ), we have ( a^{n-1} equiv 1 pmod{n} ).    - Consider ( a^{n(n-1)} - 1 ):      [      a^{n(n-1)} - 1 = (a^{n-1})^n - 1      ]    - Since ( a^{n-1} equiv 1 pmod{n} ), we have:      [      (a^{n-1})^n equiv 1^n equiv 1 pmod{n}      ]    - Therefore:      [      a^{n(n-1)} - 1 equiv 0 pmod{n}      ]    - To show that ( a^{n(n-1)} - 1 ) is divisible by ( n^2 ), we use the Lifting The Exponent (LTE) lemma:      - For ( n ) prime and ( a ) not divisible by ( n ), LTE states:        [        v_n(a^n - 1) = v_n(a - 1) + v_n(n)        ]      - Applying LTE to ( a^{n-1} - 1 ):        [        v_n(a^{n-1} - 1) = v_n(a - 1) + v_n(n-1)        ]      - Since ( n ) is prime, ( v_n(n-1) = 0 ), so:        [        v_n(a^{n-1} - 1) = v_n(a - 1)        ]      - Applying LTE to ( (a^{n-1})^n - 1 ):        [        v_n((a^{n-1})^n - 1) = v_n(a^{n-1} - 1) + v_n(n)        ]      - Since ( v_n(n) = 1 ), we get:        [        v_n(a^{n(n-1)} - 1) = v_n(a^{n-1} - 1) + 1 = v_n(a - 1) + 1        ]      - Since ( v_n(a - 1) geq 0 ), we have ( v_n(a^{n(n-1)} - 1) geq 1 + 1 = 2 ), which means ( a^{n(n-1)} - 1 ) is divisible by ( n^2 ).

First, let's find out how many 2-point questions there are. We know there are 10 questions worth four points, so the remaining questions must be worth two points each. Since there are 40 questions in total: Number of 2-point questions = Total number of questions - Number of 4-point questions Number of 2-point questions = 40 - 10 Number of 2-point questions = 30 Now, let's calculate the total points from the 2-point questions: Total points from 2-point questions = Number of 2-point questions * Points per question Total points from 2-point questions = 30 * 2 Total points from 2-point questions = 60 Next, we calculate the total points from the 4-point questions: Total points from 4-point questions = Number of 4-point questions * Points per question Total points from 4-point questions = 10 * 4 Total points from 4-point questions = 40 Finally, we add the points from both types of questions to find the total point value of the test: Total point value of the test = Total points from 2-point questions + Total points from 4-point questions Total point value of the test = 60 + 40 Total point value of the test = 100 So, the total point value of the test is boxed{100}  points."},{"instruction":"f mathbf{a}, mathbf{b}, and mathbf{c} are vectors such that |mathbf{a}| = |mathbf{b}| = 1, |mathbf{a} + mathbf{b}| = 1, and  [mathbf{c}  mathbf{a}  4 mathbf{b} = 5 (mathbf{a} times mathbf{b}),] then find mathbf{b} cdot mathbf{c}.","output":"From |mathbf{a} + mathbf{b}| = 1, we have (mathbf{a} + mathbf{b}) cdot (mathbf{a} + mathbf{b}) = 1.

We start by using the identity sin^2 x = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}cos 2x: begin{align*} f(x) &= frac{3}{2}sin 2x + sin^2 x       &= frac{3}{2}sin 2x + frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}cos 2x       &= frac{sqrt{10}}{2}left(sin 2x cdot frac{3sqrt{10}}{10} - cos 2x cdot frac{sqrt{10}}{10}right) + frac{1}{2}. end{align*} Now, we use the sum-to-product identities to express the combination of sin 2x and cos 2x as a single sine function with a phase shift theta: begin{align*} sin(2x - theta) &= sin 2x cos theta - cos 2x sin theta,  end{align*} where tan theta = frac{1}{3}, and 0 < theta < frac{pi}{2}. (1) The center of symmetry for the function is given by left(frac{kpi}{2} + frac{theta}{2}, 0right) for some integer k. Since tan frac{pi}{12} = 2 - sqrt{3}, statement (1) is incorrect. (2) The minimal positive period of the function is determined by the 2pi period of the sin and cos functions, but since f(x) has a factor of 2 multiplying x in sin 2x and cos 2x, the period is halved. Hence, the minimal positive period is pi, making statement (2) incorrect. (3) Since tan theta = frac{1}{3} < frac{sqrt{3}}{3} = tan frac{pi}{6}, we conclude that 0 < theta < frac{pi}{6}. Therefore, within the range - frac{pi}{4} + frac{theta}{2} < x < frac{pi}{4} + frac{theta}{2}, which is less than frac{pi}{3}, the function is decreasing. Therefore, on the interval left[frac{pi}{4} + frac{theta}{2}, frac{pi}{3}right], the function is decreasing and statement (3) is also incorrect. (4) For x = frac{pi}{3}, 2x + theta = frac{2pi}{3} + theta is not equal to kpi + frac{pi}{2} for any integer k. Therefore, statement (4) is incorrect. Thus, the correct answer is: [boxed{A}] Enhanced Solution Details: To prove statement (1), we could substitute (frac{pi}{12},0) into the function and check for symmetry, but the argument above using centers of symmetry for sine functions resolves it more effectively. Statement (2) is disproved by understanding the frequency of trigonometric functions, where multiplying the argument by a constant effectively changes the period. For (3), we analyze the monotonic behavior by considering when the derivative of f(x) (being the slope of the tangent line) changes sign. Alternatively, we understand the behavior of the sin function within certain intervals and apply the phase shift to determine the actual interval where the function is increasing or decreasing. As for (4), the symmetry property of the sine function around its axes is used to argue against the presence of an axis of symmetry at x = frac{pi}{3} for f(x). In this problem, we utilized properties of trigonometric functions and relationships between angles to evaluate the correctness of the statements."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=sin (2x+ frac {pi}{6}), if y=f(xvarphi)(0 < varphi < frac {pi}{2}) is an even function, then varphi= ______.","output":"Since f(x)=sin (2x+ frac {pi}{6}),   we have y=f(x-varphi)=sin [2(x-varphi)+ frac {pi}{6}]=sin (2x-2varphi+ frac {pi}{6}).

Step 4: Substitute (Q_1(x)) back into the expression for (p(x)): [ p(x) = (x-a)((x-b)Q_2(x) + 1) + a = (x-a)(x-b)Q_2(x) + (x-a) + a ] [ p(x) = (x-a)(x-b)Q_2(x) + x ]  Step 5: Using condition (3), substitute (x = c) into (p(x)): [ p(c) = (c-a)(c-b)Q_2(c) + c = c ] Thus, solving for (Q_2(c)) gives: [ (c-a)(c-b)Q_2(c) + c = c implies (c-a)(c-b)Q_2(c) = 0 implies Q_2(c) = 0 ] Since (a neq c) and (b neq c), this implies: [ Q_2(x) = (x-c)Q_3(x) ] for some polynomial (Q_3(x)).  Step 6: Substitute (Q_2(x)) back into (p(x)): [ p(x) = (x-a)(x-b)((x-c)Q_3(x)) + x = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)Q_3(x) + x ]  Conclusion: The remainder when (p(x)) is divided by ((x-a)(x-b)(x-c)) is (x).

What is the remainder when the number is divided by 39?","output":"Let's denote the certain number as ( N ) and the remainder when ( N ) is divided by 39 as ( R ). According to the problem, when ( N ) is divided by 13, the remainder is 4. This means that ( N ) can be expressed as: [ N = 13k + 4 ] where ( k ) is some integer. Now, since 39 is a multiple of 13 (39 = 13 * 3), we can see that if ( N ) leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 13, it will also leave a remainder when divided by 39. However, the remainder when divided by 39 must be a multiple of 13, since 39 is 3 times 13. The possible remainders when dividing by 39 are 0, 1, 2, ..., 38. Since we know the remainder when dividing by 13 is 4, the remainder when dividing by 39 must be either 4, 17, or 30, because these are the numbers less than 39 that leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 13. To determine which of these is the correct remainder when dividing by 39, we can check each one: - If ( R = 4 ), then ( N = 39m + 4 ) for some integer ( m ). This is consistent with ( N = 13k + 4 ), so 4 is a possible remainder. - If ( R = 17 ), then ( N = 39m + 17 ) for some integer ( m ). However, 17 is not a multiple of 13 plus 4, so it cannot be the remainder when ( N ) is divided by 39. - If ( R = 30 ), then ( N = 39m + 30 ) for some integer ( m ). However, 30 is not a multiple of 13 plus 4, so it cannot be the remainder when ( N ) is divided by 39.

To find this, we need to compute the derivative of f(x). The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 3ax^2 + frac{1}{x}. A vertical tangent occurs when the derivative is undefined, which happens when the denominator of a fraction is zero. However, in this case, the term frac{1}{x} will not be zero unless x=0, but x=0 is not in the domain of f(x) because ln x is undefined at x=0. So, the only option for a vertical tangent to occur is when 3ax^2 becomes infinitely large. For a large value of 3ax^2 to result in an undefined slope, a must be negative since x^2 is always positive.   Hence, the derivative f'(x) tends to infinity as a to -infty.

Let the slope of ( AB ) and ( CD ) be ( m ). 3. **Geometric Locus**: Any line parallel to ( AB ) or ( CD ) will preserve the vertical height between points, thus maintaining the area of the triangles between horizontal parallels. Therefore, if ( M ) lies on a line parallel to ( AB ) and ( N ) lies on a line parallel to ( CD ), the areas will always be equal because the bases and heights of the triangles will correspond directly via the horizontal distance and vertical slant preserved by the parallelism. **Conclusion**: When ( AB ) and ( CD ) are parallel, the geometric locus of points where the areas of triangles ( ABM ) and ( CDN ) are equal consists of pairs of lines parallel to ( AB ) and ( CD ). Thus, in all cases, whether the line segments intersect or are parallel, the geometric locus of points where the areas of the triangles formed are equal is described by a pair of lines.   boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Find all positive real numbers ((a,b,c) leq 1) which satisfy  [ huge min Bigg{ sqrt{frac{ab+1}{abc}}, sqrt{frac{bc+1}{abc}}, sqrt{frac{ac+1}{abc}} Bigg } = sqrt{frac{1a}{a}} + sqrt{frac{1b}{b}} + sqrt{frac{1c}{c}}]","output":"To find all positive real numbers ((a, b, c) leq 1) that satisfy the given equation: [ min left{ sqrt{frac{ab+1}{abc}}, sqrt{frac{bc+1}{abc}}, sqrt{frac{ac+1}{abc}} right} = sqrt{frac{1-a}{a}} + sqrt{frac{1-b}{b}} + sqrt{frac{1-c}{c}} ] we proceed as follows: 1. **Assume Symmetry**: Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume (a geq b geq c).

For each positive integer ( k ), let ( y_k = overline{a_k a_{k-1} ldots a_1} ). By the assumption, for every ( k > N ), there exists a positive integer ( x_k ) such that ( y_k = x_k^2 ). 3. Let ( 5^{gamma_n} ) be the greatest power of 5 dividing ( x_n ). We show that ( 2 gamma_n geq n ) for every positive integer ( n > N ). 4.

Both ( A_k ) and ( B_k ) are odd since otherwise ( y_{2k+2} ) or ( y_{2k+1} ) would be a multiple of 10, which is false by ( a_1 neq 0 ); so one of the numbers ( A_k - B_k ) and ( A_k + B_k ) is not divisible by 4. Therefore, we get ( A_k - B_k = 2 ) and ( A_k + B_k = 2^{2k} ), hence ( A_k = 2^{2k-1} + 1 ) and thus:     [     x_{2k+2} = 5^{k+1} A_k = 10^{k+1} cdot 2^{k-2} + 5^{k+1} > 10^{k+1}     ]    since ( k geq 2 ).

Given that y₁+y₂=4, we can find the slope of MN as: k= frac {y_{1}-y_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}=1. Hence, the slope of line MN is 1. (II) From part (I), we know the slope of line MN is 1. Hence, the equation of line MN can be written as y=x+a. We have two cases to consider: Case 1: M(x₁, y₁) and N(x₂, y₂) are on opposite sides of the x-axis.

Adding the above equations, we get: frac {y_{1}}{x_{1}+2}+ frac {y_{2}}{x_{2}+2}=0, which simplifies to y₁(x₂+2)+y₂(x₁+2)=0. Substituting y₁=x₁+a and y₂=x₂+a into the equation, we get: (x₁+a)(x₂+2)+(x₂+a)(x₁+2)=0. Simplifying the above equation, we get: 2x₁x₂+(a+2)(x₁+x₂)+4a=0 ①. Solving the system of equations: begin{cases} overset{y=x+a}{y^{2}=4x}end{cases} by eliminating y, we get: x²+(2a-4)x+a²=0. Thus, we have: x₁+x₂=4-2a and x₁x₂=a².

(i) Since the function F(x) can be expressed as: F(x)=  begin{cases}  x^{3}-ax^{2}+a^{2}x, & text{if } x > a  dfrac {1}{3}x^{3}+ax^{2}-a^{2}x, & text{if } xleqslant a end{cases} We can derive h(x) as follows: h(x)=  begin{cases}  3x^{2}-2ax+a^{2}, & text{if } x > a  x^{2}+2ax-a^{2}, & text{if } xleqslant a end{cases} Which simplifies to: h(x)=  begin{cases}  3(x- dfrac {1}{3}a)^{2}+ dfrac {2}{3}a^{2}, & text{if } x > a  (x+a)^{2}-2a^{2}, & text{if } xleqslant a end{cases} When ageqslant 0, h(x)_{min}=-2a^{2}; when a < 0, h(x)_{min}=- dfrac {2}{3}a^{2}. Therefore, the minimum value of h(x) is boxed{-2a^{2} text{ if } ageqslant 0, text{ and } - dfrac {2}{3}a^{2} text{ if } a < 0}. (ii) When x > a, H(x)=F(x)-x=x^{3}-ax^{2}+(a^{2}-1)x. Therefore, H′(x)=3x^{2}-2ax+(a^{2}-1) for x > a. First, we calculate triangle =4a^{2}-12(a^{2}-1)=4(3-2a^{2}). We discuss the following cases: - When triangle leqslant 0, i.e., aleqslant - dfrac { sqrt {6}}{2} or ageqslant dfrac { sqrt {6}}{2}, H′(x)=3x^{2}-2ax+(a^{2}-1)geqslant 0 always holds for x > a. Thus, the interval of monotonic increase for H(x) is boxed{(a,+infty)}. - When triangle > 0, i.e., - dfrac { sqrt {6}}{2} < a < dfrac { sqrt {6}}{2}, the equation 3x^{2}-2ax+(a^{2}-1)=0 has two distinct real roots x_{1}= dfrac {a- sqrt {3-2a^{2}}}{3} and x_{2}= dfrac {a+ sqrt {3-2a^{2}}}{3}, with x_{1} < x_{2}. Depending on the relationship between x_{1}, a, and x_{2}, we have:   - If a < x_{1}, then - dfrac { sqrt {6}}{2} < a < - dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2}, and the interval of monotonic increase for H(x) is boxed{(a, dfrac {a- sqrt {3-2a^{2}}}{3}]cup[dfrac {a+ sqrt {3-2a^{2}}}{3},+infty)}.   - If x_{1}leqslant a < x_{2}, then - dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2}leqslant a < dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2}, and the interval of monotonic increase for H(x) is boxed{[dfrac {a+ sqrt {3-2a^{2}}}{3},+infty)}.   - If ageqslant x_{2}, then dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2}leqslant a < dfrac { sqrt {6}}{2}, and the interval of monotonic increase for H(x) is boxed{[a,+infty)}."},{"instruction":"Given the expression 15n + 5 and 9n + 4, as n ranges over the positive integers, what is the maximum possible value for the greatest common divisor of these two expressions when n is congruent to 1 modulo 3?","output":"We start by applying the Euclidean Algorithm to gcd(15n + 5, 9n + 4).

Before proving the given statement, we start by proving a useful lemma:     - Let triangle P_1Q_1R_1 and triangle P_2Q_2R_2 be two triangles (as shown in Figure 1). If angle P_1Q_1R_1 = angle P_2Q_2R_2 and T_1, T_2 are the projections of Q_1 onto P_1R_1 and Q_2 onto P_2R_2 respectively, and if the ratio frac{P_1T_1}{T_1R_1} = frac{P_2T_2}{T_2R_2}, then triangle P_1Q_1R_1 sim triangle P_2Q_2R_2.     2. **Proof of the Lemma:**     - Fix triangle P_1Q_1R_1. Denote Q_2' as a point on the circumcircle of triangle P_2Q_2R_2 such that triangle P_1Q_1R_1 sim triangle P_2Q_2'R_2. Denote T_2' as the projection of Q_2' onto P_2R_2.     - Since triangle P_1Q_1R_1 sim triangle P_2Q_2'R_2, we have frac{P_1T_1}{T_1R_1} = frac{P_2T_2'}{T_2'R_2}. This implies T_2' = T_2, hence Q_2' = Q_2.     - Therefore, the lemma is established. 3. Now return to the original problem.    - We have frac{BN}{NC} = frac{DM}{MC} (due to MN parallel BD) and frac{DK}{KB} = frac{DM}{MC} (due to MK parallel BC).     4. As shown in Figure 2, let FK intersect circle S_2 again at another point ( Q ). Then angle BQD = angle BAD = angle BEC.     - By the lemma, we have triangle BQD sim triangle CEB. Consequently, angle EBC = angle QDB = angle QFB.     5. From here, we see that the right triangle triangle BKF sim the right triangle triangle ENB. Since lines MK and NB are parallel in the parallelogram MKNB, angle MNB = angle MKB. Therefore,    [    angle MNE = angle MKF.    ]     6. Given that right triangles BKF and ENB are similar, frac{MN}{KF} = frac{BK}{KF} = frac{EN}{NB} leading to frac{MN}{EN} = frac{MK}{KF} implying triangle MNE sim triangle FKM.

The faster train is moving at 46 km/hr and the slower train at 36 km/hr, so the relative speed is: Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train Relative speed = 46 km/hr - 36 km/hr Relative speed = 10 km/hr To work with meters and seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s. We use the conversion factor 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s.

Since both trains are of equal length, the total distance is twice the length of one train. Total distance = Length of faster train + Length of slower train Total distance = 62.5 m + 62.5 m Total distance = 125 m Finally, we can calculate the time it takes for the faster train to pass the slower train by dividing the total distance by the relative speed.

Recognize that the general term in the expansion of (a+y)^{6} is given by C_6^r a^{6-r} y^r, where C_6^r is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose r elements from a set of 6 elements. 2.

Since the original square has not been resized other than the cuts, the height of the tray when unfolded, corresponds to the length of the perpendicular dropped from R to MN.

Next, compute ( z^2 ):    [    z^2 = left( r (cos theta + i sin theta) right)^2 = r^2 (cos 2theta + i sin 2theta)    ] 4. Take the reciprocal of ( z^2 ), and due to the reciprocal, the modulus becomes ( frac{1}{r^2} ) and the angle negates:    [    frac{1}{z^2} = frac{1}{r^2} (cos(-2theta) + i sin (-2theta)) = frac{1}{r^2} (cos 2theta - i sin 2theta)    ] 5. To find ( -frac{1}{z^2} ), multiply by -1:    [    -frac{1}{z^2} = -frac{1}{r^2} (cos 2theta - i sin 2theta) = frac{1}{r^2} (cos (pi - 2theta) + i sin (pi - 2theta))    ] 6. Since the angle ( theta ) satisfies ( frac{pi}{4} < theta < frac{pi}{2} ), multiplying by 2 yields:    [    frac{pi}{2} < 2theta < pi    ] 7. Subtract ( 2theta ) from ( pi ):    [    0 < pi - 2theta < frac{pi}{2}    ] 8. The resulting angle ( pi - 2theta ) lies between 0 and ( frac{pi}{2} ). In the complex plane, this range of angle ( 0 < pi - 2theta < frac{pi}{2} ) corresponds to the first quadrant. 9.

We will use geometric transformations and properties of equilateral triangles to establish the relationship.  Step 1: Understanding the given conditions We are given that triangle ABC has angles angle ADB = angle BDC = angle CDA = 120^circ. This implies that the triangle is composed of three smaller triangles, each having one angle of 120^circ.  Step 2: Rotating the figure We rotate figure PRQM by a clockwise angle of pi/3 about point Q. This rotation maps point R to a new point R' and point M to a new point M'. The triangle MM'Q becomes equilateral due to the properties of rotation and the fact that the angle of rotation is pi/3.  Step 3: Establishing congruence The triangle MRM' is congruent to triangle ABC because they are both composed of smaller triangles with a 120^circ angle, and the rotation preserves the lengths and angles. Similarly, triangles PMQ and RM'Q are congruent as they are images of each other under the rotation.  Step 4: Area calculations The area of triangle ABC can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle with sides forming a 120^circ angle: [ [ABC] = frac{(wv + vu + uw) sqrt{3}}{4} ] Using the Law of Cosines, we find: [ a^2 = w^2 + wv + v^2 ] and by symmetry for the other sides: [ frac{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{bigl[2(u^2 + w^2 + v^2) + wv + vu + uw bigr] sqrt{3}}{4} ]  Step 5: Relating areas Combining the areas from the rotated triangles and using the congruence and symmetry properties, we find: [ frac{(u+v+w)^2 sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 [PQR] ] Since the area of triangle PQR is given by x^2 sqrt{3}/4, equating the areas gives: [ frac{(u+v+w)^2 sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{x^2 sqrt{3}}{2} ] which simplifies to u+v+w = x.

Each paired digit sum must then be at least 1 (since zeros are not allowed).    - If we assume these paired sums form a number of only ones, each pair of digits must sum to at most 1, which contradicts our previous observation. 3. **Evaluating the Possible Sums:**    - Because digits range from 1 to 9, each paired sum ( d_i + d'_i ) (where ( d_i ) and ( d'_i ) are corresponding digits in the original and permuted numbers respectively) must be at least 1 and at most 18.    - Given that no zeros are involved, in order to form a number consisting solely of ones (i.e., every digit in the result is 1), we realize this is impossible because it would imply each ( d_i + d'_i = 1 ). 4. **Insight into Contradiction:**    - Let us denote the pairs of same digits by their sum forming a result of only ones.    - Suppose the last two digits in a pair are such that their sum equals 1. But since our digits are from 1 to 9 (not including 0), this is impossible.    - For example, there cannot be a valid pair where ( d_i + d'_i = 1 ) because ( d_i ) and ( d'_i ) are at least 1. 5. **Sum Properties and Conclusion:**    - If we allowed digits' sums with results other than just pairs adding up to 1, then other sums could involve whole carries and exceed simple sums like just ones.    - Hence, the total sum would need to be that of an even number that can only result from non-even composite sums consisting of multiple times from pairs of sums each adding up to an even total.    - Summarizing that we get contradictions in our initial contrary statement by means of digits and properties of sum and permitted values, hence proving it incorrect.

The area of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula: [ A = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} s^2. ]     - For the larger equilateral triangle whose area is 4 square units, we set up the equation: [ 4 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} s^2. ]     - Solving for ( s^2 ): [ s^2 = frac{4 times 4}{sqrt{3}} = frac{16}{sqrt{3}} = frac{16sqrt{3}}{3}.]     - This larger triangle must have sides longer than the sides of the small triangles (which have an area of 1 square unit). 4. **Side Length Proportions in Similar Triangles:**     - Since the small triangles have an area of 1 square unit, a side length ( a ) allows us to write: [ 1 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} a^2. ]     - Solving for ( a^2 ): [ a^2 = frac{4}{sqrt{3}} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}. ]     - Compare the side lengths ( s ) and ( a ).

Also, it's important to note that the largest angle A cannot be 60^{circ}. Given that a = c + 4, b = c + 2, and A is the largest angle, we can start by applying the cosine rule: cos A = frac{b^{2} + c^{2} - a^{2}}{2bc} = frac{(c + 2)^{2} + c^{2} - (c + 4)^{2}}{2 times (c + 2) times c} = -frac{1}{2} Simplifying the equation, we get: frac{c^{2} + 4c + 4 + c^{2} - c^{2} - 8c - 16}{2c(c + 2)} = frac{c^{2} - 4c - 12}{2c^{2} + 4c} = -frac{1}{2} This simplifies to c^{2} - 4c - 12 = -c^{2} - 2c, which gives us c^{2} - c - 6 = 0.

Each digit on the spinner (1, 2, 3, 4) can appear in any of the three positions in the number, leading to 4^3 = 64 possible three-digit numbers. Next, we need to identify the numbers divisible by 4. For a number to be divisible by 4, the number formed by the last two digits (tens and units) must be divisible by 4. Let's check combinations: - **12, 24, 32, 44**: Last two digits that make a divisible by 4 number. - Hundreds digit can be any of 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each valid pair of tens and units digits: - 12 can be combined with each of 1, 2, 3, and 4, leading to: 112, 212, 312, 412. - 24 can be combined with each of 1, 2, 3, and 4, leading to: 124, 224, 324, 424. - 32 can be combined with each of 1, 2, 3, and 4, leading to: 132, 232, 332, 432. - 44 can be combined with each of 1, 2, 3, and 4, leading to: 144, 244, 344, 444.

Find log_2 n.","output":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the structure of the tournament and the conditions for the probability we need to calculate. 1. **Total Pairings of Teams**: Since there are 40 teams and each team plays every other team exactly once, the total number of games or pairings is given by the combination formula {40 choose 2}. This is calculated as follows: [ {40 choose 2} = frac{40!}{2!(40-2)!} = frac{40 times 39}{2} = 780. ] 2. **Total Possible Outcomes**: Given that each game can result in a win or loss with equal probability, and there are no ties, each of the 780 games has 2 possible outcomes. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for the tournament is 2^{780}. 3. **Condition for Unique Wins**: For no two teams to win the same number of games, each team must win a unique number of games ranging from 0 to 39. This is because the minimum number of games a team can win is 0 (losing all games) and the maximum is 39 (winning all games). Since there are 40 teams, this perfectly fits the range of 0 to 39 wins, allowing for a unique number of wins for each team. 4. **Counting Valid Outcomes**: The number of ways to assign these unique win counts to the teams is simply the number of permutations of the 40 teams, which is 40!. This is because assigning a unique win count to each team is equivalent to ordering the teams by their number of wins. 5. **Calculating the Probability**: The probability that no two teams win the same number of games is the ratio of the number of valid outcomes (40!) to the total number of possible outcomes (2^{780}). Thus, the probability is frac{40!}{2^{780}}. 6. **Simplifying the Probability**: To express this probability in the form frac{m}{n} where m and n are relatively prime, we need to factor out all powers of 2 from 40!. The number of powers of 2 in 40! is calculated by summing the integer division of 40 by powers of 2 up to 2^5 (since 2^6 > 40): [ left lfloor frac{40}{2} right rfloor + left lfloor frac{40}{4} right rfloor + left lfloor frac{40}{8} right rfloor + left lfloor frac{40}{16} right rfloor + left lfloor frac{40}{32} right rfloor = 20 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 38. ] 7. **Final Calculation**: Subtracting the number of powers of 2 in 40! from the total number of games gives us the exponent of 2 in the denominator of our simplified probability: [ 780 - 38 = 742. ] Therefore, the value of log_2 n where n is the denominator of the simplified probability is boxed{742}."},{"instruction":"A cube with edge length a = sqrt{2+sqrt{2}} is illuminated by a cylindrical beam of light with radius rho = sqrt{2}, directed along the main diagonal of the cube (the axis of the beam contains the main diagonal).

The cylindrical beam of light has a radius of (rho = sqrt{2}) and is directed along the main (space) diagonal of the cube. The main diagonal of a cube characteristically connects two opposite vertices and its length (d) can be computed using the Pythagorean theorem in 3 dimensions as:    [    d = asqrt{3}    ]    Since the axis of the cylindrical beam contains the main diagonal of the cube, we need to calculate how this beam intersects the surface of the cube. 2. **Compute cross-sectional area and determine the illuminated faces:**    Visualizing this problem, we see that the cylindrical beam will intersect each face of the cube. For a cube with edge (a), when projected onto any face, the cylinder's intersection will be a circle. 3. **Projected circle area on the cube face:**        The circle's radius remains (rho = sqrt{2}) when projected onto a face of the cube. Therefore, the cross-section of the illuminated area on any face of the cube will remain a circle with radius (sqrt{2}). 4. **Calculate the area of the circular intersections:**        The area of one circular intersection (A_c) is given by:    [    A_c = pi rho^2 = pi (sqrt{2})^2 = 2pi    ]    As the cylinder runs through the entire body of the cube, it intersects exactly three pairs of parallel faces creating circles on three orthogonal planes. 5. **Determining intersection on multiple faces:**    Given that a cube has six faces, the cylindrical beam would form circular intersections on three pairs of parallel faces. For the entire surface, however, as it projects through the main diagonal only contributes distinctly to the surface area on three faces, not through wrapping around edges or vertices. 6. **Calculate the total illuminated area:**        Each circle area calculated is (2pi), thus accounting for faces adjoined by the diagonal in the central symmetry, we must consider overlapping regions as non-distinct. Therefore, the calculations should involve:        [    3 times A_c = 3 times 2pi  = 6pi    ]    Adjusting for non-overlapping areas gives relations simplified visually by projection onto three interfacing planes.

We will generalize the solution for an (n times n) board where (n equiv 3 pmod{4}) and (n geq 7). 1. **Proof of Lower Bound:**    We first show that (n^2 - 2n - 3) is achievable. Consider the construction for (n = 15):    ![Board Construction](https://i.imgur.com/7Z5Q5kG.png)    The route of the limp rook forms a \\"snake\\" that coils around the board, leaving only a (3 times 3) square unfilled. Furthermore, the two ends of the snake each leave 2 squares unfilled, and each turn of the snake leaves 4 squares unfilled.    This construction leaves a total of (2n + 3) squares unfilled, as desired. 2. **Proof of Upper Bound:**    We now prove that (n^2 - 2n - 3) is maximal. Color the squares in the grid as follows:    ![Colored Grid](https://i.imgur.com/7Z5Q5kG.png)    Let (R) denote the color red, and so on. The sequence of colors on the route of the limp rook must repeat in the pattern:    [    R, Y, B, G, R, Y, B, G, ldots    ]    (or the above sequence reversed). It follows that the length of the sequence is (4T), where (T) is the number of blue squares on the limp rook's route.    **Claim:** The limp rook cannot pass through all the blue squares.    *Proof:* Assume for contradiction that the limp rook passes through all the blue squares. Say two blue squares are *consecutive* if the limp rook visits them without visiting any other blue square in between. Note that two consecutive blue squares must be either orthogonally adjacent or diagonally adjacent.    Checkerboard color the blue squares periwinkle and navy blue. Since there is an odd number of blue squares, the number of periwinkle squares and the number of navy blue squares are unequal. Thus, there is at least one pair of diagonally adjacent consecutive blue squares.    ![Checkerboard](https://i.imgur.com/7Z5Q5kG.png)    Without loss of generality, the limp rook moves:    [    (a, b+2) to (a+1, b+2) to (a+1, b+1) to (a+2, b+1) to (a+2, b)    ]    Then, since the limp rook must move in the pattern (R, Y, B, G, ldots), at some point in the sequence the limp rook moves:    [    (a+2, b+3) to (a+2, b+2) to (a+3, b+2)    ]    Then the rook must eventually move from ((a+2, b)) to ((a+2, b+3)) and ((a+3, b+2)) to ((a, b+2)).

Let's then consider the quadratic function y = x^2 - 2x - a. This is a parabola opening upward since the coefficient of x^2 is positive. The vertex of the parabola can be found at x = -b/2a = 1 (using the vertex formula for ax^2+bx+c=0).        Given that y(1) = 1^2 - 2cdot1 - a = -a < 0 because a > 0, the vertex lies below the x-axis. Moreover, since the quadratic function decreases for x < 1 and increases for x > 1, it intersects the x-axis at two points. This means there are two x-intercepts, which are the two real and distinct solutions of x^2 - 2x - a = 0. 3. A comparison of the two functions y = a^x and y = x^2 - 2x - a shows that:    - a^x starts at y = 1 when x = 0, while the parabola y = x^2 - 2x - a starts below y = 0 at the same point.    - Since a^x always increases or decreases without bound (depending on whether a>1 or 0<a<1) and the parabola y = x^2 - 2x - a has only one local minimum, they must intersect at least once for x > 1.    - As x decreases from x = 1 towards negative infinity, a^x either decreases towards 0 (for 0 < a < 1) or increases towards infinity (for a > 1) slower than the rate at which the quadratic function decreases, which implies that a^x and y = x^2 - 2x - a will intersect once for x < 1.       Therefore, the equation a^x = x^2 - 2x - a must have at least two solutions: one for x < 1 and one for x > 1.

This means we will work in the field ( mathbb{F}_2 ), where the coordinates ( x_i ) and ( y_i ) are taken modulo 2. 3. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:**    Since there are five points ( P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5 ) with integer coordinates, each point can be represented in ( mathbb{F}_2 times mathbb{F}_2 ). There are only four possible pairs ((0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)) in ( mathbb{F}_2 times mathbb{F}_2 ).    By the pigeonhole principle, since we have five points and only four possible pairs, at least two of these points must map to the same pair in ( mathbb{F}_2 times mathbb{F}_2 ). Let's denote these points as ( P_m ) and ( P_n ). 4. **Collinearity in ( mathbb{F}_2 ):**    Since ( P_m ) and ( P_n ) map to the same pair in ( mathbb{F}_2 times mathbb{F}_2 ), their coordinates modulo 2 are the same. This implies that the determinant of the matrix formed by ( P_m, P_n, ) and any other point ( P_x ) (where ( x ) is one of the remaining three points) will have a zero row when considered modulo 2. 5. **Integer Area Condition:**    The determinant of the matrix modulo 2 being zero implies that the area ( A_{m,n,x} ) is an integer. This is because the area formula involves a determinant that, when zero modulo 2, results in an integer value when scaled by ( frac{1}{2} ). 6. **Conclusion:**    Since there are three remaining points, and we have shown that the area of the triangle formed by ( P_m, P_n, ) and any of these three points is an integer, we conclude that there are at least three triangles with integer areas.

This implies that there exist integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that ( ax + by = 1 ) (by Bezout's identity). 3. **Modulo 1995:**    We need to consider the sequence modulo 1995. Since ( a ) and ( b ) are relatively prime, they are also relatively prime to 1995. This is because if ( a ) and ( b ) had a common factor with 1995, they would not be relatively prime to each other. 4. **Constructing the Sequence:**    We can start with any element in ( S ). Without loss of generality, let's start with ( s_1 = 0 ). 5. **Generating the Sequence:**    We can generate the sequence by repeatedly adding ( a ) or ( b ) modulo 1995. Since ( a ) and ( b ) are relatively prime to 1995, the sequence will cover all residues modulo 1995 before repeating. 6. **Covering All Residues:**    By the properties of numbers that are relatively prime to the modulus, the sequence ( 0, a, 2a, ldots, (1994)a ) modulo 1995 will cover all residues ( {0, 1, 2, ldots, 1994} ). Similarly, the sequence ( 0, b, 2b, ldots, (1994)b ) modulo 1995 will also cover all residues. 7. **Combining the Sequences:**    We can interleave the sequences generated by ( a ) and ( b ) to ensure that the difference between consecutive elements is either ( pm a ) or ( pm b ) modulo 1995. 8. **Ensuring No Repeats:**    Since ( a ) and ( b ) are relatively prime to 1995, the sequences will not repeat until all residues are covered.

Given ( angle AMC = alpha ) and ( Delta ABC ) is an equilateral triangle, we know each internal angle of ( Delta ABC ) is (60^circ). 2. **Application of Bretschneider's Formula:**    Given ( |MB| ) is the longest side, let's apply the theorem to (ABCM), considering (M) as an arbitrary point not on the circumcircle of ( Delta ABC).

If any one of ( x, y, ) or ( z ) is negative, then proving the inequality ( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 geq xyz ) becomes trivial since the squares ( x^2, y^2, z^2 ) are always non-negative.

This problem tests the application of the relationship between a line and a circle, methods for finding the maximum area of a triangle, and the formula for the distance from a point to a line, as well as the ability to analyze and solve problems. **Solution** The center of circle C: (x-a)^{2}+(y-a)^{2}=1(a > 0) is (a,a) with a radius of 1. The distance d from the center of the circle to the line is d= dfrac {2a}{ sqrt {10}}. The length of the semi-chord is: sqrt {1-( dfrac {2a}{ sqrt {10}})^{2}}= dfrac { sqrt {10-4a^{2}}}{ sqrt {10}}. Therefore, the area S of triangle CPQ is S= dfrac {2a}{ sqrt {10}}cdot dfrac { sqrt {10-4a^{2}}}{ sqrt {10}}= dfrac { sqrt {a^{2}(10-4a^{2})}}{5}= dfrac { sqrt {10a^{2}-4a^{4}}}{5}. When a^{2}= dfrac {10}{8}, 10a^{2}-4a^{4} reaches its maximum value, which is: 10× dfrac {10}{8}-4×( dfrac {10}{8})^{2}. Therefore, the maximum area S of triangle CPQ is:  dfrac { sqrt {10× dfrac {10}{8}-4×( dfrac {10}{8})^{2}}}{5}= dfrac {1}{2}. At this time, a= dfrac { sqrt {5}}{2}.

Then (a - b equiv 0 pmod{4}), which means (4 mid (a-b)).    - Therefore, ((a-b)(a-c)(a-d)(b-c)(b-d)(c-d)) is divisible by 4. 3. **Combining the results:**    - Since ((a-b)(a-c)(a-d)(b-c)(b-d)(c-d)) is divisible by both 3 and 4, it must be divisible by the least common multiple of 3 and 4.    - The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12.    - Therefore, ((a-b)(a-c)(a-d)(b-c)(b-d)(c-d)) is divisible by 12.

Since we need to account for the 200 g weight, one side of the balance will have ( 200 ) g more sugar than the other:     Let ( x ) be the amount of sugar on the side with the weight, and ( y ) be the amount on the other side.     [     x + 200 text{ g} = y     ]     Given the total sugar is 9 kg, or 9000 g:     [     x + y = 9000 text{ g}     ]     Solve for ( y ):     [     x + 200 + x = 9000 rightarrow 2x + 200 = 9000 rightarrow 2x = 8800 rightarrow x = 4400 text{ g}     ]     Consequently,     [     y = x + 200 = 4400 + 200 = 4600 text{ g}     ]     Thus, we have 4600 g of sugar on one side (with the weight) and 4400 g of sugar on the other side. 2. **Second Weighing**:     - Remove the 200 g weight and weigh the 4400 g of sugar again.     - Evenly distribute the 4400 g of sugar between the two sides of the balance scale.     Let ( a ) and ( b ) be the amounts of sugar on each side after redistribution:     [     a = b = frac{4400 text{ g}}{2} = 2200 text{ g}     ]     So we now have 2200 g of sugar on each side.

Subtract the 200 g from the 2200 g pile:     [     2200 text{ g} - 200 text{ g} = 2000 text{ g}     ]     - Thus, we are left with 2000 g of sugar on one side.

Since this is a multiple-choice question, we can check which of the possible answers would be reasonable given that the sum of the first three groups is 36. - Option A: 36 (cannot be correct since 36 is just the sum of the first three groups) - Option B: 40 (remaining students = 40 - 36 = 4, which could be distributed in the subsequent groups) - Option C: 48 (remaining students = 48 - 36 = 12, but this would imply even distribution among the remaining groups or another pattern we can't confirm) - Option D: 50 (remaining students = 50 - 36 = 14, which would also need to be distributed) Since we know that the frequencies of the subsequent groups must follow a pattern (such as increasing, staying the same, or decreasing but none of them should be zero), and given that option B only leaves 4 students to distribute, which is less than the frequency of the third group, the next reasonable assumption to maintain the pattern would be option C: 48, with 12 remaining students. This could mean that the subsequent groups have frequencies of 4, 4, and 4 or another combination that fits an increasing pattern. Therefore, we choose the closest option that facilitates an appropriate distribution of frequencies while preserving the pattern: [ boxed{C: 48} ]"},{"instruction":"R varies directly as S and inversely as T.

When the leading digit ( d_0 ) is moved to the end, the number becomes ( d_1 d_2 ldots d_{k-1} d_0 ).    For example, if ( n = overline{d_0 d_1 d_2 ldots d_{k-1}} ), we can express it mathematically as:    [    n = d_0 cdot 10^{k-1} + d_1 cdot 10^{k-2} + d_2 cdot 10^{k-3} + cdots + d_{k-1}    ]    Moving ( d_0 ) to the end gives us the number:    [    N = d_1 cdot 10^{k-2} + d_2 cdot 10^{k-3} + cdots + d_{k-1} cdot 10^{0} + d_0    ]    Now, according to the problem, ( N = 5n ). 3. **Implications:**    Since ( N ) is obtained by moving the leading digit ( d_0 ) to the end, ( N ) must necessarily end with ( d_0 ), and ( d_0 ) must be the last digit in the result.    However, for any number to be divisible by 5, it must end in either 0 or 5. This creates a contradiction since ( d_0 cdot 5 ) does not necessarily satisfy this unless ( d_0 = 5 ). 4. **Further Verification:**    The same logic applies if we test for multiplication by 6 and 8. For these multipliers, the contradiction arises in the inherent property of multiplying integers and moving the most significant digit to the least significant position:    - **For 6:**      [      N = 6n      ]            Here, the terminal digit cycle and the formation constraint imply incompatible results, as similar rearrangements still do not achieve consistent valid integers.    - **For 8:**      [      N = 8n      ]            The position rearrangement would yield results inconsistent with integer properties and nature of 10's positional weights under multiplication by 8. 5. **Conclusion:**    The thorough analysis on typical number shifting and integer properties invalidates such formations for multipliers of 5, 6, and 8.    Therefore, there are no non-zero integers ( n ) such that moving the first digit to the end results in a number that is ( 5 ), ( 6 ), or ( 8 ) times the original number.

Setting y=0, we find x=4. Therefore, |FM|=3. Hence, the correct answer is boxed{D}. First, we determine the value of p from the equation of the parabola, then use the properties of the parabola to find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB, which leads to the answer. This problem mainly examines the properties of the parabola. It is a medium-level question. When solving, it is important to carefully read the problem, meticulously solve it, pay attention to the reasonable application of equivalent transformation ideas, and determining the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB is key."},{"instruction":"The fee for renting a bicycle for 30 minutes is 4,000 won. How much does one person get to pay when renting 4 bikes for 3 hours with 6 people paying equally?","output":"First, let's calculate the cost of renting one bicycle for 3 hours. Since the fee for 30 minutes is 4,000 won, the fee for one hour (which is twice 30 minutes) would be 2 times 4,000 won, which is 8,000 won. Now, for 3 hours, the cost would be 3 times the hourly rate: 3 hours * 8,000 won/hour = 24,000 won for one bicycle. Since 4 bicycles are being rented, the total cost for 4 bicycles would be: 4 bicycles * 24,000 won/bicycle = 96,000 won. Now, if 6 people are paying equally for the total cost of 96,000 won, each person would pay: 96,000 won / 6 people = boxed{16,000}  won per person."},{"instruction":"We know that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major cause of global warming.

Therefore, indoor spaces should be ventilated regularly to maintain the carbon dioxide concentration level not exceeding the standard value. After measurement, the carbon dioxide concentration in a classroom of a certain middle school just after class was 2000 ppm. If the relationship between the carbon dioxide concentration y% after ventilation and the time t (unit: minutes) is given by the formula y=0.05+lambda{e^{frac{t}{9}}} (lambda in mathbb{R}), then the time required for the carbon dioxide concentration in the classroom to reach the national standard with ventilation is approximately: A: 10 minutes B: 11 minutes C: 12 minutes D: 20 minute","output":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding that the carbon dioxide concentration in the classroom just after class was measured at 2000 ppm, which is equivalent to 0.2%. The relationship between the carbon dioxide concentration y% after ventilation and the time t (in minutes) is given by the formula y=0.05+lambda{e^{-frac{t}{9}}}. **Step 1: Determine the value of lambda when t=0.** At t=0, the carbon dioxide concentration is 0.2%. Substituting these values into the formula gives us: [0.2 = 0.05 + lambda{e^{-frac{0}{9}}}] [0.2 = 0.05 + lambda] Solving for lambda, we find: [lambda = 0.2 - 0.05] [lambda = 0.15] **Step 2: Find the time t required for the carbon dioxide concentration to reach the national standard.** The national standard for indoor carbon dioxide concentration is not more than 0.1%, which is equivalent to 1000 ppm. To meet this standard, the concentration after ventilation should be less than or equal to 0.1%. Substituting lambda = 0.15 into the formula gives us: [0.05 + 0.15{e^{-frac{t}{9}}} leq 0.1] Solving for t, we rearrange the inequality: [0.15{e^{-frac{t}{9}}} leq 0.05] [{e^{-frac{t}{9}}} leq frac{1}{3}] **Step 3: Solve the inequality for t.** To solve for t, we take the natural logarithm of both sides: [-frac{t}{9} leq ln{frac{1}{3}}] Multiplying both sides by -9 (and flipping the inequality sign because we're multiplying by a negative number) gives us: [t geq 9ln{3}] Calculating 9ln{3} gives us approximately: [t geq 9.981] Therefore, the minimum time required for the carbon dioxide concentration in the classroom to reach the national standard with ventilation is approximately 10 minutes.

Thus, ( n = 1 = 3^0 ) satisfies the condition. 2. **General Case for ( n > 1 )**:    - Assume ( 1 + 2^n + 4^n = p ) is a prime number and ( p > 7 ).    - We can rewrite the expression as ( 1 + 2^n + (2^n)^2 = p ). 3. **Divisibility by 7**:    - Consider the expression ( 2^{3n} - 1 ). We can factorize it as:      [      2^{3n} - 1 = (2^n - 1)(2^{2n} + 2^n + 1)      ]    - Notice that ( 2^{2n} + 2^n + 1 = 1 + 2^n + 4^n = p ). Therefore:      [      2^{3n} - 1 = (2^n - 1)p      ]    - Since ( 2^{3n} - 1 ) is divisible by 7 (as ( 2^3 equiv 1 mod 7 )), it follows that ( p ) must be divisible by 7 if ( 2^n - 1 ) is not divisible by 7. 4. **Divisibility by 3**:    - For ( 2^{3n} - 1 ) to be divisible by 7, ( n ) must be divisible by 3. Let ( n = 3k ) for some ( k in mathbb{N}_0 ). 5. **Prime Divisors and Order**:    - Consider the number ( frac{2^{3^{k+1}} - 1}{2^{3^k} - 1} ). This is a positive integer greater than 1.    - This fraction must have a prime divisor ( q ). We need to show that ( 2^{3^k} - 1 ) is not divisible by ( q ).    - If ( 2^{3^k} equiv 1 mod q ), then ( q ) divides ( 2^{3^{k+1}} - 1 ) but not ( 2^{3^k} - 1 ). 6. **Contradiction and Conclusion**:    - If ( q = 3 ), then ( 2^{3^k} equiv 1 mod 3 ), which is a contradiction since ( 2 notequiv 1 mod 3 ).    - Therefore, there exists a prime ( q ) such that ( q ) divides ( frac{2^{3^{k+1}} - 1}{2^{3^k} - 1} ) and ( gcd(q, 2^{3^k} - 1) = 1 ).    - This implies ( q ) divides ( p ), meaning ( q = p ). Hence, ( p ) divides ( 2^{3^{k+1}} - 1 ), leading to ( p < 2^{3^{k+1}} ). 7. **Final Contradiction**:    - Since ( n ) is odd (otherwise ( p ) would be divisible by 3), and if ( n ) has prime divisors other than 3, then ( p < 2^{3^{k+1}} < 2^n < p ), which is a contradiction. Thus, the only possible values for ( n ) are of the form ( 3^k ).

According to the information given, Jen has 150 ducks, so D = 150. The problem states that Jen has 10 more ducks than four times the number of chickens, which can be written as: D = 4C + 10 Since we know D = 150, we can substitute that into the equation to find the number of chickens: 150 = 4C + 10 Now, let's solve for C: 150 - 10 = 4C 140 = 4C C = 140 / 4 C = 35 So, Jen has 35 chickens. The problem also states that Jen has half the number of geese as the total number of ducks and chickens combined. Let's denote the number of geese as G. The total number of ducks and chickens combined is D + C, which is 150 + 35. So, the number of geese is half of that sum: G = (D + C) / 2 G = (150 + 35) / 2 G = 185 / 2 G = 92.5 Since Jen cannot have half a goose, we should round to the nearest whole number. In this case, we would typically round down because you can't have half a bird, so G = 92.

Given that LCM(a, b) = 20 and HCF(a, b) = 1, we need to find the pairs of positive integers 'a' and 'b' that satisfy these conditions. Since the HCF is 1, 'a' and 'b' are coprime (they have no common prime factors). The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5.

Lemma 2: If ( p ) is a prime and ( U(k) ) is divisible by ( p^r ), then ( U(k+1) ) is divisible by ( p^{r+1} ). **Proof**:  If ( p = 2 ), the ( r ) factors of 2 in ( U(k) ) must be contained in ( T(k-1) ): [ 2^{U(k-1)} equiv 1 pmod{p^r} ] Thus, ( U(k+1) = T(k) - T(k-1) ), being a difference of powers of 2, must have ( r+1 ) factors of 2. For ( p > 2 ), we use induction on ( n ). Let ( n_0 ) be the smallest value such that ( p mid U(n_0) ). Let ( r_0 ) be the number of factors of ( p ) in ( U(n_0) ). Since ( T(n_0 - 1) ) is a power of 2, the ( r_0 ) factors are all contained in ( 2^{U(n_0-1)}-1 ): [ 2^{U(n_0-1)} equiv 1 pmod{p^{r_0}} ] By Lemma 1, ( U(n_0) ) is divisible by ( U(n_0-1) ); however, by the definition of ( n_0 ), ( U(n_0) ) also contains an extra factor of ( p ): [ U(n_0) = U(n_0-1) cdot p cdot J ] where ( J ) is an integer.

To do this, we will follow the steps: 1. **Arranging the Sequence:**    Arrange the integers from -33 to 100 in a specific order such that the sums of adjacent numbers are analyzed.    Let's consider the sequence:     [    100, -33, 99, -32, ldots, 34, 33.    ] 2. **Calculating the Sums:**    - If the first number of the pair is placed in an odd position, the sum is calculated as (x_n + x_{n + 1} = 100 + (-33) = 67).    - If the first number of the pair is placed in an even position, the sum is calculated as (x_n + x_{n + 1} = 99 + (-32) = 66). 3. **Analyzing the Pattern:**    - Note that all sums of adjacent numbers in this sequence are either 67 or 66.    - Therefore, the reciprocals of these sums are (frac{1}{67}) for sums of 67 and (frac{1}{66}) for sums of 66.     4. **Calculating the Sum of Reciprocals:**    Let's calculate the total count of sums equal to 67 and sums equal to 66.    - There are a total of ( 100 - (-33) + 1 = 134 ) integers in the sequence.    - Hence, there are ( 133 ) sums between adjacent numbers.    Suppose we have ( a ) pairs summing to 67 and ( b ) pairs summing to 66:    [    a + b = 133.    ]     5. **Checking if the Sum Can be an Integer:**    - Given the counts, the sum of the reciprocals is:    [    a cdot frac{1}{67} + b cdot frac{1}{66}.    ]    - To find ( a ) and ( b ) such that their sum is an integer, we test simple values:      Suppose ( a = 67 ) and ( b = 66 ):      [      67 cdot frac{1}{67} + 66 cdot frac{1}{66} = 1 + 1 = 2.      ]      We see that with these values, the final sum of reciprocals is indeed an integer. # Conclusion: Therefore, it is possible to arrange the numbers from -33 to 100 such that the sum of the reciprocals of the sums of every two adjacent integers is a whole number.

However, the condition restricts us such that no more than two 0's can be consecutive, meaning each gap can have at most two 0's. 4. **Mathematical formulation:**    Let k be the number of gaps containing double 0's.

First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5, 9, and 11. Since 5, 9, and 11 are all prime numbers, the LCM is simply their product: LCM(5, 9, 11) = 5 * 9 * 11 = 45 * 11 = 495 Now, we want a number that, when divided by 5, 9, or 11, leaves a remainder of 3.

We want to find the smallest k such that 997 - X is also the smallest non-negative number. In other words, we want to find the largest multiple of 495 that is less than or equal to 994 (since 997 - 3 = 994). Let's divide 994 by 495 to find the largest multiple of 495 that is less than or equal to 994: 994 ÷ 495 = 2 (with a remainder) The largest multiple of 495 less than 994 is: 495 * 2 = 990 Now, we add 3 to 990 to get the number that will leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, 9, or 11: 990 + 3 = 993 Finally, we subtract this number from 997 to find the least number that should be subtracted: 997 - 993 = 4 Therefore, the least number that should be subtracted from 997 so that the remainder when divided by 5, 9, and 11 will leave a remainder of 3 in each case is boxed{4} ."},{"instruction":"f A_n^3=6C_n^4, then the value of n is ________.","output":"**Analysis** This problem examines the calculation of permutations and combinations.

Therefore, (A = B leftrightarrow a = b). 2. **Step 2: (a = b leftrightarrow h_a = h_b)**    - The altitudes (h_a) and (h_b) can be expressed as:        h_a = frac{2 times text{Area of triangle}}{a}, quad h_b = frac{2 times text{Area of triangle}}{b}        - If (a = b), then:        h_a = h_b        - Conversely, if (h_a = h_b):        frac{2A}{a} = frac{2A}{b} implies a = b        Thus, (a = b leftrightarrow h_a = h_b). 3. **Step 3: (a = b leftrightarrow m_a = m_b)**    - Using the median formula for sides (a) and (b):        4m_a^2 = 2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2, quad 4m_b^2 = 2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2        If (a = b), then (m_a) and (m_b) must be equal:        4m_a^2 = 4m_b^2 implies m_a = m_b        - Conversely, if (m_a = m_b), you get:        2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2 = 2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2 implies 3a^2 = 3b^2 implies a = b        Thus, (a = b leftrightarrow m_a = m_b). 4. **Step 4: (A = B leftrightarrow r_a = r_b)**    - Angular bisectors satisfy:        r_a = s tan frac{A}{2}, quad r_b = s tan frac{B}{2}        If (A = B), it follows:        frac{A}{2} = frac{B}{2} implies tan frac{A}{2} = tan frac{B}{2} implies r_a = r_b        - Conversely, if (r_a = r_b):        s tan frac{A}{2} = s tan frac{B}{2} implies tan frac{A}{2} = tan frac{B}{2} implies frac{A}{2} = frac{B}{2} implies A = B        Therefore, (A = B leftrightarrow r_a = r_b). 5. **Step 5: (A = B leftrightarrow t_a = t_b)**    - Angular segments satisfy:        t_a = frac{c sin B}{cos frac{B - C}{2}}, quad t_b = frac{c sin A}{cos frac{A - C}{2}}        If (A = B), then:        sin A = sin B implies t_a = t_b        - Conversely, if (t_a = t_b):        frac{c sin B}{cos frac{B - C}{2}} = frac{c sin A}{cos frac{A - C}{2}} implies sin B = sin A implies A = B        Thus, (A = B leftrightarrow t_a = t_b). 6. **Step 6: (A = B leftrightarrow sin C = 2 sin A cos B)**    - From trigonometric identities:        sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B        If (A = B):        sin C = sin(2A) = 2 sin A cos A        Therefore, (sin C = 2 sin A cos B).    So, (A = B leftrightarrow sin C = 2 sin A cos B). 7. **Step 7: (A = B leftrightarrow cos^2 frac{C}{2} = sin A sin B)**    - Using trigonometric identities:        cos^2 frac{C}{2} = frac{1 + cos C}{2} = sin A sin B        Therefore, (A = B leftrightarrow cos^2 frac{C}{2} = sin A sin B).

The given problem asks us to find the smallest natural number ( n ) such that ( 1999! ) is not divisible by ( 34^n cdot (n!) ). 2. First, we decompose ( 34 ) into its prime factors:    [    34 = 2 times 17    ]    To determine divisibility, we are more concerned about the factor ( 17 ) because ( 2 ) occurs more frequently in factorials. 3. We need to calculate the highest power of ( 17 ) that divides ( 1999! ). This required computation involves counting the number of times ( 17 ) appears as a factor in the integers from 1 to 1999. This is done using Legendre's formula:    [    text{The power of } p text{ in } n! = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{p^k} rightrfloor    ]    Applying Legendre's formula for ( p = 17 ) and ( n = 1999 ):    [    leftlfloor frac{1999}{17} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{1999}{17^2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{1999}{17^3} rightrfloor + ldots    ] 4.

Summing these values gives the highest power of ( 17 ) that divides ( 1999! ):    [    117 + 6 + 0 = 123    ]    Thus, the highest power of ( 17 ) dividing ( 1999! ) is ( 17^{123} ). 6. Next, find ( n ) such that ( 34^n cdot n! ) exceeds this power. Since ( 34 = 2 times 17 ), ( 34^n ) will contain ( 17^n ) as a factor. 7. In order for ( 1999! ) to not be divisible by ( 34^n cdot (n!) ), ( 1999! ) must not contain sufficient factors of ( 17 ) to account for both ( 34^n ) and the factors of ( 17 ) in ( n! ). 8. We know ( 34^n = 2^n times 17^n ). Checking ( n = 124 ):    - ( 34^{124} ) contributes ( 17^{124} ).    - ( n! ) needs more factors of ( 17 ) than ( 123 ), which it doesn’t. 9.

We are told that the total number of cases and extra boxes is 2, so: a + b = 2 We have two unknowns (a and x) and one equation, which means we have infinite solutions.
