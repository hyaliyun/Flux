With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - In the Nightside Eclipse is the first studio album and fourth official release by Norwegian black metal band Emperor, released in 1994 through Candlelight Records. It was the last album to feature drummer Faust and the only one to feature one-time bassist Tchort.

However, you should follow standards you are most comfortable with to protect the health of your dog.  Many kennel clubs require a dog to be 8 years or younger to register litters. Many vets suggest that dogs of normal health should be retired from breeding around 8 years old. The strictest standard to retire a dog from breeding is 5 years of age. Consult your vet when considering breeding a dog older than 5 years old. The age of your dog needs to be evaluated with other factors including size and breed. Certain breeds of dogs should be retired from breeding earlier than others. This is because some breeds have physiological issues and other related problems that could cause complications with pregnancy.  Chihuahuas and other toy dogs should be retired from breeding around 5 years old. Large breed dogs like standard poodles should be retired from breeding around 5 or 6 years old. Medium sized dogs may be bred longer than small or large breed dogs, depending on specific medical conditions and the opinion of your veterinarian. Many responsible breeders, vets, and kennel clubs suggest that people stop breeding dogs after a certain number of pregnancies.  Consider:  Some kennel clubs will stop registering litters after a dog has whelped 4 or 6 litters. Many veterinarians advise to retire a dog from breeding after 4 litters.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ask a question about Old English.","output":"What major factors contributed to the development and evolution of the Old English language? Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon, was a language spoken from approximately 450 AD to 1100 AD in what is now England and southern Scotland. As a Germanic language, it emerged from the linguistic influences of several tribes and significant historical events. The development and evolution of Old English language can be analyzed from various angles. In this answer, we will investigate five significant factors that contributed to its development: the arrival of Anglo-Saxons, Latin influence, Viking invasions, literary works, and regional dialects. 1. Arrival of Anglo-Saxons: The most important factor in the emergence of Old English can be traced back to the migration of three major Germanic tribes: the Angles, the Saxons, and the Jutes. These tribes arrived in Britain in the 5th century AD, following the withdrawal of the Roman Empire. As these tribes settled in Britain, they brought their own Germanic languages (Old Saxons and Old Jtivs, for example) and dialects, which started to mingle with the native Celtic languages. Over time, these languages evolved into a single, unified language known as Old English. 2. Latin influence: Even before the mass migration of Anglo-Saxons, Britain had been part of the Roman Empire since the 1st century AD, which introduced Latin into the region. While Latin did not become the dominant language of the native Celtic-speaking Britons, it still left its mark on Old English. The Latin impact on Old English included borrowed words, especially in areas of religion, education, and administration. As Christianity became more established in Britain around the 7th century, this Latin influence increased significantly because Latin was the language of the Church. 3. Viking invasions: Beginning in the late 8th century, Nordic invaders, primarily the Danes, began raiding Britain. They eventually settled in a specific region known as Danelaw in the north and east sections of England. The Vikings spoke Old Norse, which was another North Germanic language. Due to prolonged contact between the Old English-speaking Anglo-Saxons and the Old Norse-speaking Vikings, the two languages began to influence one another. This linguistic exchange resulted in the incorporation of Old Norse vocabulary, grammatical structures, and various linguistic features into Old English. 4. Literary works: Old English literature played an essential role in preserving and codifying the language. Notable Old English works, such as the epic poem \\"Beowulf,\\" \\"Caedmon's Hymn,\\" and various law texts, religious manuscripts and historical chronicles, all contributed to the development and documentation of the language. Literature also played a part in preserving regional dialects, producing a more distinct picture of how Old English varied across different regions. 5. Regional dialects: Old English was comprised of different regional dialects, mainly West Saxon, Mercian, Northumbrian, and Kentish. Each of these dialects has unique features, such as phonetic, grammatical, and vocabulary differences. These variations were, in part, due to the geographical spread of Angles, Saxons, and Jutes across Britain and their interactions with native Celtic speakers and Viking invaders. West Saxon, in particular, became the dominant dialect during the reign of King Alfred the Great in the late 9th century and was the foundation for many literary works during this time, further influencing the development of Old English. In conclusion, the development of Old English language was a complex process that evolved over centuries from the early interaction between Celtic, Latin, and Anglo-Saxon linguistic influences to the intense contact with Old Norse speakers and the preservation of regional dialects. Each factor significantly shaped Old English's evolution and shaped the linguistic foundation that would eventually transition into Middle English after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON — As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted.

Which farmer didn't have soil development operate in relative drought on his parcel?  Two farmers had neighboring parcels of land. Bob had a nice parcel of old growth forest, while the other farmer, named Bill , had a similar sized parcel covered in grasslands.  Hint: Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Bob, the farmer with the old growth forest parcel, did not have soil development operate in relative drought on his parcel. This is because the paragraph states that the soil development operating in relative drought, along with the mentioned processes, occurs in grasslands. The other farmer, Bill, has a parcel covered in grasslands, therefore his land experiences these conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Solve -19819 = 398*h - 15839 for h. Solve this problem.","output":"Alright, little buddy, let's solve this equation step by step. We want to figure out what 'h' is. We have this equation: -19819 = 398*h - 15839 First, we need to move the -15839 from the right side of the equation to the left side to help us solve for 'h'. To do this, we need to add 15839 to both sides: -19819 + 15839 = 398*h - 15839 + 15839 When we do this, we get: -3980 = 398*h Now, we need to find the value of 'h'. Since 398 is multiplied by 'h', we should do the opposite of multiplication to find 'h'. So, we need to divide both sides by 398: -3980 ÷ 398 = (398*h) ÷ 398 When we do this, we find that: -10 = h So there you have it, the value of 'h' is -10.

Can you tell me the answer to who did the voice of king louie in the original jungle book??","output":"King Louie, the eccentric, fun-loving orangutan in Disney's original 1967 animated film \\"The Jungle Book,\\" was voiced by the talented singer, actor, and jazz musician Louis Prima. Born on December 7, 1910, in New Orleans, Louisiana, Louis Prima experienced considerable success in his career, spanning five decades. He was a well-known singer, trumpet player, and bandleader during the Swing Era, Big Band Era, and beyond. Born into a musical family, Prima was initially trained in the violin. However, he eventually discovered his passion for jazz and switched to the trumpet. By the age of 17, he started playing jazz professionally. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Prima made a name for himself in the music and entertainment industry. He had a unique performing style and a natural, charismatic stage presence. The Jungle Book, based on Rudyard Kipling's stories, follows the life and adventures of Mowgli, a human boy raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. In the film, King Louie is a comical character who rules over a kingdom of apes and desires to learn the secret of \\"man's red fire.\\" When Disney's songwriting team, Richard and Robert Sherman, were tasked with creating music for the film, they decided that King Louie required a jazz-based musical number. They thus specifically approached Louis Prima to lend his voice and style to the character. Prima gladly accepted the offer, and the Sherman Brothers crafted the delightful and catchy \\"I Wan'na Be Like You\\" song, which has become a quintessential element of King Louie's identity. Louis Prima's swing/jazz style and engaging voice turned King Louie into a truly memorable character. He infused the character with a playful, energetic, and lively demeanor that has essentially defined King Louie in the minds of audiences worldwide. Prima's performance as King Louie remains an iconic example of voice acting in the animated film industry, and the character continues to be cherished by generations of fans."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Gaelic Ireland (Irish: Eire Ghaidhealach) was the Gaelic political and social order, and associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the prehistoric era until the early 17th century. Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \\"patchwork\\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry. For most of the Gaelic period, dwellings and farm buildings were circular with conical thatched roofs (see roundhouse). Square and rectangle-shaped buildings gradually became more common, and by the 14th or 15th century they had replaced round buildings completely. In some areas, buildings were made mostly of stone. In others, they were built of timber, wattle and daub, or a mix of materials. Most ancient and early medieval stone buildings were of dry stone construction. Some buildings would have had glass windows. Among the wealthy, it was common for women to have their own 'apartment' called a grianan (anglicized \\"greenan\\") in the sunniest part of the homestead.  The dwellings of freemen and their families were often surrounded by a circular rampart called a \\"ringfort\\". There are two main kinds of ringfort. The rath is an earthen ringfort, averaging 30m diameter, with a dry outside ditch. The cathair or caiseal is a stone ringfort. The ringfort would typically have enclosed the family home, small farm buildings or workshops, and animal pens. Most date to the period 500-1000 CE and there is evidence of large-scale ringfort desertion at the end of the first millennium. The remains of between 30,000 and 40,000 lasted into the 19th century to be mapped by Ordnance Survey Ireland. Another kind of native dwelling was the crannog, which were roundhouses built on artificial islands in lakes.  There were very few nucleated settlements in Gaelic areas. However, after the 5th century some monasteries became the heart of small \\"monastic towns\\". By the 10th century the Norse-Gaelic ports of Dublin, Wexford, Cork and Limerick had grown into substantial settlements. It was at this time, perhaps as a response to Viking raids, that many of the Irish round towers were built.  In the fifty years before the Norman invasion, the term \\"castle\\" (Old Irish: caistel/caislen) appears in Gaelic writings, although there are no surviving examples of pre-Norman castles. After the invasion, the Normans built motte-and-bailey castles in the areas they occupied, some of which were converted from ringforts. By 1300 \\"some mottes, especially in frontier areas, had almost certainly been built by the Gaelic Irish in imitation\\". The Normans gradually replaced wooden motte-and-baileys with stone castles and tower houses. Tower houses are free-standing multi-storey stone towers usually surrounded by a wall (see bawn) and ancillary buildings. Gaelic families had begun to build their own tower houses by the 15th century. As many as 7000 may have been built, but they were rare in areas with little Norman settlement or contact. They are concentrated in counties Limerick and Clare but are lacking in Ulster, except the area around Strangford Lough.  In Gaelic law, a 'sanctuary' called a maighin digona surrounded each person's dwelling. The maighin digona's size varied according to the owner's rank. In the case of a boaire it stretched as far as he, while sitting at his house, could cast a cnairsech (variously described as a spear or sledgehammer). The owner of a maighin digona could offer its protection to someone fleeing from pursuers, who would then have to bring that person to justice by lawful means.  Gaelic Ireland was involved in trade with Britain and mainland Europe from ancient times, and this trade increased over the centuries. Tacitus, for example, wrote in the 1st century that most of Ireland's harbours were known to the Romans through commerce. There are many passages in early Irish literature that mention luxury items imported from foreign lands, and the fair of Carman in Leinster included a market of foreign traders. In the Middle Ages the main exports were textiles such as wool and linen while the main imports were luxury items.  Money was seldom used in Gaelic society; instead, goods and services were usually exchanged for other goods and services. The economy was mainly a pastoral one, based on livestock (cows, sheep, pigs, goats, etc.) and their products. Cattle was \\"the main element in the Irish pastoral economy\\" and the main form of wealth, providing milk, butter, cheese, meat, fat, hides, and so forth. They were a \\"highly mobile form of wealth and economic resource which could be quickly and easily moved to a safer locality in time of war or trouble\\". The nobility owned great herds of cattle that had herdsmen and guards. Sheep, goats and pigs were also a valuable resource but had a lesser role in Irish pastoralism.  Horticulture was practised; the main crops being oats, wheat and barley, although flax was also grown for making linen.  Transhumance was also practised, whereby people moved with their livestock to higher pastures in summer and back to lower pastures in the cooler months. The summer pasture was called the buaile (anglicized as booley) and it is noteworthy that the Irish word for boy (buachaill) originally meant a herdsman. Many moorland areas were \\"shared as a common summer pasturage by the people of a whole parish or barony\\".  Gaelic Ireland was well furnished with roads and bridges. Bridges were typically wooden and in some places the roads were laid with wood and stone. There were five main roads leading from Tara: Slighe Asail, Slighe Chualann, Slighe Dala, Slighe Mor and Slighe Midluachra.  Horses were one of the main means of long-distance transport. Although horseshoes and reins were used, the Gaelic Irish did not use saddles, stirrups or spurs. Every man was trained to spring from the ground on to the back of his horse (an ech-leim or \\"steed-leap\\") and they urged-on and guided their horses with a rod having a hooked goad at the end.  Two-wheeled and four-wheeled chariots (singular carbad) were used in Ireland from ancient times, both in private life and in war. They were big enough for two people, made of wickerwork and wood, and often had decorated hoods. The wheels were spoked, shod all round with iron, and were from three to four and a half feet high. Chariots were generally drawn by horses or oxen, with horse-drawn chariots being more common among chiefs and military men. War chariots furnished with scythes and spikes, like those of the ancient Gauls and Britons, are mentioned in literature.  Boats used in Gaelic Ireland include canoes, currachs, sailboats and Irish galleys.

Man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word. The comedy concerns a character called Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O' Sullivan) who finds himself after a wild party, ending up at the home of two ladies called Jo and Chrissy. Ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate. The obvious ends up happening as he moves in. Man about the house was a pre-cursor to Cooke and Mortimer's spin off show George and Mildred which featured the 2 characters who were landlords to Jo, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with Mildred (the late and much missed Yootha Joyce) in particular getting some of the best lines of the series. A semi-regular character was Larry (Doug Fisher) a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something (and never to return it). The American's did a version called three's company but it doesn't stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original. Thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script. What a pity modern comedy can't reach that high standard. This programme is available on network DVD Choose your answer. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?

Plot title: The Quick and the Dead Movie plot: Duncan McKaskel (Tom Conti) and his wife, Susanna (Kate Capshaw), a married couple who, along with their 12-year-old son, Tom (Kenny Morrison), are travelling West hoping to start a new life. They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang. As time passes, Vallian manages to kill the bandits one by one. The remaining four keep up their pursuit. Vallian is obviously attracted to Susanna, and she to him. Following a moment of high drama, she succumbs to his advances and they share a passionate kiss. McKaskel never learns of the kiss, but tells Vallian, who is critical of his apparent pacifism, to back off several times. In an encounter with Indians, Susanna learns that her brother, an army officer, has likely been killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Out hunting, Vallian is shot.

The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question.

Options:  A. river  B. freshwater lake  C. sunshine  D. music store  E. live in ponds Answer:","output":"B. Freshwater Lake The man loved to fish for bass, and to be happy, all he needed was a boat, his equipment, and a freshwater lake. This is the option that aligns most closely with common sense in this context for the following reasons: 1. Freshwater lakes are known to be a natural habitat for various species of bass. Both largemouth and smallmouth bass are commonly found in freshwater lakes and reservoirs, which makes this the perfect setting for the man to go fishing. In contrast, options A (river) and E (live in ponds) also contain bass, but they are less commonly associated with bass fishing than a lake environment. 2. Sunshine (C) is a vital factor for a great fishing experience, but it is not directly related to the fishing activity itself. Having a sunny day might make the man happier and provide better fishing conditions, but it is not essential for bass fishing, and is not specifically associated with the pursuit and capture of bass. 3. A music store (D) is not pertinent to the man's interest in fishing. It is unrelated to the context and does not contribute to his enjoyment of bass fishing. Although music could be a source of enjoyment, it does not provide him with the bass fishing experience he desires. In conclusion, choosing option B, the freshwater lake, is the most consistent with common sense, given the man's love for fishing bass and the need for a suitable environment for pursuing his passion. The freshwater lake would provide him with access to the bass species and the best opportunity to stay happy and indulge in his favorite pastime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The game comes in three different variations, distinguishing themselves by the number of suits they feature: one-suit (easy), two-suit (intermediate), and four-suit (expert). This article will provide an in-depth dive into the two-suit variation of Spider Solitaire, examining its rules, strategies, and helpful tips on how to play the game effectively.  Setting Up the Game First, let's start by dealing out the cards. In this two-suit version, we will be working only with red cards (hearts and diamonds) and black cards (spades and clubs). Shuffle two decks of standard playing cards together, excluding jokers. Lay out ten piles of five cards each, flip the top card face-up in each pile, and place the remaining cards in the draw pile. Moving Clusters of the Same Color Now that the game is set up, the objective is to move cards between piles in descending order, beginning with the king and ending with the ace. However, in this two-suit version, you must focus on creating sequences by paying attention to both the rank and the color (red or black) of the cards. This means players can only move cards onto others of the same color (for example, a red eight can only be placed on a red nine). To optimize your play, look for clusters of the same color. A cluster is a group of cards of the same color in descending order. Moving clusters of the same color will allow you to more easily empty columns, which, in turn, gives you more space to play with and increases your chances of winning. Apply General Spider Solitaire Rules Aside from these specific recommendations, players should remember that standard Spider Solitaire rules apply to the two-suit version: 1. Empty Columns: If a column is emptied, any card or a cluster of the same color can be placed in that column. 2. Dealing New Cards: If you run out of moves, you can deal new cards from the draw pile on top of each column with at least one card. Make sure that all initial face-down cards have been turned face-up before doing this. 3. Building Complete Sequences: The ultimate goal of the game is to create complete sequences of the same suit. In this variation, the sequence must be from King to Ace of either hearts or diamonds for red sequences, and from King to Ace of either spades or clubs for black sequences. 4. Removing Completed Sequences: As you complete strategies, remove them from play by transferring them to a separate area. The game is won when all cards have been sorted into their appropriate sequences and removed from play. Helpful Tips for Winning Two-Suit Spider Solitaire 1. Prioritize unearthing face-down cards: Exposing and utilizing face-down cards should be your primary focus. This not only gives you more options for creating sequences but also uncovers any hidden potential clusters. 2. Be cautious about building on higher cards: While it’s necessary to make progress, building on higher-ranked cards can be risky, as it may limit your moves in the long run. Aim to uncover and use lower-ranked cards as much as possible. 3. Keep track of suits: As you progress through the two-suit version, remember that even though we think in reds and blacks, you must ultimately form sequences of the same suit (hearts, diamonds, spades, or clubs). Knowing which cards belong to each suit can help with planning and increases chances of success. Conclusion The two-suit variation of Spider Solitaire raises the difficulty level by adding more dimensions to the game. By focusing on reds and blacks, moving clusters of the same color, and understanding how to apply the general rules effectively, players set themselves up for success. With practice, patience, and strategic thinking, players will improve their skill and enjoy the gratifying challenge of mastering the two-suit Spider Solitaire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: It is one of the most annoying words in the English language and it seems there is no escaping it. The word \\"huh?\\" is in worldwide use, a study found. Researchers discovered that languages spoken in countries from Ghana and Laos to Iceland and Italy all include \\"huh?\\", or something that sounds very like it. They said that while the study may sound silly, the word is an absolutely necessary part of speech. Without it and similar words, it would be impossible to show that we haven't heard or understood what had been said and this would lead to constant misunderstandings. But while other words used in the same context, such as \\"sorry\\" or \\"what\\", vary widely across languages, \\"huh?\\" remains unchanged. The Dutch researchers carefully studied ten languages from around the world, including Siwu, which is spoken in Ghana, and an Australian Aboriginal language, as well as Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Mandarin Chinese. They analysed tapes of recorded conversations for words that sounded like \\"huh?\\" and were used to request that whatever had just been said be repeated. All contained a version of \\"huh?\\". The word was also found in another 21 languages. While there were subtle differences in each country, all sounded basically the same. This is surprising because normally unrelated languages will use very different words to describe the same thing. For instance, the Japanese for \\"dog\\" is \\"inu\\", while the French is \\"chien\\". It is thought that languages around the world have developed their own version of \\"huh?\\" because the sound is quick and simple to form, as well as being easily understood. The researchers, said that it might seem unimportant to carry out scientific research into a word like \\"huh?\\" but in fact this little word is an essential tool in human communication. They also have an answer for those who claim that \\"huh?\\" isn't a word. They say that it qualifies because of the small differences in its pronunciation in different languages.

This is the stylish lounge adjacent to the cozy Jamaican restaurant known as The Breadfruit.  I loved the vibe of this place as soon as I walked in the door.  Their list of rums is quite impressive so if you are a connoisseur then you simply must go here.  They have a menu of fun signature cocktails that were mostly tropical themed... it sort of reminded me of Hula's Modern Tiki Bar in that respect but in this case the rums really are the main focus and any fruit juice or other mixers are meant to enhance and highlight the flavor of the rum itself.  The first one I tried was the Spicy Rumtini which was really delicious, though I expected more heat.  My husband wanted a Jack and diet coke but was told that they had neither (no whiskey since rums are their thing and they also don't offer soda with artificial sweeteners).  However the bartender recommended he try the Tennessee Rum Cider.  This drink tasted surprisingly like whiskey but actually is made with a rum called Prichard's Fine (which is made in Tennessee) mixed with an organic apple cider.  The second drink that I tried was a Dark and Stormy.  I had this drink at Citizen Public House and didn't really care for it but I really enjoyed this one.  Now don't get me wrong, I am well aware that CPH mixes up the best cocktails on the planet.  But I just happened to like this particular drink here at the Rum Bar better.  One of my companions said it was because of the type of rum they use (Goslings).  The cocktails were all 8 or 9 and their wines were 10 a glass (but they had Dos Cabezas, yay!) so because of that this would never be someplace I would come drink on a regular basis.  Though I certainly don't mind splurging on a premium cocktail every once in a while.  I saw they also had a cigar patio so I think this would be the perfect place for a classy bachelor party or b-day.","output":"Step 1: Read the review carefully.

Article:It reminds me of reporting on a drought a few years ago: while filming interviews with people about the impact, the heavens opened and rainwater was soon flowing down my neck. So as journalists were invited to the Science Media Centre in London to hear how the worldwide rise in temperatures has stalled, the mercury shot up as if on cue to record the hottest day of the year so far. In many ways, this event was long overdue: climate sceptics have for years pointed out that the world is not warming as rapidly as once forecast. A lot depends on how you do the measurements, of course. Each of the last few decades has been warmer than the last. But start your graph in 1998 - which happened to be an exceptionally warm year - and there hasn't been much global warming at all. Gradually the words 'pause' and 'hiatus' which first featured in the blogs have crossed to the media and then to the scientists professionally engaged in researching the global climate. The headline - which the scientists will not thank me for - is that no one is really sure why the rate of warming has stumbled. There are plenty of possible explanations but none of them adds up to a definitive smoking gun. Professor Piers Forster of Leeds University has tried to quantify the different factors involved - what's known as their \\"radiative forcing\\". Between 1998-2012, he reckons, manmade greenhouse gases were still the biggest influence, causing warming of 0.48 of a Watt per square metre (a key measure of energy flows to and from the planet). At the same, he estimates, two other natural influences might have led to some cooling: a relatively quiet Sun might have been responsible for a reduction of 0.16 of a Watt/sq m and volcanic eruptions another 0.06 Watt/sq m. A big unknown is the effect of aerosols - tiny particles released by industrial pollution which could cause a further cooling effect. It is thought that the world's massive industrialisation after World War Two contributed to a slight drop in global temperatures in the late 1940s. But the key factor - according to all the speakers at the briefing - is that whatever solar energy is making it through to the surface, much is being absorbed by the hidden depths of the oceans. The Argo network of automated monitors has been deployed since 2005 to measure the waters as deep as 1,800m. This isn't a very long period but the data are apparently showing some warming - even in this short time frame. And readings from satellites since 2000 show how much energy is arriving at the planet, and how much is leaving, so if the energy left behind is not manifesting itself in rising surface temperatures, then it must be going somewhere - and the deep ocean is the most plausible explanation. On top of that, the scientists say, pauses in warming were always to be expected. This is new - at least to me. It is common sense that climate change would not happen in a neat, linear away but instead in fits and starts. But I've never heard leading researchers mention the possibility before. Professor Rowan Sutton, of Reading University, said computer simulations or models of possible future climate scenarios often show periods of ten years with no warming trend - some even show pauses of 20-25 years. And Professor Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office Hadley Centre, said observations and models showed that on average there were - or would be - two pauses in warming every century. I asked why this had not come up in earlier presentations. No one really had an answer, except to say that this \\"message\\" about pauses had not been communicated widely. So where does this leave us, as greenhouse gases emissions keep rising but the temperature does not? Dr Peter Stott, of the Met Office, pointed out that 12 of the 14 warmest years have occurred since the year 2000 and says that other indicators - like the decline in Arctic sea ice of 12.9% per decade and losses of snow cover and glaciers - still point to a process of manmade warming. But what about another possibility - that the calculations are wrong? What if the climate models - which are the very basis for all discussions of what to do about global warming - exaggerate the sensitivity of the climate to rising carbon dioxide? Dr Stott conceded that the projections showing the most rapid warming now look less likely, given recent observations, but that others remain largely unchanged. A Met Office briefing document, released at the briefing, says that, even allowing for the temperatures of the last decade, the most likely warming scenario is only reduced by 10% - so \\"the warming that we might have expected by 2050 would be delayed by only a few years\\". Overall, it concludes, the pause \\"does not materially alter the risks of substantial warming of the Earth by the end of this century.\\" In other words, global warming is still on. But until the pause can be properly explained, many people will take a lot of convincing - especially if the pause lasts longer than expected. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article discusses the worldwide stall in the rise of temperatures, which has led to a pause or hiatus in global warming. Despite this stall, each of the last few decades has been warmer than the last. The cause of this rate stagnation in warming is unknown, with numerous possible explanations but no definitive answer. Factors that could contribute to the pause include manmade greenhouse gases, natural influences such as a dormant sun, volcanic eruptions, and the effect of aerosols. The article highlights the significant role of oceans in absorbing solar energy, resulting in hidden depths of warming. Additionally, the article mentions that pauses in warming were always expected, not happening in a perfectly linear manner but rather in fits and starts. Computer simulations often show periods of 10 to 25 years with no warming trend. Even as temperatures stall, other indicators such as the decline of Arctic sea ice, losses of snow cover, and glaciers point to a process of manmade warming. The article concludes that global warming is still happening, and the pause does not radically alter the risks of substantial warming by the end of the century. However, until the cause of the pause can be explained, many people will remain skeptical, especially if the pause continues longer than expected."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

McLean, Va.: So what should we be wearing on Sunday? By 8 a.m., will it be warm enough for shorts and short sleeves? I remember all of the gloves tossed on the ground last year. On the course, are there places (like the water stations) where it's okay to drop a layer of clothing? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: Runners should dress for cold dark early morning arrival at MCM. Sunrise is usually around 7:10 a.m. We will have UPS trucks in Runners Village for runners to check their bags and then pick up at finish. Recommend if cold, stay in clothing as long as you deem necessary. Some shed at the start...others in Runners Village at the trucks. Arlington, Va.: Can you elaborate on the tracking of runners during the race? This year there are no text message; rather, an iPhone/Android app. No one I know that is running can explain to me how exactly it will work. Do you still collect position information at each mile via shoe tags, or do you have to carry the phone during the marathon to use its GPS function? The latter seems onerous; however, the Web site says the new system uses GPS and you need a device to get \\"full functionality.\\" I expect this to be a major friction point on Sunday, so can you clarify the situation? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: The MCM collects split time data every 5k and will be live on the website. The timing device is on the reverse side of the bib.

USA TODAY      Tonya Harding arrives at the 75th annual Golden Globe Awards. (Photo: Jordan Strauss, Invision via AP)      Allison Janney’s Golden Globe-winning portrayal of Tonya Harding’s mother in I Tonya included two constants: drinking and physical abuse of her star figure skater daughter.      Harding’s real-life mother, LaVona \\"Sandy\\" Golden, however, told ABC News as part of a two-hour special that she neither consistently abused Harding and the scenes that showed her drinking while Harding skated as a child were inaccurate.      “I didn’t abuse any of my children,” Golden said per part of the interview ABC News released ahead of Thursday’s show. “Spanked? Yes, (I) spanked. Absolutely, positively you (have) got to show them right from wrong.”      Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story airs on ABC Thursday night (9 p.m. ET).      Golden admitted one incident from the movie did occur.      “I spanked her once with a hairbrush at a competition,” Golden said.      Harding, however, said the abuse wasn’t isolated as Golden contends and the scene where Golden threw a steak knife that lodged in her arm indeed took place.      “I was about 10 feet from her,” Harding told ABC News. “It was a steak knife.”      Golden said the incident didn't happen.      “Why would I throw a steak knife at anybody?” Golden said. “She’s lied so much she doesn’t know what isn’t a lie anymore.”      As far as the drinking, Harding told ABC News that she knew at age 11 half a thermos her mother would take to the rink in the morning was filled with “brandy and the rest was coffee.”      Golden said it wasn’t actually alcohol.      “I would have coffee and sometimes I would put brandy flavoring in it,” Golden said.             ||||| Former Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding said that her mother abused her throughout her childhood, including that she once threw a steak knife at her, and that any support from her mother came at an emotional price.      “I don’t think that there was more than one day a week, sometimes, that I didn’t get beaten,” Harding told ABC's Amy Robach.      But her mother, LaVona \\"Sandy\\" Golden, told ABC News that wasn't the case at all.      “I didn’t abuse any of my children,” Golden said. “Spanked? Yes, [I] spanked. Absolutely, positively you [have] got to show them right from wrong.”      ABC News      Harding and her tumultuous relationship with her mother are receiving new attention in the movie, “I, Tonya,” which was inspired by Harding’s life and includes a scene in which Allison Janney, who plays Golden, throws a steak knife at Harding, played by actress Margot Robbie. Janney won a Golden Globe award Sunday night for her portrayal of Golden.      Golden’s new ABC News interview is featured in the two-hour ABC News special “Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story.\\"      LaVona Golden      Tonya Harding was just 3 years old when she stepped out onto the ice for the first time, and her mother said she knew instantly that her daughter had a talent for figure skating.      “Whatever the other people were doing, she turned around right behind them and did the same thing,” Golden said. “She wasn’t supposed to be able to do any of it, but she just went and did it.”      “Tonya was my little dynamo,” she added. “I called her my little twinkle, my little star.”      LaVona Golden      Golden said Harding was the youngest of four children. Harding’s father is Golden’s third husband. She said the family had a modest life together.      “Tonya herself called us trailer trash. We were never trailer trash. We had a beautiful new trailer,” Golden said. “We didn’t live in filth or dirt or anything that I would call unusual.”      As her childhood progressed, Harding spent most of her days on the ice, practicing and in competitions. Her mother said that she worked overtime to pay for the sport’s expenses, like lessons, costumes and competition fees.      LaVona Golden      Golden said she had jobs as a waitress, a bartender and a cook, adding, “I was working right around the clock, morning, noon, and night, trying to get the money for her to skate and have lessons…. I had to work sometimes two and three jobs a day trying to make ends meet.”      “My mother did pay for skating, but I worked at the rink for my ice time or I worked at the roller rink for my ice time,” Harding told ABC News’ Amy Robach. “It’s a very expensive sport.”      Play      But Harding said that while her mother helped her pay for skating, that support came with a price. Harding said her mother once hit her in the bathroom at an ice rink, saying, “I remember she dragged me into the bathroom and beat me with a hairbrush, literally.”      Golden admitted it. “I spanked her once with a hairbrush at a competition,” said Golden, but claimed that it was an isolated incident.      LaVona Golden      But Harding alleges that the abuse went far beyond a single swat with a hairbrush. She says that once when she was in high school, her mother threw a steak knife at her, which landed in her forearm. Harding said she tried to leave the house in the middle of a conversation with her mother when she was struck.      “And that’s when it happened,” Harding said. “I was about 10 feet from her. It was a steak knife.”      However, Golden denies that the incident ever occurred. “Why would I throw a steak knife at anybody?” Golden said, claiming that her daughter has a history of being dishonest. “She’s lied so much she doesn’t know what isn’t a lie anymore.”      LaVona Golden      Harding became a force of nature on the ice. She skated her way to victory at the 1991 World Figure Skating Championships, where she became the first American woman to land a triple axel in competition, and she went on to compete at the 1992 and the 1994 Winter Olympics.      Today, Harding has her own family -- a husband of seven years, and a son.      “With my husband and my son, I get my second chance in life to be loved and to be happy,” she said.      Golden said she has never met her grandson, and Harding said that’s not going to change.      “I don’t want her anywhere near me. I don’t want her anywhere near my son,” Harding said of her mother. “She wants forgiveness. She wants to see me. She wants to make amends. She wants to meet and be part of the family. Hell no.” ||||| And the Golden Globe Award goes to … Allison Janney!      The actress took home the statue for best supporting actress in a motion picture at Sunday night’s award show for her role in I, Tonya.      Janney portrayed Tonya Harding’s mom, LaVona Fay Golden, in a dramatized version of the true story of figure skater Tonya Harding.      Janney thanked screenwriter Steven Rodgers in her acceptance speech for creating a “very distinctive, unique, mother…. of a character.”      “What he did is tell a story about class, tell a story about the disenfranchised about a woman who was not embraced for her individuality, tell a story about truth and the perception of truth in the media and the truths we all tell ourselves when we wake up in bed in the morning.”      Steve Granitz/WireImage      She also gave a shoutout to flu-ridden star Margot Robbie, who played Harding.      “Margot, my goodness, she’s a quadruple threat,” Janney said.      Be sure to check out PEOPLE’s full Golden Globes coverage to get the latest news on Hollywood’s big night.      The actress, 58, told PEOPLE at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association after party that she was “very excited and very proud” of her award.      Janney has been earning major Oscar buzz for her role as U.S. figure skater Tonya Harding’s controversial mother LaVona Golden in I, Tonya, which details the skater’s career and 1994 attack on Nancy Kerrigan that got Harding banned for life from figure skating.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who borrowed one of Dylan's big, bulky sweaters?  The album cover features a photograph of Dylan with Suze Rotolo. It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein at the corner of Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: \\"He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.\\" In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: It is one of those cultural markers that influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility. Most album covers were carefully staged and controlled, to terrific effect on the Blue Note jazz album covers ... and to not-so great-effect on the perfectly posed and clean-cut pop and folk albums. Whoever was responsible for choosing that particular photograph for The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan really had an eye for a new look.  Critic Janet Maslin summed up the iconic impact of the cover as \\"a photograph that inspired countless young men to hunch their shoulders, look distant, and let the girl do the clinging\\".The cover photo is recreated in the 2001 Tom Cruise film Vanilla Sky.

Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis.  He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow.  He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop.  Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis.  Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men.

Analyze the first sentence, \\"Air out the smoke-filled rooms\\": - In this context, \\"air\\" is used as a verb. It means to expose, ventilate, or refresh the rooms by allowing fresh air to circulate and remove the smoke. 2. Analyze the second sentence, \\"Air the old winter clothes\\": - In this context, \\"air\\" is also used as a verb. It means to expose the old winter clothes to fresh air, to dry or freshen them up, and to help get rid of any unpleasant odors or dampness.

What 2007 film is an over-the-top send-up of action movies, featuring a large amount of violence (including killing by carrots), starring Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci & Paul Giamatti?","output":"The 2007 film you are referring to is \\"Shoot 'Em Up,\\" a stylized, over-the-top action-comedy directed and written by Michael Davis. The movie stars Clive Owen as Mr. Smith, a mysterious loner with exceptional shooting skills, Monica Bellucci as Donna Quintano, a lactating prostitute, and Paul Giamatti as Hertz, the ruthless and determined villain. \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" pays homage to and parodies various action, crime, and thriller movies, blending excessive violence with tongue-in-cheek humor. Its plot revolves around Mr. Smith, who unexpectedly finds himself in the middle of a gunfight when he tries to save a pregnant woman from being killed. Despite his efforts, the woman dies, and Mr. Smith is left to protect her newborn baby from Hertz and his team of assassins. Donna Quintano becomes an inadvertent ally, using her maternal instincts and street smarts to help Mr. Smith keep the baby safe. One of the film's most distinctive features is its highly imaginative and ludicrously violent action sequences. Mr. Smith uses anything and everything as a weapon, including carrots, which he masterfully employs to kill several enemies. The movie's relentless pace, exaggerated fight scenes, and acrobatic gunplay are purposely overdone to create a sense of exhilaration and exuberance. In addition to its frenetic action, \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" is also notable for its quick-witted dialogue and biting humor, which further contribute to its send-up of the action genre. The film often pokes fun at action movie clichés and tropes, such as the calm, collected hitman or the seemingly invincible protagonist. By subverting these conventions, Michael Davis crafts a movie that serves as both a tribute to and a send-up of its cinematic predecessors. In conclusion, \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" is a 2007 film that parodies and celebrates the action genre with its extreme violence, outlandish combat scenes, and dark comedy. Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci, and Paul Giamatti deliver memorable performances as they navigate a world filled with over-the-top mayhem and dangerous assassins. While the film received mixed reviews from critics, it has garnered a cult following among fans of action cinema, who appreciate its exaggerated style and knowing humor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

Dr. Death is Released Pathologist, angel of mercy, advocate, lightning rod, scofflaw, punchline — to Dr. Jack Kevorkian’s long resume of sobriquets we may now add ex-con. After serving 8 years of a 10-to-25-year sentence for second-degree murder, the doctor walked out of the Lakeland Correctional Facility in Coldwater, Mich., and into the predictable media frenzy. He had only a few offhand, characteristically vinegary remarks for the legions of reporters and camera crews on the scene, but there will be all manner of TV appearances and news conferences in the days and weeks to come, one may be sure. Seventy-nine and not in the best of health himself, Dr. Kevorkian returns on parole to a society that still hasn’t figured out what to do about one of the great unintended consequences of modern science: The growing number of people with profound illnesses whose death can be staved off indefinitely but whose suffering and misery, physical or psychic or both, cannot be meaningfully relieved. The law, medical ethics, religious teachings and the gut feelings of the average Joe or Joan can all be in wildly different places on what’s right and what’s wrong in such cases. It’s fairly well settled that any mentally competent person has the right to refuse medical treatment, even life-saving treatment, and “let nature take its course.” But there is much more widespread disagreement about helping nature along — and that’s the fault line where Dr. Kevorkian stands. When the patient does it himself or herself, say by using the machine Dr. Kevorkian invented, it seems most people would call that suicide — a sin in most religions, but generally not a crime. If anyone else lifts a finger to actively help, even a compassionate doctor whose patient has begged for the help and has no other hope of relief, 49 of the 50 states call that homicide, a stance that the Supreme Court found to be constitutional in two 1997 cases. Oregon is the exception, with a law expressly allowing physicians to assist suicide in certain circumstances, which was passed by referendum in 1994, survived a repeal referendum and has likewise been upheld in the courts. Dr. K’s own sojourns in the legal system have been similarly mixed. As one writer on the subject, Ronald Standler, has pointed out, as long as he listened to good legal advice, Dr. Kevorkian managed to stay out of jail while helping more than 100 people slip the mortal coil at a time of their choosing. Only when he decided to represent himself in court was he convicted and imprisoned. He’s promised not to assist suicides any more; he seems unlikely to want to break parole and go back to jail. But his views on the issue haven’t changed, his associates say, and we’ll doubtless be hearing him expound them quite a bit now that he’s back in circulation. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Dr. Jack Kevorkian, known for his controversial role in physician-assisted suicide, has been released on parole after serving 8 years of a 10-to-25-year sentence for second-degree murder, reigniting debates over the ethical issues surrounding end-of-life care.

Hotshot ensign Alan Drake, fresh from the flying academy at Pensacola, Florida, gets off to a bad start with the pilots of an elite squadron, nicknamed the \\"Hellcats\\", to which he has been posted in San Diego. Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\".  Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed. Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but no further testing is allowed until Commander Gary's return. Banning had been a childhood friend of Lorna Gary, and is not her first friend to die. She sinks into a deep depression. She also knows that Gary will expect her to hide her feelings and carry on, something that is very much not in her nature. Drake, appreciating the help the Garys gave him when he arrived, visits her at her home, and convinces her she should not suffer alone. They go for walks, drives, and tennis; he amuses her with jokes. Finally, at a restaurant she reaches for his hand and in doing so realizes she is falling for him. She quickly breaks away, and says she cannot see him any more. Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who sinks into a deep depression is Lorna."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lilly finds a small boy who witnesses one attack, and tells her that a Brother was responsible. As the police don't want to panic the city, the string of murders is explained away as being the result of an outbreak of the rampant influenza virus. Silus is detailed by the church cardinals to work with the human police, because the Brothers know that these attacks have been carried out by a Brother; Silus's brother Edgar. Edgar has sent Silus a recording of his last murder, challenging him to find and stop him before he kills again. Edgar provides the location of his next murder. With Silus' help, Lilly puts together a task force to stake out the area Edgar has targeted. However Edgar distracts the cops and attacks Lilly, biting her in the neck. An officer interrupts the attack and Edgar flees. To save Lilly's life, Silus tells her to drink his blood, which she does. Silus then pursues Edgar, managing to shoot him with a tranquilizing dart.

Step 1: We need to get all the \\"x\\" parts together. Let's move the 2*x from the right side of the equation to the left side by subtracting 2*x from both sides: 14*x - 2*x + 60 = 2*x - 2*x This simplifies to: 12*x + 60 = 0 Step 2: Now, we need to get rid of the 60 on the left side to make it easier to find x. We will do this by subtracting 60 from both sides: 12*x + 60 - 60 = 0 - 60 This simplifies to: 12*x = -60 Step 3: To find out what x is, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 12: 12*x / 12 = -60 / 12 This simplifies to: x = -5 And there's our answer! x is -5 in this equation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In general, a pressure is a force per unit area, across a surface. A difference in pressure across a surface then implies a difference in force, which can result in an acceleration according to Newton's second law of motion, if there is no additional force to balance it. The resulting force is always directed from the region of higher-pressure to the region of lower-pressure. When a fluid is in an equilibrium state (i.e. there are no net forces, and no acceleration), the system is referred to as being in hydrostatic equilibrium. In the case of atmospheres, the pressure gradient force is balanced by the gravitational force, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium. In Earth's atmosphere, for example, air pressure decreases at altitudes above Earth's surface, thus providing a pressure gradient force which counteracts the force of gravity on the atmosphere. Question: with regard to the pressure gradient force air will always move from low to high pressure?","output":"Imagine you have two balloons, one big and one small. The big balloon has more air inside, so it has higher pressure, and the small balloon has less air, so it has lower pressure. Now, imagine connecting these two balloons with a tiny straw. The air will want to move from the big balloon (high pressure) to the small balloon (low pressure) to try and balance things out. This is how the pressure-gradient force works! So, to answer your question, with regard to the pressure gradient force, air will always want to move from high pressure to low pressure, not the other way around."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Aliquippa Police Chief Donald Couch Jr. said the loaded .22-caliber revolver was found Monday morning inside a backpack, but they are sure the student meant no harm.      Superintendent David Wytiaz told parents that another student told a teacher about the weapon inside a backpack.      Administrators at Aliquippa Elementary School secured the firearm and turned it over to Aliquippa police.      “It's a very unique situation,” Police Chief Donald Couch Jr. said. “As far as the circumstances, how it got there, I can't go into that.”      Police have contacted the child's mother and her boyfriend to determine whether any criminal charges are warranted. The gun came from the boy's home and is registered to someone born in 1914 who police think is dead.      Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf visited the school that day at around 2:15 p.m.      “I can stress that at no time were any students in danger,” Couch said. “We are definitely sure there was no ill will by the student towards anyone.”      Wytiaz reiterated that point.      “We believe at this point, there was no threat made or anything like that,” Wytiaz said. “The gun was removed without anyone seeing it.”      Channel 11’s Gordon Loesch reported the child who had the gun is 5 or 6 years old.      The boy’s family told Channel 11’s Courtney Brennan that the boy wasn’t being aggressive. He simply was trying to protect his younger brothers.      “For them to say he’s aggressive, that’s a lie,” said his godmother, Nicole Lutle. “It’s not that this child was bad. It’s not that this child had a temper because all of that is a lie.”      According to Lutle and other family friends, the boy found the gun on a bed inside his apartment in the Linmar Terrace housing complex Sunday night.      “He picked it up because he didn’t want his little brother to get to it,” Lutle said. “He knew his little brother wouldn’t go through his book bag, so he put it in his book bag and forgot it was in there.      The boy’s younger brother is 3 years old.      “He’s a very sweet kid. He wasn’t taking the gun to school to hurt anyone,” Lutle said.      Lutle doesn't condone what happened but said this kindergartener and his siblings need help.      “We have to show these kids more love because if we don’t show them, what do they think they have?\\" she said.      On Tuesday, several parents told Channel 11’s Gordon Loesch that they’re angry and fearful after the incident.      “My son, they all ride the bus together. I feel really scared for him,” said Darryce McCoy.      A letter was sent home to parents Tuesday, but some said they should have been notified sooner.      “That’s not good enough. We need to know when it happens,” Smith said.      The Associated Press and Channel 11’s news exchange partners at TribLIVE contributed to this report. ||||| School has just begun for most kids, and along with the pencils and notebooks that the students brought to one school in Pennsylvania was a gun -- a loaded gun. It was found in a 5-year-old's backpack in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, after a classmate told the teacher about it. These kids are in kindergarten. And there was a loaded gun in a kindergarten student's backpack. Terrifying. The boy was suspended, but I don't think he should have been. He has a very good reason why he brought the gun to school.      The child said he found it on a bed in his house and didn't want his 3-year-old brother to get it, so he packed it in a place he thought was safe.      The child's grandmother, Nicole Lutle, spoke to WPXI and said:      He put it in his book bag and forgot it was in there .... For them to say he’s aggressive, that’s a lie. It’s not that this child was bad. It’s not that this child had a temper because all of that is a lie.      This whole story is worrisome on so many levels. I have 5-year-old twins who are in kindergarten. The thought of either of them somehow handling a loaded gun scares me to my core. The thought of them being in a classroom where another child brings in a gun is equally frightening. I am so thankful this story didn't turn out worse. But I also do not think this child should be suspended -- his parents should be. They should be charged somehow. If what this child said was true, he was protecting his 3-year-old brother. He didn't want him to get the gun, which was reportedly loaded and lying on a bed in their home.      That decision may have saved this boy's brother's life. Of course there are so many ways this could have played out and thank everything everywhere that no one was harmed. Kids and guns do not mix in my opinion. Ever. Not even at a shooting range -- the story of a 9-year-old accidentally killing her firing range instructor is proof of that. But I just can't stop thinking about a loaded gun lying on a bed with a 3- and 5-year-old in the home. I can't stop thinking that what this kid did was sincerely what he thought was the right thing.      What do you think? Should the child be suspended? Should any action be taken against the parents?

Some parents were killed, others were unharmed when soldiers came calling. Investigators examined period between 1977 and 1989, 'peak' adoption period. Reports says many more could have been taken, investigation underway. Article:","output":"Title: Tragic Truth: Children Stolen for Foreign Adoption in the 20th Century Revealed by Report Introduction In recent years, reports have been surfacing about the dark history involving the stealing and trafficking of children for adoption in various countries across Europe and North America. A new investigative report has recently shed light on this tragic issue and the heart-wrenching stories of innocent families torn apart during the peak adoption period between 1977 and 1989. This astonishing discovery has unveiled the untold horrors faced by countless children and their families, and pushed for a thorough investigation into this deeply rooted problem. Paragraph 1: Countries and Adoption Trends The report highlights cases in countries like the United States, Sweden, Italy, and France, where desperate couples seeking to adopt a child often unwittingly became accessories to this illicit industry. The children, many of whom were unaware of their backgrounds, were taken from their families and put up for adoption against the wishes of their birth parents. The investigation focuses on the peak adoption period between 1977 and 1989, with the report surmising that so many more children may have been taken from their families during this time. Paragraph 2: Parents' Survival Rates In chilling detail, the report describes the events that unfolded when soldiers came calling to take these innocent children from their homes. Some parents were tragically killed, further illustrating the brutality of these abductions. The parents who were spared met with other unimaginable horrors, as they were forced to watch their children being taken away from them. In the aftermath, several distraught families spent years desperately searching for their loved ones. Paragraph 3: Ongoing Investigations An ongoing investigation has been launched to determine the extent of these abductions and to identify those involved in these criminal activities. As the truth continues to unravel, it is becoming increasingly apparent that this problem is rooted far deeper than initially thought. It also speaks volumes to the corruption and lack of oversight in the adoption process in the past. Conclusion: Hope for Justice With this new report, light has been shed on one of the most tragic cases of child abduction and human trafficking in modern history. As the investigation progresses, victims and their families can finally begin to seek justice, and governments worldwide need to address and learn from these painful lessons of the past. The ongoing investigation will hopefully aim to reunite families that were systematically separated and ensure that measures are put in place to prevent future tragedies of this nature."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The children live with their parents, Woody (Delroy Lindo), a struggling musician, and Carolyn (Alfre Woodard), a schoolteacher. The neighborhood is filled with colorful characters. The Carmichaels' next-door neighbor, Tony Eyes (David Patrick Kelly) continuously sings. Snuffy (Spike Lee) and Right Hand Man (N. Jeremi Duru) are glue sniffers. Vic Powell (Isaiah Washington) is a war vet who lives upstairs from the Carmichaels. One day, the Carmichael children get into a dispute with Tony who alleges that they are always throwing trash into his area. The argument escalates when Carolyn and several neighborhood children get involved. Tony is still yelling when Vic comes downstairs. Vic then punches Tony in the face. Troy, who has sneaked out to the corner store, sees Vic getting arrested as she leaves the store. One night, Woody and Carolyn argue about money; Carolyn resents Woody because he isn't earning money as a musician and because he has bounced checks. The argument escalates as Carolyn yells for the children to turn off the television. Carolyn later turns off the TV. Clinton turns it back on. Carolyn grabs him for disobeying her and Woody grabs her and carries her out of the room. Woody drags Carolyn down the stairs and Nate jumps on Woody's back. The other children hold Carolyn and Carolyn hurts her ankle in the struggle. Carolyn kicks Woody out of the house. Woody brings flowers to Carolyn and the two reconcile. The family then decides to go on a trip. As they are leaving, a worker from Con Ed comes by to shut off the electricity due to an unpaid bill. The trip is postponed and the family has to use candles for light. A few days later, Nate and Troy travel to the South to stay with relatives.

Comparing statements a and d, the wife is mentioned as having an education in the premise while the spouse is contributing financially in the hypothesis. Although these statements might seem different, the premise implies that the education leads to financial support.  Comparing statements b and e, the premise suggests that the wife could support the family financially, while the hypothesis states that the result would be a two parent home.  Comparing statements c and e, the premise identifies the value in having a two parent home which is consistent with the hypothesis. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis.

Question: \\"What were the desired solution?\\"  Context: \\"The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The desired solution in the context of Indian independence was to address the demands and concerns of both the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League while ensuring a peaceful transition of power. The steps taken in an attempt to reach this solution were: 1. Recognizing the pressing need for Indian independence: The Labour government, led by Clement Attlee, made it a priority to address Indian independence following their election in 1945. 2. Acknowledging the differing positions of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League: Congress wanted a unified secular Indian state, while the Muslim League sought a separate Muslim state in Muslim-majority regions. 3. Assessing the urgency of the situation: With increasing civil unrest and potential for civil war, the British government realized that a swift resolution was necessary, leading to Attlee promising independence by 1948 and Lord Mountbatten bringing the date forward to 15 August 1947. 4. Partitioning India based on religious demographics: To address the concerns of both parties, the British drew borders to broadly separate Hindu and Muslim areas, which ultimately led to the creation of two independent states, India and Pakistan. 5. Ensuring the independence of other nations previously under British influence: Burma and Sri Lanka gained their independence in 1948, with India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka becoming members of the Commonwealth. However, it is important to note that the desired solution did not entirely mitigate the issues at hand, as it led to mass migrations, violence, and the loss of lives among the Hindu and Muslim communities."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Article: SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc Chief Executive Larry Page and Apple CEO Tim Cook have been conducting behind-the-scenes talks about a range of intellectual property matters, including the mobile patent disputes between the companies, people familiar with the matter said.      The two executives had a phone conversation last week, the sources said. Discussions involving lower-level officials of the two companies are also ongoing.      Page and Cook are expected to talk again in the coming weeks, though no firm date has been set, the sources said on Thursday. One of the sources told Reuters that a meeting had been scheduled for this Friday, but had been delayed for reasons that were unclear.      The two companies are keeping lines of communication open at a high level against the backdrop of Apple's legal victory in a patent infringement case against Samsung, which uses Google's Android software.      Last Friday, a jury awarded Apple 1.05 billion in damages and set the stage for a possible ban on sales of some Samsung products in a case that has been widely viewed as a \\"proxy war\\" between Apple and Google.      One possible scenario under consideration could be a truce involving disputes over basic features and functions in Google's Android mobile software, one source said. But it was unclear whether Page and Cook were discussing a broad settlement of the various disputes between the two companies, most of which involve the burgeoning mobile computing area, or are focused on a more limited set of issues.      Competition between Google and Apple has heated up in recent years with the shift from PCs to mobile devices. Google's Android software, which Apple's late founder Steve Jobs denounced as a \\"stolen product,\\" has become the world's No.1 smartphone operating system. The popularity of the software has been in tandem with patent infringement lawsuits involving various hardware vendors who use it, including Samsung and HTC.      The latest complaint was filed by Motorola Mobility, now a unit of Google, against Apple at the U.S. International Trade Commission claiming some features of Apple's devices infringe on its patents. A previous lawsuit between the two in a Chicago court was thrown out by a federal judge, who said neither side could prove damages.      Apple in recent months has moved to lessen its reliance on Google's products. Apple recently unveiled its own mobile mapping software, replacing the Google product used in the iPhone, and said it would no longer offer Google's YouTube as a pre-loaded app in future versions of its iPhone.      Cook took the helm at Apple a year ago, and Page stepped into the top job at Google a few months before that.      The conversation between Page and Cook last week did not result in any formal agreement, but the two executives agreed to continue talking, according to one source.      Google's Larry Page, who sat out several public speaking engagements earlier this summer because of an unspecified medical condition affecting his voice, has continued to run Google's business.      Apple and Google declined to comment on any discussions.      (Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic and Poornima Gupta with additional reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Jonathan Weber, Martin Howell and Leslie Gevirtz) ||||| CNET confirms that Google CEO Larry Page and Apple CEO Tim Cook have held at least one conversation and plan to talk again in bid to settle lingering patent disputes.      Maybe Google got the hint after watching what happened to Samsung last week, but CNET has confirmed that the CEOs of Apple and Google have held at least one conversation in a bid to resolve the myriad intellectual property and patent disputes between the companies.      Apple's CEO Tim Cook and Google's Larry Page talked before last week's verdict in the Samsung-Apple trial and plan to talk in a few weeks, according to a person familiar with dealings.      The news of the conversations between the two CEOs was first reported by Reuters.      Reuters also reported that talks are also taking place between the companies at a lower echelon. Google declined comment. We've reached out to Apple and will update the post when we hear back.      But you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind's blowing. After its one-sided court victory last week over Samsung in a landmark copy infringement lawsuit, Apple has added incentive to press its legal claims against other computer makers who use Google's Android operating system.      When the Samsung decision got announced last Friday afternoon, Google immediately attempted to distance itself from the case, declaring that most of the patents in question \\"don't relate to the core Android operating system.\\"      Given the lopsided nature of Samsung's legal defeat, Google may believe the prospects of an Apple lawsuit are higher than they were just a week ago.      \\"Theoretically they could hold Google responsible for all of the harm that Android allegedly causes to Apple, but it's a much more difficult story to tell to a judge and, especially, a jury,\\" noted Florian Mueller, a legal analyst who writes a widely-read blog about intellectual property and patent law. \\"It's also more difficult to get an injunction against someone who doesn't compete with you directly, only indirectly.\\"      Meanwhile, the repercussions of Apple-Samsung are still reverberating. Earlier this week, the Korea Times reported that Samsung and several U.S. carriers were seeking to find ways to modify their designs to avoid further legal entanglements with Apple. Of more direct concern to Apple, the paper also reported considering warming up to Microsoft and reducing its reliance upon Google's Android platform.\\"      The companies are already involved in litigation through Google's ownership of Motorola Mobility. A couple of weeks back, Motorola Mobility filed another lawsuit against Apple in a move to block the company from importing the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and certain Macs. This was part of a longer back-and-forth patent fight that's raged for years between Apple and Motorola.      At the same time, the companies were able to reach a tentative deal a few days ago to license out certain Motorola patents to Apple. |||||Summary:","output":"Google CEO Larry Page and Apple CEO Tim Cook have had behind-the-scenes talks about intellectual property issues, including mobile patent disputes.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.

The Verve were an English rock band formed in Wigan in 1990 by lead vocalist Richard Ashcroft, guitarist Nick McCabe, bass guitarist Simon Jones and drummer Peter Salisbury. Guitarist and keyboard player Simon Tong later became a member. Beginning with a psychedelic sound with their debut LP The band's physical and mental turmoil continued into the chaotic recording sessions of the band's second album, 1995's A Northern Soul, produced by Owen Morris. The band departed from the experimental psychedelic sounds of A Storm in Heaven and focused more on conventional alternative rock, with Ashcroft's vocals taking a more prominent role in the songs, although reminiscent of some of the early work. Around this period, Oasis guitarist and friend of Ashcroft, Noel Gallagher, dedicated the song \\"Cast No Shadow\\" on the album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? to Ashcroft, and Ashcroft returned the gesture by dedicating the song \\"A Northern Soul\\" to Noel.  The band released the album's first single \\"This Is Music\\" in May, and it reached No. 35, their first single to reach the Top 40. It was followed by \\"On Your Own\\" in June which performed even better, reaching No. 28. This single was particularly new for the Verve as it was a soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single \\"History\\", which reached No. 24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: \\"I knew that I had to do it earlier on, but I just wouldn't face it. Once you're not happy in anything, there's no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn't do anything about it.

After the financial crisis of 2007–08, it was known in 2008–2009 that two Portuguese banks (Banco Português de Negócios (BPN) and Banco Privado Português (BPP)) had been accumulating losses for years due to bad investments, embezzlement and accounting fraud. The case of BPN was particularly serious because of its size, market share, and the political implications - Portugal's then current President, Cavaco Silva, and some of his political allies, maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO, who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes. In the grounds of avoiding a potentially serious financial crisis in the Portuguese economy, the Portuguese government decided to give them a bailout, eventually at a future loss to taxpayers and to the Portuguese people in general. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why was the case of BPN more serious?","output":"The case of Banco Português de Negócios (BPN) was more serious for a few reasons: 1. Size and market share: BPN was a larger bank with a significant market share in Portugal. Its collapse could have had a more pronounced impact on the overall stability of the Portuguese banking system and financial markets. A failure of BPN could potentially trigger a loss in confidence among the public and other financial institutions, leading to a larger systemic crisis. 2. Political implications: The fact that Portugal's then-current President, Cavaco Silva, and some of his political allies maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO made the situation more delicate. This connection raised questions about the integrity of the political establishment and its potential role in the bank's failure or in the decision-making process of granting a bailout. 3. The nature of the crimes: The CEO of BPN was charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes, which made the case even more severe. This suggests that the bank's issues were not only due to bad investments but also due to criminal activities, which could have potentially led to further investigations and legal actions against the bank and its leadership, extending the consequences beyond the financial aspect. In summary, the case of BPN was more serious due to its size and market share, the political implications, and the nature of the crimes associated with its failure. These factors made the potential consequences of BPN's collapse more significant than those of Banco Privado Português (BPP) and further justified the government's decision to provide a bailout to prevent a potentially more severe financial crisis in Portugal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.  Now, I have a new situation: Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well. As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia.  Answer this question please: Which friend had an excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH)?

This is because hypercalcaemia, which Danny suffers from, is often caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both of which facilitate calcium absorption.

With a budget of 329 million, LSC provides civil legal assistance to low-income people in every county in America, Kleiman said. NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt.

Answer: Answer:","output":"The product review in question is not positive. The reasons for this are outlined in two parts: Firstly, the title \\"Disappointed!!\\" already indicates a negative sentiment. The title of a review often summarizes the sentiment of the reviewer and in this case, expressing disappointment typically suggests an unfulfilled expectation or a negative experience with the product. Secondly, the content of the review provides specific reasons for the user's disappointment. The reviewer expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the product didn't come with a handle even though the picture showed it did. This suggests that the product did not meet the customer's expectations based on the information provided during the purchase process. Misrepresentation of a product in its description or image can lead to a breach of trust and disappointment, which are displayed in this review. The customer, while indicating that the product was \\"made good\\", firmly asserts that it doesn't match what was shown in the picture. Although this is a partial positive comment indicating that the quality or craftsmanship may be acceptable, it does not negate the overall negative sentiment. In summary, while there is an element of positivity regarding the quality of the product, the overall tone and message of the review is negative. This is due to the product not matching its representation and the resulting disappointment, which was significant enough to elicit this review.

Question: Information:  - Music notation or musical notation is any system used to visually represent aurally perceived music played with instruments or sung by the human voice through the use of written, printed, or otherwise-produced symbols, including ancient symbols or modern musical symbols and including ancient symbols cut into stone, made in clay tablets or made using a pen on papyrus, parchment or manuscript paper; printed using a printing press (ca. 1400s), a computer printer (ca. 1980s) or other printing or modern copying technology. Types and methods of notation have varied between cultures and throughout history, and much information about ancient music notation is fragmentary. Even in the same time period, such as in the 2010s, different styles of music and different cultures use different music notation methods; for example, for professional classical music performers, sheet music using staves and note heads is the most common way of notating music, but for professional country music session musicians, the Nashville Number System is the main method.  - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - A string quartet is a musical ensemble of four string players  two violin players, a viola player and a cellist  or a piece written to be performed by such a group. The string quartet is one of the most prominent chamber ensembles in classical music, with most major composers, from the mid to late 18th century onwards, writing string quartets.  - MILAN (\\"milan(e)\\" is French for kite) is a European anti-tank guided missile. Design of the MILAN started in 1962, it was ready for trials in 1971, and was accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire guided SACLOS (semi-automatic command to line-of-sight) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit has to be aimed at the target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability.  - Giulietta e Romeo is a dramma per musica by composer Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli with an Italian libretto by Giuseppe Maria Foppa after the 1530 novella of the same name by Luigi da Porto . The opera premiered at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 30 January 1796 . Giulietta e Romeo was composed by Zingarelli in only eight days and it is considered by many scholars to be his best work . The opera remained a part of the Italian repertory well into the nineteenth century and the role of Romeo was a favourite vehicle for Maria Malibran until c 1830 .  - Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms and/or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs  printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages  the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \\"play back\\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments.  - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet.  - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art.  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'giulietta e romeo ' with the relationship of 'set in period'.

To answer the question \\"what can high temperatures cause?\\" more comprehensively, let's analyze each of the provided options in relation to the two facts given: 1. Symptoms: Although high temperatures can induce certain symptoms such as sweating or dehydration, this option is not directly related to the given facts about combustion and dioxin production. 2. Dioxins: As stated in Fact 2, dioxins are byproducts of combustion processes. Given that high temperatures can cause an object to combust (Fact 1), it is logical to conclude that high temperatures can result in the production of dioxins. 3. Rise: This option is vague, but if it refers to a rise in temperature, then it could be indirectly related to the facts provided. High temperatures leading to combustion can cause a localized spike in temperature, leading to a rise in the given area. However, this is not a direct consequence of high temperatures as specified in the facts. 4. Pollution: Dioxins, being byproducts of combustion, are known to be harmful to both human health and the environment. Given that high temperatures lead to combustion and the subsequent production of dioxins, it is reasonable to conclude that high temperatures can cause pollution. 5. Anemia: The term anemia refers to a medical condition with a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. While high temperatures could potentially exacerbate anemia symptoms, such as fatigue, there is no direct correlation to the facts provided on combustion and dioxins. 6. Allergies: Allergies are immune system responses to specific substances or environmental factors. High temperatures can contribute to certain allergic reactions, such as those involving pollen, but this option is not directly tied to the facts provided about combustion and dioxin production. 7. Disease: Diseases are typically caused by pathogenic organisms or various other factors. While high temperatures can play a role in disease transmission or the exacerbation of certain symptoms, the given facts on combustion and dioxins do not directly link high temperatures to disease. 8. Sweating: Sweating is a natural response to high temperatures as the body attempts to regulate its internal temperature. While this option is relevant to high temperatures, it is not directly linked to the facts provided on combustion and dioxin production. In conclusion, given the two facts provided, high temperatures can cause the production of dioxins (option 2) and subsequently lead to pollution (option 4).

Alex is a sculptor and single mother of one daughter; Jane is a newly divorced music teacher unable to have children; while Sukie has six daughters and works as a columnist for the Eastwick Word, the local newspaper. The three friends all have lost their husbands (Alex's died, Jane's divorced her, and Sukie's abandoned her). Unaware that they are witches, the women unwittingly form a coven where they have weekly get-togethers and share their fantasies about ideal men. A mysterious man (Jack Nicholson) arrives in town and stirs up trouble by buying the town's landmark property: the Lennox Mansion. The arrival of this enigmatic stranger fascinates the townsfolk, all except for Felicia Alden (Veronica Cartwright), the devoutly religious wife of newspaper editor Clyde Alden (Richard Jenkins), Sukie's boss. Felicia senses that this man (whose name is easily forgotten) is up to no good. One night, at one of Jane's music recitals, the strange man appears and makes a spectacle of himself, which leads to more gossip. After the recital, Jane receives a bouquet of flowers with the initial D written on it. This sparks Sukie's memory, finally revealing the man's name as Daryl Van Horne. However, as chaos over the name spreads through the crowd, Sukie's bead necklace inexplicably breaks and falls to the floor, causing Felicia (who had mocked Daryl's name) to trip down a large staircase and break her leg. The following day, Daryl sets out to seduce Alex. As he converses with her, he says insensitive, disgusting, and rude things every time he speaks. Appalled, she tells him off, refuses his amorous advances, and begins to walk out. Before she opens the door, he speaks to her, manipulating her emotions until she eventually agrees.

As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.  Paragraph: Year 2022 would be an interesting year when three comets would get scientists' attention - Comet A, Comet B, and Comet C. Comet A and C are very faint, but Comet B is very bright.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Scientist Florence Wambugu works with farmers in Kenya, a country in East Africa. She helps them grow bigger and better crops. Wambugu is especially interested in finding simple ways to produce more food. In the past ten years, Wambugu has spent much of her time studying sweet potatoes, which are an important food in her part of Kenya. A virus   kept attacking the plants. It stopped the sweet potatoes from growing well. Because of the virus, some farmers lost three quarters of their crops. Wambugu went to war against the virus. Her research for a way to save the sweet potatoes led to a lab in St. Louis, Missouri. The lab mainly works on genes  , the chemical \\"computer programs\\" found in the cells of living things. Genes tell a plant to produce pink flowers or an animal to grow black hair. Now scientists have found ways to move genes from one living thing to another. That process is called genetic engineering. Wambugu spent three years in the lab. As a result, she created a sweet potato plant that could fight off the virus. Wambugu tested her research in Kenya, and her plants produced wonderful sweet potatoes. That's just the beginning, Wambugu believes. Genetically modified   foods, she thinks, could help farmers in poor countries grow badly needed crops, thus, fewer people will go hungry.

Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom.

This article: English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create. Rusko said \\"She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose heartbeat was recorded while they were in the studio, according to Rusko?, what is it ?","output":"The name of the person whose heartbeat was recorded while they were in the studio, according to Rusko, is Ikyhd."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The work was well done, for the amount paid. Color matched and dents were not to be seen. However, I did notice a few scratches on my driver side fender area that I know were not there before I dropped it off. The estimated time when I dropped it off was 2 days at latest, but in actuality it was 6 days later before I was able to pick it up!   In addition, as I picked my car up, no one really took the time to let me know about the work they did nor did they give a brief overview. Instead, after paying inside, a worker who did not really speak English, drove my car to the front and basically handed me my keys and nodded.

Answer: The international release of the single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart . Question: what is the song heart shaped box about Answer:","output":"\\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, released in 1993 as the lead single from their third and final studio album, \\"In Utero.\\" The song was written by the band's frontman, Kurt Cobain, who also contributed to the music and lyrics. While the international release of the single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart, the meaning and interpretation of the song have been a subject of much debate and speculation among fans and music critics alike. Kurt Cobain never explicitly stated the meaning behind \\"Heart-Shaped Box,\\" which has left fans exploring a variety of interpretations for the song. Some of the most common theories about the meaning of \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" include: 1. Love and Relationships: Many people believe that the song is about the complexities of love and relationships, with the heart being a prevalent symbol of love. The \\"heart-shaped box\\" could represent the vulnerability and emotional turmoil of being in love, with the box acting as a metaphor for the fragility and complexity of human emotions. 2. Drug Addiction: Another interpretation of \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" relates to Cobain's struggles with drug addiction, specifically heroin. The lyrics \\"I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\\" might refer to the self-destructive nature of addiction and the desire to save someone you love from the harmful effects of substance abuse. 3. Cobain's Relationship with Courtney Love: Some fans have speculated that \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" was written about Cobain's relationship with his wife, Courtney Love, and the difficulties they faced as a couple. It is said that Love had given Cobain a heart-shaped box as a present, which could have inspired the song's title and imagery. The lyrics of the song could be interpreted as Cobain's reflection on their tumultuous relationship. 4. Exploring the Dark Side of Human Nature: Another possible interpretation of the song is that it explores the darker side of human nature, including aspects such as depression, addiction, and unhealthy relationships. The imagery in the lyrics and the accompanying music video directed by Anton Corbijn contain elements of surrealism, and the juxtaposition of beautiful and grotesque images can leave a lasting impression on the listener. 5. Confronting Mortality and Suffering: The song could be interpreted as a reflection on the inevitability of suffering and death. The line \\"I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks\\" might suggest a sense of entrapment and existential angst, while the references to cancer and the blackened emotional state could represent the pain and fear that come with facing one's mortality. In conclusion, \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is a complex and multi-layered song that can be interpreted in various ways. The song may be about love and relationships, drug addiction, Cobain's relationship with Courtney Love, the dark side of human nature, confronting mortality and suffering, or a combination of these themes. While its meaning remains open to interpretation, \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" stands as a powerful and evocative example of Nirvana's masterful songwriting and Cobain's poignant lyrical style."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first stamp marking the opening of the White Olympics was issued   on January 25th, 1932 in the United states to celebrate the 3rd White Olympics. From then on, issuing stamps during the White Olympics became a tradition. To observe the 4th Winter Olympic Games, a group of stamps were published in Germany in November, 1935. The five rings of the Olympics were printed on the front of the sportswear. It was the first time that the symbol appeared on stamps of the Winter Olympics. In the 1950s, the stamps of this kind became more color1ful. When the White Olympics came, the host countries as well as the non-host countries published stamps to mark those Games. China also published four stamps in February, 1980, when the Chinese sportsmen began to march into the area of the Winter Olympics. Japan is the only Asian country that has ever held the White Olympics. Altogether 14,500 million stamps were sold to raise funds for the sports meet.

Now, let's analyze each part step-by step: Step 1: Analyze the advantage observed In the premise, the nature of the advantage is not specified. In the hypothesis, the advantage is specifically described as seeing better weapons. Since the premise does not provide any specific information about the advantage, we cannot confirm that it refers to the better weapons mentioned in the hypothesis.  Step 2: Analyze their actions upon seeing the advantage In the premise, the action is that they rushed in after observing the advantage. In the hypothesis, the action is that they ran in after seeing better weapons. Rushing in and running in are similar actions, so this part of the hypothesis aligns with the premise. Conclusion: Although the actions align between the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise, because the nature of the advantage is not specified in the premise. It is possible that the advantage observed is related to better weapons, but it could also refer to a different advantage entirely.

In addition to this, Maine Coons are a large and beautiful breed that are expensive to purchase. While it's rare, people do steal Maine Coons they see outdoors. For your cat's safety, keep it as an indoor cat only. A clean litter box is important to any cat. Maine Coons in particular, due to their long hair, require a clean litter box. Debris from litter can easily get caught in their fur, so clean your litter box daily.  Each day, scoop any feces or clumps of urine out of the litter box and add a small amount of fresh litter.  Swap the litter out completely once every two to three weeks. When you do so, make sure to scrub out the inside of the box and let it dry before replacing the litter. Maine Coons are one of the most social cat breeds. They do not do well without daily attention. Make sure to give your Maine Coon plenty of love to keep it happy.  Maine Coons may follow you around. You can pet them on occasion, but if you're busy they're generally happy to observe you. It's a good idea to pet them and snuggle at the end of the day, when you have time. In addition to keeping your cat active, playing can help you bond with your Maine Coon. Maine Coons, due to their friendly demeanor, generally do well with young children. However, interaction should be supervised. Maine Coons are tolerant of children, as long as kids are taught to handle them gently.  Encourage your kids to treat your cat with respect. Let them know they should only handle your cat when it comes to them and should not attempt to grab or restrain a Maine Coon. Young children may sometimes try to dress up an animal, or place it in a toy like a toy high chair or stroller. Maine Coons are more tolerant of this behavior than many house cats, but you should still keep an eye on your kids when they play with your Maine Coon. Make sure the cat does not seem aggressive or frightened during play.

Answer:","output":"No, the answer \\"more abundant\\" does not accurately represent a specific protein found within a virus's phospholipid envelope. Instead, a more appropriate answer to this question would be \\"Matrix protein (M protein)\\" or \\"Envelope protein (E protein).\\" These proteins have specific biological functions and are present in the phospholipid envelope of some enveloped viruses. Matrix proteins (M proteins) are structural proteins found in the phospholipid envelope of viruses such as Influenza virus and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acting as connectors between virus's envelope and the nucleocapsid core. M proteins provide structural support and assist in the assembly of new virions. Envelope proteins (E proteins) are also integral components of a virus's phospholipid envelope, primarily involved in host-cell recognition and fusion. This protein plays a crucial role in the early stages of viral infection by facilitating the entry of the virus into the host cell. An example of such envelope proteins can be found in the respiratory syncytial virus and Dengue virus. It is essential to note that not all viruses have a phospholipid envelope; some viruses are non-enveloped and consist of only a protein capsid surrounding their genetic material."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: You make decisions, year after year, never lasting for more than a few days ending up lost and in the same place you started. Allow me to suggest some tips that may help you stick to your decisions creating long- lasting positive change in your life. Telling other people about your plan can help in many ways. First, it is always easier to stick to a decision when you have other people supporting you. Your friends are less likely to tempt you with whatever it is you are trying to control if they know that you made a decision about it. Telling other people about your decision is also helpful in that it keeps us to the pressure on you to try and stick to you plan of action. Choose a measurable and specific decision. Instead of deciding to \\"look better\\" or \\"have a better relationship with so and so\\", choose a more definable decision. Deciding to \\"eat a vegetable every day\\" or \\"go out for coffee once a week with John\\" is much easier to track and assess than a general decision to \\"be a better person\\". Build a reward system. Connected to the last tip of choosing a measurable and specific decision is that when you do accomplish this specific behavior you decided to do, give yourself small rewards along the process. For example, for every week of healthy eating treat yourself with something special. Creative visual aids. A colleague of mine decided one year for his New Year's decision to be more frugal. He decided to try and save money by lowering his monthly bills. So he posted a copy of his highest electric bill by his heater so that every time he wanted to raise the temperature he would see the high electric bill reminding him to be more cautious about his energy consumption. Question: Why does the writer advise telling your plan to other people? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Because they will offer you support and pressure.\\"?","output":"Yes, the writer advises telling your plan to other people because they will offer you support and pressure. The support from your friends helps you avoid temptation, and the pressure to stick to your plan ensures you remain committed to the decision, ultimately leading to long-lasting, positive change in your life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will the centripetal force on the bucket increase or decrease as Adam spins it faster? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's consider the steps and the science behind the trick. Step 1: Understand the situation Adam is spinning a bucket of water in a circle, without any water spilling out.  Step 2: Identify the forces involved In this case, the main force to consider is centripetal force, which acts towards the center of the rotation and keeps the bucket and water in circular motion. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between speed and centripetal force Centripetal force is given by the formula: F_c = mv^2/r, where m is the mass of the object (the bucket and water), v is the velocity (or speed) of the object, and r is the radius of the circle. Step 4: Determine the effect of increasing the speed If Adam spins the bucket faster, the velocity (v) in the equation increases. According to the formula, as the velocity increases, the centripetal force also increases, since the two variables are directly proportional.

Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him.

Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E.

White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the location that had a high discharge of 111 cubic feet per second?  White Deer Hole Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale mountain region, entirely in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. South and North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain are composed of sedimentary Ordovician rock, while the valley rock is Silurian, with a small Devonian region closer to the river, in the north. The watershed has no deposits of coal, nor natural gas or oil fields. The creek is in a narrow mountain valley with steep slopes in its upper reaches. In its middle and lower reaches it has steep mountain slopes to the south, and a wide valley with rolling hills and gentle slopes to the north. The channel pattern is transitional, with a trellised drainage pattern.From 1961 to 1995, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) operated one stream gauge on White Deer Hole Creek at the Gap Road bridge (upstream of Elimsport), for the uppermost 18.2 square miles (47 km2) of the watershed. The highest yearly peak discharge measured at this site was 4,200 cubic feet (120 m3) per second and the highest yearly peak gauge height was 11.83 feet (3.61 m), both on June 22, 1972, during Hurricane Agnes. The lowest yearly peak discharge in this time period was 135 cubic feet (3.8 m3) per second and the lowest yearly peak gauge height was 4.29 feet (1.31 m), both on November 26, 1986. The USGS also measured discharge at Allenwood, very near the creek's mouth, as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975. The average discharge was 70.4 cubic feet (1.99 m3) per second, and ranged from a high of 111 cubic feet (3.1 m3) per second to a low of 33 cubic feet (0.93 m3) per second.

Based on the sentence \\"People milling about after a show.\\", is the sentence \\"People are milling about after a show.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"People are milling about after a show.\\" is a true sentence as it conveys the same meaning as the original sentence, \\"People milling about after a show.\\" Both sentences convey that a group of people are moving around or mingling in a somewhat aimless or relaxed manner after a show or event has taken place. The original sentence is an example of a reduced form, where the verb 'to be' has been omitted, a common occurrence in informal settings and casual conversation. In this case, the verb 'to be' is understood rather than stated explicitly. The sentence still retains its meaning and is generally understood by English speakers without any confusion. By adding \\"are\\" to the original sentence, it becomes a complete sentence with a subject (\\"People\\") and a verb (\\"are milling about\\") while retaining the same meaning. This makes it a true sentence since it reflects an accurate and grammatically-structured representation of the original statement. In summary, both sentences – \\"People milling about after a show\\" and \\"People are milling about after a show\\" – convey the same event and meaning, where people engage in aimless or relaxed movements and interactions following a show. Although the original sentence omits the verb 'to be,' this does not impede the intended meaning, and the addition of 'to be' in the form of \\"are\\" in the second sentence further clarifies the statement and is therefore considered a true sentence."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Passage:During the Napoleonic wars, Île de France became a base from which the French navy, including squadrons under Rear Admiral Linois or Commodore Jacques Hamelin, and corsairs such as Robert Surcouf, organised raids on British merchant ships. The raids (see Battle of Pulo Aura and Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811) continued until 1810 when the British sent a strong expedition to capture the island. The first British attempt, in August 1810, to attack Grand Port resulted in a French victory, one celebrated on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. A subsequent and much larger attack launched in December of the same year from Rodrigues, which had been captured a year earlier, was successful. The British landed in large numbers in the north of the island and rapidly overpowered the French, who capitulated (see Invasion of Isle de France). In the Treaty of Paris (1814), the French ceded Île de France together with its territories including Rodrigues and Seychelles to Great Britain. The island then reverted to its former name, 'Mauritius'.","output":"Task: Determine whether information from more than one term in the context passage is needed to answer the question.

He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the person who tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six?

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Great white sharks! Just hearing that name _ . In reality, these big fish have more to fear from us than we do from them. For many years, people killed countless great white sharks in the waters around the United States. But thanks to conservation   efforts, great whites are making a comeback in the U.S. Two recent studies show that the population of these sharks is rising along the east and west coast. Why is the growing population of a killer fish something to celebrate? \\"When you fish too many of them, you start to lose balance in the environment,\\" says shark researcher Tobey Curtis. As the biggest killer, sharks help keep the populations of fish, seals, and other creatures they eat from growing too large. In spite of their importance, great white sharks had long been hunted for their meat and their fins  . Then, in 1997, the U.S. government passed a law that didn't allow the hunting of great whites. Afterwards, the numbers of these sharks in the U.S. waters started to increase. The law wasn't the only thing that has helped great whites. Conservationists have also played a part in the sharks' comeback. The research group OCEARCH is using a method called tagging   to help change people's attitudes about great white. They let the public follow each shark as it travels the world's oceans. OCEARCH also gives each tagged shark a name to help people form a closer connection with the big fish. The group's most well-known shark is named Katharine. She was tagged last year near Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Since then, thousands of people have tracked Katharine's movements on Twitter and the OCEARCH website. This helps people see sharks in a new way. Chris Fischer, the founder of OCEARCH believes learning to appreciate great whites will encourage people to do more to protect them. Question: The main purpose of the passage is to   _  . Options: A: introduce an experiment result B: make an advertisement for OCEARCH C: remind us that big killers are dying out D: inform us that great whites are making a comeback Answer:","output":"D: Inform us that great white sharks are making a comeback.  The article primarily discusses the growing population of great white sharks, a consequence of various conservation efforts put in place to protect them. It outlines the past scenario where people used to hunt the shark species extensively for their meat and fins, leading to a significant decrease in their population. However, due to laws passed in 1997 by the U.S government banning the hunting of great white sharks, their numbers have started to rebound. Additionally, the article also discusses the role of conservationists, particularly research group OCEARCH, in nurturing a healthy perception towards these sharks amongst the public. Through a method called 'tagging', they allow the public to track the sharks' movements and promote greater understanding of their nature and behavior. By personifying these sharks and giving them names, they enable the public to create a personal connection with these creatures, thereby altering attitudes towards them and encouraging further conservation efforts. Thus, while part of the text discusses the role of OCEARCH, it does not serve as an advertisement for them. The information about shark overfishing is presented as context to the primary message about the 'comeback of the great white sharks'. The purpose of the article is not to introduce an experiment result, nor to remind us that 'big killers' (as in apex predators) are dying out. Conversely, it informs us they are experiencing a resurgence due to successful conservation efforts."},{"instruction":"Title: Keep moving... nothing to see here.... Review: OK.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - Portland Bill is a narrow promontory (or bill) at the southern end of the Isle of Portland, and the southernmost point of Dorset, England. One of Portland's most popular destinations, the popular attraction Portland Bill Lighthouse is found in the area. The surrounding coast of Portland, namely Portland Bill and Chesil Beach, have been notorious for the many vessels that became shipwrecked in the area over the centuries. The dangerous coastline, which features shallow reefs and the Shambles sandbank, was proven more hazardous due to the strong tidal race known as the Portland Race.  - Stop motion (hyphenated stop-motion when used as an adjective) is an animation technique that physically manipulates an object so that it appears to move on its own. The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a fast sequence. Dolls with movable joints or clay figures are often used in stop motion for their ease of repositioning. Stop motion animation using plasticine is called clay animation or \\"clay-mation\\". Not all stop motion requires figures or models; many stop motion films can involve using humans, household appliances and other things for comedic effect. Stop motion using objects is sometimes referred to as object animation.  - Norman Rossington (24 December 1928  21 May 1999) was an English actor best remembered for his roles in \\"The Army Game\\", the \\"Carry On\\" films and the Beatles' film \\"A Hard Day's Night\\".  - The Adventures of Portland Bill was a British stop motion animated children 's television series made in 1983 . It was set in a fictional lighthouse on the Guillemot Rock , just off the coast from the fictional village of McGuillycuddy . Norman Rossington provided the voice of all the characters , with Portland Bill acting as the narrator of each episode .  - Object animation is a form of stop motion animation that involves the animated movements of any non-drawn objects such as toys, blocks, dolls, etc. which are not fully malleable, such as clay or wax, and not designed to look like a recognizable human or animal character.  - Children's television series are television programs designed for and marketed to children, normally broadcast programming scheduled for broadcast during the morning and afternoon when children are awake. They can sometimes run during the early evening, allowing younger children to watch them after school. The purpose of the shows is mainly to entertain and sometimes to educate.  - Chesil Beach , sometimes called Chesil Bank, in Dorset, southern England is one of three major shingle structures in Britain. Its toponym is derived from the Old English \\"ceosel\\" or \\"cisel\\", meaning \\"gravel\\" or \\"shingle\\".  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - Clay animation or claymation is one of many forms of stop motion animation. Each animated piece, either character or background, is \\"deformable\\"made of a malleable substance, usually Plasticine clay.  - The Army Game is a British sitcom that broadcast on ITV from 1957 to 1961. Made in black-and-white, it is about National Service conscription to the post-war British Army. It was created by Sid Colin. Many stars, including Charles Hawtrey, William Hartnell, Bernard Bresslaw, Alfie Bass and Dick Emery became household names, and appeared in the \\"Carry On\\" films, which began with \\"Carry On Sergeant\\", virtually a spin-off. It was made for the ITV network by Granada Television.    What object entity has the relation of 'original network' with the subject 'the adventures of portland bill'?

Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6]  Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7]  With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7]  Now, I have a new situation: The hospital in Y city had a good disposal site in which they disposed of Biomedical wastes, but the hospital in the neighboring city X had big problems, because the biomedical waste contaminated the ground water and affected the population.

NIH-supported innovations also influence improvements in health that can bolster the economy, improve productivity, and reduce illness and disability at home and across the globe. But, budget cuts and inadequate funding for NIH in the past decade have put both medical innovation and our next generation of researchers at risk. Today, too many of our talented young scientists are deciding to do something else, or are leaving the country to pursue their research. Simply put, scientific and medical innovation depends on our ability to foster, support and invest in these new researchers. That is why I have worked across party lines with Senator Susan Collins of Maine and introduced the Next Generation (NextGen) Researchers Act. Our act builds opportunities for new researchers, helps address the debt burden that young scientists face today, and invests in the future of research, science, and innovation. This commonsense proposal would create the \\"Next Generation Researchers Initiative\\" within the NIH Office of the Director to coordinate   all current and new NIH policies.

Questions: What can planning vacation lead to between a couple when they disagree? Options: - relaxation - enjoying - arguments - going abroad - spending money The answer is:","output":"arguments. When a couple is planning a vacation and they disagree on certain aspects, it can lead to arguments between them. These disagreements may stem from various factors such as differences in preferences, budget constraints, or the choice of destination. It is crucial for couples to have open communication and address any conflicts to ensure a positive vacation planning experience. Although the other options listed could be outcomes of a vacation, they do not directly address the question of what can happen between a couple when they disagree while planning. To briefly touch upon the other options: - Relaxation: This is a positive outcome that vacations often provide, but it is not the result of a disagreement during the planning process. - Enjoying: Similar to relaxation, enjoying a vacation is a possible outcome of a successful trip but does not specifically answer the question about disagreements during the planning stage. - Going abroad: This is an example of a type of vacation, which does not directly address the issue of disagreements arising during the planning process. - Spending money: While spending money is an inevitable part of any vacation, it does not speak to the potential disagreements that may occur between a couple while planning their trip. Thus, the most relevant and accurate answer to the question, \\"What can planning a vacation lead to between a couple when they disagree?\\" is \\"arguments,\\" as it specifically identifies a potential consequence caused by disagreements during the planning process."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What were the names of the two songs Saint-Saëns wrote during his career?  From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies, writing more than 140. He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder. Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: \\"you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable.\\" Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including \\"Le lever du soleil sur le Nil\\" (\\"Sunrise over the Nile\\", 1898) and \\"Hymne à la paix\\" (\\"Hymn to Peace\\", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein. He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, \\"One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence, of oratorio.\\" He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach...

Question: how are tropical storms and hurricanes named I found the following answer on Google: Tropical cyclones strengthen when water evaporated from the ocean is released as the saturated air rises, resulting in condensation of water vapor contained in the moist air. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","output":"No, the answer you provided explains how tropical cyclones form, not how they are named. To answer your question about how tropical storms and hurricanes are named: 1. Identify the responsible organization: Hurricane and tropical storm names are determined by regional meteorological organizations. For example, in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific regions, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is responsible for naming these storms. 2. Understand the naming system: Names are chosen and maintained in lists that are used in rotation. Each list typically consists of 21 names, alternating between male and female names, and are reused every six years. The names are typically easy to pronounce, so they can be clearly communicated to the public. 3. Know the criteria for naming storms: When a tropical cyclone forms, it is given a name once it reaches tropical storm strength, which is defined by sustained winds of at least 39 miles per hour (63 kilometers per hour). If a tropical storm strengthens further and reaches hurricane status (sustained winds of 74 miles per hour or 119 kilometers per hour), it retains its name. 4. Account for retired names: If a hurricane causes significant damage or results in a high number of casualties, its name may be retired from the list and replaced with a different name at the discretion of the WMO. So, in conclusion, the process of naming hurricanes and tropical storms involves a well-organized system maintained by responsible organizations like the WMO, utilizing predetermined lists of alternating names, and accounting for retired names when necessary."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Article: Centuries ago, man discovered that removing moisture from food helps to store it, and that the easiest way to do this is to expose the food to sun and wind. In this way the North American Indians produce pemmican(dried meat ground into powder and made into cakes), the Scandinavians make stockfish and the Arabs dried dates. All foods include water--cabbage and other leaf vegetables contains as much as 93% water, potatoes and other root vegetables 80%, lean meat 75% and fish, anything from 80% to 60%, depending on how fatty it is. If this water is removed, the activity of the bacteria which cause food to go bad is checked. Fruit is sun-dried in Asia Minor, Greece, Spain and other Mediterranean countries, and also in California, South Africa and Australia. Various methods are used, but in general, the fruit is spread out on trays in drying yards in the hot sun. Nowadays most foods are dried mechanically. The method of such dehydration is to put food in chambers through which hot air is blown at temperatures of about 110degC at entry to about 43degC at exit. This is the usual method for drying such things as vegetables, minced meat, and fish. Dried foods take up less room and weigh less than the same food packed in cans or frozen, and they do not need to be stored in special conditions. For these reasons they are invaluable to the climbers, explorers and soldiers in battle, who have little storage space. They are also popular with housewives because it takes so little time to cook them. Usually it is just a case of replacing the dried-out moisture with boiling water. Question: Bacteria which cause food to go bad  _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"have their activity greatly reduced by drying\\"?

It is available as either for download or in streaming, as opposed to first airing on broadcast or cable television. The format can be used as a preview, a promotion, as part of a collection of shorts, or a commercial. A webisode may or may not have been broadcast on TV. What defines it is its online distribution on the web, or through video-sharing web sites such as Vimeo or YouTube. While there is no set standard for length, most webisodes are relatively short, ranging from 315 minutes in length. It is a single web episode, but collectively is part of a web series, a form called web television that characteristically features a dramatic, serial storyline, where the primary method of viewership is streaming online over the Internet. The term \\"webisode\\" (a portmanteau formed from the words 'web' and 'episode') was first introduced in the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2009.  - Adult Swim is a programming block of the American cable network Cartoon Network that operates at night from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., Eastern and Pacific Time.

Context: The context in which the review has been placed is crucial. If this review is for a specific app or product, it may be relevant but lacks specificity. In the case of a more general topic, such as a review for an app store or mobile device, the request for an additional sponsored app might make more sense, but it would still be useful for the reviewer to specify which kind of sponsored app they have in mind. 2. Attitude: The tone of the review sounds more like a suggestion or a feature request rather than a review of the existing product or service. There's no indication of whether the reviewer enjoyed or disliked the current offering, which makes it difficult for others to gauge their experience. A valuable review would typically share their opinion on the product or app. 3. Clarity: The message conveyed in the review is quite vague, as it doesn't explain the reasoning behind the request or provide sufficient detail to understand the reviewer's preferences or expectations. An effective review should be clear, concise, and informative, allowing prospective users to grasp the reviewer's sentiment and form their own opinions based on this feedback. With these factors in mind, I would give the review a rating of 2 out of 5. While the suggestion of adding an additional sponsored app could be useful in certain contexts, the review lacks specificity and fails to provide any insight into the reviewer's experience with the existing product or service. Additionally, the lack of clarity in the message prevents it from being a valuable source of information.

Mr Sarkozy said he \\"felt he had the strength to lead the combat at such a tormented moment in our history.\\" No-one doubts his energy, but a number of obstacles must be overcome if he is to fight his way back to the Elysee. Nicolas Sarkozy served as French president from 2007 to 2012, and the country he left behind as he walked from the Elysee was not a happy one. The campaign promises of a land where people could \\"work more to earn more\\" had vanished. Unemployment was back near 10%; the deficit ballooning; and the much-vaunted \\"rupture\\" with the country's uncompetitive past as much a dream as five years previously. Mr Sarkozy could argue - with some justice - that all his plans to rewire the economy had gone down the drain by the 2008 world crisis. But still the man with all the answers turned out to be mainly mouth. Profile: Nicolas Sarkozy Nicolas Sarkozy may want to be the centre-right candidate next April, but sadly for him others have the same idea. There are in fact 10 other runners in the November primary, most of whom have no chance whatsoever and are merely putting down markers for the future. A couple are serious rivals. There is Mr Sarkozy's former Prime Minister Francois Fillon - the man who learned to swallow hard and keep looking impassive through whatever his master's latest putdown. And then there is Alain Juppe - another former prime minister. Right now Mr Juppe is in fact the favourite to win in the November primary - so Mr Sarkozy has a tough and potentially bitter fight ahead. Mr Sarkozy's enemies have always given themselves heart from the thought that if all else fails to bring him down,  justice will. The list of \\"affaires\\" in which the former president is embroiled is long and very complicated. Two stand out. In the first, Mr Sarkozy is accused of knowingly exceeding campaign funding limits in the 2012 election. In the second, he is said to have put pressure on a judge to reveal details on another case in which he was implicated. In both of these affairs, Mr Sarkozy is \\"mis en examen\\" - in other words he is formally the target of a judicial investigation that might well end in a trial. Were that to happen in the weeks to come, his chances would be scuppered. Luckily for Mr Sarkozy, the wheels of French justice grind exceeding slow.  Still - the law is a weak spot. Investigations Nicolas Sarkozy faces Bling is such an annoying, meaningless expression - but Mr Sarkozy undoubtedly suffered from his supposed affinity for a certain kind of lifestyle. He came to be viscerally loathed by a large part of the population - not just as a political figure, but for the kind of man he was. In truth, his lifestyle was not that different from other French leaders'. Carla Bruni was no liability: in fact she is quite admired. Far more problematic was Nicolas Sarkozy's odd personality: impulsive, cocky, braggadocio masking some inner insecurity. Many people didn't like it, and they still don't. If Nicolas Sarkozy ends up against Francois Hollande in 2017 (and it is perfectly possible), it will be an exact re-run of 2012. Could there be a more crying indictment of French politics? And a more potent argument for Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front? This article was about:","output":"This article discusses the obstacles former French President Nicolas Sarkozy must face as he announced his bid to run for the nation's presidency in 2017. As a member of the centre-right Republicans party, Sarkozy must first win the party's primary elections that are set to occur in November. Sarkozy's opponents in the primary race include his former Prime Minister Francois Fillon and another former Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, the latter of whom is currently favored to win. Sarkozy served as France's president between 2007 and 2012 and left office with the country experiencing dissatisfaction under his leadership. Promises of economic prosperity and increased employment went unfulfilled, with unemployment levels nearly 10% and the deficit growing. Sarkozy attributed the failure of his economic plans to the global financial crisis in 2008. If Sarkozy manages to win the primary elections, he still faces several legal challenges related to campaign funding and efforts to influence a judge in another case. Should these investigations lead to a trial, Sarkozy's chances of winning the presidency would be significantly diminished. Additionally, Sarkozy's public image, particularly his perceived lavish lifestyle and overconfidence, has been a liability for him. His personality has been the cause of distaste for many, which might stand in the way of his political ambitions. If Nicolas Sarkozy and current President Francois Hollande are the two main contenders in the 2017 French presidential election, it would be a reiteration of the elections in 2012, highlighting the lack of progress and change within the French political sphere, and potentially boosting interest in the far-right National Front party, led by Marine Le Pen."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive?

Because the company was important and busy, it gave work to more than 50 people. So, these people had jobs that helped them earn money to buy things like food, clothing, and toys. One day, something sad happened. The price of oil went down, which means it didn't cost as much to buy oil as it used to. You might be thinking, \\"Wait, isn't that good?\\" Well, sometimes, low prices can be good, but in this case, it wasn't good for the engineering company. You see, they needed to make money by working for others who needed their knowledge and skills to design and build great things. But because the price of oil was now low, the people who used to hire the engineering company didn't need them as much anymore. So, what happened next was very sad. The engineering company didn't have enough money to pay all the 50 people who worked there. That means those people lost their jobs and had to go find another place to work. But that's not all! Even more people might lose their jobs at the company. This is because the people who run the company asked some special helpers called administrators to come and find ways to save the company. These administrators are smart and will try their best to help the company stay open. But it might mean that more people will lose their jobs if the company can't make enough money. Everyone in the city of Aberdeen felt sad about the engineering company and the people who lost their jobs. But they also hoped that the company would find a way to keep going. And who knows? If the price of oil goes up again and the company starts making more money, maybe they can hire back the people who lost their jobs and make everyone happy again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

Article: My neighbor Mrs. Gargan first told me about it. \\"Have you seen the tree?\\" She asked as I was sitting in the backyard enjoying the autumn twilight  . \\"The one down at the corner,\\" she explained. \\"It's a beautiful tree--all kinds of colors. All the passers-by stop to have a look. You ought to see it.\\" I told her I would, but I soon forgot about the tree. Three days later, I was jogging down the street when a splash of bright orange caught my eyes. For an instant, I thought someone's house had caught fire. Then I remembered the tree. I approached the tree to look at it closely. There was nothing remarkable about the shape of the tree. It was a medium-sized maple. But Mrs. Gargan had been right about its colors. Like the mess of an artist's palette , the tree blazed a bright crimson on its lower branches and burned with vivid yellows and oranges in its center, and deep red at its top. Through these colors were light green leaves as yet untouched by autumn. Walking closer I noticed several bare branches near the top, their small black branches scratching the air like claws. The fallen leaves lay like a red carpet around the trunk. As I was amazed at this beauty, I thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson's comments about the stars. \\"If the constellations appeared only once in a thousand years, imagine what an exciting event it would be. But because they're up there every night, we barely give them a look,\\" he made a remark in Nature. I felt the same way about the tree. Because its beauty will last only a week, it should be especially precious to us. And I had almost missed it. Once in the 19th century when a man noticed a brilliant display of northern lights in the sky over Massachusetts, he rang a church bell to alert the whole town's people. That's what I felt like doing about the tree. I wanted to awake the countryside to its wonder. I didn't have a church bell, but as I walked home, I did ask each neighbor I passed the same simple but important question Mrs. Gargan had asked me: \\"Have you seen the tree?\\".

Question: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess.  Does lake Mahoe have more or less chemicals in it than lake Tresco?  Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Lake Mahoe has more chemicals in it than Lake Tresco. The presence of the large farm next to Lake Mahoe, where various crops are grown, suggests that there may be a significant use of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides. When rainwater falls, it can pick up these chemicals and create runoff that carries them into nearby bodies of water, like Lake Mahoe. In contrast, Lake Tresco is located near a school, and there is no mention of any agricultural activity in its vicinity. Therefore, it is less likely to have the same level of chemical exposure as Lake Mahoe. As the hint states, high levels of chemicals from agricultural runoff can lead to excessive growth of water plants and algae, which in turn can create dead zones where aquatic life cannot survive. Additionally, contaminated water can infiltrate groundwater and cause issues when it is consumed by humans."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information:  - The Armenian Highlands (also known as the Armenian Upland, Armenian plateau, Armenian tableland, or simply Armenia) is the central-most and highest of three land-locked plateaus.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Orville Willis Forte IV was born in Alameda County, California. His father, Orville Willis Forte III, is a financial broker, and his mother, Patricia C. (nee Stivers), is an artist and former schoolteacher. He was raised in Moraga, before moving to Lafayette. He went by Billy in his early years until he was teased at school for it also being a girl's name, at which point he decided he would from there on be known as Will. Context: He began taking classes at the Groundlings in Los Angeles, an improvisational and sketch comedy troupe and school, while tutoring children to make ends meet. Forte's first successful foray into comedy was 101 Things to Definitely Not Do If You Want to Get a Chick, a comic book he produced that details incompetent men. The comics landed him his first professional job writing for The Jenny McCarthy Show, a short-lived variety show starring Jenny McCarthy. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to submit a packet to the Late Show with David Letterman and was told Letterman responded favorably to animation. After only nine months at Letterman, he was \\"let go\\" from the job. He recalled his stint on the program as unpleasant, noting that he did not have enough experience in writing. \\"What an honor to work at that show but I don't think I was fully mentally prepared. [...] I always wonder what it would be like if I'd had a couple more years of experience before going there.\\"  Forte returned to Los Angeles and began performing with the Groundlings' Main Company, with Cheryl Hines, Jim Rash and Maya Rudolph. He tried stand-up comedy three times, mostly at open mic nights, but quit after being voted into the Main Company. He joined the writing teams of two failed sitcoms, including The Army Show and Action. Forte got jobs writing for 3rd Rock from the Sun and That '70s Show, two successful programs. He loved writing but had mostly given up on acting, aside from acting with the Groundlings. While performing with the troupe in 2001, he was spotted by Lorne Michaels, the creator of Saturday Night Live (SNL). Forte felt his confidence was higher than usual, as That '70s Show had been picked up for two more years. He was invited to audition for SNL, which he regarded as unexpected.  At his audition for SNL, he performed multiple original characters, including Tim Calhoun, a speed reader, a prison guard, in addition to impressions of singer Michael McDonald and actor Martin Sheen. His final character was an older piece from his days with the Groundlings, in which he portrays a gold-painted street performer who performs fellatio to pay for his face paint, which devolves into a song needlessly uttering the words \\"cock\\" and \\"face paint\\" dozens of times. He felt his time to shine as a performer was already over, as he was in his thirties when he auditioned. To his surprise, he was offered a chance to be on the show, but declined, opting instead for the financial stability of his work at That '70s Show. He felt working for SNL could not live up to the idealized version he had dreamed of, but he later realized he would be making a mistake. Question: what did he do next? Answer:","output":"After realizing that he would be making a mistake by not accepting the offer to join Saturday Night Live (SNL), Will Forte decided to take a leap of faith and join the iconic show. He left his stable job at That '70s Show and became a cast member on SNL. This marked an important turning point in his career as it allowed him to showcase his acting and comedic talents on a national platform. During his tenure on SNL from 2002 to 2010, Forte became known for his unique characters and impressions. He created memorable sketches such as the popular \\"MacGruber,\\" a parody of the action-adventure television series \\"MacGyver,\\" which eventually turned into a full-length feature film in 2010. He also mastered impressions of various celebrities and political figures like George W. Bush and John Edwards, further setting himself apart as a versatile comedic actor. Being part of SNL also opened up more opportunities for Forte in television and film. He started making guest appearances on popular TV shows such as How I Met Your Mother, 30 Rock, Parks and Recreation, and several others. Furthermore, he expanded his career in the film industry by landing roles in movies like Baby Mama, Beerfest, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Forte's decision to join SNL, despite initial doubts, proved to be a stepping stone to a successful acting career in the entertainment industry. It allowed him to demonstrate his comedy and acting prowess and put him on the path to becoming the accomplished writer, actor, and comedian that he is today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

An Egyptian police chief was shot dead today as security forces tried to regain control of an area where gunmen killed 11 policemen last month and mutilated their bodies. Police had earlier fired tear gas and exchanged gunfire with armed men in Kerdasa, on the outskirts of Cairo, state TV reported. Despite wearing a bulletproof vest, Giza Police Chief General Nabil Farag was killed after unidentified militants opened fire. He was shot dead, and as these dramatic photographs show, had to be carried away by his fellow officers. Egyptian security forces help the lifeless body of Giza Police Chief General Nabil Farag, who was killed after unidentified militants opened fire. Police Chief General Farag had been on an operation with security forces deployed early morning to the town of Kirdasa to drive off suspected Islamists taking control of the town near Giza Pyramids, Egypt. Security troops backed up by helicopters, had stormed into the area, an Islamist stronghold, to carry out arrests after the torching of a number of police stations and the killing of an estimated 11 officers in clashes that followed the removal of President Mohamed Morsi in July. Kerdasa police station was abandoned after it was hit with rocket propelled grenades and gunfire on August 14 - the same day security forces moved against protests by supporters of the deposed president, killing hundreds. Police forces had not been allowed in Kerdasa since then. General Nabil Farrag, the assistant security director of the Giza Province, is dragged from a car after he was shot during an operation against gunmen. General Nabil Farrag died shortly after being brought to a hospital. Security forces captured 14 Islamist fugitives wanted for alleged involvement in violence in the village and at the six-week long Islamist sit-in outside Cairo University in support of ousted president Mohammed Morsi. The Egyptian Interior Ministry said the police chief was shot by gunmen positioned on the roofs of schools and mosques which the militants had taken over. At least one other police officer was injured in Thursday's violence, state TV reported. It said police forces took control of the area and imposed a curfew. As police and rebels fired at each other, Egyptian explosives experts were working to defuse bombs found on the public metro. Specialists defused two primitive bombs which has been planted 100 metres from Helmeyet el-Zaytoun station in northeast Cairo. Security troops stormed into the area to arrest people accused of torching police stations and killing an estimated 11 security officers.

Egyptian soldiers take cover behind an armoured personnel carrier as they keep watch during an operation against gunmen in the Kerdasa district. Egyptian security forces take cover during clashes with suspected militants, who have been fighting with police since Morsi was ousted. Egypt has suffered outbreaks of violence and attacks on police and civilians following Morsi's exit. Violence between his supporters and security forces included massive attacks on police stations, security officers and churches. At least 1,000 people have died in the violence with most deaths coming during the security forces' dispersal of two pro-Morsi sit-ins in Cairo on August 14. About 100 police officers also died in the clashes. Nearly 2,000 Islamist activists and politicians have been arrested since Morsi's removal. Smoke rises during the fierce battles between Egyptian security forces and suspected militant, in the town of Kirdasa, near Giza Pyramids. Kerdasa, known for producing and selling luxury fabrics is 14 km from Cairo and known to be an Islamist stronghold. Residents of the area said yesterday they were not in control of the area but do not want police there. 'We don't trust them as we know they will come to arrest people we know and respect whom they blame on the violence that we know was done by outsiders, not by our respectable sheikhs,' Ahmed Aly, a resident, told Reuters on Wednesday. Egyptian security forces had on Monday stormed the town of Delga in Minya province, about 300 km south of Cairo, clearing barricades that was set by Morsi's supporters there who were almost in control of the town. Forces arrested 56 residents.

When General Farag was shot, he was wearing special clothes to protect him, called a bulletproof vest, but it didn't work this time. His friends, the other police officers, carried him away. They want to make Kerdasa safe for everyone and stop the bad people from doing more bad things. There have been a lot of problems in Egypt since a man named President Mohamed Morsi was removed from his job. Some people liked Morsi, and some people didn't. After Morsi was removed, lots of people were angry, and some did very bad things, like hurting other people and burning buildings.

That summer, the Bells had a vacation on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, spending time at the small village of Baddeck. Returning in 1886, Bell started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck, overlooking Bras d'Or Lake. By 1889, a large house, christened The Lodge was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings, including a new laboratory, were begun that the Bells would name Beinn Bhreagh (Gaelic: beautiful mountain) after Bell's ancestral Scottish highlands.[N 21] Bell also built the Bell Boatyard on the estate, employing up to 40 people building experimental craft as well as wartime lifeboats and workboats for the Royal Canadian Navy and pleasure craft for the Bell family. An enthusiastic boater, Bell and his family sailed or rowed a long series of vessels on Bras d'Or Lake, ordering additional vessels from the H.W. Embree and Sons boatyard in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia.

Article:      Television personality Nancy O’Dell arrives at the 11th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at the Shrine Exposition Center on Feb. 5, 2005, in Los Angeles. (Stephen Shugerman/Getty Images)      The woman who rejected Donald Trump’s sexual advances — referred to as “Nancy” in an obscenity-laced video obtained by The Washington Post — has been identified as Nancy O’Dell, a television personality whom he reportedly tried subsequently to have fired as host of the Miss USA pageant.      In the 2005 video clip, the Republican presidential nominee recalled his failed attempts to seduce a married woman. “I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it,” he said.      On Friday night, “Access Hollywood” reported that the woman who rebuffed Trump’s advances was that show’s former host, O’Dell. Trump’s crass remarks were made to O’Dell’s then co-anchor, Billy Bush, as the two men arrived for a cameo appearance by Trump on the soap opera “Days of Our Lives.”      In this video from 2005, Donald Trump prepares for an appearance on \\"Days of Our Lives\\" with actress Arianne Zucker. He is accompanied to the set by \\"Access Hollywood\\" host Billy Bush. The Post has edited this video for length. (Obtained by The Washington Post)      Two years later, Trump tried to have O’Dell fired as host of the Miss USA pageant, reportedly because she was pregnant, although the video suggests he may have had other motives, as well.      After the video was released, TMZ quickly revived its previous reporting about Trump’s attempt to have O’Dell dismissed from the Miss Universe pageant in 2007. “A source tells TMZ that the enigmatic real estate developer wanted to drop O’Dell as host because he doesn’t like the way pregnant women look,” the site reported at the time.      O’Dell went on to host the pageant despite Trump’s objections, TMZ wrote, because NBC executives had the final decision-making power.      O’Dell is a television veteran who got her start as a news reporter in South Carolina, where she grew up. She spent a decade as the host of “Access Hollywood” and is now the co-anchor of “Entertainment Tonight” on CBS. She can frequently be seen interviewing celebrities on the red carpet before major award shows.      In 2005, O’Dell married tech executive Keith Zubchevich. Two years later, she gave birth to a daughter.      O’Dell released this statement on Saturday: “Politics aside, I’m saddened that these comments still exist in our society at all. When I heard the comments yesterday, it was disappointing to hear such objectification of women. The conversation needs to change because no female, no person, should be the subject of such crass comments, whether or not cameras are rolling. Everyone deserves respect no matter the setting or gender. As a woman who has worked very hard to establish her career, and as a mom, I feel I must speak out with the hope that as a society we will always strive to be better.”      Early Saturday morning, shortly after midnight, Trump released a short video apologizing for his remarks. He is slated to debate Hillary Clinton on Sunday evening.      O’Dell is scheduled to return to the air on Monday. ||||| Trump Tried to Dump Because of Baby Bump      Trump Tried to Dump Because of Baby Bump      NBC announced today that \\"Access Hollywood's\\" Nancy O'Dell will host next month's Miss USA Pageant, but if it had gone Donald Trump's way, that wouldn't be the case.A source tells TMZ that the enigmatic real estate mogul wanted to drop O'Dell as host because he doesn't like the way pregnant women look. But it's not The Donald's call: O'Dell is under contract with NBC and is the host of the \\"Access Hollywood\\" (which is syndicated on many NBC stations), and she will also be fronting the network's Oscar coverage this weekend. The lesson here: Don't pick on the Peacock's golden girl, Donald!What was particularly troubling to O'Dell, our source says, is that the Miss USA Pageant is supposed to embody more than just how a woman looks in a bikini. It's safe to say that O'Dell, who will be six-months pregnant when the pageant airs, won't be sporting a two-piece.Trump's camp had no comment. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In 2005, a video clip was obtained by The Washington Post involving Donald Trump recalling his failed attempts to seduce a married woman, referred to as \\"Nancy.\\" This woman was later identified as television personality Nancy O'Dell.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: How does Sam know the person who gets his head crushed by a statue?, using the article: Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense. Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand.

Given the following context:  In 2006, U2 started work on the follow-up to How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), collaborating with producer Rick Rubin. After U2 guitarist the Edge worked individually with Rubin in Los Angeles, the group spent two weeks in September 2006 completing songs with the producer at Abbey Road Studios in London. Later that year, the band released two songs from these sessions on the compilation album U218 Singles: a cover of the Skids' \\"The Saints Are Coming\\" with Green Day, and \\"Window in the Skies\\". In January 2007, lead singer Bono said U2 intended to take their next album in a different musical direction from their previous few releases.

Both devices play critical roles in producing and regulating the electric current we depend on in our daily lives. Electric generators use electromagnetic induction to change kinetic energy to electrical energy. They produce electricity in power plants. Electric transformers use electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of electric current. Some transformers increase voltage and other decrease voltage.  Bob works for the local electric power company. Part of is job involves checking the generators and transformers. His work schedule allows him to work on the generator tagged as gen A only on Mondays, and the transformer tagged as tran B only on Tuesdays.  Which one would most likely be located in a power plant, gen A or tran B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Gen A would most likely be located in a power plant. This is because electric generators, like gen A, are responsible for producing electricity in power plants by converting kinetic energy into electrical energy using electromagnetic induction. On the other hand, tran B, an electric transformer, is used in various locations along the power transmission and distribution network to modify the voltage of the electric current."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a new situation: James spent a lot of time indoors, and didn't get out much like Rob, his friend, who loved outdoors stuff.  But I can use this background: Recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions. When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend breathes more fresh air on a daily basis? A:","output":"Based on the given information, Rob breathes more fresh air on a daily basis. This is because he loves outdoor activities and spends more time outside, whereas James spends a lot of time indoors. Outdoor air is generally fresher than indoor air, as indoor spaces can have trapped pollutants due to limited air circulation.

(Photo: Mark Henle, The Arizona Republic)      Uber's self-driving car system detected an Arizona pedestrian about six seconds before the vehicle it was in killed the woman in March. But the system never took action to prevent the incident, according to the preliminary results of a National Transportation Safety Board investigation.      Uber engineers had intentionally disabled the Volvo's emergency braking system \\"to reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior\\" but did not program the system to alert the human operator to manually brake the vehicle, NTSB reported Thursday.      If the emergency braking system had been activated, it would have been triggered 1.3 seconds before the car hit the pedestrian, according to the probe.      The revelations came a day after Uber announced it would shutter its Arizona self-driving car operations.      NTSB said Uber's system was \\"operating normally\\" on the 2017 Volvo XC90 with \\"no faults or diagnostic messages.\\"      But \\"according to Uber, emergency braking maneuvers are not enabled while the vehicle is under computer control to reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior,\\" NTSB said. \\"The vehicle operator is relied on to intervene and take action. The system is not designed to alert the operator.\\"      The woman behind the wheel, an Uber employee, noticed a woman pushing a bicycle across the road in the dark and grabbed the steering wheel \\"less than a second before impact,\\" NTSB said.      In a video released publicly after the crash, the operator was shown looking down at times. According to the NTSB probe, she told investigators that she was \\"monitoring the self-driving interface and that while her personal and business phones were in the vehicle, neither were in use until after the crash.\\"      She began braking \\"less than second after impact\\" with the victim, the NTSB's Elaine Herzberg said.      NTSB said it had not yet reached a conclusion on the \\"probable cause\\" of the incident.      Uber said it is cooperating closely with NTSB investigators.      \\"As their investigation continues, we’ve initiated our own safety review of our self-driving vehicles program,\\" Uber said in a statement. \\"We’ve also brought on former NTSB Chair Christopher Hart to advise us on our overall safety culture, and we look forward to sharing more on the changes we’ll make in the coming weeks.\\"      Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.

The report into the first fatal crash caused by a self-driving vehicle also disclosed that the modified 2017 Volvo XC90’s radar systems observed the pedestrian six seconds before impact but “the self-driving system software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle with varying expectations of future travel path.”      At 1.3 seconds before impact, the self-driving system determined emergency braking was needed. But Uber said, according to the NTSB, that automatic emergency braking maneuvers in the Volvo XC90 were disabled while the car was under computer control in order to “reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior.”      The report gives new fuel to opponents in Congress who have stalled a bill designed to speed the deployment of self-driving cars on U.S. roads and puts a spotlight on the fact that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is also investigating, does not test self-driving vehicles or certify them before they are deployed on U.S. roads.      Uber Technologies Inc, which voluntarily suspended testing after the crash in the city of Tempe, said on Wednesday it planned to end testing in Arizona and focus on limited testing in Pittsburgh and two cities in California. Uber aims to resume its self-driving operations this summer, likely with smaller routes and fewer cars, the company said.      The company did not directly comment on the NTSB findings but noted it recently named a former NTSB chairman, Christopher Hart, to advise on Uber’s safety culture.      “As their investigation continues, we’ve initiated our own safety review of our self-driving vehicles program,” the company said on Thursday, adding it planned to announce changes in the coming weeks.      All aspects of the self-driving system were operating normally at the time of the crash, and there were no faults or diagnostic messages, the NTSB said.      Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking her bicycle outside the crosswalk on a four-lane road when she was struck by the Uber vehicle traveling 39 miles per hour (63 kph).      A safety operator behind the wheel appeared to be looking down, and not at the road, moments before the crash, according to video from inside the car released by police. The operator told the NTSB she was not looking at a mobile phone but monitoring the vehicle’s self-driving systems.      Tempe police said on Wednesday it had completed its investigation and turned the findings over to prosecutors to review. Police did not release the results of the probe.      The NTSB said the Uber vehicle required the operator to intervene and take action, but the system was not designed to alert the operator. The report said the operator engaged the steering wheel less than a second before impact and began braking less than a second after impact.      The report noted that Herzberg tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana, and that she did not look in the direction of the vehicle until just before impact.      ‘RECKLESS’      William Wallace, senior policy analyst for Consumers Union, the advocacy division of Consumer Reports, called Uber “reckless” and said the NTSB report “makes it clear that a self-driving car was tested on public roads when it wasn’t safe enough to be there, and it killed a pedestrian.” He added that the system “was far too dangerous to be tested off a closed track.”      Some cities expressed hesitation about immediately allowing Uber to return to testing.      Pittsburgh mayoral spokesman Timothy McNulty said the mayor still “wants a full federal investigation of the accident and for Uber to agree to his demands specific to Pittsburgh testing before he would welcome them back to the city.”      Sacramento, California, is interested in having Uber and other developers test in the city but wants to ensure the companies follow all regulations.      “The NTSB report really shines a light on the importance of safety and security of vehicles, so I think it hardens our stance a little bit on safety and security,” said Louis Stewart, Sacramento chief innovation officer.      A spokesman for Ontario’s Ministry of Transportation said on Thursday it would ensure it was satisfied with the steps Uber has taken to ensure the safety of its automated vehicles, before resuming testing in Toronto.      Arizona’s governor in March suspended Uber’s permit for the testing, citing safety concerns.      Uber has said it considers self-driving technology important to the future of its ride services, although it is not clear how it fits into the plans of new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi. He has revamped the company structure and cut expenses as Uber prepares for an initial public offering next year.      The NTSB did not say when it would release its final report on the accident. The agency typically issues its final conclusions at least a year after an accident.      It is also investigating a series of crashes involving Tesla Inc’s semi-autonomous “Autopilot” system after faulting the system last year after a fatal crash in Florida.

National Transportation Safety Board/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY. - RC124083F3B0 ||||| The Uber Technologies Inc. self-driving car involved in a fatal crash in Arizona identified an object on the road six seconds before impact and didn’t determine the need for emergency braking until nearly five seconds later, U.S. safety investigators said Thursday.      The calculation ultimately wasn’t acted on as the car’s built-in automatic emergency braking system was disabled and the safety operator responsible for performing such a maneuver didn’t apply the brakes until after the collision, the National Transportation Safety Board said in its preliminary report on the March 18 accident in Tempe, Ariz., near Phoenix.      The crash marked the first pedestrian death involving a self-driving car and ignited a broader discussion about whether the driverless technology that auto and tech companies are racing to develop is ready for the real world.      It also illustrates the challenges Uber has faced in developing software that can detect hazards on the road and respond appropriately, as the ride-hailing company chases rivals such as Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo and General Motors Co.’s Cruise Automation, which aim to deploy robot taxis that could pose as a threat to Uber’s business.      Uber was testing a fleet of Volvo Cars sport-utility vehicles that come equipped with automatic emergency braking and other safety features. The vehicles, however, were modified by the ride-hailing company, which equipped them with cameras, sensors and onboard computers. An operator rides in each vehicle, prepared to take the wheel to ensure safety as needed.      The NTSB said the Uber vehicle’s sensors detected the pedestrian walking across the road with a bicycle six seconds before impact. At first, the self-driving system’s software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, then as a vehicle and finally as a bicycle with varying expectations of where the bike was headed.      The NTSB said the vehicle was traveling at 43 miles an hour before impact. At that speed, six seconds is enough time for a vehicle to stop, said Todd Humphreys, an associate professor who specializes in robotic perception at the University of Texas at Austin. He said stopping time in those conditions could have occurred within less than three seconds.      It was 1.3 seconds before impact that the system decided emergency braking was needed, the NTSB said. According to Uber, the NTSB said, Volvo’s built-in automatic braking system had been disabled during testing to “reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior.” The safety operator began braking less than a second after impact, the NTSB said.      “The vehicle operator is relied on to intervene and take action,” the report said. “The system isn’t designed to alert the operator.”      Uber’s decision to deactivate the vehicle’s automatic-braking system and leave it in the hands of the safety operator, who in turn wasn’t given an alert, were mistakes, Mr. Humphreys said.      Related Video As part of its investigation, the Tempe, Ariz., police department released this video showing the moment before a self-driving Uber operating in autonomous mode struck a pedestrian on March 18. Warning: Graphic content. PHOTO: CHRIS CARLSON/ASSOCIATED PRESS      “This was an absolutely inexcusable design decision,” Mr. Humphreys said in an email. “Over those critical 1.3 seconds, the car could have slowed down from 43 to 24 mph before the collision.” That would have given the pedestrian a better chance of surviving the collision, he said.      It is common for developers to disable built-in vehicle features such as automatic braking to avoid multiple systems issuing conflicting commands, said Raj Rajkumar, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who founded and later sold an autonomous-car software startup.      The problem with Uber’s approach, he said, is the company didn’t replace Volvo’s system with its own automatic emergency braking. Instead, Uber relied on the safety operator, who was seemingly distracted and didn’t receive a warning to brake or swerve, he said.      “Uber’s software designers punted the final action to the operator; except that no alert was generated,” Mr. Rajkumar said in an email.      At the very least, Uber’s autonomous software should have predicted the potential collision and slowed the vehicle or slammed on the brakes, he said.      A video released around the time of the crash showed the safety operator glancing down toward the center console of the vehicle several times before impact. In an interview with NTSB investigators, the operator said she had been monitoring the self-driving system interface.      In addition to being responsible for intervening in the driving of the vehicle, the safety operator is also monitoring diagnostic messages that appear on a digital screen in the center console and tagging events for further review, the NTSB said.      Many autonomous vehicle developers begin with two safety operators and move to one as their systems become more advanced. Uber moved from two to one after more than a year of planning and continues to use two in some scenarios, the company said.      “We decided to make this transition because after testing, we felt we could accomplish the task of the second person—annotating each intervention with information about what was happening around the car—by looking at our logs after the vehicle had returned to base, rather than in real time,” the company said.      Mr. Humphreys said the operator shouldn’t be expected to interact with the screen if it means not looking at the road. “A second Uber employee should have been in the car to interact with the system interface,” he said.      The pedestrian was dressed in dark clothing and was walking a bicycle across the road, not at a crosswalk, according to the report. NTSB also said the pedestrian tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana, though it didn’t say that played a role in the crash.      Volvo, in statement, said it was helping with the investigation, noting its driver-assistance system was disengaged.      An Uber spokeswoman Thursday said the company has worked with the NTSB and started its own review, bringing on former NTSB head Christopher Hart to advise on its safety culture. She said the company in the coming weeks will detail changes it plans to make.      On Wednesday, Uber said it was closing down its self-driving vehicle program in Arizona, two months after the state barred it from road-testing self-driving technology.      —Austen Hufford contributed to this article.

So, we have three groups of apples on one side of the problem and one group of apples on the other side. First, let's combine our groups of apples on the left side. Here's what we do: (-611 - 426 + 578) apples = (159) apples + 70452 Doing the math, we find that it's (-1037 + 578) apples. This simplifies to -459 apples on the left side of the equation.

In Christianity, an archbishop (, via Latin \\"archiepiscopus\\", from Greek , from -, \\"chief\\", and , \\"bishop\\") is a bishop of higher rank or office. In some cases, like the Lutheran Church of Sweden, it is the denomination leader title. Like popes, patriarchs, metropolitans, cardinal bishops, diocesan bishops, and suffragan bishops, archbishops are in the highest of the three traditional orders of bishops, priests, also called presbyters, and deacons. An archbishop may be granted the title, or ordained as chief pastor of a metropolitan see or another episcopal see to which the title of archbishop is attached.  Episcopal sees are generally arranged in groups in which the bishop who is the ordinary of one of them has certain powers and duties of oversight over the other sees. He is known as the metropolitan archbishop of that see. In the Roman Catholic Church, canon 436 of the Code of Canon Law indicates what these powers and duties are for a Latin Rite metropolitan archbishop, while those of the head of an autonomous (\\"sui iuris\\") Eastern Catholic Church are indicated in canon 157 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.  As well as the much more numerous metropolitan sees, there are 77 Roman Catholic sees that have archiepiscopal rank.

A onetime California school official was sentenced Monday to 10 years in state prison for sexually assaulting two women when they were her students, including a woman who confronted her in a recorded phone call that went viral on YouTube. Andrea Cardosa, 41, of Perris, was sentenced in Riverside County Superior Court on three charges of committing lewd acts on a child. She avoided a potential life sentence by pleading guilty last month. Prosecutors dropped more than a dozen other counts. Guilty: Andrea Michelle Cardosa, an educator who was confronted with allegations of abuse in a phone call by a former student who then posted the conversation on YouTube, has been jailed for 10 years. Pleaded guilty: Cardosa was charged with abusing a former student at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside beginning when the girl was 12. The abuse lasted from 1997 to 2001, prosecutors said. Old photo: Andrea Cardosa has been accused by a former student of sexually abusing her when she was 12. Cardosa was charged with abusing a former student at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside beginning when the girl was 12. The abuse lasted from 1997 to 2001, prosecutors said. In court papers, prosecutors said Cardosa molested the girl more than 100 times in a locker room and Cardosa's car, and at the home of Cardosa's sister. In a recording that was posted online in January 2014, the former student telephoned Alhambra High School, where Cardosa was assistant principal, and confronted her. The now 29-year-old mother Jamie Carrillo said that she made the video post as the statute of limitations has run out for her to be able to prosecute and that she didn't want Cardosa around other children. In the call, she tells the woman, who identifies herself as Ms Cardosa, that she did something terribly wrong at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside 15 years ago. Ms Carrillo then asks what the woman would do if a student told her that she was having a sexual relationship with a teacher to which she replies that she would involve law enforcement. 'You should be so ashamed and so disgusted with yourself,' the caller said. 'I am. I am,' Cardosa said. 'I regret it every day. Every day.' Cardosa later resigned. Confession: The then  28-year-old Jamie Carillo posted a YouTube video where she confronted the woman who allegedly sexually abused her in middle school. Took her on trips: Ms Carrillo said that the teacher (pictured right) took her on out of town trips and made her feel 'special' More than one: After Jamie Carillo (pictured) posted her video on YouTube, a second alleged victim came forward to say that she had also been abused. She asks: 'So how is that any different from what you did when I was at Chemawa Middle?' To which the convicted molester answered: 'It's not.' Ms Carrillo goes on to tell her attacker that she has children of her own and that her former teacher's actions ruined her life and that she is 'disgusting'. When she hangs up the phone, Ms Carrillo shows that she made the call on the screen and reads out the number. She says: 'And I'm shaking like a leaf... not even an ''I'm sorry.'' Or anything. Just that she regrets it.' Horrific abuse: The 29-year-old alleges that her former teacher (left) abused her when she was a student at a California high school. Alhambra Unified School District Superintendent Laura Tellez-Gagliano released a statement saying the YouTube link was emailed to the school and they passed it to the Alhambra Police Department. Ms Carrillo said that the coach kissed her in the locker room and put her hand down the then 12-year-old's pants. The former student then said Ms Cardosa, who is believed to have been in her mid-twenties at the time of the assaults, organized out of town trips so that she could have sex with the underage girl. The 29-year-old said: 'Everything was stolen from me. She just completely manipulated me into thinking that I needed her and I wanted it.' Cardosa molested the girl over 100 times, and acts were committed in a locker room, Cardosa's car, and at the home of Cardosa's sister, where the two were almost discovered. The ex-student spoke at Cardosa's sentencing. 'I will stand up for my 12-year-old self who did not have anyone to fight for her,' the woman, now 28, said in a written victim-impact statement she read in court. 'It is never OK for an adult to betray the trust of a child.' Another former student came forward after the recording appeared online. Brianna, now 18, told detectives that she met Cardosa when she was a student at a middle school in Perris. She said Cardosa drove her to a secluded area in 2010, where she tried to kiss her and inappropriately touched her. Cardosa was charged with abusing that victim from 2009 to 2010 while she was a 15-year-old student at Tomas Rivera Middle School in Perris. A statement was read in court on behalf of that woman, who described having nightmares and trust issues. 'How will I ever trust anyone around my son?' she said in the statement. The victims also have sued the Riverside Unified and Val Verde Unified school districts. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This is a story about a woman named Andrea Cardosa. She used to be a school official in California. Imagine if you were at school and there was a teacher or someone who worked there that you really didn't like because they did bad things - that's what Andrea Cardosa was like. She did some very inappropriate, bad things to two girls when they were her students. One of those girls, named Jamie Carrillo, decided many years later that she wanted to talk to Andrea Cardosa about the bad things that happened. So, Jamie called Andrea, but she also made a recording of their conversation and posted it on YouTube where lots of people could see it. In the video, Jamie told Andrea that she did something terribly wrong. Andrea admitted that she did do something bad and expressed regret for her actions. Because of Jamie's video, a court decided that Andrea should go to prison for 10 years because of the bad things she did. This is a way for her to pay for her actions. Another student also said that Andrea did bad things to her as well. This made the court even more sure that they made the right decision to send Andrea to prison. We can learn from this story that it's very important to tell someone when a person is doing bad things, so that person can be stopped."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Apollo Creed, a fictional character from the \\"Rocky\\" movie series, does not die during a championship boxing match, but rather during a high-profile exhibition fight. In the movie series, Apollo Creed, portrayed by actor Carl Weathers, is a former heavyweight boxing champion. Apollo Creed dies in the 1985 movie \\"Rocky IV.\\" In this installment, Creed faces a formidable Soviet Union fighter named Ivan Drago, played by Dolph Lundgren. The fight between Apollo Creed and Ivan Drago is intended to be an exhibition match held in Las Vegas, with no actual competition for the championship title. Despite it being an exhibition fight, the battle between Creed and Drago gets intense as Drago showcases his immense power and intimidating fighting style. Apollo Creed suffers a merciless round of punches from Drago and ultimately succumbs to his injuries, dying in the ring.

My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up. She just married that person 2 weeks ago, and honestly….I just want her to be happy. I miss her, I always will, and in hindsight, I don’t know why she stayed with me as long as she did. I was not an easy person to love.

The writer himself speculates that he was \\"not an easy person to love\\", implying that his behavior or personality may have contributed to the end of the marriage. However, this is a somewhat subjective observation and doesn't provide a concrete reason for the dissolution of the marriage. The narrative also indicates the wife became involved with a friend of the writer on the same day she left the marriage, which could suggest that she developed feelings for this person while she was still married. However, without clear confirmation or further details, this remains speculative. The writer does not mention any unhappiness in the marriage prior to his wife leaving, and there's no indication that her family had any influence over her decision. Hence, those reasons seem unlikely based on the given information. Therefore, the most accurate answer from the given options would be \\"not enough information\\" as we don't have a definitive explanation from the wife herself about her motivations for leaving the marriage.

Paragraph: Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

(iStock)      Indian food, with its hodgepodge of ingredients and intoxicating aromas, is coveted around the world. The labor-intensive cuisine and its mix of spices is more often than not a revelation for those who sit down to eat it for the first time. Heavy doses of cardamom, cayenne, tamarind and other flavors can overwhelm an unfamiliar palate. Together, they help form the pillars of what tastes so good to so many people.      But behind the appeal of Indian food — what makes it so novel and so delicious — is also a stranger and subtler truth. In a large new analysis of more than 2,000 popular recipes, data scientists have discovered perhaps the key reason why Indian food tastes so unique: It does something radical with flavors, something very different from what we tend to do in the United States and the rest of Western culture. And it does it at the molecular level.      [Why delicious Indian food is surprisingly unpopular in the United States]      Before we go further, let's take a step back and consider what flavors are and how they interact. If you were to hold a microscope to most Western dishes, you would find an interesting but not all-too-surprising trend. Popular food pairings in this part of the world combine ingredients that share like flavors, which food chemists have broken down into their molecular parts — precise chemical compounds that, when combined, give off a distinct taste.      [This surprisingly tough quiz will make you second guess how well you know food]      Most of the compounds have scientific names, though one of the simpler compounds is acetal, which, as the food chemist George Burdock has written, is \\"refreshing, pleasant, and [has a] fruity-green odor,\\" and can be found in whiskey, apple juice, orange juice and raw beets. On average, there are just over 50 flavor compounds in each food ingredient.      A nifty chart shared by Scientific American in 2013 shows which foods share the most flavor compounds with others and which food pairings have the most flavor compounds in common. Peanut butter and roasted peanuts have one of the most significant overlaps (no surprise there). But there are connections that are more difficult to predict: strawberries, for instance, have more in common with white wine than they do with apples, oranges or honey.      Data crunching Indian recipes      Chefs in the West like to make dishes with ingredients that have overlapping flavors. But not all cuisines adhere to the same rule. Many Asian cuisines have been shown to belie the trend by favoring dishes with ingredients that don't overlap in flavor. And Indian food, in particular, is one of the most powerful counterexamples.      [Why many restaurants don't actually want you to order dessert]      Researchers at the Indian Institute for Technology in Jodhpur crunched data on several thousand recipes from a popular online recipe site called TarlaDalal.com. They broke each dish down to its ingredients, and then compared how often and heavily ingredients share flavor compounds.      The answer? Not too often.      Here's an easy way to make sense of what they did, through the lens of a single, theoretical dish. Say you have a dish with 4 different ingredients, like the one below:      Each one of those ingredients has its own list of flavor compounds. And any two of those ingredients' lists might have some overlap. Take the coconut and onion, for instance. We can all agree that these two things are pretty different, but we can also see (in the Venn diagram below) that there's some overlap in their flavor make-up. (Ignore the math symbols.)      You could create the same diagram for all the ingredients with overlapping flavor compounds, as in this diagram. There are six that have overlap. (Again, ignore the math.)      The researchers did this for each of the several thousand recipes, which used a total of 200 ingredients. They examined how much the underlying flavor compounds overlapped in single dishes and discovered something very different from Western cuisines. Indian cuisine tended to mix ingredients whose flavors don't overlap at all.      \\"We found that average flavor sharing in Indian cuisine was significantly lesser than expected,\\" the researchers wrote.      In other words, the more overlap two ingredients have in flavor, the less likely they are to appear in the same Indian dish.      [It's official: Americans should drink more coffee]      The unique makeup of Indian cuisine can be seen in some dishes more than others, and it seems to be tied to the use of specific ingredients. Spices usually indicate dishes with flavors that have no chemical common ground.      More specifically, many Indian recipes contain cayenne, the basis of curry powder that is in just about any Indian curry. And when a dish contains cayenne, the researchers found, it's unlikely to have other ingredients that share similar flavors. The same can be said of green bell pepper, coriander and garam masala, which are nearly as ubiquitous in Indian cuisine.      \\"Each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavor sharing pattern with rest of the ingredients,\\" the researchers noted.      [Where people around the world eat the most sugar and fat]      Milk, butter, bread, and rice, meanwhile—all of which are hallmarks of Western cuisine—were found to be associated with just the opposite: flavor pairings that match. When any of those ingredients appeared in an Indian dish, there was a good chance there would be a lot of flavor overlap.      A lesson for all chefs      The takeaway is that part of what makes Indian food so appealing is the way flavors rub up against each other. The cuisine is complicated, no doubt: the average Indian dish, after all, contains at least 7 ingredients, and the total number of ingredients observed by the researchers amounted to almost 200 out of the roughly 381 observed around the world. But all those ingredients — and the spices especially — are all uniquely important because in any single dish, each one brings a unique flavor.      [Why Chipotle's pork problem is a bad sign for its future]      But the upshot should also be a thought that we might be approaching food from the wrong angle. Combining ingredients with like flavors is a useful (and often delicious) strategy, but it might be a somewhat misleading rule of thumb. Indian cuisine, after all, is cherished globally, and yet hinges on a decidedly different ingredient pairing logic. ||||| Julia Child famously said that fat carries flavor, but perhaps instead we should give thanks to 4-methylpentanoic acid. Unique combinations of such chemical compounds give foods their characteristic flavors. Science-minded chefs have gone so far as to suggest that seemingly incongruous ingredients—chocolate and blue cheese, for example—will taste great together as long as they have enough flavor compounds in common. Scientists recently put this hypothesis to the test by creating a flavor map, a variant of which we have reproduced here. Lines connect foods that have components in common; thick lines mean many components are shared. By comparing the flavor network with various recipe databases, the researchers conclude that chefs do tend to pair ingredients with shared flavor compounds—but only in Western cuisine. Dishes from a database of recipes from East Asia tend to combine ingredients with few overlapping flavors. ||||| When I die, bury me inside a vat of saag paneer. Indian food is categorically delicious: its flavors are complex, oscillating between sweet, savory, and spicy; its textures meld creamy sauces with doughy breads and tender meat and vegetables to make the slop of dreams. It’s a divine synthesis that is aromatic and sophisticated without being bougie. Hell, you can get a better-than-decent plate of it for nary more than the cost of a deli sandwich.      But what is it that makes Indian food so endlessly rich and tasty? Scientists were wondering, too, and recently performed an analysis of 2,500 recipes to find out, as first observed in the Washington Post.      Researchers Anupam Jaina, Rakhi N Kb, and Ganesh Bagler from the Indian Institute for Technology in Jodhpur ran a fine-tooth comb through TarlaDalal.com—a recipe database of more than 17,000 dishes that self-identifies as “India’s #1 food site”—in attempts to decode the magic of your chicken tikka masala or aloo gobi. Sure, there are commonalities in seasoning that run through Indian cuisine as a whole, but just how varied are they?      The answer is more complicated than you might expect.      While many Western cuisines attempt to pair ingredients that share “flavor compounds”—the minute timbres that indicate something like types of sweetness or sourness or spiciness—Indian food’s signature is that it combines ingredients that don’t share these qualities at all.      “We study food pairing in recipes of Indian cuisine to show that, in contrast to positive food pairing reported in some Western cuisines, Indian cuisine has a strong signature of negative food pairing,” the researchers wrote. “[The] more the extent of flavor-sharing between any two ingredients, [the] lesser their co-occurrence.”      For example, if you find cayenne in an Indian dish, you’re unlikely to find another ingredient that shares the same compounds—though you may find other spices that have complementary, but not identical, attributes. This is true across the eight different types of sub-cuisines studied, from Bengali to Punjabi to South Indian.      A total of 194 unique ingredients were identified in the recipes, and subdivided into 15 categories: spices, seeds, herbs, meats, etc. But—rather unsurprisingly—the spices, and their methods of pairing and combination, emerged as the character-defining attributes of Indian cuisine.      That like flavors should be combined for better dishes—an unspoken but popular hypothesis stipulated by recipe-building in North American, Western European, and Latin American cultures—is an idea essentially reversed in Indian cuisine. In the words of the study, “Each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavor-sharing pattern with [the] rest of the ingredients, and is sensitive to replacement even with other spices.”      In other words, each spice serves a very specific role in the dish it inhabits, from the warm sweetness of ginger to the slight bitterness of tamarind to the zingy freshness of cilantro. And it is the combination of many of these components—a typical Indian dish can incorporate a dozen different herbs and spices—that creates the flavor fingerprint that we’ve come to associate with a good plate of chana masala.      So while instincts may say to pile sweet on sweet or hot ‘n’ spicy on even more hot ‘n’ spicy, keep in mind that opposites sometimes attract with delicious results. |||||","output":"Indian food is known for its blend of spices and unique flavors, and a recent study analyzing over 2,000 popular recipes has found that this distinct taste comes from the unconventional pairing of ingredients that do not share overlapping flavors.

Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.  Guess a valid title for it!

Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century.

Given the question: Here's a question: The soldiers were on the run and in danger, they entered a building to hold up but first they had to make sure it was what?  Here are possible answers to this question: - full of people - safety - lie - secure - being safe  I believe the correct choice is \\"secure\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"\\"secure\\", and let me provide a detailed explanation of why this is the most appropriate choice among the provided options. First, let's analyze the context of the question. The soldiers are on the run and in danger, which suggests that they are likely in a combat situation or escaping from enemy forces. Their objective is to find a suitable location to hide, recover, or protect themselves from any further threats. Now, let's consider each response and evaluate which one best aligns with the soldiers' objective: 1. Full of people: While finding refuge in a crowd could potentially offer anonymity or temporary camouflage, it comes with significant risks. Placing the soldiers among a group of civilians not only increases the likelihood of collateral damage and civilian casualties but also goes against the principle of distinction in armed conflict, which separates combatants from non-combatants. Therefore, this option is not the most appropriate choice in terms of ensuring the soldiers' safety. 2. Safety: Although this term is general and may seem like an attractive option, it is redundant with the concept of \\"being safe\\", which is also listed as an option. In this context, \\"safety\\" refers to the broader objective of finding a secure location. However, the question specifically asks what the soldiers need to ensure once they have entered the building. Therefore, this option does not directly address the question at hand. 3. Lie: The term \\"lie\\" is not relevant to the soldiers' immediate need for security and safety. Since they are on the run and in danger, their priority is to secure their position, not to deceive someone or hide the truth. 4. Secure: This option is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the soldiers' need to verify that the building is a safe space where they can take necessary precautions and defend themselves against any potential threats. Ensuring that the building is secure implies that they will be checking for any vulnerabilities, such as entry points for enemy forces, and taking steps to prevent their discovery or access. 5. Being safe: While \\"being safe\\" is indeed a priority for the soldiers, this option is not as specific as \\"secure\\" and does not explicitly address their need to confirm the safety of the building once they've entered it. In conclusion, the most appropriate answer to the question is \\"secure\\" because it directly relates to the soldiers' primary concern of ensuring that the building they've entered can provide adequate protection and defense against any potential threats. The other options provided, although somewhat relevant, do not address this concern as explicitly and accurately as the term \\"secure\\" does. Ensuring the building is secure would include assessing its structural integrity, monitoring any entry points, and potentially setting up temporary fortifications to improve their defensive position, ultimately allowing them to maintain their safety and carry out their mission effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Queen Juliana, born Juliana Louise Emma Marie Wilhelmina on April 30, 1909, was the daughter of Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Hendrik of the Netherlands. She ascended to the throne on September 4, 1948, following her mother's abdication. Queen Juliana's reign was marked by a progressive and humanitarian approach, and she was beloved by the Dutch people for her down-to-earth nature and genuine concern for their well-being. Throughout her reign, Queen Juliana focused on social issues and played a significant role in rebuilding the country after the devastation of World War II. She worked to enhance the welfare state, championed social and economic equality, and strived for international peace and cooperation. Queen Juliana was a strong advocate of decolonization, and during her tenure, several territories gained independence, including Indonesia, Suriname, and the Netherlands Antilles. On April 30, 1980, Queen Juliana chose to abdicate the throne in favor of her eldest daughter, Beatrix, as part of a long-standing Dutch tradition of abdication in favor of the next generation. The day marked not only her 71st birthday but also the national holiday known as Queen's Day, a day for celebration and connection with the Dutch people. By abdicating at this time, Juliana ensured that the Dutch people would continue to associate this festive occasion with the monarchy. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, born Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard on January 31, 1938, was educated in the Netherlands and abroad. Like her mother, she studied at Leiden University, where she majored in law, economics, and sociology. Her reign, which lasted from 1980 to 2013, was characterized by strong support for European integration, commitment to environmental issues, and a continued focus on social welfare. Queen Beatrix also played a vital role in promoting Dutch culture and maintaining close relationships with other European royals. Continuing the tradition, Queen Beatrix abdicated the throne herself on April 30, 2013, in favor of her son, King Willem-Alexander.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  and the situation: Fred was a good athlete in his youth, and so was Vic.

The resort's three \\"worlds\\" are populated with lifelike androids that are practically indistinguishable from human beings, each programmed in character for their assigned historical environment. For 1,000 per day, guests may indulge in any adventure with the android population of the park, including sexual encounters and even a fight to the death. Delos' tagline in its advertising promises, \\"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\\" Peter Martin (Benjamin), a first-time Delos visitor, and his friend John Blane (Brolin), on a repeat visit, go to West World. One of the attractions is the Gunslinger (Brynner), a robot programmed to instigate gunfights. The firearms issued to the park guests have temperature sensors that prevent them from shooting humans or anything with a high body temperature but allow them to 'kill' the cold-blooded androids. The Gunslinger's programming allows guests to draw their guns and kill it, with the robot always returning the next day for another duel. The technicians running Delos notice problems beginning to spread like an infection among the androids: the robots in Roman World and Medieval World begin experiencing an increasing number of breakdowns and systemic failures, which are said to have spread to West World.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

To expand on the given phrase, let me provide some additional context and information. Water lilies are aquatic plants that grow in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving water bodies. They are characterized by their large, round leaves that float on the water surface and their beautiful, colorful flowers that bloom in various shades of white, pink, yellow, and purple. Water lilies serve as a popular subject matter for art, and they hold cultural significance in many societies. Ducks, on the other hand, are known for being a common type of waterfowl that can be found in various parts of the world. They are characterized by their webbed feet, which allow them to swim efficiently, and their unique quacking sound. Ducks are often found in freshwater bodies, making them perfect companions for water lilies in an illustration. In the context of the translated phrase \\"Water lily and ducks for coloring\\", it refers to a subject matter for coloring pages or art activities, engaging people of all ages, particularly children, in a creative and educational process. Coloring water lilies and ducks allows individuals to experiment with color combinations, learn more about these plants and animals, and practice their artistic skills. Coloring pages featuring water lilies and ducks provide an opportunity for parents and educators to introduce children to the natural world, teaching them about the beauty and importance of these species in their ecosystem. They are also a way for people to connect with nature, especially those who live in urban environments and have limited access to natural habitats. Furthermore, art activities such as coloring provide several benefits, such as: 1. Enhancing fine motor skills: Coloring involves the use of hands and fingers, which helps to improve dexterity and strength in these muscles. 2. Promoting creativity: Coloring pages provide a canvas for individuals to express themselves and experiment with their artistic abilities. 3. Boosting cognitive development: Choosing colors and applying them to the right areas of the coloring page can help to improve focus, concentration, and problem-solving skills. 4. Providing relaxation and stress relief: Coloring has been shown to have a calming effect on the mind, allowing individuals to unwind and take a break from daily stresses. In conclusion, the translated phrase \\"Water lily and ducks for coloring\\" refers not only to specific plant and animal subjects in an artistic setting but also to the opportunity for individuals to immerse themselves in a creative and educational activity that offers multiple benefits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

I read this background article the other day: Ants form symbiotic associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.  I am facing a new situation today: Greg was studying behavior of different organisms. He noticed that some organisms were showing inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case A. Then he noticed some other organisms didn't show any inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case B. He was astonished by the complicated interactions among organisms.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would case A see greater or smaller opportunity for food sources than case B? Answer:","output":"Case A would see a greater opportunity for food sources than case B.  Step 1: Understand the two cases - Case A involves organisms that show inquiline behavior, meaning they live within ant nests and can have various relationships with the ants. - Case B involves organisms that do not show any inquiline behavior, and thus, do not have these specific interactions with ants. Step 2: Relate the cases to the background knowledge - Ants form symbiotic associations with various species and can also be preyed upon by other animals. Inquilines, like in case A, may rely on ants, their larvae, and eggs, or on the food stores of the ants. - Inquilines may also benefit from protection within the ant nest, which can help them avoid predators. Step 3: Analyze the opportunities for food sources - Case A organisms, being inquilines, have access to multiple food sources within the ant nest. These include the ants themselves, their larvae and eggs, as well as the ants' food stores. This creates a greater opportunity to find food. - Case B organisms do not have these specialized relationships with ants, and thus, may not have the same level of access to food sources. Conclusion: Case A, with organisms showing inquiline behavior, would have a greater opportunity for food sources than case B, where organisms do not exhibit inquiline behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Build a movie plot around this: How many people does Perkins kidnap 14 Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Perkins' Captives\\" Genre: Crime, Thriller, Drama Plot Summary: Perkins is a methodical, enigmatic criminal mastermind who has always remained one step ahead of the authorities. Known for his signature of kidnapping exactly 14 people every time, his motives for these actions remain a mystery. Each of his captives has a unique background, skill set, and reason for being chosen. As the victims unravel the purpose behind their abduction, they must come together and use their combined talents to escape Perkins' grasp and bring him to justice. Act One: The movie opens in an undetermined city in a dimly lit and eerie warehouse, where Perkins, a mysterious and calculating kidnapper, has just taken his 14th victim, a renowned cybersecurity expert named Emma. The other 13 captives, who range from former military operatives to a gifted con artist, have been trapped together in a high-tech, booby-trapped cell for weeks. Meanwhile, the FBI, led by a determined and empathetic agent named Thomas, is investigating the case of the 14 actively kidnapped individuals. As they attempt to uncover Perkins' motives and location, they realize that each victim was taken for a specific reason and start searching for the connection between them. Act Two: Inside the cell, the captives start bonding and unraveling the reason behind Perkins' schemes. They discover that they each hold a piece of a much larger and sinister puzzle. Perkins had been carefully studying them for months, observing their strengths and weaknesses to orchestrate an elaborate heist to control a deeply hidden and dangerous underground criminal empire.  As the captives start to form a plan to escape, Perkins commences his final move, forcing them to cooperate or face deadly consequences. Each captive has no choice but to use their unique abilities to advance Perkins' agenda while secretly working together to devise a strategy to foil his plan. Act Three: Utilizing their combined skills and close bond, the captives execute a daring escape plan, narrowly avoiding Perkins' deadly traps, and liberating themselves. While some of the victims manage to escape, others are left to carry on the mission of dismantling Perkins' operation from the inside. As Thomas and the FBI close in on Perkins, they encounter Emma, who has managed to hack into Perkins' communication system. Emma's efforts, combined with the inside knowledge of the other captives, help them locate the rest of Perkins' facilities and uncover the extent of his criminal empire. In a thrilling chase sequence, the captives and FBI work together to apprehend Perkins, who ultimately falls victim to his own cunning plans. The captives, now united by a common experience, must rebuild their lives after their ordeal. Perkins is finally brought to justice by Thomas and the FBI, shedding light on the intricate intricacies of his twisted mind and the dangerous game he had been playing on the lives of his 14 captives. \\"The Perkins Captives\\" poses questions about the importance of empathy, trust, and teamwork in overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles, delivering an enthralling and suspenseful journey from beginning to end."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In Einstein's e=mc ,what does the 'c' represent?","output":"In Einstein's famous equation, E=mc², the 'c' signifies the speed of light in a vacuum. This groundbreaking formula, which was brought forward as part of Einstein's groundbreaking theory of relativity in 1905, establishes a direct connection between energy (E) and mass (m) through the constant of the speed of light (c). To appreciate the role that 'c' plays in this equation, it's essential to have a basic understanding of the theory of relativity. This theory primarily revolves around the idea that the laws of physics remain constant for all observers in an inertial frame of reference. Moreover, it unearths the idea that the speed of light is the same for all such observers, regardless of their relative motion or that of the light source. Digging a bit deeper, the speed of light (c) is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (or around 186,282 miles per second). From a practical standpoint, this means that light can travel seven and a half times around Earth's equator in just one second. In the context of Einstein's equation, the speed of light plays a pivotal role for several reasons: 1. Universal Constant: As mentioned earlier, the speed of light remains constant for all observers, making it a fundamental quantity in physicists' understanding of space-time. By incorporating this quantity in the equation, Einstein connected universal physical constants with the principles underpinning matter and energy. 2. Conversion Factor: By introducing 'c' as part of the equation, Einstein establishes a direct correlation between mass and energy. 'c' serves as a conversion factor that helps calculate how much energy can be obtained from a mass and vice versa. Intuitively, the equation suggests that a small amount of mass can be converted into an enormous amount of energy since 'c' is a large number, and the energy is related to the square of 'c'. 3. Linking Mass and Energy: Scientists can now analyze the mass-energy equivalence through this equation. 'c' operates as a binding parameter connecting two previously disconnected entities, warranting an entirely new perspective on the relationship between mass and energy. This connection has significant implications on various scientific fields, such as nuclear physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. To sum up, the 'c' in Einstein's E=mc² equation represents the speed of light in a vacuum, serving as a universal constant, conversion factor, and the linking component between mass and energy. This equation has had a profound impact on our comprehension of the universe, the atom, and the dynamic relationship between matter and energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Release them into the air by process of sporulation - Spores are carried by the wind - Land in a hospitable growing environment - The spores germinate into the soil - The mushroom starts growing - The adult mushroom produce spores of its own to repeat the process. Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the process is: Fungal mycelium develops and forms a fruiting body, which is the structure that will eventually produce and release spores. So, the revised and complete process of mushroom reproduction would be as follows: 1. Fungal mycelium develops and forms a fruiting body: Mushroom reproduction begins with the growth of mycelium, a network of thread-like structures called hyphae. Mycelium is the vegetative part of the fungus and plays a crucial role in the mushroom's growth and development. As the mycelium absorbs nutrients from the environment, it starts to form a fruiting body, which is the visible part of the mushroom that we typically recognize. 2. Release them into the air by the process of sporulation: When the fruiting body is fully developed, often in response to specific environmental conditions, it undergoes sporulation. During this process, the fruiting body releases millions of microscopic reproductive spores into the air. 3. Spores are carried by the wind: Once released, spores are carried by air currents, which can transport them significant distances from their original location. This dispersal mechanism helps ensure that the fungi can colonize new environments and prevents overcrowding in the existing location. 4. Land in a hospitable growing environment: As spores drift through the air, they eventually land in diverse locations. Only the spores that find a suitable environment, with the proper nutrients, temperature, and moisture levels, will be able to continue the life cycle. 5. The spores germinate into the soil: When conditions are favorable, the spores that have landed in a suitable habitat will germinate, and the hyphae will begin to grow. The new hyphae branch out into the soil, seeking out nutrients, and eventually forming more mycelium. 6. The mushroom starts growing: As the mycelium network grows and absorbs nutrients, it eventually forms a new fruiting body. The fruiting body emerges from the ground and becomes the visible part of the mushroom, undergoing growth and maturation. 7. The adult mushroom produces spores of its own to repeat the process: Once mature, the new mushroom's fruiting body undergoes sporulation, releasing spores into the air to continue the cycle. This ongoing process allows the mushroom species to reproduce and propagate throughout the environment, ensuring its survival and dispersal over time. In summary, the missing first step in the process of mushroom reproduction is the development of fungal mycelium and the formation of a fruiting body, which initiates the life cycle and leads to the production and dispersal of spores."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Title: First Timer or Lifetimer.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Books Of The Times By Michiko Kakutani A GOOD MAN IN AFRICA. By William Boyd. 342 pages. William Morrow and Company Inc. 14.50. MORGAN LEAFY has problems. The First Secretary of the British Deputy Commission in the West African country of Kinjanja, he is being blackmailed by a local politician. His plans to rig the country's elections have somehow gone awry and a coup is slowly brewing. To make matters worse, his black mistress, Hazel, is cheating on him. The luscious Priscilla Fanshawe, daughter of his boss and object of his ambitious lusts, has just announced her engagement to his hated rival. And her father is threatening to dismiss him - unless Morgan can promptly dispose of a smelly corpse, which, according to local beliefs, must be left to rot under the hot African sun. With his first book, ''A Good Man in Africa,'' William Boyd has made a fine and very funny contribution to that now familiar genre of the English comic novel. The plot is quick; the prose - for the most part - smooth; the humor, relentlessly black. Indeed ''Good Man'' frequently recalls the manner and tone perfected by such masters as Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis - it is as though Lucky Jim had been suddenly transported to the mythical kingdom of Azania in ''Black Mischief.'' Yet if Mr. Boyd's style is somewhat derivative, his protagonist, Morgan Leafy, still deserves a place of his own in the pantheon of modern British anti-heroes. He is not, at first glance, a terribly likable fellow: as he himself points out, he is frequently ''rude, sulky, bullying, selfish, unpleasant, hypocritical, cowardly, conceited.'' He resents his social betters for wearing Old School ties and for being the favored sons of ''a bourgeois, ex-public school God,'' and he is dismissive of his inferiors, relishing any opportunity to catch his servants napping. His person seems as blemished as his soul. Pale, fat and balding, Morgan is the unfortunate prisoner of his flesh, indulging whenever he can in women and drink. ''There were two good things about living in Africa,'' he says to himself. ''Beer and sex.'' ''They were the only things in his life that didn't consistently let him down. They sometimes did, but not in the randomly cruel and arbitrary way that the other features of the world conspired to confuse and frustrate him.'' Why do we care about such a loser? In part, because we have become accustomed to rooting for the underdog. In part because Mr. Boyd writes with such energetic irony. And in part because Morgan experiences something of a spiritual awakening: although this change is not, to my mind, clearly enough delineated, the title phrase ''Good Man'' undergoes a transformation of sorts by the end of the novel, from a derisively used rugger-club expression to an acknowledgement of real moral worth. The supporting cast of ''Good Man'' is sketched in with less detail, but just as much brio. To be sure, many of the characters are familiar comic types - the dim-witted, demanding boss and the voluptuous coquette; the bored, snooty British expatriates and the rhetoric-loving revolutionaries -but Mr. Boyd manages to invest many of them with memorable eccentricity. There is Deputy High Commissioner Fanshawe, who deals with his posting in this ''Godforsaken insignificant spot'' by nostalgically recalling his past assignments in the Far East and decorating his Commission residence as a cross between a Buddhist temple and a Chinese restaurant. And there is Sam Adekunle, the Harvard Business School-educated chieftain who employs such Western techniques as blackmail to pull off one of his country's biggest real estate scams. Although Mr. Boyd's Africa is not quite so outrageous a place as Waugh's - none of the satiric capers in ''Good Man'' comes close to the ''Birth Control Gala'' in ''Black Mischief'' - it possesses a similar emotional geography. It is an absurd and eminently corrupt place, Kinjanja -a place where both the natives and post-colonial Britons are opportunists, bent on taking advantage of the country's ''dangerous languor.'' Thanks to the author's first-hand knowledge of the continent - he grew up in Nigeria and Ghana - the fictional landscape is also well grounded in particulars of time and place. There are, of course, things a reader might quarrel with: Mr. Boyd's penchant for broad humor and narrative pratfalls makes, at times, for an irritating glibness; and his technical mastery of the novel form obscures the fact that he has yet to develop a voice that is truly his own - the echoes of his predecessors haunt the achievement of this book. Still, this remains a precocious debut indeed, and I eagerly await Mr. Boyd's next novel.","output":"\\"A Good Man in Africa\\" by William Boyd is a darkly humorous novel set in the West African nation of Kinjanja. The book explores the tormented life of its central character, Morgan Leafy, a First Secretary of the British Deputy Commission who finds himself entangled in political blackmail, a faltering love life, duplicitous election-rigging plans, and a looming coup. Morgan, who's revealed as an unlikable, flawed character battling personal and professional crises, eventually experiences a form of spiritual awakening. Despite drawing comparisons with other British comic novels and having a style reminiscent of Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis, Boyd's work distinguishes itself with his vivid portrayal of a corrupt and absurd Africa grounded in details of time and place due to the author's own upbringing there. The supporting cast of characters adds a layer of eccentricity to the narrative, combining familiar comic archetypes with unique personalities contributing to the tangled chaos in Kinjanja. Though critique could be levied on the author's broad humor and over-bearing echoes of his predecessors, the book is seen as a promising debut offering from Boyd."},{"instruction":"Given the following passage  \\"Red is one of the most common colors used on national flags.

Please answer the following question: What were the names of the streams where the sawmills were located?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek served as an area for settlers to establish homesteads and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek was a source of power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek led to the development of many small sawmills: the Larrys Creek watershed once had 53 sawmills within 22 miles (35 km) of the mouth (as well as other industries of the time). No other stream in the country had so many sawmills in so small a territory. Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on Canoe Run and Lawshe Run, and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. Eight were structures rebuilt on the site of previous sawmills, and only four were steam powered (the rest were water powered). The earliest of these sawmills was built in 1796 (near Seeley Run), the last in 1902 (on Lawshe Run), and by 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating.Lumbering removed the tree trunks, but left many flammable limbs, branches, and stumps behind.

Question: Who helps Brent and Nova escape the gorillas ?s Title: Beneath the Planet of the Apes Movie plot: Following the events of Planet of the Apes, time-displaced astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston) and the mute Nova (Linda Harrison) are riding on horseback through the desert of the Forbidden Zone. Without warning, fire shoots up from the ground and deep chasms open. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes. Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second spaceship has crash landed after being sent to search for Taylor and his crew. Like Taylor's ship, it has traveled into Earth's distant future. However, surviving astronaut Brent (James Franciscus) believes he has traveled to another planet. He encounters Nova and notices she is wearing Taylor's dog tags. Hoping Taylor is still alive, he rides with her to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover the simian civilization. He observes the gorilla General Ursus (James Gregory) leading a rally calling for the apes to conquer the Forbidden Zone and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the orangutan Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans). Brent is wounded by a gorilla soldier and taken by Nova to the home of the chimpanzees Cornelius (David Watson) and Zira (Kim Hunter), who treat his wound and tell him of their time with Taylor. The humans hide when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone. Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. They hide in a cave which Brent soon discovers is the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway, making him realize that he has traveled through time to Earth's post-apocalyptic future. After following a humming sound deeper into the underground tunnels, Brent begins to hear voices telling him to kill Nova. Entering the remains of St. Patrick's Cathedral, he finds a population of telepathic humans who worship an ancient nuclear bomb. Brent and Nova are captured and telepathically...

They have also served vehicles and crew-released heavy weapons in 1 : 6 scale . They have also released vehicles and serve heavy weapons in scale 1 : 6 .","output":"Though the two sentences are fairly similar and discuss a similar subject matter, they do not have the exact same meaning due to differences in verb usage and the order of concepts. 1. \\"They have also served vehicles and crew-released heavy weapons in 1 : 6 scale.\\" In this sentence, serving seems to denote supporting or carrying out a function for the vehicles and the crew-released heavy weapons in a 1:6 scale. Here, \\"served\\" could potentially suggest a variety of actions depending on context, such as manufacturing, maintenance, or operation. It indicates some form of support or execution of duties. The adjective \\"crew-released\\" indicates that the heavy weapons were released by a crew.  The provided scale (1:6) means the objects in consideration, which are vehicles and heavy-weapons, are significantly smaller than their real-life counterparts. The ratio indicates the model's size relative to the real thing. If, for example, the model is 1 foot long and the real vehicle is 6 feet long, the ratio is 1:6. 2. \\"They have also released vehicles and serve heavy weapons in scale 1 : 6 .\\" This sentence suggests they have released (perhaps meaning manufactured or marketed) both vehicles and heavy weapons in a 1:6 scale. Here, the term \\"serve\\" is used in association only with heavy weapons. This separation from the vehicles might suggest two different sets of actions—perhaps they manufacture vehicles and use or operate heavy weapons. Again, \\"scale 1:6\\" refers to the size of the vehicles and heavy weapons, which are significantly smaller than their real-life counterparts. In summary, the two sentences cannot be seen as interchangeable because they convey different roles that \\"they\\" seem to fulfill, particularly whether \\"they\\" are serving both vehicles and heavy weapons or releasing vehicles and serving heavy weapons. Additionally, the first sentence insinuates that the crew releases the heavy weapons, but the second sentence does not specify who does the releasing. As a result, the two sentences yield slightly different interpretations due to variations in the procession of the activities represented by the verbs and the structuring of the sentence. Their meanings are somewhat similar but not exactly the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti.  Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini.  One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"Sardou"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then they came up with an idea -- they would use two machines to keep her blood _ in her body. After waiting for about four months, D' Zhana had another heart transplant. It was very successful. When doctors use a man-made heart to keep a patient's life, they usually leave the patient's own heart in the body. \\"She, we believe, is possibly one of the youngest that had the machines without her own heart,\\" one of D' Zhana Simmons' doctors said.

Hypothesis: The items are in a junky room .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Yes, if the premise is true and it states that umbrellas and junk are sitting in a messy room, we can conclude that the items are in a junky room. To thoroughly explain this conclusion, let's break down the premise and hypothesis and analyze them. Premise: Umbrellas and junk sitting in a messy room The premise provides a description of a situation where two kinds of items, umbrellas and junk, are present in a room. Additionally, the room is characterized as messy. A messy room typically implies that the items within it are disorganized, cluttered, or strewn about in a chaotic manner. This characteristic is important to understanding the overall scenario, as it provides context for the state of the room and helps justify the hypothesis. Hypothesis: The items are in a junky room The hypothesis suggests that the items, which are the umbrellas and junk identified in the premise, are in a room that is described as junky. The term \\"junky\\" can be synonymous with messy, cluttered, or disorganized. In this context, a \\"junky room\\" implies a room filled with items in a disorderly and chaotic state. When comparing the description of the room in the premise (messy) and in the hypothesis (junky), they both convey a similar state of disarray and disorganization. With this understanding, we can logically conclude that if the premise is true and umbrellas and junk are indeed sitting in a messy room, the items are in a junky room as described by the hypothesis. However, the given premise alone doesn't provide a complete picture of all possible factors contributing to the room's messiness or junkiness. There might be additional reasons why a room appears cluttered or disorganized, other items in the room could also contribute to the overall messiness. In this case, umbrellas and junk are only two contributing elements to the messiness of the room, but the hypothesis is still true when considering the given premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process: - Magma comes up to the surface of the earth - The magma cools - Particles inside the magma move closer together - Crystals are formed - The crystals contain minerals.  Question: suppose less butterflies around happens, how will it affect If more magma comes out of a volcano.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"C: No effect To fully understand why there is no effect on the amount of magma coming out of a volcano when there are fewer butterflies, let us first discuss the processes involved in both volcanic activity and the presence of butterflies, and then analyze the relationship between the two phenomena. 1. Volcanic activity: The formation of magma and its movement towards Earth's surface involve a series of geologic processes. Magma is formed when temperatures and pressures in the Earth's mantle cause rocks to partially melt, creating a molten mixture of minerals at extremely high temperatures (around 700°C to 1300°C). This magma rises to the surface due to the difference in density between the solid rock in Earth's crust and the molten mixture in the mantle. As the magma approaches the surface, it may encounter structural weaknesses or fractures, which can lead to the formation of volcanic conduits and ultimately an eruption. When magma reaches the surface, it can cool to form solid rock, depending on how fast the cooling process takes place. The cooling mechanism affects the crystal formation of minerals in the rock. 2. Butterfly population: Butterflies are insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera. They play an essential role in pollination, as they help transfer pollen between plants while feeding on nectar, thereby enabling reproduction in a wide range of plant species. The butterfly population can be affected by numerous factors, such as habitat loss, climate change, pesticides, and the availability of food sources (nectar-producing plants). These factors can lead to fluctuations in butterfly numbers, resulting in more or fewer butterflies in a specific environment. Now, let us analyze the relationship between volcanic activity and butterfly populations. Geologic processes, such as plate tectonics and mantle convection, drive the creation, movement, and eruption of magma. These processes occur independently of biological systems, including butterfly populations. The presence or absence of butterflies has no direct impact on geological processes and would not affect the amount of magma coming out of a volcano. In summary, considering both volcanic activity and butterfly populations, we can conclude that the number of butterflies in the environment has no direct effect on the amount or rate of magma emerging from a volcano. Therefore, the answer is C: No effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking, but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) It wasn't an android at all, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh. The popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they'd done it properly. In fact, the modernization of sex-bots are in the news as I speak. Robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made, so they could have at least had her act like one.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - Ayreon is a musical project by Dutch songwriter, singer, multi-instrumentalist musician and record producer Arjen Anthony Lucassen. Ayreon's music is described as progressive rock, progressive metal and power metal sometimes combined with genres such as folk, electronica, experimental and classical music. The majority of Ayreon's albums are dubbed \\"rock operas\\" (or \\"metal operas\\") because the albums contain complex storylines featuring a host of characters, usually with each one being represented by a unique vocalist.  - A bass-baritone is a high-lying bass or low-lying \\"classical\\" baritone voice type which shares certain qualities with the true baritone voice. The term arose in the late 19th century to describe the particular type of voice required to sing three Wagnerian roles: the Dutchman in \\"Der fliegende Holländer\\", Wotan/Der Wanderer in the \\"Ring Cycle\\" and Hans Sachs in \\"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\\". Wagner labelled these roles as \\"Hoher Bass\\" (\\"high bass\\")see fach for more details.  - A choir (also known as a chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers. Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the Medieval era to the present, and/or popular music repertoire. Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm and face gestures.  - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor.  - Vocal range is the measure of the breadth of pitches that a human voice can phonate. Although the study of vocal range has little practical application in terms of speech, it is a topic of study within linguistics, phonetics, and speech and language pathology, particularly in relation to the study of tonal languages and certain types of vocal disorders. However, the most common application of the term \\"vocal range\\" is within the context of singing, where it is used as one of the major defining characteristics for classifying singing voices into groups known as voice types.  - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - Shadow Project was an alt-rock/goth metal band formed in 1987 featuring former members of Los Angeles deathrock groups Christian Death and Super Heroines. After recording two LP records the group experienced a three-year hiatus, reconvening for a third and final album. Shadow Project definitively folded after vocalist Rozz Williams committed suicide in April 1, 1998.  - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk.  - Eric Clayton ( born December 1 , 1967 ) is an American singer - songwriter and musician , best known for his work in the influential gothic symphonic metal group Saviour Machine which he formed with his brother Jeff Clayton in 1989 . Eric Clayton is notable for his deep baritone operatic vocals , and he has done guest vocals on Ayreon 's album The Human Equation , Divinefire 's album Glory Thy Name , Narnia 's album The Great Fall , Wedding Party 's album Anthems , and Eva O 's album Damnation ( Ride the Madness ) as well as Seventh Circle 's album \`\` The Struggle .

Christian Death is cited by some as a pioneer of the American gothic rock scene as well as deathrock. Williams was also involved with Daucus Karota, Heltir, and EXP; he also recorded several solo albums.  - Damnation (Ride the Madness) is the 1999 studio solo album of the American deathrock veteran musician Eva O, released on the German label Massacre Records. The album was announced as the first half of a two album set, but the sequel, to be titled \\"Salvation (Are You Ready to Die?)\\", was not released. Her 2005 album \\"Damnation/Salvation\\" includes rerecorded versions of songs from this album along with the \\"Salvation (Are You Ready to Die?)\\" songs.  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - Electronica is an umbrella term that encompasses a broad group of electronic-based styles such as techno, house, ambient, drum and bass, jungle, and industrial dance, among others. It has been used to describe the rise of electronic music styles intended not just for dancing but also concentrated listening.  - Delain is a Dutch symphonic metal band formed in 2002 by former Within Temptation keyboardist Martijn Westerholt, and Charlotte Wessels. The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\".  - Divinefire is a symphonic power/thrash metal group founded in the spring of 2004 by Finnish guitarist Jani Stefanovic, and Swedish singer Christian Liljegren. Liljegren is the former frontman of the band Narnia.  - Christian Death is an American deathrock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1979 by Rozz Williams. They became a highly influential act, heralding the American gothic rock and deathrock movements.  - Eva Ortiz (born January 11, 1961), better known as Eva O, is a music artist most notable for her previous works in Christian Death and a band she formed with her then-husband Rozz Williams called Shadow Project. Regarded as a veteran and \\"one of the most striking figures of the American Gothic scene,\\" Eva O has had a significant influence on the emerging deathrock movement, which garnered her the \\"Queen of Darkness\\" title from the press and audience. She is known for her heavy guitar playing style and dramatic, authoritative vocals.  - A baritone is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range lies between the bass and the tenor voice types. It is the most common male voice. Originally from the Greek , meaning \\"deep (or heavy) sounding\\", music for this voice is typically written in the range from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C (i.e. FF) in choral music, and from the second A below middle C to the A above middle C (A to A) in operatic music, but can be extended at either end. The baritone voice type is generally divided into the baryton-Martin baritone (light baritone), lyric baritone, \\"Kavalierbariton\\", Verdi baritone, dramatic baritone, \\"baryton-noble\\" baritone, and the bass-baritone.  - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock.  - Arjen Anthony Lucassen (born 3 April 1960, Netherlands) is a Dutch progressive metal/rock songwriter, singer, multi-instrumentalist musician and record producer, best known for his long-running progressive opera project titled Ayreon.  - Devin Garrett Townsend (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian musician, songwriter and record producer. He was the founder, songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist in extreme metal band Strapping Young Lad from 1994 to 2007 and has an extensive career as a solo artist.  - Jani Stefanovic (Born May 23, 1979) is a Swedish multi-instrumentalist that primarily plays Swedish death metal. Jani started playing around the age of 1314 years old.  - The Human Equation is the sixth album from the progressive rock project Ayreon by Dutch musician Arjen Anthony Lucassen, released on 25 May 2004 via InsideOut Music. As with other Ayreon albums, it features guest appearances from several musicians previously unrelated to the project, including James LaBrie of Dream Theater, Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth, Eric Clayton of Saviour Machine, and Devin Townsend, performing music arranged and written by Lucassen.  - Massacre Records is an independent record label based in Abstatt, Germany.   - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\".  - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers.  - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted.  - Progressive metal (sometimes known as prog metal or technical metal) is a fusion genre melding heavy metal and progressive rock which combines the loud \\"aggression\\" and amplified guitar-driven sound of the former with the more experimental, cerebral or \\"pseudo-classical\\" compositions of the latter. Whilst the genre emerged towards the late-1980s, it was not until the 1990s that progressive metal achieved commercial success. Dream Theater, Queensrÿche, Tool, Symphony X and Fates Warning are a few examples of progressive metal bands who achieved commercial success; additionally, many other thrash and death metal bands started to incorporate elements of progressive music in their work. Progressive metal's popularity started to decline towards the end of the 1990s, but it still remains a largely diffused underground genre with a committed fan base.  - A film score (also sometimes called background score, background music, movie soundtrack, film music or incidental music) is original music written specifically to accompany a film. The score forms part of the film's soundtrack, which also usually includes dialogue and sound effects, and comprises a number of orchestral, instrumental, or choral pieces called cues, which are timed to begin and end at specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question. Scores are written by one or more composers, under the guidance of, or in collaboration with, the film's director or producer and are then usually performed by an ensemble of musicians  most often comprising an orchestra or band, instrumental soloists, and choir or vocalists  and recorded by a sound engineer.  - Kevin James LaBrie (born May 5, 1963) is a Canadian vocalist and songwriter, who is best known as the lead singer of the American progressive metal band Dream Theater.  - Lars Mikael Åkerfeldt (born 17 April 1974) is a Swedish musician, prominently known as the lead vocalist, guitarist, and primary songwriter of progressive death metal band Opeth, as well as being the former vocalist of death metal supergroup Bloodbath. He was also guitarist for the \\"one-off\\" band Steel, and is part of the collaboration Storm Corrosion with Steven Wilson.  - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.  - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre.  - Deathrock is a subgenre of punk rock incorporating horror elements and spooky atmospherics, that emerged on the West Coast of the United States in the early 1980s.  - Dream Theater is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 under the name Majesty by John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy while they attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010, when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011.  - Christian metal, also known as white metal or heavenly metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity. Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks.  - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences.  - Opeth is a Swedish heavy metal band from Stockholm, formed in 1989. The group has been through several personnel changes, but singer, guitarist and songwriter Mikael Åkerfeldt has remained Opeth's primary driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Opeth is also well known for their incorporation of Mellotrons in their work. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of \\"Blackwater Park\\", they have led several major world tours.  - Saviour Machine was an American Christian metal band that formed in 1989. They have released five studio albums and two live albums on Frontline and subsequently on MCM Music, distributed through Massacre Records. Saviour Machine's music and lyrics deal with war, death, and personal introspection as it relates to prophecy and divine revelation.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Damnation/Salvation is the 2005 studio solo album of the American deathrock veteran musician Eva O, released on the Dark Dimensions and Alice In... labels.

Article: Adrian Peterson has been suspended without pay for at least the remainder of this season.      The NFL announced its highly anticipated ruling Tuesday morning, stating that the Minnesota Vikings' star running back will not be considered for reinstatement before April 15, 2015, for violating the league's personal conduct policy.      Editor's Picks Goessling: Peterson's time in Minnesota likely over The NFL's punishment of Adrian Peterson was so thorough it likely means the end of Peterson's time in Minnesota, Ben Goessling writes.      The league said it informed Peterson of the ruling in a letter from commissioner Roger Goodell, who spelled out a path for his return to the field.      The Vikings have six games left this season. The league's enhanced disciplinary policy calls for a six-game suspension for first offenses of assault, battery or domestic violence. Aggravating circumstances warrant higher levels of discipline, and Goodell's letter to Peterson spelled that out.      But a league source told ESPN's Ed Werder that it is \\"very possible\\" that Peterson could return to the field for this Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers, pending a ruling by the independent arbitrator in Monday's grievance hearing.      The NFL Players Association quickly announced its plan to appeal and sharply rebuked what it calls the league's inconsistency and unfairness in the process.      If arbitrator Shyam Das rules in favor of Peterson, he could play while his appeal of Tuesday's suspension is heard, according to rules laid out in the NFL's collective bargaining agreement. Goodell, under the CBA, would decide who hears Peterson's appeal.      Another source told ESPN's Chris Mortensen that if Das decides Peterson should be reinstated, the issue will become more complex and \\"there will be many lawyers involved.\\"      \\"You have shown no meaningful remorse for your conduct. When indicted, you acknowledged what you did but said that you would not 'eliminate whooping my kids' and defended your conduct in numerous published text messages to the child's mother. You also said that you felt 'very confident with my actions because I know my intent.' These comments raise the serious concern that you do not fully appreciate the seriousness of your conduct, or even worse, that you may feel free to engage in similar conduct in the future.\\" Excerpt from NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's letter to Adrian Peterson      Peterson was indicted in September on a felony charge of injury to a child for using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son earlier this year. The All-Pro pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of misdemeanor reckless assault Nov. 4, setting the stage for the NFL's ruling.      Peterson was placed on a special exempt list at the sole discretion of Goodell on Sept. 18, essentially paid leave while his case went through the legal system.      The NFLPA said Peterson was told that would count as time served for any suspension levied, citing an unnamed NFL executive. League spokesman Brian McCarthy told The Associated Press in an email that Peterson's stay on the exempt list was taken into account.      \\"There were aggravating circumstances that led to the discipline announced,\\" McCarthy told the AP.      The league's statement included excerpts of the letter written by Goodell, who has required that Peterson undergo counseling and treatment in order to be reinstated.      \\"We are prepared to put in place a program that can help you to succeed, but no program can succeed without your genuine and continuing engagement,\\" Goodell wrote in the letter. \\"You must commit yourself to your counseling and rehabilitative effort, properly care for your children, and have no further violations of law or league policy.\\"      The Vikings also released a statement, saying they \\"respect the league's decision and will have no further comment at this time.\\"      Peterson's case revived a debate about corporal punishment, which is on the decline in the U.S. but still widely practiced in homes and schools. Peterson has repeatedly claimed that he never intended to harm his son and was disciplining him in the same way he had been as a child growing up in East Texas.      Goodell, however, expressed concern in his letter that Peterson does not \\"fully appreciate the seriousness\\" of his conduct.      \\"You have shown no meaningful remorse for your conduct,\\" Goodell's letter said. \\"When indicted, you acknowledged what you did but said that you would not 'eliminate whooping my kids' and defended your conduct in numerous published text messages to the child's mother. You also said that you felt 'very confident with my actions because I know my intent.'      \\"These comments raise the serious concern that you do not fully appreciate the seriousness of your conduct, or even worse, that you may feel free to engage in similar conduct in the future.\\" ||||| MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Adrian Peterson's potential return to the Minnesota Vikings is at the heart of a dispute between the NFL and the players' association, and the star running back thinks the league is being unfair.      Peterson criticized the NFL on Sunday over the process of being activated from a special exempt list after he pleaded no contest Nov. 4 to misdemeanor reckless assault in Texas for hitting his 4-year-old son with a wooden switch.      The union filed a grievance with the league, demanding Peterson be allowed to rejoin the Vikings until the determination of any punishment under the personal conduct policy. The NFL, however, ruled Peterson must remain on paid leave in the meantime.      Commissioner Roger Goodell has the sole power to remove him from the special exempt list.      \\"At this point, I've resolved my matter in the criminal court; I've worked to make amends for what I've done; I've missed most of the season, and I stand ready to be candid and forthcoming with Mr. Goodell about what happened,\\" Peterson said in a statement issued by the NFL Players Association.      \\"However, I will not allow the NFL to impose a new process of discipline on me, ignore the CBA, ignore the deal they agreed to with me, and behave without fairness or accountability. The process they are pushing is arbitrary, inconsistent, and contrary to what they agreed to do, and for those reasons, I never agreed to the hearing.\\"      The NFL offered Peterson the hearing, but a hearing is only required by the CBA if a player elects to appeal a punishment. In this case, no decision has been made yet on discipline. The NFL's enhanced penalty for players involved in domestic violence, announced by Goodell in August, is a six-game suspension. The injuries to Peterson's son occurred in May. Peterson said he meant no harm in his attempt to discipline the boy.      The league had no further comment Sunday, referring to its statement from the previous day that it offered three days in advance a hearing for Peterson that would have been held Friday to review the case. The union then informed the league Thursday of its refusal to meet.      In the statement, Peterson said the NFLPA sent repeated questions to the NFL about the nature and purpose of the hearing that went unanswered.      \\"After consulting with the union, I told the NFL that I will attend the standard meeting with the Commissioner prior to possible imposition of discipline, as has been the long-term practice under the CBA, but I wouldn't participate in a newly created and non-collectively bargained pre-discipline 'hearing' that would include outside people I don't know and who would have roles in the process that the NFL wouldn't disclose,\\" Peterson said.      Regarding the grievance, an arbitrator was scheduled to hear arguments from both sides Monday. That's only to determine whether Peterson should be immediately reinstated prior to the league's issuance of any discipline. He could, in theory, be ordered back to the team only to be suspended soon after.      But as Minnesota played Chicago Sunday, time was running out on this season for the 2012 NFL MVP. The Vikings have six games left after this weekend.      ___      AP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL |||||Summary:","output":"Adrian Peterson, the Minnesota Vikings' star running back, has been suspended without pay for at least the remainder of this season.

(CNN) -- The wife of fugitive Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, three of his children and some of his grandchildren arrived in Algeria on Monday morning, Algerian diplomats said.  Mourad Benmehidi, the Algerian ambassador to the United Nations, said he relayed the news to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon earlier Monday. Benmehidi said his country granted entrance to Gadhafi's wife, Safia, his daughter, Aisha, sons Hannibal and Mohamed and their children on \\"humanitarian grounds.\\"  \\"We made sure the international community has been informed,\\" said Benmehidi.  The ambassador said he did not know whether Moammar Gadhafi was expected to seek entry into Algeria and claimed none of the Gadhafis were subject to U.N. Security Council sanctions.  In fact, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970, passed on February 26, includes the names of all three Gadhafi children who are now in Algeria as being subject to a \\"travel ban\\" because of their \\"closeness of association with (the) regime.\\"  The U.N. ban requires \\"all member states\\" to prevent them and others listed from entering their territories, unless there is some special circumstance that the council agrees warrants an exception. The resolution also allows the nation -- in this case, Algeria -- to determine \\"on a case-by-case basis that such entry or transit is required to advance peace and stability (and) notifies the committee within 48 hours after making such a determination.\\"  News on Monday of the Gadhafi relatives' departure from Libya came the same day that a senior rebel commander reported that Khamis Gadhafi, a son of the Libyan leader and military commander in his regime, had been killed Sunday night.  1.

Answer the following question: Background: Millions of people in the world jog for exercise. For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body.  Paragraph: Kevin and his cousin Darlene both enjoy jogging for exercise. One day, Kevin goes out for a jog in his local neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is quite high, and he begins to sweat a lot and starts to feel a bit dizzy. On the same day, Darlene goes jogging in her neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is low and she feels perfectly normal as she continues to jog.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency. This is due to several factors that are present in his situation, compared to Darlene's. Firstly, the amount of heat outside is quite high when Kevin goes for a jog. This can contribute to excessive sweating as his body tries to cool itself down in response to the increased temperature. When a person sweats a lot, it leads to a loss of electrolytes, which are essential minerals like sodium, potassium, and magnesium that play vital roles in regulating various body functions, including muscle contractions and maintaining fluid balance. The paragraph also mentions that Kevin starts to feel dizzy during his jog. Dizziness is one of the early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency, which can result from excessive sweating and subsequent loss of electrolytes. This further supports the likelihood of Kevin experiencing electrolyte deficiency. On the other hand, Darlene goes jogging in her neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is low. This implies that Darlene is less likely to be sweating excessively and consequently, she has a lower risk of losing significant amounts of electrolytes. Moreover, she feels perfectly normal while jogging, which indicates that she doesn't appear to be experiencing any symptoms of electrolyte deficiency, such as nausea, fatigue, or dizziness. In conclusion, considering the various factors and symptoms present in the given paragraph, Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency when compared to Darlene. Proper intervention, such as consuming sports drinks or electrolyte supplements, would be necessary to quickly restore the electrolytes in Kevin's body and prevent further complications, such as muscle weakness or a potentially life-threatening impact on his heart rate."},{"instruction":"Context: Robin was sleeping at their friends house and had woken up very early before anyone else was up, so Robin made their coffee for them.

We have a math problem with a bunch of numbers and the letter \\"y.\\" We're trying to find out what number y represents. Here's the problem: 1738*y - 3593*y + 250 + 174 = -1802*y First, let's add together the numbers that have a \\"y\\" with them. We've got 1738*y, -3593*y, and -1802*y on the other side of the equal sign.  When you combine these together, you get: 1738*y - 3593*y + 1802*y = (1738 - 3593 + 1802) * y = (-53) * y So, now our problem looks like this: -53*y + 250 + 174 = 0 Now, let's add the other numbers we have - 250 and 174. 250 + 174 = 424 Now, our problem looks like this: -53*y + 424 = 0 Our goal is to find out what y is, so we'll need to get y all by itself. To do that, we'll move the 424 from the left side of the equal sign to the right side. We do this by subtracting 424 from both sides: -53*y = -424 Now, we have -53 * y = -424. To find out what y is, we'll divide both sides of the equal sign by -53: y = -424 / -53 When you divide -424 by -53, you get: y = 8 So, the answer to the math problem is y = 8!

It is only later when he has aged and been through many battles that he learns an important lesson: there is no \\"I \\" in \\"team\\". There is no better example of the value of teamwork than the Boston Celtics. Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett were all superstars on three different teams. Yet, none of them had any titles to show for it. Then, last season, they decided to sacrifice money and individual statistics to play together. Garnett and Allen joined Pierce on the Celtics and changed the NBA in the process. It started in simple ways. Garnett and Allen are two of the most intense athletes in the world. They treat every second of every practice like it is the NBA championship. If you want to play alongside them then you will have to do the same. So, the young guys on the Celtics started giving their full effort too. Pierce had been the star of the Celtics for many years. He used to shoot the ball many times a game. But with the addition of Allen and Garnett he shot less and focused on defense. His selflessness showed the young players that doing what made the team better was the only thing that mattered. When the Celtics were winning and the game was almost over, Garnett, Pierce and Allen would come out of the game. But they wouldn't just sit on the bench. Instead, they stood and cheered and screamed for their teammates. They wanted to support their friends and teammates. Now, the guys who don't play know they can still affect the game by cheering so they scream and cheer when Garnett, Allen and Pierce are playing. The Celtics have developed a strong relationship. They are more than just teammates. They are brothers. The result: the Boston Celtics won the championship and are considered the favorites to win the Eastern Conference championship again this year. There is a saying that goes, \\"A successful team beats with one heart.\\" If that is the case, the Celtics may have the biggest heart in the NBA. Question: Which of the following didn't contribute to the success of the Boston Celtics?

What sentence would provide a factual answer to this question: \\"Why would happen if the screw was loose on a bicycle's tire?\\"","output":"If the screw was loose on a bicycle's tire, several potential consequences could arise, depending on various factors, such as the location of the loose screw, the degree of looseness, and the type of tire and wheel system involved. In general, a loose screw may compromise the stability and integrity of a bicycle's tire, potentially leading to decreased performance, safety hazards, or even damage to the bicycle and its components. 1. Decreased performance: A loose screw on a bicycle's tire may cause wobbling or vibrations while riding, leading to an uncomfortable and less efficient cycling experience. This could result in increased difficulty in maintaining balance, navigating turns, or accelerating, all of which might negatively impact a cyclist's speed and overall performance. 2. Safety hazards: A loose screw on a bicycle's tire may increase the chances of various safety risks, such as punctures or tire blowouts. If the screw happens to be a part of the tire's bead, which secures the tire's edges to the wheel rim, a loose screw could mean the tire is not properly attached and may come off the rim while riding. Depending on the speed and the nature of the terrain, this situation could lead to accidents, injuries, or damage to the bicycle. 3. Damage to bicycle components: A loose screw on a bicycle's tire might lead to long-term damage to the wheel, the tire, or other associated components. For instance, if the screw is responsible for connecting the rim to the bicycle hub and remains loose over time, the wobbling and vibrations could lead to additional strain on spoke tension and can eventually cause the spokes to break. This, in turn, may lead to a warped or damaged rim, which could necessitate costly repairs or replacements. 4. Uneven tire wear: In cases where the loose screw is located on the tire's valve or is part of a tubeless tire system, it could lead to an uneven distribution of air pressure within the tire. This might speed up the tire's wear in specific areas, as opposed to the usual uniform wear. In turn, this uneven wear may necessitate premature replacement of the tire. In conclusion, a loose screw on a bicycle's tire can cause a range of issues, from decreased performance to safety hazards and damage to the bicycle's components. To maintain optimal functionality and safety, it is crucial to regularly inspect one's bicycle for loose screws and tighten or replace them as needed."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What is an interesting fact about the Cretaceious, or than chalk?\\"  Context: \\"To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"An interesting fact about the Cretaceous period, also known as \\"the age of chalk,\\" is that it witnessed the most extensive chalk formation in Earth's history. This unique geological phenomenon occurred due to the interplay of various factors, including shifting tectonic plates, changes in ocean chemistry, and the evolution of calcareous nanoplankton, which significantly contributed to the massive chalk deposits. During the Cretaceous period, the Tethys Sea continued to narrow as shallow seas advanced across central North America and Europe. At its peak, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged underwater, leaving marine deposits and coal beds as evidence of the transgression. As the continents underwent significant changes in their positions and shapes, the shifting of tectonic plates resulted in the emergence of mid-ocean ridges. These mid-ocean ridges played a crucial role in the formation of chalk by allowing seawater to circulate through them, enriching the oceans with calcium. This increase in calcium saturation not only created ideal conditions for chalk formation but also enhanced the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton – microscopic marine organisms that use calcium to build their shells. These nanoplankton thrived in the Cretaceous oceans and, upon their death, their calcareous shells sank to the seafloor and accumulated, ultimately creating massive chalk deposits over time. The extensive chalk formations from the Cretaceous period have contributed significantly to the rich geological record preserved in various locations across the globe. Famous examples include Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member, teeming with marine fossils, and the Hell Creek Formation, which contains fossils of terrestrial fauna. In addition to North America, the Cretaceous chalk formations are also evident in Europe and China. Another noteworthy geological event that occurred during the late Cretaceous and early Paleocene was the formation of the Deccan Traps in present-day India. Massive lava flows covered the region, creating layers of basaltic rock that still remain today. These volcanic eruptions may have played a role in the mass extinction event marking the end of the Cretaceous period. In conclusion, the Cretaceous period holds significant importance as the age of chalk, with more chalk formations occurring during this time than in any other period of Earth's Phanerozoic history. This fascinating fact can be attributed to the interplay of tectonic movements, changes in ocean chemistry, and the proliferation of calcareous nanoplankton – a remarkable testament to the dynamic geological processes that shaped our planet during this era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:-  The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat -   What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"A: The first step of the process causing the sequence of events mentioned above is most likely a forest fire, also known as a wildfire. Forest fires are uncontrolled fires that occur in areas with dense vegetation, such as forests, woodlands, or grasslands. These fires can be ignited by both natural and human factors and spread at various speeds depending on fuel availability, weather conditions, and topography. Natural factors that contribute to forest fires can include lightning, volcanic eruptions, and spontaneous combustion from decaying organic matter. Human factors causing wildfires are often due to careless activities, such as unattended campfires, discarded cigarettes, or even intentional arson activities. Once a forest fire begins, it consumes trees, plants, and other organic materials in its path, leading to a series of consequences that impact the ecosystem. The smoke produced by burning trees and plants, for example, can pose a serious threat to animals living in the forest. These animals often lose their homes due to the destruction of their habitat, forcing them to migrate or perish in the flames. When smoke inhalation becomes too much for those that do not escape the fire, there's a risk for many animals to die due to suffocation and respiratory issues. With the destruction of plants and trees, the food sources for these animals become scarce, leading to a significant decrease in available nourishment. Furthermore, these events can create a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem. Herbivores lose their primary food sources, which in turn affects predators that rely on herbivores for sustenance. The loss of vegetation can also result in soil erosion, diminished air quality, and alteration of the landscape, making the recovery process for the ecosystem slow and challenging. The key to preventing such catastrophic events from happening is understanding the importance of forest fire management, which includes preventive measures such as controlled burns, monitoring lightning-prone areas, and minimizing human activities that can ignite fires. Additionally, public awareness campaigns and emergency response plans for communities living close to forests help to reduce the risk of wildfires and mitigate the damage they cause. To summarize, the first step of this devastating process is the ignition and spread of a forest fire or wildfire. It leads to the destruction of trees and plants, the displacement and potential death of animals due to their homes being destroyed and smoke inhalation, and the scarcity of food sources for those remaining. Preventing these incidents from happening requires a combination of appropriate forest management practices, public awareness, and community preparedness to protect and sustain the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the rank of the man accused of attacking the widow? , can you please find it?   Around 1880, two young British officers arrive to join a regiment in India. One, Lieutenant Drake, from a middle-class background, is extremely eager to fit in while the other, Lieutenant Millington, the son of a general, is keen to get out as soon as possible and deliberately antagonizes his fellow officers. The two newcomers learn the traditions of the regiment, one of which is a mess game in which they chase a wooden pig on wheels, attempting to pierce its anus with their swords. Mrs Scarlett, the flirtatious and attractive widow of a captain who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, is a constant presence in the regiment.  One night at a mess dance, Millington gets drunk and tries to seduce Mrs Scarlett in the garden. She repels him, but moments later runs back into the mess wounded and in shock, claiming the culprit was Millington. An informal court martial -more a mock trial than anything else- is organized with Drake ordered to be Millington's defending officer. Although Drake is pressured by his superior officer to plead guilty for Millington and close the case quickly, he begins to challenge the orders in order to give the defendant a fair trial. Drake learns from an Indian servant that another widow suffered a similar attack with a sword six months earlier, before he and Millington joined. After irrefutable evidence, Mrs Scarlett finally admits it was not Millington who attacked her but will not say who the culprit is. Millington, now indisputably proved innocent, is welcomed back by his brother officers; but Drake, disgusted by the truth he's uncovered, resigns. One officer knows who the culprit is and, hiding Drake in the shadows so he may witness what is to take place, confronts the guilty man privately in the final scene.

Here is a news article: Police say some of the sexual assaults of an 11-year-old girl occurred at this abandoned trailer house in a part of Cleveland called \\"the Hood.\\"      CLEVELAND - All Maria wanted was to see her 11-year-old daughter.      Weeks ago, the girl had been hushed away to a \\"safe house\\" for her own protection - after the phone calls started, and the disturbing, sexually explicit videos began surfacing in this town of 9,000 about 50 miles north of downtown Houston.      Seventeen men and boys, including a middle school student and adults in their 20s, have been charged with sexually assaulting Maria's daughter, a sixth-grader, in a dingy trailer. That number could grow to 28.      Last week, while hospitalized for an illness, Maria finally received a brief visit from the girl.      \\"My daughter was crying and crying and hugging on me,\\" Maria said. \\"She didn't want to leave. She misses her family and wants to come home.\\"      But the family's tiny gray wooden home off a long, dark forested road on the outskirts of town is no longer considered safe for the 11-year-old. Child Protective Services put the girl in a foster home for her protection and restricted her family from even speaking to her, the family said.      Local officials say the attack has devastated this close-knit community, leaving many to wonder who will be charged next. There's talk that a star athlete at Cleveland High School was seen sexually assaulting the girl on the video. The son of a local school board member is involved, too.      Someone has been making phone calls to Maria's house. Police fear they're coming from people seeking retribution.      \\"They keep calling and asking for her,\\" said Maria, whose last name is not being printed to protect her daughter's identity. \\"They don't believe me when I say she's not here and cuss us out. They're trying to find her. This is the time when she needs us the most.\\"      Music blaring      Cleveland, a town whose history dates to 1836, is nestled near the picturesque Sam Houston National Forest. Timber, cattle, farming and oil fuel the town's economy.      Normally a quiet place, the community recently has been in an uproar over a looming election to recall three City Council members accused of mismanagement.      When the sex assault story broke wide open in recent weeks, the town gained further unwanted attention.      The editor of the Cleveland Advocate, Vanesa Brashier, who has kept her hand on the pulse of this community, said, “Feelings are raw as these things keep happening and then there’s no time to heal. Our town has been in the spotlight too much lately.”      Some Cleveland residents, like Kisha Williams, are critical of the 11-year-old’s parents.      “Where were they when this girl was seen wandering at all hours with no supervision and pretending to be much older?” she asked.      Several churches have organized special prayer events for the town.      Carter Williams, 64, seated at a small card table playing dominoes inside a local grocery, does not think laying blame is the right response to the sex assault.      “This is a praying time for the young men and the young girl,” Williams said. “Seems like everyone in this whole town needs some God in their life.”      Inside a trailer      Over the Thanksgiving holiday, retiree Joe Harrison noticed an 11-year-old girl as he walked past an abandoned trailer to play dominoes with friends in what locals call \\"the Hood.\\"      He thought the girl looked older than her years with her long hair and dark makeup. She was standing near the aging brown trailer, which was partially covered by a blue tarp and had remained unoccupied since Hurricane Ike except for an occasional drug user who would sneak inside to smoke crack.      Later, Harrison heard loud music blaring from that same trailer on Ross Street. But he thought the girl had already been picked up by her mother. He never realized anything horrible might have happened until weeks later when the arrests started.      \\"I have a granddaughter that age and can't imagine anything like that happening to her,\\" he said. \\"Whoever did this should pay for it.\\"      Cleveland police say the 11-year-old was sexually assaulted inside that trailer and a small blue house with white trim around the corner.      The assaults happened Nov. 28 after a 19-year-old with prior drug convictions persuaded the young girl to leave her house and go \\"riding around\\" with him and two other young men, according to a Cleveland police officer's sworn statement.      They first went to the blue house, where she was ordered to disrobe. If she refused, the statement said, she was warned other girls would beat her up and she would never get a ride back home.      Soon she was having sex with multiple young men there, the statement said. Someone used a phone to invite four more men, who soon arrived.      Not long afterward, the group fled through a back window when they heard a relative of one of the teens arriving at the blue house. The 11-year-old left behind her bra and panties as the group moved to the nearby abandoned trailer, where the assaults continued. As the men had sex with the girl, others used their cell phones to take photographs and video, police said.      Familiar faces in video      Over the next two days, the recordings went viral around school. One student who recognized the girl and several of the young men, including star athletes, in the videos, alerted school authorities and triggered the investigation.      So far, 17 suspects have been charged, ranging in age from a middle-schooler to a 27-year-old. Seven are high school students, including two members of Cleveland's state-ranked basketball team. Another is the 21-year-old son of a school board member. Several have prior criminal records for drug sales, aggravated robbery and manslaughter.      James D. Evans III, an attorney who represents three of the defendants, insists: \\"This is not a case of a child who was enslaved or taken advantage of.\\"      Investigators note an 11-year-old can never legally give consent.      On her Facebook page, the 11-year-old tells whomever she befriends that she's aware people have probably heard about her, but she doesn't care what they think.      \\"If you dislike me, deal with it,\\" she wrote.      Sometimes she comes across like a little girl, such as when she talks of her special talent for making \\"weird sound effects\\" and \\"running in circles\\" to overcome nervousness.      But she also makes flamboyant statements about drinking, smoking and sex. Yet her vulnerability pokes through the tough veneer as she tells of \\"being hurt many times,\\" where she \\"settled for less\\" and \\"let people take advantage\\" and \\"walk all over\\" her. She vows to learn from her mistakes.      While Maria said she never saw any of her daughter's Internet postings, she believes her 11-year-old might have been seeking misguided attention.      Earlier signs of trouble      Shortly before the video recordings surfaced at school, there was a sign of trouble. Her daughter had borrowed her father's cell phone, and afterward Maria discovered a lurid photo of a young man that had been e-mailed to it.      \\"I asked about it, and she said she knew nothing. So I told her I was taking it to the police, and I did,\\" Maria said. \\"They still have the phone. And I've not heard anything back.\\"      Meanwhile, not only has the girl been forced from the town where she was born, but authorities also want the entire family to relocate.      \\"The police think we may be in danger. Because if they can't get my 11-year-old, they might take out their revenge on us,\\" said Maria, as extra patrols are making rounds down her street.      Neither Cleveland police nor Child Protective Services would discuss the safety issue or a closed-door hearing with the family held Friday in Coldspring. State District Judge Elizabeth Coker said a gag order has been issued.      Struggle for children      Maria's two older daughters, who are in advanced placement classes and the band, and her 9-year-old son have all cried about being uprooted. However, the 11-year-old, who was withdrawn from Cleveland schools when the videos surfaced, is enrolled in gifted and talented classes at her new school and is \\"doing fine,\\" Maria said.      Yet life for the children has been a struggle, as their father cannot find carpentry work and their mother earns very little by cleaning houses. The mortgage holder recently notified the family that they were being evicted but gave them extra time because of the family crisis.      The stress has grown so intense, the 16-year-old daughter said, that her parents considered separating, while the 11-year-old is having regrets about following through with the case.      But Maria wants those who stole her daughter's childhood prosecuted. She said her daughter was threatened with beatings or death if she refused to cooperate.      \\"These guys knew she was in middle school,\\" Maria said. \\"You could tell that whenever you talked to her. She still loves stuffed bears.\\"      cindy.horswell@chron.com ||||| There are many reasons why one might reach for a tube of lip balm.

Trivia question: Name the country in Europe which is double landlocked (surrounded by landlocked countries)? And the answer is?","output":"The country in Europe that is double landlocked, meaning it is surrounded entirely by landlocked countries, is Liechtenstein.  Liechtenstein is a small principality located in the heart of Europe, situated between Switzerland and Austria. With a total area of only 160 square kilometers (around 62 square miles), it is one of the smallest countries in the world. Despite its small size, Liechtenstein is a highly developed nation and is known for its strong economy, beautiful scenery, and historic castles. The country is predominantly mountainous, with the majority of its landscape dominated by the Alps. The eastern part of the country is relatively more flat and is where most of the population resides. Liechtenstein has a population of around 38,000, making it one of the least populated countries in Europe. The primary language spoken in Liechtenstein is German, and the country's official name is Fürstentum Liechtenstein, which translates to \\"Principality of Liechtenstein\\" in English. The nation is a constitutional monarchy, with the reigning prince, currently Prince Hans-Adam II, holding a significant amount of political power. Liechtenstein is unique in that it is one of the only two double landlocked countries in the world, the other one being Uzbekistan in Central Asia. This means that not only is Liechtenstein a landlocked country with no direct access to oceans, but it is also surrounded by countries that are landlocked themselves. In Liechtenstein's case, these surrounding countries are Switzerland to the west and Austria to the east. Both of these neighbors are landlocked, making Liechtenstein a double landlocked nation. Despite being double landlocked and having a small population, Liechtenstein has a thriving economy that relies on industries such as finance, high-tech manufacturing, and tourism. Additionally, the country is known for having a high standard of living, with excellent healthcare, education, and social services for its citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For roughly the billionth time, we learned this past week that politics and social media are often (always?) a toxic combo. The latest chapter in the “How not to use social media” book, which will have roughly an infinite number of entries before it’s all said and done, was written by Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.). Lauten, having watched Malia and Sasha Obama looking less than enthused at the White House’s annual Thanksgiving turkey pardoning, took to Facebook, writing in part: “Dear Sasha and Malia, I get you’re both in those awful teen years, but you’re a part of the First Family, try showing a little class. . . . Rise to the occasion. Act like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.” Knowingly or not, Lauten violated one of the few adhered-to commandments of political Washington: Thou shalt not talk about politicians’ children. After a predictable media backlash, she apologized — via Facebook, natch. “I quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager,” she wrote. Too late. By Monday, Lauten had resigned. By Tuesday, conservatives had begun attacking the press for its allegedly over-the-top coverage of a junior staffer for a backbench member — evidence, they insisted, of the media’s liberal bias. The end result of this now-familiar outrage cycle was heightened disgust — if that’s even possible — with everyone and everything in Washington.

His empire split into several kingdoms upon his death, the most famous of which were the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch, Seleucia and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa. Although the political unity of Alexander's empire could not be maintained, it resulted in the Hellenistic civilization and spread the Greek language and Greek culture in the territories conquered by Alexander. Greek science, technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Alexander the Great's father was Philip II of Macedon. Philip II was the king of Macedon from 359 BC until his assassination in 336 BC. He played a crucial role in consolidating the Greek states and forming the League of Corinth, which allowed for the unified invasion of the Persian Empire under the leadership of his son, Alexander III (\\"The Great\\"). The accomplishments of Alexander the Great and the subsequent Hellenistic period contributed significantly to the spread of Greek language, culture, science, technology, and mathematics throughout the territories he conquered."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jury comes out against driver in delivery-fee lawsuit A jury has found against a Boston-area Domino’s delivery man who sued the chain claiming that a small delivery fee took a bite out of his tips. Edione Lisandro of Marlborough was one of four drivers represented by Fair Work P.C. who filed class-action lawsuits against Domino’s and local franchisee Henry Askew. The drivers claimed a delivery fee of around 2 imposed by the restaurants confused customers and led many of them not to tip. Attorneys for the pizza shop have said in court filings that customers were informed of the policy and said credit-card records showed that many did tip. After about two hours of deliberations, a jury found against Lisandro on Friday, according to court documents. The case has not been closed, however. The jury was empaneled and heard arguments before the judge had resolved some disputes, such as whether Domino’s delivery drivers could sue together as a class. It wasn’t immediately clear what the verdict meant for another case filed by driver Atila Adolfo Tigges earlier this month. Two other drivers accepted settlements in similar cases. Attorneys for Lisandro and Tigges didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.

The next day, in the newspapers, some of the comments were so unkind. The young musician was painful. That day, as he sat in his hotel room in total despair , there came a knocking at his door. He had a visitor.The famous Finnish composer  Jean Sibelius had come by to congratulate the young pianist on his performance.

Burger King Brand proposed on Monday, and Joel Burger and Ashley King accepted.      The company is paying the expenses and providing gifts for the July 17 wedding of Joel and Ashley in Jacksonville, aka the Burger-King nuptials.      Friday's column was about how Joel and Ashley have been Burger-King since they were in the fifth grade together in New Berlin. When they announced their engagement this spring, they had their picture taken next to the BK restaurant logo in Springfield. They flipped their names so that Joel's would be first in the announcement. Normally the woman's name is first. But then it wouldn't have been Burger-King, would it?      Friday's column was pretty well-read locally. And then it went viral. The New York Daily News posted it. The Huffington Post reposted it. Soon I was hearing from BuzzFeed, the Daily Mail in the U.K. and a producer from Australia’s #1 Radio Show, which happens to be The Kyle and Jackie O Show. (But, then, you knew that.)      They all wanted to contact Joel and Ashley. The media crush is threatening to become overwhelming. It will only gain momentum now that Burger King is on board and will be promoting the Burger King, Burger-King connection nationally. I hope it stays fun for Joel and Ashley.      \\"Oh my God, it's going to be crazy,\\" Ashley said. She knew over the weekend that the column had gone viral. She said, sure, they'll talk with Australia's number one radio show. I expect more will be calling.      > UPDATE (April 8, 10:15 a.m.): Burger King has released a video about the couple on YouTube:      This all began innocently enough with SJ-R business editor Tim Landis. He spotted the unique Burger-King engagement announcement and photograph in the Chatham Clarion. He put it on my desk in case I thought it could make a column. For my part, all I had to do was recognize it as one.      Since Ashley had already tried to reach out to the Burger King company, but unsuccessfully, I sent an email to the company's media relations representative. I soon heard from Alison Brod Public Relations in New York City, the company that has the Burger King account. I sent them an email about the wedding, they contacted the company, and Burger King took it from there.      Which culminated Monday afternoon when Joel and Ashley got the big news from Burger King via Skype. The connection was between New Berlin and New York City and we can't say that very often, can we? Ashley's dad, Vince King, was there to help celebrate, as was Joel's mom, Cindy Burger.      \\"When we heard about the happy, Burger-King couple, we felt an overwhelming urge to celebrate their upcoming marriage,\\" said Eric Hirschhorn, Burger King Brand spokesman. \\"On so many levels it felt like fate; they found each other and their story found us.\\"      The company, as we say in the newspaper business \\"buried the lede\\" when giving Joel and Ashley the news Monday afternoon. Burger King didn't tell them they were picking up the tab for the wedding until near the end. It was a huge surprise.      \\"We were just blown away,\\" Joel said.      \\"We were shaking,\\" Ashley added.      Shaking and blown away and crying, but in a good way.      Since Friday's column described how the Burger-King name was given Joel and Ashley by a motivational speaker who used yo-yos at a fifth-grade assembly, the Burger King company is providing personalized yo-yos to the wedding guests. The company also is providing gift bags, Mason Jars and Burger King crowns, all personalized for Joel and Ashley's wedding.      But paying for the entire thing is huge.      \\"We knew deep in our hearts that we wanted to honor the union of Mr. Burger and Ms. King,\\" says Hirschhorn. \\"In an unforgettable way. Everyone at Burger King Brand agreed and, as Dave Bakke said, we knew we wanted to create a 'whopper of a wedding' that's uniquely their own.      \\"And now we hope we've swept them off their feet. All we ask in return is that they live happily ever after.\\"      And that's the way we like it: Well done.      — Contact Dave Bakke: dave.bakke@sj-r.com, 788-1541, twitter.com/DaveBakkeSJR.      *** ||||| This story was updated on Tuesday, April 7, 2015.

A grand jury has already been impaneled in Virginia to investigate Michael Flynn and his work in the private sector on behalf of foreign interests. The new grand jury apparently will focus on Russia and the 2016 election and, quite possibly, on claims of obstruction of justice.      The existence of the D.C. grand jury is a sure sign that Mueller is pressing hard. As one expert told the Journal:      This doesn’t mean [Mueller] is going to bring charges, but it shows he is very serious. He wouldn’t do this if it were winding down.      It didn’t require the impaneling of the new grand jury to tell us this, though. We already knew it from the way Mueller has staffed this case — excessively and with plenty of Hillary-supporting Democrats.      Indeed, the Journal also reports that Mueller recently added Greg Andres, a top partner in a big New York law firm, to his team. Andres is a former top Justice Department official who also oversaw the criminal division of the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn. No one believes he would leave his law firm to participate in a low-level, short-lived investigation.      The impaneling of the new grand jury means that Mueller’s team will be subpoenaing records and taking testimony from witnesses. This process likely will tip off Trump’s legal team where the investigation is headed and whether it has taken on what the president views as the characteristics of a witch hunt. Trump will then be in a better position to decide whether to fire Mueller.      For example, Trump told the New York Times that if Mueller looks at his finances and those of his family “unrelated to Russia” this would cross a “red line.” If the grand jury probe goes in this direction, Trump will be sorely tempted to cut it off.      I will be sorely tempted not to blame him.      For now, the Trump administration is saying politically correct things. Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said “the White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly [and]. . .is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.”      This could change on a dime, as anyone who has been following the Trump presidency, even casually, knows. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Ali Vitali      WASHINGTON — More than eight months after winning the election, President Donald Trump on Thursday declared Hillary Clinton's defeat \\"the greatest loss in the history of American politics,\\" while painting the Russia investigation as a \\"total fabrication\\" by Democrats to distract from their failure to win the White House and lack of message.      \\"The reason why Democrats only talk about the totally made-up Russia story is because they have no message, no agenda and no vision,\\" Trump told a raucous crowd of supporters gathered for a campaign rally-style event in Huntington, West Virginia.      The president called probes into alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia during the 2016 election \\"demeaning\\" and \\"fake.\\"      \\"Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign — there never were,\\" Trump said. \\"We didn't win because of Russia. We won because of you, that I can tell you.\\"      \\"Have you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania?\\" Trump continued, listing states he won last year before quizzing the crowd: \\"Are there any Russians here tonight? Any Russians?\\"      The president had another target in mind for those looking to investigate something: Hillary Clinton's missing emails.      \\"What the prosecutors should be looking at are Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails,\\" Trump said, prompting chants of \\"Lock her up! Lock her up!\\" from the crowd, a common occurrence during the 2016 campaign.      Democrats, he said, \\"can't beat us at the voting booths so they're trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want.\\"      President Donald Trump holds a sign as he arrives at a rally on August 3, 2017, in Huntington, West Virginia. Carlos Barria / Reuters      Just as during the campaign Trump primed his supporters to doubt the election results if he lost — he repeatedly deemed the system then as \\"rigged\\" — the president planted seeds of doubt about the integrity of the investigations into Russian meddling.      \\"I just hope the final determination is a truly honest one, which is what the millions of people who gave us our big win in November deserve and what all Americans who want a better future want and deserve,\\" Trump said.      His fiery rebuke comes hours after a report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury in Washington to investigate alleged ties between the campaign and Moscow. The president's personal lawyer, John Dowd, told NBC News that \\"with respect to news of a federal grand jury being impaneled, we have no reason to believe President Trump is under investigation.\\"      Making good on a promise earlier in the day for a \\"big announcement\\" during the rally, Trump invited West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Democrat, on stage for a \\"very, very large announcement\\" — a point the president drove home by gesturing with his hands to show the governor’s size.      Supporters cheer as President Donald Trump speaks during a Make America Great Again Rally on August 3, 2017 in Huntington, West Virginia. Saul Loeb / AFP - Getty Images      Justice announced he would change parties, becoming a Republican and notching another statehouse executive seat for the GOP. \\"Tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican,\\" he said. \\"As a coach, I would tell you it’s time to run another play.\\"      Justice also rallied the crowd against the Russia investigations, asking, \\"Have we not heard enough about the Russians?\\"      And while Republicans in Congress have signaled they would like to move on from failed GOP efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump on Thursday wasn't yet ready to concede the fight.      The president lamented the unsuccessful attempts as \\"incredible,\\" and demanded of lawmakers, \\"You have to do it. Nothing in life is easy, but Congress must not give in.\\"      \\"Call everybody,\\" Trump told the crowd. \\"Get them to have the guts to vote to repeal and replace Obamacare — which is a disaster.\\" ||||| WASHINGTON — Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s attempts to disrupt last year’s presidential election, has issued subpoenas from a Washington-based grand jury in recent weeks, according to several lawyers involved in the case.      At least some of the subpoenas were for documents related to the business dealings of Michael T. Flynn, the retired general who briefly served as President Trump’s national security adviser. Mr. Flynn is under investigation for foreign lobbying work, as well as for conversations he had during the transition with Sergey I. Kislyak, who was Russia’s ambassador to the United States.      Mr. Mueller’s team is broadly investigating whether any Trump associates colluded with the Russian government in its attempts to disrupt the election. It is unclear whether the subpoenas issued in recent weeks relate to other members of Mr. Trump’s campaign who have been a focus of the Mueller investigation, including Paul J. Manafort, the former campaign chairman.      A grand jury based in Alexandria, Va., began issuing subpoenas in the Flynn case months ago. Mr. Mueller took over the investigation in May and assembled a team of prosecutors in an office in downtown Washington. Mr. Mueller has not impaneled a special grand jury, the lawyers involved in the case said, and has decided instead to use one of several grand juries that regularly sit in Washington. ||||| The increased financial focus hasn't gone unnoticed by Trump, who warned Mueller, via an interview with The New York Times , that his financial dealings were a red line that investigators shouldn't cross. But the order establishing the special counsel makes clear Mueller is authorized to investigate any matters that \\"arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\\"      In response to this CNN story, the President's attorney, Jay Sekulow, said, \\"President's outside counsel has not received any requests for documentation or information about this. Any inquiry from the special counsel that goes beyond the mandate specified in the appointment we would object to.\\"      In 2015, the FBI began investigating cyber breaches targeting US political organizations, including the Democratic National Committee.      In the summer of 2016, US intelligence agencies noticed a spate of curious contacts between Trump campaign associates and suspected Russian intelligence, according to current and former US officials briefed on the investigation. James Comey, in his Senate testimony, said the FBI opened an investigation into Trump campaign-Russia connections in July 2016. The strands of the two investigations began to merge.      In the months that followed, investigators turned up intercepted communications appearing to show efforts by Russian operatives to coordinate with Trump associates on damaging Hillary Clinton's election prospects, officials said. CNN has learned those communications included references to campaign chairman Paul Manafort.      A year later, the FBI is reviewing financial records related to the Trump Organization, as well as Trump, his family members, including Donald Trump Jr., and campaign associates. They've combed through the list of shell companies and buyers of Trump-branded real estate properties and scrutinized the roster of tenants at Trump Tower reaching back more than a half-dozen years. They've looked at the backgrounds of Russian business associates connected to Trump surrounding the 2013 Miss Universe pageant. CNN could not determine whether the review has included his tax returns.      In recent weeks, investigators have also started looking into the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower and how the White House responded to news of that meeting. The session included Trump Jr., Manafort, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, and a Russian attorney.      Trump has denied any collusion and maintains that his business empire has \\"no involvement with Russia\\" and that he has \\"no loans, no nothing\\" from Russia. His lawyers have detailed a few exceptions, including the Miss Universe pageant he held in Moscow and the Florida mansion he sold to a Russian oligarch in 2008. Trump earned more than 100 million from those deals, according to his lawyers.      \\"This is like any investigation,\\" says one person briefed on the probe. \\"You start at the core and then move to the periphery. You have to explore the finances. Where this is going is no different from any investigation.\\"      The Mueller Team      Since his appointment in May, Mueller has quietly gathered a team of more than three dozen attorneys, investigators and other staff in a nondescript office in Washington. Officials familiar with the probe describe it as akin to a small US attorney's office, with FBI agents and prosecutors assigned to separate groups looking into various aspects of the investigation.      These include groups of investigators and lawyers focused separately on Russian collusion and obstruction of justice, as well as the investigations focused on Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, according to a US official briefed on the investigation. Some of the investigators have been pulled from field offices across the country to join the Mueller team in Washington. Others left high-paying jobs at law firms. Many of the investigators have backgrounds in investigating fraud and financial crimes. There are 16 attorneys assigned to the probe, according to a spokesman for Mueller.      Mueller reports to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but there's a measure of separation from Justice Department headquarters to keep the probe independent.      CNN has learned some of the investigators involved in the probe are buying liability insurance out of concern they could become targets of lawsuits from those who are being investigated, according to one of the people familiar with the probe. The Justice Department covers legal fees for employees sued in the course of their duties, but some of the lawyers want extra protection.      The Justice Department and special counsel's office both declined to comment on the liability concerns.      Bait and Switch      The possible financial ties between Trump and Russia were part of the concerns for US intelligence and law enforcement officials from the beginning, according to one current law enforcement official and one former US intelligence official.      In some cases, the FBI was pursuing others who did business with the Trump organization, including alleged mobsters who controlled key contractors used by many real estate developers in New York during the 1980s. The flow of Russian money in real estate -- and concerns that some buyers were making the purchases to illegally launder money -- had also drawn some attention by US authorities to the Trump business.      The international real estate business is a part of the global economy where foreigners can still use cash with fewer questions asked about the sources of money. Terrorism financing concerns long ago put more stringent rules on banking and other businesses. But the rules are looser in the business of buying and selling high-end real estate, US officials say.      Investigators are looking both at whether financial laws were broken and whether there are any dealings that could put the President or his associates in a compromising position.      \\"There's always been a concern about his exposure to blackmail in his financial dealings,\\" says the person briefed on the investigation.      Trump has repeatedly insisted that he has no enduring financial ties to Russian interests.      But some of the people who are now under scrutiny by Mueller see a bait and switch. Instead of collusion, many believe the Mueller probe will instead end up being about past financial troubles.      \\"They launch an investigation into collusion in the election,\\" says one person whose client is among those being scrutinized by the Mueller investigators. \\"Then they go after people because of old business matters that have nothing to do with collusion.\\"      Missing Links      Even at the FBI, there's a measure of frustration over the investigation.      After a highly contentious year investigating Hillary Clinton's private email servers and being accused of swinging the election against her, the FBI finds itself again where officials tried not to be: amid a politically treacherous investigation that has hobbled a new President.      Worse yet, some FBI officials fear the question of whether there was any criminal coordination or collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia may never be answered.      One challenge is that tantalizing pieces of intelligence are missing key links because they did not develop long enough for investigators to determine their significance. These include intercepts monitored by US intelligence that showed suggestions of illegal coordination but nothing overt.      Those missing links mean that the FBI and Mueller's prosecution team may not have enough evidence to bring charges related to possible illegal coordination with a foreign intelligence service. Instead, prosecutors could pursue financial crime charges unrelated to the election.      Investigators also face a big hurdle: those participating in the intercepted communications were foreigners, outside the reach of the FBI, who may be exaggerating or lying about events.      Some FBI officials also blame media coverage dating back to last summer for prompting some communications to cease, and making it more difficult for investigators to monitor the interactions of Russians and campaign associates.      Scrambling to react      By last July when Russian intelligence began releasing troves of stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, the FBI had been aware of the DNC intrusion about a year.      Until the stolen emails were weaponized in their release via WikiLeaks and the Russian intelligence's own site DCLeaks, intelligence and law enforcement officials believed the cyber-intrusion was an intelligence-gathering effort, like many of those that occurred before past elections.      Over the next four months, the Obama administration officials and law enforcement and intelligence agencies debated how to respond.      \\"You had an administration that didn't want to look heavy-handed\\" in favor of Hillary Clinton, one senior former US official involved in investigation said.      At the White House, Obama officials scrambled last summer for a strategy on how to respond to what they already knew were Russian actions, well before the administration was willing to point the finger publicly.      Michael Daniel, the White House cyber-security coordinator, ordered staff in August to draw up a list of possible retaliatory measures, according to a former administration official briefed on the matter. These included planting malware in Russian infrastructure that could be activated if the Russian actions escalated, according to the former official.      But shortly after Daniel gave the order, White House officials raised other concerns. Top officials including Susan Rice, national security adviser, and Lisa Monaco, homeland security adviser, led efforts by the White House to make sure the government could prevent any move by Russian intelligence to tamper with the voting infrastructure and sow chaos on Election Day.      Daniel, in an interview, declined to discuss specifics about measures considered in response, because much of the information remains classified. But he said one top concern for White House officials was \\"it not appear we were trying to be partisan in what we were doing.\\"      The partisan concerns were exacerbated by interactions between the White House and congressional leaders. Monaco traveled to Capitol Hill to try to get top leaders of both parties to send a letter to state governors to urge shoring up of their defenses of election infrastructure. But they were rebuffed by Republican leaders, who viewed the request as partisan, according to current and former officials briefed on the discussions.      Daniel told CNN he and his cyber-response group worked quietly, reducing the number of people allowed in meetings to avoid leaks. \\"We didn't need to do the Russians work for them,\\" Daniel said. \\"We needed to develop diplomatic options first, and we [put] the other options on the back-burner.\\"      After the election, the Obama administration unveiled a series of measures , including expulsion of diplomats and seizure of Russian diplomatic compounds allegedly used for espionage. The technical staff also released a trove of information on Russian cyber-intrusion techniques and malware that current and former officials say forced the Russians to spend time and money coming up with new methods.      Four Targets      The approach to the Manafort and Flynn probes may offer a template for how investigators' focus on possible financial crimes could help gain leverage and cooperation in the investigation.      CNN has learned that investigators became more suspicious when they turned up intercepted communications that US intelligence agencies collected among suspected Russian operatives discussing their efforts to work with Manafort, who served as campaign chairman for three months, to coordinate information that could damage Hillary Clinton's election prospects, the US officials say. The suspected operatives relayed what they claimed were conversations with Manafort, encouraging help from the Russians.      Manafort faces potential real troubles in the probe, according to current and former officials. Decades of doing business with foreign regimes with reputations for corruption, from the Philippines to Ukraine, had led to messy finances      The focus now for investigators is whether Manafort was involved in money laundering or tax violations in his business dealings with pro-Russia parties in Ukraine. He's also been drawn into a related investigation of his son-in-law's real estate business dealings, some of which he invested in.      Manafort has not been accused of any wrongdoing.      In response to questions about CNN's reporting, his spokesman, Jason Maloni, says it \\"is becoming increasingly apparent that there was no collusion between the campaign and the Russian government.\\"      Maloni offered further comment to CNN after the initial publication of this story, saying: \\"Paul Manafort did not collude with the Russian government to undermine the 2016 election or to hack the DNC. Other than that comment, we aren't going to respond to anonymous officials illegally peddling second hand conspiracy theories. But the Justice Department, and the courts if necessary, should hold someone to account for the flood of unlawful government leaks targeting Mr. Manafort.\\"      Flynn drew suspicions in late 2016 when US spy agencies collecting the communications of Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak found Flynn, the incoming national security adviser, discussing the subject of US sanctions on Russia. That appeared to contradict White House claims that Flynn had not discussed sanctions in his talks with Kislyak.      On January 24, Andrew McCabe, then the deputy FBI director, called Flynn at his White House office. He told the retired lieutenant general that he was sending a couple of FBI agents to discuss a matter with him, according to people familiar with what unfolded. Flynn spoke to McCabe without his lawyer present.      At the FBI, the decision to approach Flynn was debated at the highest levels, including by Comey, according to sources familiar with those discussions. FBI officials considered the visit by agents a \\"duty to warn\\" matter, a not-uncommon effort by the FBI to warn a US official that foreign spies may be trying to target them.      The agents asked Flynn about the Kislyak calls, in part out of concern that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail over the content of the conversations. Flynn gave a wobbly explanation of events. He initially denied the sanctions discussions, then later claimed he couldn't remember.      Despite the conflicting accounts, FBI investigators have leaned against seeking charges over the Kislyak discussions. The investigators don't consider Flynn's answers to be intentionally dishonest.      Flynn's lawyers have criticized media reports about his connection to the Russia investigation as peddling \\"unfounded allegations\\" and \\"outrageous claims.\\"      More troublesome for Flynn, investigators have focused on his lobbying work for the Turkish government , which the former Defense Intelligence Agency chief didn't initially disclose as required by law. Flynn's lawyers have since retroactively registered his lobbying.      Page had been the subject of a secret intelligence surveillance warrant since 2014, earlier than had been previously reported, US officials briefed on the probe told CNN.      When information emerged last summer suggesting that the Russians were attempting to cultivate Page as a way to gain an entrée into the Trump campaign , the FBI renewed its interest in him. Initially, FBI counterintelligence investigators saw the campaign as possible victims being targeted by Russian intelligence.      Page denies working with any Russians as part of the Kremlin's election meddling, though he admits interacting with some Russians during the campaign.      Stone denies collusion and says his conversations with Guccifer 2.0, which he since posted online, were innocuous.      Editor's note: This story has been updated with additional comments from Manafort's spokesman, Jason Maloni, that were given to CNN after the initial publication. ||||| Summary:","output":"The article discusses how a special investigator named Mr. Mueller is looking into whether President Trump's associates worked with Russia to interfere in the U.S. election. However, the article says that this is difficult to prove. Some people who are being investigated are worried because they think Mr. Mueller might instead look into their financial histories, even if those aren't related to the election. The article also notes that President Trump and others have denied working with Russia during the election, saying that they won because of voters' support. The President pointed out that such claims seem to distract from the fact that the Democrats lost the election.  In simpler terms, it's like a teacher trying to find out if one student copied another's homework. However, it's hard to prove, and now some students are worried the teacher might instead get them in trouble for unrelated things. Meanwhile, the student who is accused of copying maintains he did all the work himself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: TV Shows and Long Bus Trips Long bus rides are like television shows. They have a beginning, a middle, and an end-- with ads thrown in every three or four minutes. The ads are unavoidable. They happen whether you want them or not. Every couple of minutes a billboard appears outside the bus window.\\"Buy Super Clean Toothpaste.\\"\\"Drink Good'n Wet Root Beer.\\"\\"Fill up with Pacific Gas.\\" Only if you sleep, which is equal to turning the television set off, are you spared the unending cry of \\"You Need It! Buy It Now!\\" The beginning of the ride is comfortable and somewhat exciting, even if you've traveled that way before. Usually some things have changed--new houses, new buildings, sometimes even a new road. The bus driver has a style of driving and it's fun to try to figure it out the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly daring, the ride can be as exciting as a suspense  story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left-hand lane?After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you've got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops. The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning. You know it will soon be over and there's a kind of expectation and excitement in that. The seat, of course, has become harder as the hours have passed. By now you've sat with your legs crossed, with your hands in your lap, with your hands on the arm rests--even with your hands crossed behind your head. The end comes just at the right time. There are just no more ways to sit. Question: What is the purpose of this passage? Options: A: To talk about the similarities between long bus trips and TV shows. B: To persuade you to take a long bus trip. C: To display the differences between long bus trips and TV shows. D: To describe the billboards along the road. A:","output":"The purpose of this passage is A: To talk about the similarities between long bus trips and TV shows. The passage uses a metaphor to describe the experience of a long bus ride, comparing it to watching a television show with its distinct beginning, middle, and end, and commercials (symbolized by billboards along the road). The passage does not focus on persuading the reader to take a long bus trip, discussing differences between bus rides and TV shows, or describing the billboards, making option A the most accurate answer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.  I am facing a new situation today: After decades of debate, Brunei decided to adopt electrical vehicles and use them extensively, ultimately phasing out gasoline powered vehicles.

Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online.

Article: When we give our kids holiday gifts, many of us can't wait to hear their appreciative cries of\\"thank you!\\"once the wrapping gets ripped off. But here's a tip: You'd be wise not to expect much gratitude from them for what they receive. Gratitude can make us happier, healthier, and even fitter. But do the kids show their gratitude for the stuff we buy them? All the research I've done has convinced me that it won't happen. One mom told me that when she asked her 16-year-old son to thank her for buying him a cellphone, he said, \\"But that's what moms should do.\\" From a teenager's angle, it's a parent's responsibility to take care of the family. According to Dunham, Yale's assistant professor of psychology, \\"When teenagers code it that way, a gift is no longer something given freely and voluntarily\\"--it's just mom and dad living up to their obligation. Parents do have the right to demand good manners and children should thank sincerely whoever gives them something. But kids can't know how blessed they are unless they have a basis for comparison. And they don't learn that by a parent complaining that they're ungrateful. We need to give our children the gift of a wider world view. Show by example that gratitude isn't aboutstuff--which ultimately can't make any of us happy anyway.It's about realizing how lucky you are and paying your good fortune forward. You can collect all the charitable appeals and sit down together with the kids to go through them. You set the budget for giving and the kids decide how it's distributed. Once the conversation about gratitude gets started, it's much easier to continue all year. Also you can set up a family routine at bedtime where kids describe three things that have made them grateful. When kids go off to college, you can text them a picture each week of something that inspires your appreciation. Teaching children to focus on the positive and appreciate the good in their lives is perhaps the greatest gift we can give them. And we can all learn together that the things that really... Question: How do children respond when receiving gifts from their parents? Yes or no, is the answer \\"They take their parents' gifts for granted.\\"? A:","output":"Children's response when receiving gifts from their parents can vary, but it is often observed that they may take their parents' gifts for granted. This is because teenagers might view it as their parents' responsibility to provide for them, and thus may not always express gratitude.

Question: What happens to Christine ? Movie title: Christine Movie plot: Arnold \\"Arnie\\" Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is an awkward, unpopular teen with only one friend, Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell). Arnie's life begins to change when he buys a used red-and-white 1958 Plymouth Fury, nicknamed \\"Christine\\", in need of extensive repairs. Arnie begins to restore Christine at a local junkyard, Darnell's Autobody, but as he spends more of his time working on the car, he discards his glasses, dresses differently, and develops an arrogant personality. Dennis and Arnie's new girlfriend, Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul), discover the car's previous owner was obsessed with Christine and had died in it due to carbon monoxide poisoning. A group of bullies at schoolâangry with Arnie after a shop class confrontation results in Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander) getting expelledâvandalize Christine. Arnie is devastated and determined to repair Christine. As he examines the ruined car, he hears the creaking of metal and notices the engine is now fully restored. Arnie tells the car \\"show me\\"; Christine restores itself to showroom quality, then seeks out the vandals; Moochie Welch (Malcolm Danare) is targeted first and crushed to death in an alley. Buddy, Richie Trelawney (Steven Tash) and Don Vandenberg (Stuart Charno) are then killed: Richie and Don are caught in a gas station explosion (which sets Christine on fire), and Buddy is run over and burned by the flaming car. The owner of the junkyard is eventually killed in the garage when he sits in the car and is crushed by the seat adjuster. On New Year's Eve, Dennis and Leigh reason that the only way to stop Christine and save Arnie is to destroy the car.

Here is a question about this article: An 1855 paper on the \\"introduction\\" of species, written by Alfred Russel Wallace, claimed that patterns in the geographical distribution of living and fossil species could be explained if every new species always came into existence near an already existing, closely related species. Charles Lyell recognised the implications of Wallace's paper and its possible connection to Darwin's work, although Darwin did not, and in a letter written on 1–2 May 1856 Lyell urged Darwin to publish his theory to establish priority. Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper. He met Lyell, and in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker affirmed that he did not want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal. He began a \\"sketch\\" account on 14 May 1856, and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species. His theory including the principle of divergence was complete by 5 September 1857 when he sent Asa Gray a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas. What is the answer to this question: How did Wallace claim that patterns in the distribution of species could be explained?","output":"Wallace claimed that patterns in the distribution of species could be explained through the concept that every new species always came into existence near an already existing, closely related species. In his 1855 paper on the \\"introduction\\" of species, Alfred Russel Wallace argued that observing the geographical distribution of both living and fossil species would show this connection between new and closely related pre-existing species. Essentially, Wallace's hypothesis suggested that new species would arise in close geographical proximity to their closely related species, which would then lead to certain patterns in the distribution of species across various geographical locations. This concept played a significant role in the development of the theory of evolution, as Charles Lyell recognized the implications of Wallace's work and its possible connection to Charles Darwin's research. Lyell subsequently urged Darwin to publish his own theory on species to establish priority. In summary, Alfred Russel Wallace claimed that the patterns in the distribution of living and fossil species could be best explained by the idea that every new species would come into existence near an already existing, closely related species. This insight contributed to the broader understanding of the mechanisms underlying species distribution and evolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","output":"Mirosław Pawlak is a notable figure in Polish politics, who has dedicated a significant portion of his life to public service. Born in 1942, Pawlak carries a rich Polish lineage and national identity, which has considerably shaped his political perspectives and approaches. Pawlak's political career is marked by his affiliation with the Polish People's Party, a significant political entity in Poland. Being part of this party testifies to his political conviction, as the Polish People's Party has been well-known for its agrarian stance and its emphasis on the farmers’ rights and rural development. One of the most significant contributions of Pawlak in the political field of Poland is his service as a member of the Sejm. The Sejm, lower house of the Polish Parliament, is a highly reputable office and plays a pivotal role in shaping the laws and policies of the country. Pawlak's term as a member of the Sejm started on the 25th of September, 2005, representing the constituency of 33 - Kielce. This period marked a critical phase of Pawlak's career as he was able to engage directly in legislation processes and decision-making to serve not only the people of Kielce but of the entire nation. The city of Kielce is known to be one of the significant urban settlements in Poland, which further underscores the importance of Pawlak's role as the representative of this region. As the representative of Constituency 33, Pawlak was entrusted with the task of voicing the concerns, interests, and needs of the people residing in this constituency, contributing to its development and welfare. Throughout his political career, Pawlak’s endeavors have not just been confined to legislative work. Serving his party and holding a notable position in the Sejm, he has been advocating for the principles and ideologies that the Polish People's Party stands for, with a focus on equality, human rights, social justice, and most notably, rural development and safeguarding farmers' rights. Despite now being in his late seventies, Pawlak's contributions to Polish politics and his dedicated service to the Polish People's Party remain significant footprints in the sand of times and serve as an inspiration to many aspiring politicians in Poland. In conclusion, Mirosław Pawlak, with his Polish roots and political commitments, has left an indelible mark on Polish politics. Representing the constituency of Kielce in the Sejm, his work has been instrumental in promoting the welfare of the local citizens and delivering the mission and vision of the Polish People's Party to a broader audience. His life is an illustration of dedicated service and constant advocacy for the values he believes in."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows: How would you define creativity? What does it mean to you to be an artist? Do you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy? Change and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography. You seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics.

Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences? What continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist?

Mathieu grew up to become a renowned French painter and writer, known for his significant contributions to the art world. He was a prominent figure in the movements of lyrical abstraction and tachisme, which emerged during the post-World War II period in Europe, particularly in France. Throughout his career, Mathieu created notable works such as \\"Hommage au Maréchal de Turenne\\" (1952) and \\"La Bataille de Bouvines\\" (1954). Apart from painting, Mathieu was also known for his writing, which helped to establish his reputation as a multi-talented artist.  Georges Mathieu held French nationality and became widely celebrated for his distinct artistic style. His paintings were characterized by bold, expressive strokes and vibrant colors, which represented the core principles of lyrical abstraction and tachisme.

Would PepsiCo potatoes be less or more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods'?  PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers. Eventually, they buy the potatoes for their chips. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips.  Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...

Their fries are thick cut, it's a very heavy meal....OPTIONS: 1). negative 2). positive I think the answer is","output":"2). positive The sentiment of this review is positive because the person talks about the nice terrace, not feeling like it was a tourist trap, enjoying the food, and that it was worth the money. They also mention the generous portion sizes and other menu options. The negative aspect - the food making them sick if they eat too much - is not strong enough to make the overall sentiment negative.

Question 2: If interacting with people makes us happy, are introverts less happy than extroverts? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Hello little friend! Let's understand these two questions one at a time. Question 1: How can extroverted persons handle introverted persons? An extroverted person is someone who likes talking and playing with lots of friends. An introverted person is someone who enjoys quiet time alone or with a few close friends. To help an extroverted person handle an introverted person, they can remember to: 1. Be patient: Since introverted people need time to think and can be quiet, give them a little more time to answer your questions or share their stories. Pretend it's like waiting for your turn on a swing! 2. Listen carefully: Introverted people might have some interesting things to share, but they'll only tell you if they know you're listening. It's like you're playing a detective and finding clues in what they're telling you! 3. Respect their space: Introverted people like to have their own space and not be surrounded by too many people. Think of it like a secret hiding spot where they can be comfortable. Question 2: If interacting with people makes us happy, are introverts less happy than extroverts? Interacting or playing with people can make us happy, but what makes one person happy might not be the same for someone else. Introverted people also enjoy spending time alone or with a small group of friends, they can be just as happy as extroverted people. Think of happiness like your favorite ice cream flavor. Different people like different flavors, and that's okay! As for your last question, no, questions 1 and 2 are not the same. Question 1 is about how extroverts can interact with introverts in a way that's comfortable for both. Question 2 is about whether introverts are less happy because they enjoy spending time with fewer people.

Naturally, I get some shitty customers, as well as plenty of fantastic customers. The problem is that I've noticed a pattern in what groups have been the biggest pains in my ass to deal with, at least as customers. And unfortunately that manages to settle into two specific groups: Hispanic families and east Asians. Hispanic families being the groups of at least three people at once, usually with at least one kid. First, there tends to be a language barrier that's difficult to get past, but I've learned to deal with that. *However*, these groups also tend to end up being picky on top of not knowing what they actually want (ordering one thing and then realizing they ordered wrong when I've finished the drink, even when I clarified what they meant when they ordered the drinks), showing up less that 30 minutes before close, not using normal manners like \\"please\\" and \\"thank you,\\" either tipping less than 50 cents or not tipping at all, giving me a 50 or 100 bill for an order under 10, and making an awful mess and either not cleaning up after themselves at all or half-assing their \\"attempt\\" to clean up. I realize that outside of a retail scenario these people are probably perfectly reasonable, but at work I'm starting to build a preemptive internal feeling of frustration when these demographics of people just walk into the store, before they've even approached the counter.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what is the political system of the us?\\" Answer:","output":"The political system of the United States is a federal constitutional republic, characterized by a separation of powers among three branches of government, a system of checks and balances, and a strong emphasis on individual rights. This system is based on the U.S. Constitution, which establishes the framework for the federal government and serves as the supreme law of the land. 1. Federalism: The United States is made up of 50 individual states, each with its own laws and governments. The federal government is responsible for addressing issues of national importance, while state governments handle matters of local concern. This division of authority between the national and state governments is known as federalism. 2. Separation of Powers: The U.S. Constitution divides the federal government into three branches—executive, legislative, and judicial—to prevent any single branch from becoming too powerful. Each branch has its own separate roles and responsibilities:   - The Executive Branch, headed by the President, is responsible for enforcing laws, conducting diplomacy, and managing the day-to-day operations of the federal government. The President is both the head of state and the head of government, and is elected to serve a four-year term.      - The Legislative Branch is composed of two houses: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate is made up of 100 members (two from each state), while the House has 435 representatives, with each state's representation based on its population. Together, these two houses make up the U.S. Congress, which is responsible for creating, debating, and passing legislation.      - The Judicial Branch is led by the Supreme Court, which consists of nine justices nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The Supreme Court's primary function is to interpret the Constitution and ensure that laws are consistent with its principles. 3. Checks and Balances: In order to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful, the U.S. Constitution establishes a system of checks and balances. This system allows each branch to monitor and regulate the actions of the other branches, ensuring that no single branch can act without oversight or accountability. 4. Bill of Rights and Individual Rights: The U.S. Constitution includes a Bill of Rights, consisting of the first ten amendments, that guarantees fundamental individual rights, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to a fair trial. These rights serve as the foundation for the American political system and ensure protection from government overreach. Overall, the political system of the United States is designed to promote democratic principles, safeguard individual liberties, and maintain a balance of power among the various branches and levels of government."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press)      MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Milwaukee man wanted to storm a Masonic temple with a machine gun and kill at least 30 people in an attack he hoped would show \\"nobody can play with Muslims\\" and spark more mass shootings in the United States, federal agents said Tuesday after the man's arrest.      Federal prosecutors charged 23-year-old Samy Mohamed Hamzeh with unlawfully possessing a machine gun and receiving and possessing firearms not registered to him. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney, Dean Puschnig, didn't immediately respond to a question asking why charges were limited to gun possession. Hamzeh's attorney, federal defender Ronnie Murray, didn't immediately return email and voicemail messages left after business hours.      According to an FBI affidavit, agents were tipped off in September that Hamzeh planned to travel to Israel in October to attack Israeli soldiers and citizens in the West Bank. He abandoned those plans due to \\"family, financial and logistic reasons,\\" the affidavit said, but refocused his efforts on a domestic attack.      Hamzeh discussed his plans extensively with two FBI informants. The affidavit said the FBI started recording his conversations with the informants in October.      Hamzeh and the two informants traveled to a gun range on Jan. 19 and practiced with a pistol. Afterward they took a tour of a Masonic temple in Milwaukee. The affidavit does not name the temple and Puschnig declined to identify it.      Masons are members of a fraternal organization that carries out a variety of activities including charity work. Wisconsin has nearly 11,000 Masons in 180 lodges, according to Frank Struble, grand master of Free and Accepted Masons in Wisconsin. The organization is not a religion.      Struble said the allegations were \\"hard to hear.\\" He said he knew which Masonic center had been targeted but declined to identify it.      \\"Masons are a part of an organization that helped build this country,\\" Struble said. \\"I can understand from that standpoint where someone who is against this country would target us.\\"      The owner of a downtown Milwaukee gym said she recently fired Hamzeh after hiring him as a trainer just a few weeks ago.      Delia Luna of 9Round Kickbox Fitness described Hamzeh as \\"very intense, very militant\\" as a trainer and said he didn't fit the atmosphere she wanted to create.      \\"He didn't mix well,\\" Luna said.      Federal agents said that on Jan. 19 and into the early morning of Jan. 20, Hamzeh discussed his plans to attack the temple with the informants, telling them they needed two more machine guns — the group apparently already had one — and silencers. They planned to station one person at the temple's entrance while the other two went through the building, killing everyone they saw. They then planned to walk away from the scene as if nothing had happened.      \\"I am telling you, if this hit is executed, it will be known all over the world ... all the Mujahedeen will be talking and they will be proud of us,\\" Hamzeh said, according to the affidavit. \\"Such operations will increase in America, when they hear about it. The people will be scared and the operations will increase. ... This way we will be igniting it. I mean we are marching at the front of the war.\\"      Hamzeh added that he hoped to kill 30 people, \\"because these 30 will terrify the world. The (expletive) will know that nobody can play with Muslims.\\"      He added, \\"We are here defending Islam, young people together join to defend Islam, that's it, that is what our intention is.\\"      According to the affidavit, Hamzeh met with two undercover FBI agents on Monday. They presented him with two automatic machine guns and a silencer. He paid for the weapons and silencer in cash and put them in the trunk of his car. The agents then arrested him and recovered the guns and silencer.      Hamzeh's arrest marks the Milwaukee area's second brush with a mass shooting in less than four years. A white supremacist named Wade Michael Page fatally shot six people at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, a Milwaukee suburb, in 2012. Page shot himself in the head after a police officer wounded him.      Last month Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a social services center in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people. They later died in a shootout with police.      ____      Richmond reported from Madison, Wisconsin. ||||| Advertisement Continue reading the main story      WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors on Tuesday announced the arrest of a Milwaukee man who they said was planning a mass shooting at a Masonic temple in the city.      The suspect, Samy Mohamed Hamzeh, 23, who worked as a trainer at a kickboxing facility, was charged with illegally buying a machine gun and a silencer to carry out the attack. But he was not charged with any terrorism-related offenses because investigators were unable to tie him conclusively to a foreign terrorist organization, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is continuing.      A tip from the public appears to have led counterterrorism investigators in Milwaukee to Mr. Hamzeh. The F.B.I. used two undercover operatives to gather evidence against him, including recorded conversations in which he spoke of making the “mujahedeen” overseas proud, the authorities said. “We are Muslims, defending Muslim religion,” he is accused of saying.      Last fall, Mr. Hamzeh planned to travel to Jordan, then enter the West Bank and attack Israeli soldiers and citizens, prosecutors said. But he abandoned those plans and instead focused on a possible attack in the United States, the prosecutors said.      In a criminal complaint filed Monday, the Justice Department charged that the suspect and the two undercover operatives went to a shooting range in the Milwaukee area last week for target practice. They then went to a Masonic temple in the city and got a tour to scout the location, the complaint said.      Mr. Hamzeh “devised a detailed plan to commit a mass shooting intended to kill dozens of people,” Gregory J. Haanstad, the acting United States attorney in Milwaukee, said in a statement. ||||| The exterior of Humphrey Scottish Rite Masonic, on N. Van Buren St., the target of a planned mass shooting. Credit: Rick Wood      By of the      A terrorist-style plot intended to kill dozens of people with automatic weapons at a Masonic center in Milwaukee was foiled this week by FBI agents, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.      Samy Mohamed Hamzeh discussed his plan to attack the center with two others, detailing how they would quickly and quietly kill the first people they saw and then methodically move through the building, \\"eliminating everyone\\" they encountered, according to a federal criminal complaint.      Hamzeh, 23, has been charged with possessing a machine gun and a silencer. Despite indications of an attempted act of terrorism, Hamzeh is not charged with any terrorism counts.      \\"We are Muslims, defending Muslim religion, we are on our own, my dear, we have organized our own group,\\" Hamzeh said, according to the criminal complaint, adding he was confident it would trigger more attacks in the United States.      \\"Such operations will increase in America, when they hear about it. The people will be scared and the operations will increase, and there will be problems all over,... this will lead to people clashing with each other. This way we will be igniting it. I mean we are marching at the front of the war,\\" he said, according to the complaint.      Acting U.S. Attorney Gregory J. Haanstad called it a \\"detailed plan to commit a mass shooting intended to kill dozens of people.\\"      \\"(Hamzeh) also said that he wanted this mass shooting to be 'known the world over' and to 'ignite' broader clashes. It is difficult to calculate the injury and loss of life that was prevented by concerned citizens coming forward and by the tireless efforts of the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force.\\"      Hamzeh does not claim a connection to an established, known terrorist group, according to the complaint. At one point he says, \\"We have our own group, not with Hamas, ... we are here defending Islam, young people together join to defend Islam, that's it, that is what our intention is.\\"      Jeff Cramer, a former federal prosecutor, said a criminal complaint is used to arrest someone and it appears there was urgency to take Hamzeh into custody. Prosecutors still must present the case to the grand jury, when additional charges may be added, including a terrorism-related count, but that will depend on the facts of the case, Cramer said. Such counts generally require approval from the Justice Department in Washington.      Hamzeh — who most recently worked at a downtown gym where he was fired for being too intense, gym owner Delia Luna said — appeared in federal court in Milwaukee Tuesday and remains in custody by order of U.S. Magistrate Judge David Jones. Hamzeh will have court-appointed counsel but an attorney has not been assigned, according to federal defender Daniel Stiller, who did not have further comment on the case.      Hamzeh was planning to attack the Humphrey Scottish Rite Masonic Center, a historic building on N. Van Buren St. in downtown Milwaukee that hosts weddings, conferences, meetings and other special events. The Wisconsin Scottish Rite, which purchased the building in 1912, has been in the community since 1863.      Hamzeh had scouted the Masonic center by taking a tour and spoke in detail about how the attack would occur, the complaint says. A woman in the lobby of the center Tuesday afternoon told a reporter that the staff had no comment.      Hamzeh had been under investigation by the FBI since September, which used confidential informants who secretly recorded him. Undercover FBI agents arrested him this week after he tried to buy automatic weapons from them, the complaint says.      Hamzeh originally had planned to travel to Jordan to attack Israeli soldiers and civilians in the West Bank, but ditched those plans because of logistical issues and focused on attacking a target in the U.S., according to the criminal complaint.      He hatched a plan to attack a Masonic center in Milwaukee with two others, who were actually the informants cooperating with the FBI.      Last week, Hamzeh and the informants went to a local shooting range and practiced firing a handgun. Afterward, they went to the Masonic center and got a tour of the facility. Later, Hamzeh spoke with the informants in detail about the planned attack, according to the complaint.      Detailed plan of attack      During this meeting, which was recorded and translated from Arabic to English, Hamzeh, according to the complaint, said they needed three automatic weapons, each with a silencer, to launch the attack.      According to the complaint:      They would enter with clothes over their heads, he said. It was important to quietly kill the receptionist, the first person they were likely to see, Hamzeh said.      \\"... If she was alone, it is OK, if there were two of them, shoot both of them, do not let the blood show, shoot her from the bottom, two or three shots in her stomach and let her sit on the chair and push her to the front, as if she is sleeping, did you understand?\\"      After killing those at the door, one attacker would remain there, Hamzeh said. \\"...One of us will stay at the door at the entrance and lock the door down, he will be at the main door down, two will get to the lift (elevator) up, they will enter the room, and spray everyone in the room. The one who is standing downstairs will spray anyone he finds. We will shoot them, kill them and get out.\\"      Hamzeh said each of them would have to kill everyone around him, \\"to annihilate everyone, there is no one left, I mean when we go into a room, we will be killing everyone, that's it, this is our duty.\\"      The exit plan was to leave by the stairs and out the door, quietly and calmly. \\"We leave, as if there is nothing, no running, no panic, just regular walking.\\"      Global reaction predicted      He predicted the attack could bring global attention, the complaint states.      \\"I am telling you, if this hit is executed, it will be known all over the world. Sure, all over the world, all the Mujahedeen will be talking and they will be proud of us.\\"      Of the target, he said, according to the complaint: \\"They are all Masonic; they are playing with the world like a game, man, and we are like asses, we don't know what is going on, these are the ones who are fighting, these are the ones that needs to be killed, not the Shi'iat, because these are the ones who are against us, these are the ones who are making living for us like hell,\\" he said.      \\"Thirty is excellent. If I got out, after killing thirty people, I will be happy 100% ... 100% happy, because these 30 will terrify the world.\\"      Hamzeh met with undercover FBI agents on Monday. The undercover agents showed two weapons and a silencer to Hamzeh, and told him the weapons were capable of fully automatic fire, the complaint says.      Hamzeh agreed to a price and paid it to the undercover agents, who then handed Hamzeh a bag containing two automatic weapons and a silencer. Hamzeh carried the bag to his car and put the bag in the trunk of the vehicle, the complaint states. He then was arrested.      Robert J. Shields, special agent in charge of the Milwaukee FBI, said the arrest was the result of well-coordinated law enforcement work, \\"thwarting an attack that could have resulted in significant injury and/or loss of life.\\"      Cary Spivak, Bruce Vielmetti, Jesse Garza and Mary Spicuzza of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A man in Milwaukee, US, has been arrested after planning to carry out a mass shooting at a Masonic Temple.

Context: A permissive society is a society in which social norms become increasingly liberal, especially with regard to sexual freedom. This usually accompanies a change in what is considered deviant. While typically preserving the rule \\"do not harm others\\" (harm principle/non-aggression principle), a permissive society would have few other moral or legal codes (no victimless crimes, for example). Hypothesis: A permissive society ends up becoming quite deviant. Choose from:  * Yes.  * It's impossible to say.  * No.","output":"To draw an appropriate conclusion, let's analyze the context step by step: 1. The context defines a permissive society as one where social norms become increasingly liberal, especially in matters of sexual freedom. 2. This change usually accompanies a redefinition of what is considered deviant. 3. A permissive society typically follows the rule \\"do not harm others,\\" but has fewer moral and legal codes concerning victimless crimes. Given these points, we will evaluate if the hypothesis \\"A permissive society ends up becoming quite deviant\\" is valid. The term \\"deviant\\" refers to behavior that deviates from social norms. In the context, it's mentioned that what is considered deviant may change as the society becomes more permissive. Therefore, whether the society becomes deviant or not depends on what is accepted as the new social norm in that society. So, the conclusion we can draw from the context is: \\"It's impossible to say.\\" The hypothesis that a permissive society ends up becoming quite deviant cannot be confirmed or denied universally, as the degree of deviation depends on the evolving social norms within that specific society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, I would suggest validating the answer, as it correctly addresses the question of how RFID tags are powered. However, I would recommend expanding on the response to provide a more comprehensive view of the powering mechanisms involved in RFID tags. Here is a more detailed answer: RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags consist of two primary types: passive and active. The power source for each type of tag differs, as explained below: 1. Passive RFID tags: These tags do not have their own power source. Instead, they draw energy from the RFID reader's electromagnetic field, as mentioned in the suggested answer. The reader generates a magnetic field when it is within close proximity to the tag, usually a few meters or less, depending on the tag's frequency and strength. Through electromagnetic induction, the tag's antenna captures the magnetic field's energy, which then powers the microchip in the tag, allowing it to transmit its stored information back to the reader. 2. Active RFID tags: In contrast to passive tags, active RFID tags have their own power source, typically in the form of a small battery. This internal power source allows active tags to have longer read ranges, increased storage capacity, and faster data transmission capabilities compared to passive tags. However, active tags are generally larger in size and more expensive than their passive counterparts due to the need for a battery. In conclusion, the initial suggested answer is correct in stating that some RFID tags are powered via magnetic fields through electromagnetic induction. However, it is essential to note that this powering mechanism applies primarily to passive RFID tags, whereas active RFID tags rely on an internal power source, usually a battery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They might cheer about the guy having sex with the hot cheerleader, but I can also guarantee that the first the football team heard about it would not be at a urinal.\\"     The tone is still negative as the reviewer criticizes the unreality of the scene portrayed in the film. 3. \\"It was obvious that this film didn't take itself so seriously, and it wasn't hideously bad, but come on!\\"    In this sentence, the reviewer might have slight positive sentiment as they note the film doesn't take itself seriously and wasn't \\"hideously bad\\", but they conclude with \\"come on!\\" - a phrase that suggests exasperation, returning to a negative sentiment. Summing up these points, the overall sentiment of the review can be considered negative as the critic has more complaints than praise for the movie, expressing dissatisfaction with character development and plot realism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Process:  - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose System weakened by more stress happens, how will it affect material will pass through stomach quickly.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis supposes that the digestive system may be weakened by more stress, which could potentially affect the rate at which material passes through the stomach. If this were to happen, changes in the overall digestive process could be observed. Stress can have various impacts on the human body, and the digestive system is no exception. When the body experiences stress, it triggers the release of stress hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline, to respond to the perceived threat. This response is commonly called the \\"fight or flight\\" response. These hormones can cause a range of physiological changes like increased heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. As a result, the body's main priority shifts from digesting food to addressing the source of stress. In the context of the digestive process, an increase in stress can cause the stomach to release more acid, which may result in various symptoms like heartburn, indigestion, or stomach pain. However, stress may also affect the speed at which the stomach empties its contents. In some cases, stress can cause the stomach to empty its contents more quickly than usual, which means that food might not be adequately broken down before it enters the small intestine. This rapid gastric emptying could lead to malabsorption of nutrients and poorer digestion. On the other hand, stress could also slow down the movement of food through the stomach. This is caused by the stress response's effect on the production of certain hormones responsible for the proper functioning of the digestive system. In this scenario, stress might lead to a delay in stomach emptying, causing food to sit in the stomach for longer periods. This can give rise to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and feelings of fullness. Moreover, prolonged exposure to stomach acid might cause irritation and inflammation of the stomach lining, leading to gastritis. Besides its direct impact on the digestive process, stress has indirect effects. Stress can alter the balance of gut bacteria, known as the gut microbiota. An imbalance in gut bacteria can have far-reaching consequences on digestive health, leading to symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, or bloating. Given all these factors, it is evident that stress can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of digestion. While the perturbation hypothesis suggests that material may pass through the stomach more quickly due to stress, other possibilities, such as delayed stomach emptying and alterations in gut microbiota, are also of concern. It's crucial to address stress and maintain proper digestive health in order to avoid complications and ensure efficient digestive processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\").   Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the third greatest in the show's history.

Given these facts, what does aggression cause among the following options: - ligt  - death  - harm  - damage  - force  - caring  - companionship  - peace A:","output":"Aggression can cause several outcomes among the options provided, including harm, damage, and possibly even death.  1. Harm: Aggressive behavior is often intended to cause harm or pain, which can range from emotional pain to physical harm. It can take various forms, such as verbal abuse, bullying in school or workplace settings, or domestic violence. The harm can be done to oneself or others, and can often have lasting emotional and psychological effects on those involved.  2. Damage: As a direct result of aggressive behavior, damage may be incurred to people, relationships, or property. For example, heated arguments or physical altercations may lead to emotional damage for the individuals involved, while physical aggression could result in damaged objects or spaces. Damage caused by aggression can be difficult to repair, particularly in cases where trust has been broken between individuals or the well-being of a person has been compromised. 3. Death: In extreme cases, aggression can escalate to the point of causing death. When acts of aggression become life-threatening, such as those involving weapons or fatal assaults, the potential for loss of life increases. Factors contributing to heightened aggression include substance abuse, mental health challenges, and learned patterns of behavior from upbringing or societal exposure. It is important to note that while these are some possible outcomes of aggression, it does not encompass all possible consequences. Additionally, it is essential to recognize that aggression can manifest within varying degrees with a wide range of potential impacts. As such, understanding the nuances and complexities of aggressive behavior is crucial in addressing, preventing, or mitigating potential harm, damage, or death arising from these situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer who is under investigation for his business dealings, has provided legal advice to Fox News host Sean Hannity, one of Trump’s most prominent media supporters. The dramatic revelation came Monday during a court hearing in New York where lawyers for Cohen and Trump argued for permission to determine whether thousands of pages of documents FBI agents seized from Cohen last week should be subject to attorney-client privilege. U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood appeared to reject the idea, saying that a “taint team” created by prosecutors to set aside privileged documents is a “viable option,” while a court-appointed outside lawyer known as a “special master” may also play a role in determining which records can and cannot be viewed by prosecutors. The disclosure about Hannity, who also hosts a nationally syndicated talk radio show, came after prosecutors indicated that Cohen performed “little to no legal work” and had just one client: Trump. In response, Cohen’s lawyers said that Cohen has represented three clients in the past year — Trump, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and a third “publicly prominent individual” who wished to remain anonymous. Cohen's lawyers identified Hannity as the third unnamed client only after Judge Wood ruled that it must be made public.

Theo Walcott teased Tottenham Hotspur supporters with a 2-0 scoreline gesture as he was stretchered from the action during Arsenal’s FA Cup victory at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners were leading thanks to goals from Santi Cazorla and Tomas Rosicky when, with seven minutes remaining, Walcott made the cheeky hand signal to the visiting fans. The Football Association may choose to take action against Walcott for his taunt, while Tottenham may also come under fire after their supporters showered him with objects. Cheeky: Theo Walcott leaves the game on a stretcher and reminds the Spurs fans of the 2-0 scoreline. All smiles: Walcott cannot hide his grin as he makes the gesture, to the delight of Arsenal's fans. Two good: Arsenal were comfortable victors as they booked their place in the fourth round. Satisfaction: Walcott continued to tease the visiting fans as he made his way around the pitch. They had responded with a hail of coins, as well as a lighter, a plastic cup and a bread bun. But Walcott, who had been forced off with a leg injury, appeared unconcerned and was smiling ear to ear despite the irritation caused. He then donned a scarf thrown to him by a member of the home support who were thrilled with their player's jibe. Walcott’s team-mate Wojciech Szczesny also got in on the act and posted a picture mimicking the gesture on his Instagram account. Handy: Wojciech Szczesny copies Walcott's cheeky gesture in this instagram post. Money shot: A matchday steward holds a handful of coins that were thrown in the direction of Walcott. Target: A lighter, a bread roll and a plastic cup were all hurled towards Walcott. The Football Association will wait until receiving the match report of referee Mark Clattenburg before deciding whether the Walcott incident warrants investigation. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, however, moved to diffuse the situation. 'The doctors said to me that the coins had been raining over his (Walcott's) head and they had to protect him, maybe that is why he did that. Yes (the coins came before the gesture) that is what I have been told,' said Wenger. 'After that, what he did is not offensive. You look for every single incident, I can understand that, but it is an action that didn't offend anybody. Angry: Some of the visiting fans were incensed by Walcott's cheeky scoreline. 'I have seen the pictures after the game and it does not even look aggressive, he is smiling.' Last month, Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere was suspended for two matches after television pictures showed him making an obscene hand gesture towards Manchester City supporters in the 6-3 defeat at Manchester City. Wenger, though, maintained this situation did not merit any disciplinary action. 'My response will be simple, they (FA) have seen the pictures on television. If they judge it offensive, what can I say?' the Arsenal boss added. Injury: Walcott was taken off on a stretcher towards the end of the FA Cup victory. Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood, meanwhile, revealed in his post-match press conference he had not witnessed the incidents. Sherwood said: 'Someone just mentioned it to me in there. I didn't see it. 'Is that what he did? Well, listen I don't know Theo, I don't know him as a lad. It could have been a bit of banter, possibly. 'If they (Tottenham fans) did then it's a problem, isn't it? If they didn't then it's not a problem.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In a 2014 FA Cup match, Arsenal player Theo Walcott taunted Tottenham Hotspur fans with a 2-0 scoreline gesture while being stretchered off the field due to a leg injury. Tottenham fans responded by throwing coins, a lighter, a plastic cup, and a bread roll at Walcott. The Football Association considered investigating the incident, but Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger dismissed it as non-offensive and not aggressive. Wenger added that the coins were thrown before Walcott made the gesture, and that Walcott was smiling during the incident. Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood admitted he didn't see the incident and suggested it might have been banter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

While the passage does not specifically mention any dish, we can deduce the possibilities based on traditional French cuisine commonly featured in a 3-course meal. A traditional French meal typically consists of an appetizer or \\"entrée,\\" a main course or \\"plat principal,\\" and a dessert. Since we are asked about one dish, let's consider potential dishes for each of the three courses. Appetizer possibilities: 1. French Onion Soup: A rich soup made with onions, beef broth, and topped with melted Gruyère cheese on toasted bread. 2. Escargot: Snails cooked with garlic, butter, and parsley, typically served as a starter in French cuisine. 3. Ratatouille: A vegetable medley consisting of eggplant, zucchini, tomatoes, and bell peppers, slowly cooked in olive oil and flavored with herbs. Main course possibilities: 1. Coq au Vin: A traditional French dish made of braised chicken cooked in red wine, mushrooms, onions, and garlic, often served with potatoes or noodles. 2. Bouillabaisse: A fish stew that contains various types of fish and shellfish, simmered with vegetables, olive oil, and flavored with saffron, fennel, and other herbs. 3. Beef Bourguignon: A slow-cooked beef stew prepared with red wine, mushrooms, onions, and herbs, typically served with mashed potatoes or baguettes. Dessert possibilities: 1.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the company that markets pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring? is inside the article: People have used resources on and around the Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 03:36 EST, 4 April 2013. |. UPDATED:. 17:06 EST, 4 April 2013. Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy signed into law Thursday sweeping new restrictions on weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines similar to the ones used by the man who gunned down 20 child and six educators in the massacre. Alongside family members of some of the victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Malloy signed the bill hours after the General Assembly approved the measure to give the state some of the toughest gun laws in the country. 'This is a profoundly emotional day for everyone in this room,' the governor said. 'We have come together in a way that few places in the nation have demonstrated the ability to do.' Scroll down for video. Taking action: Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy signed strict gun control measures into state law on Thursday while surrounded by the parents of victims from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Relatives: Nicole Hockley (right), the mother of slain Dylan Hockley, hugs State Senator Beth Bye as Neil Heslin (left), the father of victim Jesse Lewis, watches. Emotional: Mark Barden, the father of victim Daniel Barden, cries as he hugs Senator Richard Blumenthal following the signing of the law banning more than 100 weapons. Waiting for action: Relatives of two of the children who were killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting added to the poignancy of the signing of the gun control law on Thursday. In the hours after the shooting. December 14, as anxious family members gathered inside a firehouse and. waited for news, Malloy told them their loved ones were not coming home. He said later that he didn't think it was right for the families to. wait for the victims to be formally identified. Now, Connecticut joins states. including California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts in having. the country's strongest gun control laws, said Brian Malte, director of. mobilization for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in. Washington. 'This would put Connecticut right at the top or near the top of the states with the strongest gun laws,' Malte said. The legislation adds more than 100. firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials. have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as. well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition. Some parts of the bill. would take effect immediately after Malloy's signature, including. background checks for all firearms sales. Support: Now Connecticut is one of the states with the most strict gun control laws in the country. Advocate: Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy has been held up as a leader on the issue of gun control. Heartfelt: Malloy was the one to inform the waiting parents on December 14th that their children had been killed. Following a total of more than 13. hours of respectful and at times somber debate, the House of. Representatives and the Senate voted in favor of the 139-page bill. crafted by leaders from both major parties in the Democratic-controlled. General Assembly. Both were bipartisan votes. 'I pray today's bill — the most. far-reaching gun safety legislation in the country — will prevent other. families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26 Sandy Hook. families have felt,' said House Majority Leader Joe Aresimowicz. 'Don't tread on me': Gun control opponents. outside the statehouse in Hartford, Connecticut, as lawmakers debated. the new laws passed last night which ban more than 100 guns and. large-capacity ammo magazines. Gun control advocates: Lauren Garrett, a supporter of gun regulation and her son Robert display a sign that reads 'Ban AR-15's' inside the statehouse in Hartford yesterday. Colorado and New York also passed new. gun control requirements in the wake of the Newtown shooting, in which a. 20-year-old gunman used a military-style semi-automatic rifle. Compared with Connecticut's. legislation, which, for example, bans the sale or purchase of ammunition. magazines holding more than 10 rounds, New York restricted magazines to. seven bullets and gave owners of higher-capacity magazines a year to. sell them elsewhere. Colorado banned ammunition magazines that hold more. than 15 rounds. President Barack Obama has urged lawmakers at the national level to take similar action. Connecticut House majority leader Joe. Aresimowicz said of last night's decision: 'I pray today's bill - the. most far-reaching gun safety legislation in the country - will prevent. other families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26. Sandy Hook families have felt.' Some of the measures take effect. right away, including an expansion of the state's assault weapons ban,. background checks for all firearms sales and a ban on the sale or. purchase of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Defining issue: President Barack Obama speaks about gun control at the Denver Police Academy in Colorado yesterday. He is pushing for new nationwide gun controls but faces opposition from powerful groups. The massacre reignited a national. debate on gun control, and President Obama has made gun safety one of. the defining issues of his second term, which started a month after the. shooting. His proposed gun control measures. have largely stalled in Congress, however, and Obama has planned a trip. to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in. Washington. Legislative leaders, aware of the attention on them, struck a rare bipartisan agreement they want to serve as a national model. Long debate: Rob Kane, a Republican senator serving towns in western Connecticut, left, questions Senate President Donald Williams, D-Brooklyn, during a discussion of a gun bill on the Senate floor last night. Tense: Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, R-Fairfield, left, and Senator Carlo Leone, D-Stamford and Darien, watch a vote for an amendment of the gun-control bill at the Capitol in Hartford. President Barack Obama has made gun safety one of the defining issues of his second term, which began just a month after the bloody Sandy Hook massacre. Connecticut is the latest state to introduce stricter gun controls in response to the 26 killings on December 14, joining New York, Massachusetts, California and Colorado. But Obama's proposed national gun control measures have largely stalled in Congress, however, and the president has planned a trip to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in Washington. He visited Colorado yesterday and repeated his call for universal background checks for gun buyers - a measure that has better chances of winning enough support in Congress than an assault weapons ban or limits on large-capacity ammunition magazines. Obama's visit was heavy with political symbolism because Colorado recently expanded gun control laws despite being a western, largely rural state where gun ownership is a cherished right. Colorado suffered two of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history - at Columbine school in 1999 and at a movie theater last year. It has expanded background checks for gun purchases and placed restrictions on ammunition magazines. Obama said Colorado's action shows 'there doesn't have to be a conflict' between keeping citizens safe and protecting the right to bear firearms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. But the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby claims more guns keep people safer and have blocked many efforts towards stricter gun controls. Several county sheriffs in Colorado have also vowed not to enforce the new gun restrictions. Senate. President Donald Williams Jr., a Democrat, said: 'The tragedy in. Newtown demands a powerful response, demands a response that transcends. politics. 'It is the strongest and most comprehensive bill in the country.' The. bill passed 26-10 in the Senate and 105-44 in the House of. Representatives. Both were bipartisan votes. The legislation adds more than 100. firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials. have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as. well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition. But some lawmakers said they felt the legislation did not do enough to address mental health issues. Representative Mitch Bolinsky, a freshman Republican lawmaker from Newtown, acknowledged the legislation 'is not perfect' and he hoped would be 'a beginning in addressing critical mental health needs.' Representative Douglas McCrory, D-Hartford, said he felt the bill 'doesn't speak to the issue of gun violence that has permeated our cities.' He said families in his district who've lost children to gun violence have not received the same level of attention from state politicians as the Newtown families. But Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, R-Fairfield, whose district includes Newtown, said he felt he was representing the interests of the Sandy Hook victims as he cast his vote. 'I stand here as their voice, as their elected representative,' he said, reciting the names of the 26 victims at the school. Lawmakers appeared to still be stunned by the enormity of the massacre. 'When. a child is sent to school, their parents expect them to be safe. The. Sandy Hook shooting rampage was a parent's, a school system's, a. community's and the nation's worst nightmare,' said Republican state. Sen. Toni Boucher of Wilton. Horror: Connecticut State Police lead a line of. children from the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. on Friday, December 14, 2012 after the massacre at the school which. claimed 26 lives. Grief: Young children wait outside Sandy Hook Elementary School after the shootings. Tears: A woman waits to hear about her sister, a teacher, following a shooting at the Sandy Hook. Gun rights advocates, who greatly. outnumbered gun control supporters in demonstrations held earlier in the. day at the Capitol, railed against the proposals as misguided and. unconstitutional. Newtown school gunman Adam Lanza: He slaughtered. 20 first-grade pupils and six teachers with shots from a legally bought high-powered rifle. 'No! No! No!' and 'Read the bill!' they chanted. 'We want them to write laws that are sensible,' said Ron Pariseau, of Pomfret, who was angry he'll be made a felon if he doesn't register his weapons that will no longer be sold in Connecticut. 'What they're proposing will not stop anything.' By the time the Senate voted around 6.30pm, many of the gun rights advocates had gone home, leaving behind proponents of the bill who applauded when the tally in the Senate was read. The halls were mostly empty by the time the House voted at 2.26am this morning. Among the gun control advocates were Dan and Lauren Garrett, of Hamden, wearing green shirts in honor of the Sandy Hook victims. The Garretts traveled to Hartford with their 10-month-old son, Robert, to watch the bill's passage. They said they hope lawmakers will build on the proposal. 'It's just the beginning of this bill. In six months from now, it's going to get stronger and stronger,' Dan Garrett said. 'I think they're watching us all over the country.'","output":"- Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy signed new gun restrictions into law, including limitations on weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines. - The law was signed in the presence of family members of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. - Connecticut now has some of the toughest gun laws in the country. - The legislation bans more than 100 firearms, creates a dangerous weapon offender registry, and enforces eligibility rules for buying ammunition. - The measure's passage in Connecticut was seen as a national model for bipartisan cooperation on gun control."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: loses sight of its own story  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence leans towards a negative impression. The sentence \\"loses sight of its own story\\" suggests that the film has shortcomings when it comes to its narrative. The phrase \\"loses sight\\" implies that the movie could not maintain a strong focus on the central plot or core message throughout its duration. This kind of critique could indicate various problems with the movie, such as weak character development, inconsistencies in the story arc, or the presence of confusing subplots that detract from the main storyline. As the film fails to remain cohesive and engaging, it is likely to lead to a less enjoyable and more frustrating viewing experience.

News article: DENVER — The woman who once held the crown for Miss Denver 2018 has stepped away from the position.      Kayla Kline posted to her Instagram this week that she has resigned in solidarity with the current Miss America, who claimed of bullying in the Miss America Organization (MAO).      “With a heavy heart I resign,” Kline wrote in the post. “I sent my letter to be received at the national level this afternoon. The national organization that the current MAO board of directors has made Miss America into is not one that I recognize. Miss America deserves a voice, and if you can't hear her, I'll stand and shout with her.”      The post included a screenshot of her email to the national organization, where she expressed her concerns with its direction.      “I hope that maybe, if the current board recognizes that the actions they have taken and the manner in which they conduct themselves has caused damage enough to make faithful titleholders resign that it may help push positive change,” she wrote.      Her decision came in the wake of a letter penned by current Miss America Cara Mund, where Mund claimed that she was silenced and bullied by leaders in the organization, and wanted to stand up for all the volunteers and participants involved, according to the AP. Mund sent the letter to former Miss Americas on Friday.      \\"Let me be blunt: I strongly believe that my voice is not heard nor wanted by our current leadership; nor do they have any interest in knowing who I am and how my experiences relate to positioning the organization for the future,\\" Mund wrote, according to the AP. \\"Our chair and CEO have systematically silenced me, reduced me, marginalized me, and essentially erased me in my role as Miss America in subtle and not-so-subtle ways on a daily basis. After a while, the patterns have clearly emerged, and the sheer accumulation of the disrespect, passive-aggressive behavior, belittlement, and outright exclusion has taken a serious toll.\\"      On Aug. 17, MAO published a response to Mund's accusations.      “The Miss America Organization supports Cara,\\" the response said. \\"It is disappointing that she chose to air her grievances publicly not privately. Her letter contains mischaracterizations and many unfounded accusations. We are reaching out to her privately to address her concerns.” ||||| Mund opens up to The Hollywood Reporter about speaking up about the pageant and its chairwoman, revealing she'd have \\"no regrets\\" if she's stripped of her title before the next coronation on Sept. 9.      When Cara Mund won Miss America last year, she never anticipated the challenges that would come during her reign.      Months after the North Dakota native took home the crown, the Miss America Organization became embroiled in scandal as offensive email chains leaked in December. In the exchanges, former CEO Sam Haskell, along with other organization leaders, crudely discussed the appearances of women who had competed in the pageant with demeaning and misogynistic language.      \\"That was a tough time,\\" Mund tells The Hollywood Reporter. \\"Transitioning is always hard. I figured there would be some growing pains.\\"      Pain, Mund says, \\"came indeed.\\" According to the 24-year-old beauty queen, the treatment she claims to have experienced under the new leadership of chairwoman Gretchen Carlson and CEO Regina Hopper was nearly paralyzing. In a five-page open letter — written to fellow Miss America winners and shared via her official Facebook page Aug. 17 — Mund detailed the bullying she allegedly endured at the hands of Carlson and Hopper, including hurtful comments about her appearance and an intent to have her \\"silenced.\\"      \\"The treatment just kept getting worse and I kept thinking to myself, 'Is it my fault?'\\" Mund says, adding that her first uncomfortable encounter with Hopper was telling of their future dynamic.      \\"The first instance of bullying that really sticks out to me? Back in January, the very first time I met Regina. She told me she's not nice. We were walking down the hall and she gave me some kind of compliment,\\" Mund recalls. \\"And my response is typically like, 'Oh, that's so nice of you.' And she turned around and she said, 'Oh, I'm not nice.'\\"      Later, as Mund claims in her letter, Hopper went as far as to criticize her sartorial choices. Of a Karl Lagerfield dress Mund once wore, Hopper allegedly said, \\"Yuck. You should burn that. Don't ever wear that again.\\"      Aside from Hopper's alleged insults, which, as Mund says, \\"took a toll\\" on her emotional well-being, Mund says that Carlson barred the Brown University graduate from participating in high-profile appearances that past titleholders have historically been a part of.      \\"There was a National Press Club luncheon in D.C. that the CEO and chairwoman took. And it's fine. They can have it. But why wasn't I asked to do that? I had voiced this concern before,\\" Mund tells THR. \\"When we go in to get sponsors or attend big events, they should bring Miss America because I'm a product of the organization. I'm determined, I have an opinion, I am well-spoken and educated. Plus, I want to work! To have this job means the world to me and I want to make each day count.\\"      But, under Carlson's leadership, Mund says her contributions as Miss America have been minimal at best. Adding to a long list of letdowns, she also says she was blocked from attending a trip to Cannes this year, where Carlson spoke about the relevance of Miss America in the #MeToo era. The former Fox & Friends anchor and onetime Miss America was hailed as an early voice of the movement after coming forward with her claims of sexual misconduct against the late Roger Ailes; she also offers advice about how to conquer workplace harassment in her 2017 book, Be Fierce.      Mund finds it hard to reconcile Carlson's public persona with the woman Mund claims has \\"systematically silenced me, reduced me, marginalized me, and essentially erased me in my role as Miss America in subtle and not-so-subtle ways on a daily basis.\\"      She elaborates to THR: \\"After all this, I do admire Gretchen's courage to come forward when she did because I now realize how tough and how scary it is. At the same time, I wish I would have had support from her because she is someone who went through harassment — at a different level, obviously, and in a different situation — but she knows how bad it can be on the other side.\\"      \\"I just want to be heard in the same way she wanted to be heard,\\" adds Mund, who says she's been vocal about her issues with the organization's leadership since January. \\"My voice matters just as much as she feels hers does.\\"      Mund's pageant sisters are certainly paying attention. More than 20 former Miss Americas, many of whom have expressed public praise for Mund, are now demanding that the entire Miss America board of directors, including Carlson and Hopper, resign. A petition calling for the same has been signed by over 21,000 people.      In the state of New Jersey, where Miss America is crowned each year in Atlantic City, workplace bullying is defined as \\"deliberate insults, threats, demeaning comments, constant criticism, overbearing supervision, profane outbursts, blatant ostracism, being overworked or simply not communicating with colleagues.\\"      Mund believes that what she has experienced falls under this definition. However, she tells THR that she'd like to avoid taking legal action against Carlson, Hopper or the Miss America Organization. \\"I think we all have the same goal,\\" says Mund. \\"I hope we all want Miss America to survive. I prefer not to take legal action. I just want us to air it out, point out the concerns and fix them. Let's move on.\\"      Carlson refuted Mund's claims in a lengthy Twitter statement Aug. 19. Since then, she has attempted to reach Mund via phone. \\"I just prefer written communication at this point,\\" Mund says. \\"There's been a loss of trust, so that's what I've requested.\\"      After sharing her letter, Mund says she's been receiving \\"emails about security instructions\\" for Sept. 9, the day she is set to hand over the crown to a new competitor at Miss America 2019. \\"But they're also forwarding media requests directly to me, to handle on my own,\\" she says. \\"So, I have no idea what's going on. Sometimes I think to myself, 'Is this a game? Is this a setup?' Those are thoughts I have, and thoughts I have had throughout my tenure.\\"      Mund has also thought about the \\"possibility\\" of being dethroned before this year's pageant takes place — which would be a first in the 97-year history of Miss America. But, if she does have to hand in her tiara and sash ahead of time, she'll do it with a smile on her face.      \\"Yes, it is a possibility that they take away my crown. But if they strip me of my title early, speaking out would have been well worth it. I have no regrets,\\" she says. \\"I want the next winner to know that she's stronger than she thinks she is. I kept thinking I was going to break, but I didn't. Women are so strong. And I want her to know that she has my support and the support of everyone who supported me.\\"      Mund, who has plans to attend law school in the fall of 2019, concludes: \\"She needs to know that she has a voice and it's important. If she feels like she can't use it, grab that microphone and use it louder. She can really cause change.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Miss Denver 2018 Kayla Kline has resigned from her position in solidarity with the current Miss America, Cara Mund, who claims she has faced bullying within the Miss America Organization (MAO).

He has two samples of particles, sample A and sample B. Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles.  But I can use this background: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form.  What is an answer for this question: Would kinetic energy in sample B likely be lost or retained? Answer:","output":"In order to determine whether kinetic energy in sample B would likely be lost or retained, we must first understand the properties of the particles within sample B and analyze the type of collisions they might undergo. While we know that sample A contains gas particles, which are assumed to experience elastic collisions, sample B has not been explicitly defined. However, we do know that it does not contain gas particles. Considering sample B contains particles other than gas particles, it is possible that it could be made up of liquids or solids. The behavior of particles in these states of matter is different from that of gas particles. In liquid and solid states, the particles typically have stronger intermolecular forces and are in relatively closer proximity when compared to gas particles. This can result in energy transfer during collisions, including both kinetic and potential energy transformations.  In response to the question of whether kinetic energy in sample B would be lost or retained, it is important to note that, unlike gas particles, collisions between particles in liquid and solid states might not always be perfectly elastic. This means that when particles in sample B undergo collisions, some kinetic energy could be transformed into other forms of energy, like thermal energy or vibrational energy, due to the stronger intermolecular forces.  As a result, it can be concluded that kinetic energy in sample B would likely be partially lost during collisions, as some of it may be converted into other forms of energy. This is in contrast to the elastic collisions between gas particles in sample A, where kinetic energy is conserved. However, the extent to which kinetic energy is lost in sample B during collisions would depend on the nature of the particles, their velocities, the intermolecular forces in play, and the experimental conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I read this background article the other day: For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate.

Question: suppose feeling more depressed happens, how will it affect A person eats more  high sugar food.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"Step 1: Suppose feeling more depressed happens. Reasoning: A person might have emotional changes, leading to altered eating habits. Step 2: A person eats more high sugar food. Reasoning: Consuming high sugar food may be a coping mechanism for some people when they are feeling more depressed. Step 3: The person's blood sugar level rises. Reasoning: Eating more high sugar food will result in an increase in blood sugar levels. Step 4: The pancreas receives a signal to release insulin. Reasoning: The body senses elevated blood sugar levels and signals the pancreas to secrete insulin. Step 5: Insulin is released into the bloodstream. Reasoning: The pancreas releases insulin in response to high blood sugar levels. Step 6: Insulin signals cells to absorb sugar. Reasoning: Insulin is a hormone that enables cells to take in sugar from the bloodstream. Step 7: The cells absorb the sugar from the bloodstream. Reasoning: The cells take in sugar to use it as a source of energy, reducing blood sugar levels in the process. Influence on the second effect (person's blood sugar level rises): More effect. Reasoning: When a person eats more high sugar food, it leads to a greater increase in blood sugar levels than if they consumed less, or no high sugar food. This is because consuming more sugar directly correlates to an increase in blood sugar levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, the director, Mr. Hansen, manages to insult the young women gravely, and they leave the studios in anger, taking one of the studio's fancy cars as their ride while still wearing the costumes from the production. They drive to the luxurious Hotel Trollheimen, and use the costumes to lure the management into thinking they really are a countess and her maid. On the outside they encounter army Lt. Paul Von Cram, who is so captivated by their appearance - especially Karen's - that he offers to carry their suitcases up to their hotel suite. Because of this the two women mistake Paul for a bellboy. Paul decides to cancel his imminent date with socialite woman Peg Manning, since he now has his eyes set on Karen. He then sends Karen a note at the hotel, asking her to meet \\"a lieutenant\\" at the hotel bar. Karen is intrigued by this and has no idea that it is Paul she is meeting.
