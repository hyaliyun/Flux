In the first development, a portrait of Shakespeare, which is believed to be the only picture painted of him during his lifetime, was _ in London. The artwork has been dated back to 1610, meaning it was painted six years before the writer's death. The painting had been owned by a family descended from Shakespeare's literary patron tor hundreds of years without them ever knowing who the man in the picture was. Alec Cobbe, who inherited the portrait, realized that the painting was a likeness of Shakespeare after visiting an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery where he saw a portrait that had, until 70 years ago, been accepted as a life portrait of Shakespeare. Mr Cobhe immediately realized he was looking at a copy of the painting that had been in his family for centuries. The painting will now go on display in Shakespeare's hometown Stratford-upon-Avon. In a separate story, archaeologists in London believe they have unearthed the remains of Shakespeare's first theatre. The site was excavated by a team from the Museum of London last summer, and is believed to have been built in 1576. Experts think that Shakespeare himself acted at the theatre, which may have been where the play Romeo and Juliet was premiered . It is believed that 25 years after construction, the building was pulled down and moved timber by timber to the South Bank of the Thames, where a reconstruction of the theatre now stands.

Sentence 1: He played 18 games, came to bat 29 times. Sentence 2: He played 18 games, came to beat 29 times. Step 2: Analyze if the components are the same or equivalent in meaning. In both sentences, the number of games played is mentioned as 18, so that part is the same in meaning. However, in Sentence 1, it's mentioned that he \\"came to bat 29 times\\", while in Sentence 2, it says \\"came to beat 29 times\\". Step 3: Consider the possible implications of the difference in meaning. This change from \\"bat\\" to \\"beat\\" might be a typo or miscommunication, as \\"came to beat\\" doesn't necessarily make sense in the context of games. It is likely that the intended meaning of Sentence 2 is \\"came to bat 29 times\\". Step 4: Compare the use of \\"just\\" and \\"only\\". In Sentence 1, \\"just\\" is used to emphasize the low number of games played, and in Sentence 2, \\"only\\" is used for the same purpose. These words can be considered similar in meaning, as they both emphasize the limited number of games played. Conclusion: Although the sentences have a slight difference in their wording, it's likely that they are meant to have the same meaning overall, especially if we consider that the word \\"beat\\" in Sentence 2 is a mistake and should be \\"bat.\\" So yes, they can be considered to have the same meaning if we correct the error in Sentence 2."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice question: Same meaning?

The paragraph discusses attacks in Bogota attributed to drug trafficking cartels. Moreover, it informs the reader about bombings that took place in the offices of various political parties and a bank office. While this information grants insight into the political violence and conflict occurring in Bogota at that time, it does not provide any details about the city's age or history. To understand Bogota's history and whether it could be considered \\"very old,\\" one must delve into the origins of the city. Bogota was founded on August 6, 1538, by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada. Its original name was \\"Bacatá\\" in the indigenous Muisca language, referring to the powerful zipa or king who ruled in this region. Bogota then became an important hub for trade and administration during the Spanish colonial period. While over 480 years of history can be considered \\"old,\\" it's important to note this age is specific to the city rather than the country. Furthermore, age perception is subjective; what is considered old in one context could be seen as relatively young in another, especially when compared to ancient civilizations with histories spanning thousands of years. Thus, while Bogota possesses a rich historical background, it may not be accurate to label it as a \\"very old country,\\" especially since it is not a country but rather the capital city of Colombia."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

The setting is the fictitious Protestant village of Eichwald, Germany, from July 1913 to 9 August 1914, where the local pastor, the doctor and the baron rule the roost over the area's women, children and peasant farmers. The puritanical pastor leads confirmation classes and gives his pubescent children a guilty conscience over apparently small transgressions. He has them wear white ribbons as a reminder of the innocence and purity from which they have strayed. When his son confesses to impure touching, the pastor has the boyâs hands tied to his bed frame each night. The doctor, a widower, treats the village children kindly but humiliates his housekeeper (the local midwife) and is found with his teenage daughter at night. The baron, who is the lord of the manor, underwrites harvest festivities for the villagers, many of them his farm workers. He summarily dismisses Eva for no apparent reason yet defends the integrity of a farmer whose son has destroyed the baron's field of cabbages. The schoolteacher's friendship with Eva leads to an invitation to her family home during a Christmas break, and they receive permission from her parents to marry after a one-year engagement. Unexplained events occur. A wire is stretched between two trees causing the doctor a terrible fall from his horse. The farmer's wife dies at the sawmill when rotten floorboards give way; her grieving husband later hangs himself. The baronâs young son goes missing on the day of the harvest festival and is found the following morning in the sawmill, bound and badly caned. A barn at the manor burns down. The baroness tells her husband that she is in love with another man. The steward's daughter has a violent dream about the midwife's handicapped son, then the boy is attacked and almost blinded.

Joe occasionally provides insight via voiceover narration throughout the film. He hires a local pickpocket with simple English knowledge, Kong, as his go-between in Bangkok, a condition of the contract being that the gang will never meet Joe. Contracts from the Bangkok gangsters are passed to Kong one by one via a nightclub dancer, Aom. Joe's first execution in Bangkok is done on motorcycle; when the target car stops at a red light, Joe kills all the passengers with a machine pistol. Kong retrieves information about the second target, again via Aom, and the pair become friendlier with every contact.

The Supreme Court also requested a report on the case, which echoed a notorious case from 2002 in which another teenager was gang-raped on a local council’s order. “A total of 29 people were involved in this ghastly crime, and we have 25 of them in our custody,” Multan City Police Officer Ahsan Younus told Reuters by telephone on Thursday. Earlier this month, a local council in the southern city of Multan was called after a family accused a 16-year-old boy of raping a 13-year-old neighbor. The council ruled that the sister of the boy should be handed over to the victim’s brother to be raped. The punishment was carried out on July 17 after her family handed the girl over. The case came to light when both families filed criminal charges with police accusing the other family’s son of rape. Questioning both sides in the cases, however, soon revealed the role of the informal village council, Younus said. “All the village council elders who ordered the revenge rape have been arrested,” he said.

Chaudhry Both the victims and their mothers have been sent to a women’s protection center, he added. Pakistan has a centuries-old tradition of quick justice handed down by gatherings of local elders, known as jirgas or panchayats, seen by many villagers as preferable to the often-cumbersome and corrupt formal legal system. In most of the country, jirgas are tolerated but not recognized by the formal courts and police. People are seen gathered under a tree where a village council ordered to rape a 16-year-old girl in Rajapur village near Multan, Pakistan July 27, 2017. REUTERS/K. Chaudhry The jirgas and the practice of “revenge rape” drew international attention in 2002 when a woman named Mukhtaran Mai was ordered gang-raped by a local council for a male relative’s alleged crime. Mai took the rare step of filing criminal charges against her attackers, and six men were convicted and sentenced to death later that year, though five of them were later freed on appeal. Mai went on to become a high-profile campaigner for women’s rights in Pakistan. “Another Tribe Court (panchayat) in south Punjab Multan and another girl was raped. We are still in 2002,” Mai said on her official Twitter account this week. Speaking to Reuters by telephone, Mai denounced the revenge rape. “If there were any justice in the panchayat, they should have shot the rapist. Why punish an innocent girl instead?” ||||| Two rapes within one family in Pakistan have drawn outrage and attention to the panchayat - or village council - system. (The Washington Post) The extended family members all lived within yards of one another, in a small village near a riverbank in Pakistan’s largest province, Punjab. It was in this village, near the city of Multan, where the first of two rapes occurred. A daughter of the family, around the age of 12 or 13, was cutting the grass in nearby fields on July 16 when a boy raped her, police said. The boy was a 16-year-old relative of hers. In the days that followed, the family’s elders gathered in shock and anguish, seeking to resolve the matter. But mourning soon gave way to vengeance. The elders — who effectively served as the “panchayat,” or village council — decided that justice should be served as revenge. They instructed the victim’s brother, also about 16, to rape the teenage sister of the alleged attacker in retaliation for his crime, Ahsan Younis, head of the Multan city police, told The Washington Post. So the 16-year-old brother assaulted the teenage girl in his family’s home, effectively carrying out what Younis called a “revenge rape.” Two rapes, within two days, all in one extended family. It turns out that the first alleged assailant’s father is a brother of the second alleged assailant’s grandfather. “They are victims and accused at the same time,” Younis said Thursday morning. “It’s barbaric.” Indeed, the case is shocking. But it is not entirely unheard of — such “honor” crimes still take place in some parts of Pakistan and India. But what made this case different was that somebody spoke up, and authorities took action. The rapes were reported to the Violence Against Women Center in Multan, and authorities investigated. But as they investigated the case, police learned that several other family members also were involved, Younis said.

Of those, 25 have been taken into custody, including the first of the suspected assailants. Family members admitted to police that the second rape was ordered as retaliation for the first one. But they asserted that the decision was a consensual one between the two sides. A representative from the Violence Against Women Center told the Pakistani newspaper Dawn that the mother of the first accused had offered either of her two married daughters to settle the score, on the condition that the first victim’s family not take legal action against her son. But the panchayat demanded that she instead hand over her unmarried teenage daughter to be raped as punishment. This was a distinct type of a panchayat, made up entirely of elders from the same extended family. Most such village councils have leaders from different, unrelated families in the area. The two males accused of rape could face a maximum punishment of the death penalty, Younis said, but “that is up to the court.” The “revenge rape” has spurred outrage in Pakistan and prompted its chief justice early Thursday to order the inspector general of Punjab police to submit a report on the case, according to Dawn. It has highlighted the continued prevalence of the panchayat system, an informal village governance system in which leaders have been known to settle disputes over women with forced marriages, stonings and other punishments. A Pakistani villager points to a house where a teenage girl was raped near the city of Multan. (SS Mirza/AFP via Getty Images) Human rights lawyer and activist Asma Jahangir on Wednesday urged the government to crack down on all panchayats, which she said have no legal standing. “Panchayats have no standing and the courts have stated the same,” Jahangir said, according to Geo News. “If they act outside of law, then the panchayat and its members should be prosecuted according to law.” The story also underscored the problem of violence against women and girls in Pakistan, which has ranked as the world’s third most dangerous place for women, according to a 2011 Thomson Reuters Foundation expert survey. More than 1,000 women and girls in the country are victims of “honor killings” every year, according to Pakistan’s Human Rights Commission. But progress has been made. Last year, Punjab lawmakers gave unprecedented protection to female victims of violence, passing a law that criminalizes all forms of violence against women, whether domestic, psychological or sexual. It also mandated the establishment of women’s shelters and a toll-free abuse reporting hotline, Reuters reported. The case also had several parallels with the most high-profile case of its kind, which occurred in the same district: the gang rape of a woman named Mukhtar Mai. “Such incidents remind me of what happened with me in 2002,” she told Geo News on Wednesday, saying she was heartbroken by the case and encouraging the rape survivors to speak out. In 2002, Mai was allegedly dragged into a house, raped and pushed back out naked. About 200 tribal leaders watched in approval nearby, as The Post’s Pamela Constable reported. The woman’s father was too afraid to save her. The gang rape had been ordered as punishment after her brother was accused of having an affair with an older woman. Mai did what many in Pakistan do not have the courage to do, because of the stigma surrounding sexual assault: She reported the attack and challenged her assailants in court. After a lengthy and humiliating investigation and trial, judges acquitted most of the 14 men accused in her gang rape. Mai became an international symbol of women’s rights, won awards and founded a school. Her story even inspired an opera, “Thumbprint,” which opened in New York in 2014. But despite all this, she continued to stay in her poor, native village in Punjab. “I have so many students and poor women turning to me,” she told The Post in 2011. “I cannot leave them.” ||||| A search operation is underway to arrest the members of a panchayat (village council) who fled after ordering a man to rape a 16-year-old girl, police said on Wednesday. According to SHO Malik Rashid, the search operation began after two cases were registered against the members of the council at a police station inside the Violence Against Women centre in Multan. The council, comprising at least 40 men, was convened in Muzaffarabad's Rajpur area after a 12-year-old girl, F*, was raped by a man while cutting grass in a field on July 16, reads the First Information Report (FIR) filed at the police station. On July 18, the panchayat ordered F's brother to rape 17-year-old N*, the sister of the accused. According to the police, N was dragged to the area where the panchayat was convened and was raped before the men and her parents. After the incident, the parents of N filed an FIR on July 20, while a second FIR was filed on July 24 by F's family, who had initially wished to keep the matter quiet. After the cases were registered, the police started investigations and arrested 20 of the council's members, including the head of the panchayat who gave the order.

It was the last tour he did with his brothers. Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated 3 to 5 million, to charity. His charitable work continued with the release of \\"We Are the World\\" (1985), co-written with Lionel Richie, which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa. It earned 63 million, and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold.

They are also the writers of \\"\\". Hypothesis: Aibel and Berger were born 21 days apart","output":"Based on the information provided in the context, we can draw the hypothesis that Aibel and Berger were born 21 days apart. Here's a detailed analysis of the given context: - Jonathan Robert Aibel was born on August 6, 1969, in Demarest, New Jersey. - Glenn Todd Berger was born on August 26, 1969, in Smithtown, New York. To verify the hypothesis, we can calculate the number of days between their birthdates: 1. Start with Jonathan Robert Aibel's birthdate: August 6, 1969. 2. Calculate the number of days left in August (excluding August 6): There are 31 days in August, so there are (31 - 6 = 25) 25 days left after the 6th. 3. Add Glenn Todd Berger's birthdate (August 26, 1969) to the 25 days from the calculation above: 25 + 1 (Berger was born on the 26th day of August) = 26. Thus, based on this calculation, Aibel and Berger were born 26 - 5 = 21 days apart. It should be mentioned that this calculation does not account for leap years, which do not affect this case, as 1969 is not a leap year. Therefore, the hypothesis stating that Aibel and Berger were born 21 days apart can be considered accurate based on the information provided in the context. Their shared profession as American screenwriters and involvement in the Kung Fu Panda franchise and its sequels demonstrates that these two individuals, despite being born 21 days apart, have worked closely together in the film industry and have found success in their collaborative projects."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: By what does Gorillas get killed? Lava from the Volcano A:","output":"Title: Lava's Grasp Genre: Action-Adventure/Sci-Fi/Drama Plot Summary: \\"Lava's Grasp\\" follows the thrilling and emotional journey of a group of primatologists and their team of highly intelligent gorillas who must work together to survive and save their home when a seemingly dormant volcano begins to erupt. As the lava engulfs the dense landscape, tensions rise and the stakes are higher than ever, blurring the lines between nature and intellect. The team must learn to adapt and evolve in order to face the ultimate challenge - the wrath of nature. Act 1: The Calm Before the Storm The movie starts with Dr. Amelia James, a dedicated primatologist, and her team of researchers studying a group of gorillas residing in the valley near the base of Mount Gira, a long-dormant volcano. The team has spent years living amongst the gorillas, building trust, and conducting groundbreaking research into their advanced communication and social structure. Their star gorilla, Koba, is especially intelligent and has formed a close bond with Dr. James, occasionally assisting in their research. Act 2: Deadly Awakening As Dr. James and her team continue their research, a series of unusual tremors and earthquakes shake the area. As tensions rise, they consult with experts who reveal that Mount Gira is showing signs of awakening. The team urgently decides to evacuate, but before they can leave, the volcano erupts, spewing lava and ash, blocking off any escape routes and separating the humans and gorillas. Act 3: Journey to Survival Stranded and facing imminent danger, Dr. James devises a plan to reunite with the gorillas and lead them to safety. But time is running out as the lava flow threatens to engulf the entire valley. The team must rely on their extensive knowledge of the terrain and Koba's keen survival skills to navigate the treacherous environment and avoid the deadly grasp of the lava. As they embark on their perilous journey, the team and the gorillas form an even stronger bond, showcasing the importance of trust and inter-species cooperation, as they face life-threatening obstacles and unforeseen challenges. Along the way, several gorillas, tragically succumb to the destructive force of the lava, making their mission even more urgent. Act 4: The Final Stand As lava continues to relentlessly flow towards the valley, the team and the gorillas find themselves cornered, with only a narrow and dangerous path to safety. In a desperate attempt to save the remaining gorillas, Dr. James and her team must lead them across the hazardous terrain and confront the impending wall of volcanic fury. In an emotional and heart-wrenching scene, Koba sacrifices himself to save a young gorilla from plunging into the deadly lava, showcasing the depth of his empathy and intelligence. United by their shared loss, the humans and gorillas press onward and finally reach a safe zone, just as the volcano reaches its peak eruption, obliterating their former home. Act 5: A New Beginning Dealing with the aftermath of the disaster, Dr. James and her team, along with the surviving gorillas, must work together to rebuild their lives and further develop the understanding of human and animal kinship. The sacrifices made and the bonds forged during their incredible journey serve as a testament to the power of unity in the face of adversity. The movie ends on a hopeful note, with the surviving gorilla group flourishing in their new environment, signifying that life can persist and rebuild despite the wrath of nature. \\"Lava's Grasp\\" is a visually stunning and emotionally charged film that explores the themes of resilience, unity, and the innate power of both human and animal. Its engaging and thought-provoking storyline will captivate and inspire audiences with its testament to the strength and adaptability of the living world."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: England's schools commissioner Sir David Carter told the Commons Education Committee 119 academies had been \\"re-brokered\\" as a last resort. Some academies were performing no better than the failing schools from which they had taken over, he told MPs. But he stressed the academies his team were most concerned about were being challenged and supported to improve. Sir David said of the 973 functioning multi-academy trusts in England, only seven had been inspected by Ofsted as part of a process known as \\"batched inspections\\". This is where a number of schools in an academy trust are inspected as a group because of concerns raised about performance. Following these seven batched inspections, Ofsted reported concerns about the outcomes for pupils and accused some of the trusts of sitting on large sums of cash that should have been spent on pupils. Sir David said: \\"There are academies that are performing not better or minimally better than the schools they were before. \\"The commitment these sponsors made was to improve these schools rapidly.\\" Of the academies that had been re-brokered since September 2014, 68 had gone from a multi-academy trust to another multi-academy trust and 51 and gone from a single academy trust to a multi-academy trust, he said. The \\"re-brokerage solution\\" was an important tool for regional schools commissioners challenging under-performance, he said, but it was also disruptive and expensive and affected the children at the school. On the whole, regional commissioners, who are charged with overseeing standards in the academy system, tried to get involved with struggling academies before they got so bad that there was no other option but to find another sponsor and new management, Sir David said. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw, also giving evidence, said some multi-academy trusts had \\"been allowed to grow to far too quickly, without the capacity to improve their individual schools\\". He said: \\"There was a lot of empire building going on and executive head teachers who wanted to show how many schools they had rather than whether they were any good or not.\\" Sir David agreed that expansion had sometimes been too quick in the past, but suggested the situation had improved in recent years. Summary:","output":"England's schools commissioner, Sir David Carter, has told the Commons Education Committee that 119 academies have gone through the \\"re-brokerage solution\\" process as a last resort, admitting that some academies were performing no better than the failing schools they had originally taken over.

Food price: It has been mentioned that you may not mind paying a little bit more for certain factors like better service, but it is not clear precisely where the threshold of acceptable pricing lies. While increased food costs may be worth it for improved service or a great atmosphere, the willingness to tolerate higher prices can vary from person to person. 2. Service: Undeniably, great service is an essential factor for many people in deciding where to dine. Prompt, friendly, and attentive service can significantly enhance the overall dining experience. While some may be willing to pay extra for exceptional service, others may expect a certain level of service to be a given, with no additional cost involved. 3. Atmosphere: The atmosphere of a restaurant can indeed influence the dining experience and dictate if customers feel comfortable and relaxed. A well-designed and inviting atmosphere can encourage diners to pay slightly higher prices for the overall experience. However, each individual can differ in their preferences and expectations regarding ambiance, so not everyone might agree with the idea of paying extra for it. 4. Speed of eating: Although it is acceptable to assume that most people would prefer not to wait too long for their meal, it is not entirely clear if this equates to refusing to pay extra. Some customers might consider paying more for quicker service if they are in a hurry, while others may still expect a reasonable wait time without incurring additional charges. The statement \\"I refuse to pay anything extra for eating quickly because I should just be able to anyway\\" can be a personal opinion, but it is not a universally applicable conclusion. Several factors contribute to the dining experience, and individual preferences play a significant role in deciding whether one is willing to pay extra for a quicker meal or expects this to be a baseline service quality."},{"instruction":"who sang the original version of mr bojangles??","output":"The original version of the song \\"Mr. Bojangles\\" was sung by a man named Jerry Jeff Walker.

With the baby sleeping in their tent, the family is enjoying a barbecue with their fellow campers when a cry is heard. Lindy returns to the tent to check on Azaria and is certain she sees a dingo with something in its mouth running off as she approaches. When she discovers the infant is missing, everyone joins forces to search for her, without success. It is assumed what Lindy saw was the animal carrying off the child, and a subsequent inquest rules her account of events is true.The tide of public opinion soon turns against the Chamberlains. For many, Lindy seems too stoic, too cold-hearted, and too accepting of the disaster that has befallen her. Gossip about her begins to swell and soon is accepted as statements of fact. The couple's beliefs are not widely practised in the country, and when the media reports a rumour that the name Azaria means \\"sacrifice in the wilderness\\" (when in fact it means \\"blessed of God\\"), the public is quick to believe they decapitated their baby with a pair of scissors as part of a bizarre religious rite.

W: Have you ever put a computer together before? What would the listener say? Answer:","output":"Based on the given conversation, it is hard to determine what the listener would say, as different individuals have different experiences. However, let me propose some possible responses the listener might consider depending on their background. Response A: An experienced person in computer assembly. Yes, I have actually put together quite a few computers before. I have been building custom computer systems for people for several years now, and I enjoy the process of selecting the components, assembling them, and ensuring the entire system works smoothly. I've been able to help others create computers optimized for various purposes, such as gaming, graphic design, and data analysis. If you are looking to build a computer or need assistance, I would be more than happy to help you out. Response B: An amateur who has built a computer before. Yes, I actually have put a computer together before. It was a fascinating process, and I learned a lot from the experience. I spent a lot of time researching the components I would need for my specific requirements and had to watch several tutorials online to understand the proper steps involved in assembling the parts. I managed to put together a decent system, and it was a great feeling when it worked correctly. It has certainly sparked my interest in learning more about computer hardware and building more systems in the future. Response C: A person who has never built a computer before. No, I have never put a computer together before. It is something that I feel quite interested in but haven't had the chance to try just yet. I know there are many resources online that can help guide someone through the process, like online tutorials and forums. I'm open to learning more about it and potentially trying it out in the future, as I understand it can be cost-effective and allows customization of specifications based on individual needs. In conclusion, the listener's response could vary significantly depending on their experience and familiarity with computer assembly. Whether they are experienced, have built one before, or have no experience, the listener might express different levels of confidence and knowledge regarding the topic. Their response could highlight any pre-existing skills, interest in the subject, or eagerness to learn more about building a computer."},{"instruction":"San Diego The members of the city council are each elected from single member districts within the city.

His father, Billy Baskin, is a struggling artist and temporary sole caregiver of the children while his wife attends to the needs of her recently deceased father in Australia. Upon hearing the news that an abandoned mansion has recently burned down, Michael and his friend Connie decide to explore the remains. Outside the mansion, Connie dares Michael to take a look inside, leading to a frightening encounter with the ghosts of its homeless inhabitants who had died in the fire. Michael does not know this yet, but his fearsome run in with the ghosts has given him a mysterious illness simply known as \\"The Fright\\". Michael wakes up the next morning to find out that \\"The Fright\\" has made him lose all of his hair. After a failed attempt with a wig (his wig was pulled off by an older boy during a fight in a soccer game), the ghosts visit Michael in his sleep and give him the recipe of a magical formula for hair growth, the main ingredient of which is peanut butter.

(2) Disputes with leaders of Marble Hill persuaded the railroad to relocate their route through Lutesville instead . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, these two sentences essentially mean the same thing. Both sentences convey that there were disputes with the leaders of Marble Hill, which led to the railroad deciding to change their route to pass through Lutesville instead of Marble Hill. The first sentence uses the word \\"move,\\" while the second sentence uses the word \\"relocate\\" to express the same idea. In the first sentence, \\"Disputes with leaders of Marble Hill persuaded the railroad to move their route through Lutesville instead,\\" the verb \\"move\\" is used to denote the action of changing the position or location of the railroad route. This suggests that, due to the disagreements or conflicts with the leaders of Marble Hill, the railroad company made the decision to shift their route so that it would go through Lutesville as an alternative. Similarly, in the second sentence, \\"Disputes with leaders of Marble Hill persuaded the railroad to relocate their route through Lutesville instead,\\" the verb \\"relocate\\" is used. In this context, \\"relocate\\" also refers to the action of changing the position or location of something, specifically the railroad route. This implies that the conflicts with the leaders of Marble Hill ultimately convinced the railroad company to change the route and have it pass through Lutesville instead. While there might be a subtle difference in the emphasis of the two verbs, with \\"move\\" being more about the action of changing position and \\"relocate\\" being more about the process of moving one location to another, in this context, both sentences convey the same basic meaning and can be understood interchangeably.

Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (lead guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music. At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005 with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be \\"featured with\\" Queen as \\"Queen + Paul Rodgers\\", not replacing Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating. In November 2004, Queen were among the inaugural inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and the award ceremony was the first event at which Rodgers joined May and Taylor as vocalist. Between 2005 and 2006, Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, which was the first time Queen toured since their last tour with Freddie Mercury in 1986. The band's drummer Roger Taylor commented; \\"We never thought we would tour again, Paul [Rodgers] came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry. Paul is just such a great singer. He's not trying to be Freddie.\\" The first leg was in Europe, the second in Japan, and the third in the US in 2006.

Leopold hoped to be received by the court of Louis XV at nearby Versailles. However, a recent death in the royal family prevented any immediate invitation, so Leopold arranged other engagements. One person who took particular note of the children was the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior von Grimm, whose journal records Wolfgang's feats in glowing terms: \\"the most consummate Kapellmeister could not be more profound in the science of harmony and modulation\\". Leopold's own assessment, written a few months later, was similarly effusive: \\"My little girl, although only 12 years old, is one of the most skilful players in Europe and, in a word, my boy knows more in his eighth year than one would expect for a man of forty\\".On 24 December the family moved to Versailles for two weeks during which, through a court connection, they were able to attend a royal dinner, where Wolfgang was reportedly allowed to kiss the hand of the Queen. At Versailles they also visited the famous courtesan Madame de Pompadour, then in the last months of her life—\\"an extremely haughty woman who still ruled over everything\\", according to Leopold. In Nannerl's later recollections, Wolfgang was made to stand on a chair to be examined by the Madame, who would not allow him to kiss her.There is no record of the children giving a formal concert at Versailles.

The song quickly achieved commercial success, reaching the number one spot on the UK Singles Chart and peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. It became Edison Lighthouse's signature song, as well as their biggest hit. The catchy tune and memorable chorus have made this song a classic of its time. Although Tony Burrows played a pivotal role in the success of \\"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes),\\" he would not remain part of Edison Lighthouse for long.

Answer:","output":"John offers two hundred dollars."},{"instruction":"*some spoilers* I was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms (acting, dated dialogue, unclear storyline) unfounded. Belafonte is great as a Brandoesque, menacing, swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill-equipped from his past life to do so. He learns too late how empty his hustling, materialistic life was without love. Mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife Fanny. In spite of his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) in one. The two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other, the result being hilarious and touchingly sad. The perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film. After looking everywhere for Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a falling feather, and he frantically reaches for it as if he's finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte wasn't allowed to finish his miracle (either to restore Fanny's health or Mostel's faith), so he never got his wings. The feather floats tauntingly out of Mostel's grasp, a metaphor for both men's live: it's too late and you don't get a second chance.

The movie is a captivating blend of science fiction and heist drama that allows viewers to explore the realms of the subconscious mind in a visually extraordinary setting. The cast, led by stalwart actor Leonardo DiCaprio, is a remarkable ensemble. DiCaprio admirably carries his role as Dom Cobb, a professional thief who steals secrets from the subconscious minds of people while they are in their dream state. The supporting cast, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and others, skillfully add profound depth to their characters. Nolan makes extensive use of Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI), for which \\"Inception\\" was highly acclaimed. The pulling apart of cityscapes folds onto itself in awe-inspiring visuals and the \\"Zero Gravity Hallway Fight\\" is another notable example of this. Behind the visual spectacle, however, is a solid storyline revolving around Cobb, who is on the run and is given a chance for redemption by performing 'Inception' - planting an idea in someone's mind. Delving into Cobb's murky subconscious and past, we see the sublime performance of Marion Cotillard as Mal, Cobb’s wife, whose story is woven throughout the movie. Her mystic and melancholic portrayal adds intensity to the emotional core of the film. Apart from flawless visuals, there is the auditory brilliance. The background score by Hans Zimmer is a seamless fit to the movie. An amalgamation of electronic music and orchestral symphonies that complement the suspenseful and thrilling moments throughout the film. The famous \\"BRAAAM\\" sound - a recurring motif, has become synonymous with suspense and thrill in the film world after Inception. One can't ignore the level of detail incorporated in the construction of the dream world. The rules and different layers create an intelligent and intricate plot that can seem over-complicated at times. However, the complexity is also the movie's virtue, as it demands viewers' engagement like a puzzle. Despite its brilliance, \\"Inception\\" is not without its detractors. Some argue that heavily layered narratives demand too many viewings to fully grasp, and others feel that the emotional side of the story is overshadowed by the intellectual challenge the movie presents. To conclude, \\"Inception\\" is a timeless memory heist that fuses tech-noir with a heist caper to explore the extreme possibilities of the human mind. Nolan's genius ensures that this ambitious, innovative film is an astounding visual and narrational treat that leaves viewers contemplating long after the screen goes dark.

He wrote the #2 Billboard hit, \\"The Rapper\\", with the Jaggerz in 1970 and was a member of Wild Cherry after the group had a #1 hit with \\"Play That Funky Music.\\" He also achieved fame as a solo artist in the early 1980s with the #29 hit \\"Ah! Leah!\\" Iris' first album, Back on the Streets, was released in July 1980 on the small Cleveland, Ohio-based Midwest Records. With the track \\"Ah! Leah!\\" receiving airplay in Boston, Cleveland and Pittsburgh, MCA Records took notice and quickly signed Iris to a five-album deal and re-released the album nationally in October. The first single \\"Ah! Leah!\\" peaked at #29 on the Billboard Hot 100 (and #34 in Australia) in February 1981 and became one of the most frequently played AOR tracks of the year, and the album reached #57 on the Billboard 200. In addition, the band launched a national tour to promote the album and its follow-up during the summer of 1981. The follow-up album, King Cool, credited to Donnie Iris and the Cruisers, was released in August 1981 and garnered the band more AOR success, with \\"Love Is Like a Rock\\" reaching #9 on Billboard's Top Tracks chart. Two other songs from the album received significant AOR airplay; \\"My Girl\\" at #25 and \\"Sweet Merilee\\" at #31, charted on the Rock Tracks chart. In addition, he gained the nickname King Cool from this album in the later part of his career. However, the album itself charted less successfully, at #84. After the long tour promoting their two previous albums, the band continued songwriting and in the fall of 1982 released The High and the Mighty. The album contained the single \\"Tough World,\\" but only charted at #180, marking a decline in his success, but the band still was determined to release new material. Their next album one year later, Fortune 410, contained the hit single \\"Do You Compute?\\" which was used by their label MCA and the computer company Atari to form a cross-marketing promotion. Because the promotional partnership was secured prior to release of the album, it was possible to use the Atari 1200 XL Home Computer in poster photography, as well as in the video clip for \\"Do You Compute?\\", which aired on MTV. The title of the album is a reference to the trademark glasses Iris wears, Fortune 410's. The combination of marketing and the promotion for its hit single allowed the album to chart higher than its predecessor. Despite Fortune 410 charting higher than The High and the Mighty, MCA was displeased that both albums didn't chart as high as Back on the Streets and King Cool had. The label suggested that the band allow them to bring in a new producer, displacing Mark Avsec, as well bring in new songwriters. Iris and the Cruisers, wanting to keep as much of their creative freedom and sound as they could, said no. As a result, MCA dropped the band in 1984. Shortly after being let go from MCA, the band signed with the small HME Records label. Their next album, No Muss...No Fuss, released in 1985, continued the trend set by Fortune 410 by charting at #115 with the single \\"Injured in the Game of Love\\".

Possible A: tree, garden, meadow, rock, rug Why is \\"rock\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Rock\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for a few reasons: 1. Physical properties: A rock is a solid, inorganic object with a naturally hard and sturdy structure. These properties make it an appropriate tool for smashing a large, frightening bug while outdoors. When applying enough force, a rock can easily crush and kill a bug, ensuring that it no longer poses a threat to you or others. 2. Availability: Rocks are commonly found in outdoor settings, such as gardens, parks, and hiking trails. When faced with an immediate need to eliminate a large and frightening bug, it is more likely that an individual would be able to quickly find and utilize a rock in an outdoor environment. This makes it a convenient and accessible option for addressing the issue at hand. 3. Safety and non-contamination: Using a rock to smash a bug outdoors offers a level of separation between the individual and the bug, reducing the chances of direct contact. This serves as a barrier, minimizing the risk of being bitten, stung, or contaminated by the bug. Moreover, once the rock is used to kill the bug, it can be easily cleaned or left in the outdoor environment without causing harm to its surroundings. 4. Environmental factors: Rocks naturally blend into outdoor environments and picking one up to use against a bug does not require any form of modification or preparation. This is an eco-friendly and sustainable way to deal with bugs when compared to using chemical insecticides or other potentially harmful methods. Comparing the other possible answers: - Tree: Although trees are also commonly found outdoors, they are large, stationary objects that cannot be easily utilized to smash a bug. - Garden: A garden is a plot of land used for growing plants and flowers, rather than an object that can be picked up and used to smash a bug. - Meadow: Similar to a garden, a meadow is a large, open field typically filled with grass and wildflowers. It is not an object or a tool that can be utilized to eliminate a bug. - Rug: While a rug could, in theory, be used to smash a bug, it is not typically found outdoors and is less effective than a rock due to its softness and flexibility. In conclusion, \\"rock\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense when considering the need to smash a large, frightening bug while outdoors. Its natural properties, availability, safety aspect, and minimal environmental impact make it the most appropriate choice when compared to other potential options."},{"instruction":"Any movie that portrays the hard-working responsible husband as the person who has to change because of bored, cheating wife is an obvious result of 8 years of the Clinton era.

It is meant to intercept North Korea’s medium-range missiles. “Were it not for the provocative behavior of North Korea, we would have no need for Thaad out here,” Mr. Mattis added. “There is no other nation that needs to be concerned about Thaad.” South Korea was a logical first stop for Mr. Mattis, who will also visit Japan on the trip. Tensions have risen in the region after Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, proclaimed during his New Year’s Day address that his military was preparing to conduct its first test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. ||||| (CNN) New US Defense Secretary James Mattis on Thursday defended the planned deployment of a missile defense system in South Korea, saying only North Korea had anything to fear from it. After arriving at the Osan Air Base outside Seoul, Mattis said Pyongyang's \\"provocative behavior\\" was the only reason the US-developed system was on the agenda. South Korea's decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, known as THAAD, has drawn sharp criticism from China, which sees it as part of a broader US strategy to extend its military alliance network from Japan all the way down to the South China Sea. \\"There is no other nation that needs to be concerned about THAAD other than North Korea if they're engaged in something that's offensive,\\" Mattis said. On Thursday afternoon, Mattis met with acting South Korean President Hwang Kyo-ahn in Seoul and reiterated the strength of the US-South Korean alliance. \\"I talked to President Trump and he wanted to make a very clear statement about the priority that we place on this alliance between our two nations,\\" the US defense chief said. \\"Our new administration inherits a very strong, trusted relationship between our two countries, and it's our commitment to make it even stronger.\\" Mattis' arrival in South Korea comes at a time of relative quiet from Kim Jong Un's regime , which hasn't tested a ballistic missile since October 20 after firing off projectiles at a record rate earlier in 2016. The question North Korea watchers are asking: How long will Kim keep his missile program grounded? Some analysts expect testing to resume soon. \\"They have a wonderful tradition of greeting every new US president with a bit of fireworks, sometimes a nuclear test, sometimes ICBM launch, and they're not going to break this tradition,\\" Korean studies professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul told CNN. But Bruce Bennett of the Rand Corp. think tank said Kim's testing hiatus is focused not on Washington, but on Seoul and the recent impeachment of President Park Geun-hye in a corruption scandal. Her fate is now before South Korea's Constitutional Court. A decision against her could trigger elections earlier than the mandated December 20 deadline. \\"I believe that North Korea's No. 1 objective between now and the ROK presidential election is to ensure that the new South Korean president will be a progressive and certainly not a conservative,\\" Bennett said, using the acronym for the Republic of Korea. \\"But any provocations that it commits would give support to conservative candidates,\\" the senior defense analyst said. JUST WATCHED Report: North Korea may test missile soon Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Report: North Korea may test missile soon 02:21 John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, concurs with Bennett to a point, saying Kim is keeping relatively quiet because of the presidential uncertainty in Seoul but also to see what course US President Donald Trump will take. After Kim said in a televised New Year's Day speech that his military is on the brink of testing its first intercontinental ballistic missile -- a rocket that can be equipped with nuclear weapons and is powerful enough to reach any part of the United States -- Trump vowed in a tweet, \\"It won't happen!\\" North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 But the incoming US leader didn't say how he'd block Kim's missile ambitions. On the campaign trail last year, he said he might be willing to meet the North Korean leader for discussions over a hamburger. Mattis said Thursday he's in South Korea to listen to its leaders before deciding on what strategy the Trump administration will adopt concerning Pyongyang. \\"I need to get some data from them, I need to get their appreciation of the situation before I start making statements about where I stand,\\" Mattis said.

MUST WATCH What could Trump do about North Korea? 02:29 \\"It's hard to anticipate what they do,\\" he said of the North, but he was cautious not to inflame the situation. \\"We maintained what passes for peace so far to a degree.\\" ||||| Over the past months–and particularly in the days since North Korea’s latest nuclear and satellite tests–there has been a lot of ink spilled on South Korea’s interest in deploying what is known the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. A lot of mainstream coverage of the issue, which has China and South Korea at loggerheads, correctly notes that China is worried about the system, but doesn’t quite get at what exactly THAAD is, what it does, and why its deployment on the Korean peninsula is so threatening to China. China’s anxiety over THAAD has gotten to the point where its ambassador to South Korea would suggest that its implementation would destroy their bilateral relationship in “an instant.” THAAD is a relative recent addition to the United States’ anti-ballistic missile/interceptor toolkit. It entered production in 2008 and is primarily tasked with taking out threatening ballistic missiles in what’s known as their “terminal” phase (the ‘T’ in the acronym). This is actually the first part where a clarification is due. As Jeffrey Lewis recently highlighted in a Foreign Policy column, THAAD, and systems like it, including the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) interceptor, are designed to hit things as they zoom downward toward the earth–not as they go up. This may seem like a trivial point, but Japan made a show of deploying its PAC-3 interceptors in Tokyo ahead of North Korea’s latest satellite launch. Of course, the Kwangmyongsong satellite had a one-way ticket out of the atmosphere and wouldn’t be coming back, making PAC-3, or hypothetically THAAD, useless. (North Korea does have a bunch of short- and medium-range SCUDs that THAAD would be great against, though.) THAAD is particularly well-suited to intercept and destroy short, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase. Rod Lyon, in a recent post at the National Interest, helpfully catalogues some of THAAD’s tried-and-tested abilities, which attest to that fact. THAAD’s overall operation is similar to many other missile interceptor and surface-to-air missile systems: an X-Band active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar (AN/TPY-2) kicks off THAAD’s interception, detecting the target projectile. THAAD’s fire control and support equipment identifies, verifies, and initiates the launcher. The launcher–a road-mobile erector launcher, to be precise–finally releases the infrared seeker head-equipped THAAD missile which, according to the system’s manufacturer, then uses “kinetic energy to destroy [the] incoming missile.” In plain English, missile meets missile in mid-air; both missiles go “Boom.” There’s a lot more to THAAD’s feature set. The “high altitude” part of the acronym isn’t there for show: THAAD is able to intercept incoming missiles at endo- and exo-atmospheric altitudes, with a maximum engagement altitude of roughly 93 miles above the earth’s surface. The missile itself can travel at speeds over Mach 8, placing it in the “hypersonic” category. Indeed, THAAD manufacturer Lockheed Martin is interested in developing an extended range THAAD variant to counter hypersonic glide vehicles, including China’s own WU-14. Keeping this feature set in mind, why is China so upset about a potential THAAD deployment? The answer, I think, has to do more with the monitoring capabilities that are part of the THAAD package. Beijing isn’t, for instance, worried that a THAAD deployment in South Korea would threaten any ballistic missiles it would plausibly fire at the United States–again, THAAD only works against ballistic missiles in the terminal phase and not against inter-continental ones anyway. Lyon evaluates China’s concerns: China’s right to believe that THAAD surveillance data could be transferred to other BMD assets protecting [the continental United States (CONUS)]. Indeed, one of THAAD’s missions would be to strengthen U.S. defenses against the possibility of North Korean ballistic missile attack on CONUS. So it has to be able to transfer data to CONUS-based radars and interceptors. But the United States already has a THAAD battery deployed on Guam, two AN/TPY-2 radars deployed in Japan (at Shariki and Kyogamisaki), space-based assets, plus a range of ship-borne radars and larger land-based radars in other parts of the Pacific theatre. Would a THAAD deployment in South Korea change much? The short answer is that it could improve early tracking of some Chinese missiles, depending on their launch point. Still, that might not make actual interception of those missiles much easier. ICBM warheads move fast. And sophisticated penetration-aids help to confuse missile defenses. So, from the Chinese perspective, a THAAD deployment could shift the strategic stability needle ever so slightly away from its status quo equilibrium and advantage the United States, giving Washington better early warning and tracking of Chinese ICBMs. That, in itself, doesn’t seem like a serious impingement on China’s security or its nuclear deterrent. What’s interesting is reading China’s worries about a THAAD and AN/TPY-2 deployment on the Korean peninsula together with murmurs that Beijing is growing increasingly interested in a launch-on-warning nuclear posture. Does a THAAD deployment affect the credibility of China’s second-strike capabilities by giving the United States a greater early warning edge? Perhaps, but, as Lyon notes above, the difference would be marginal given the AN/TPY-2s already in Japan. Assessing China’s position on THAAD in light of the system’s real capabilities, we should concede that Beijing does have some legitimate reasons to be upset, but I question if the negative implications for China’s security really outweigh the diplomatic cost to the bilateral relationship with South Korea, which had seen a sharp uptick over the past year. Moreover, it’s clear that South Korea’s security would benefit in important ways from a THAAD deployment–Pyongyang’s Toksa, SCUDs, and No Dong missiles would be a lot less threatening. China and South Korea should be able to come to an understanding, but this won’t be possible as long as Beijing holds to its maximalist position on THAAD, refusing to abide a deployment of the interceptor on the peninsula. Are there alternatives? If you ask South Korea and the United States, then the answer is yes: China could change its approach to North Korea, making this THAAD business less necessary in the short-term. I wouldn’t count on that happening anytime soon, despite news of the United States and China making some progress on harsher sanctions. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has defended the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) anti-missile system in South Korea.

Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece is a truly exceptional film that showcases the director's unique vision and storytelling prowess. The story takes place in the early 1960s, during the height of the Cold War. Sally Hawkins plays Elisa Esposito, a mute janitor working at a top-secret government laboratory. There, she meets and forms an improbable bond with an amphibious creature (Doug Jones), brought from the Amazon by the ruthless Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). Elisa's blossoming love for the creature sets her on a potentially dangerous path, with the assistance of her caring friends: a fellow janitor, Zelda (Octavia Spencer), and her lonely neighbor, Giles (Richard Jenkins). Sally Hawkins delivers a powerful performance as Elisa, despite being unable to speak a word. Her expressive eyes and body language convey deep emotions, while her sign language is evocative and fluid. Doug Jones' portrayal of the creature is a ballet of physical dexterity, managing to infuse the part-human, part-amphibian being with a genuine sense of grace and empathy. The supporting cast is equally outstanding, with Octavia Spencer providing heart and humor as Elisa's loyal friend, while Richard Jenkins creates a sympathetic portrait of a man navigating the challenges of personal and professional life. Michael Shannon, as the antagonist, is both terrifying and alluring, making it impossible to look away whenever he is on screen. Visually, \\"The Shape of Water\\" is a work of art. Every frame is masterfully crafted, with del Toro's distinct ambience heavily imbued throughout the film. The colors and textures are rich, and the set design is meticulously detailed. The underwater sequences are particularly mesmerizing. The soundtrack, composed by Alexandre Desplat, adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The melodic score effortlessly transitions from haunting to hopeful, perfectly echoing the dualities present in the movie. Thematically, \\"The Shape of Water\\" explores the complexities of love, loneliness, and what it means to be human. Elisa's romance with the creature transcends the boundaries of language and species, forcing the audience to confront their preconceived notions about love. The film also touches upon social issues, with its portrayal of prejudice and the acceptance of the \\"other.\\" In conclusion, \\"The Shape of Water\\" is a testament to Guillermo del Toro's genius as a filmmaker. This highly original, moving, and visually astonishing film is a cinematic experience unlike any other. It captivates the heart and the mind, leaving the audience with a renewed appreciation for the complexities of human emotion, the mysteries of love, and the resilience of the human spirit."},{"instruction":"Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who thinks that, in America, his public declaration about his bisexuality stood in the way of so much he wanted to do?

The survey of 2,000 adults was completed to mark the launch of the hit US drama GRIMM , which starts tonight at 9pm on Watch, and sees six drama series based on traditional fairytales. The survey found a quarter of parents questioned wouldn't consider reading fairytales to their kids.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct, but it only covers a part of Isaac Newton's achievements. Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, and astronomer who is most famous for his work in the field of classical mechanics, optics, and the development of calculus. In addition to developing the first practical reflecting telescope and the theory of color, some of his major achievements are: 1. Newton's Three Laws of Motion: Newton formulated and established the three fundamental laws of motion that form the basis of classical mechanics. These laws describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, as well as its motion in response to those forces. - First Law (Inertia): An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a force. - Second Law (Force): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma). - Third Law (Action and Reaction): When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction on the first body. 2. Universal Law of Gravitation: Newton discovered the law of universal gravitation, which states that every point mass attracts every other point mass with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses (M and m) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (r). The gravitational force can be calculated using the formula F = G * (Mm / r^2), where G is the gravitational constant. 3. Calculus: Newton developed a mathematical framework, known as calculus, for describing the motions of objects under varying conditions. Calculus is a powerful mathematical tool used in a wide range of scientific disciplines to model and solve problems involving rates of change, such as velocity and acceleration. In summary, Isaac Newton made significant contributions to multiple fields, including physics, mathematics, and optics.

He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows. He also narrated the first two series of the children's television programme Thomas & Friends and portrayed \\"Mr... contains an answer for the question: What is the full professional name of the person who wrote and sang \\"Octopus's Garden\\"?, what is it ?

Movie plot title: The Ten Commandments Movie plot: Pharaoh Rameses I of Egypt has ordered the death of all the firstborn Hebrew male infants after hearing the prophecy of the Deliverer, but a Hebrew mother named Yoshebel saves her own infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the Nile. Bithiah, the Pharaoh's daughter, who had recently lost both her husband and the hope of ever having children of her own, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew and protests. Because she drew the infant out of the water, Bithiah decides to name the baby Moses. Many years later, Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with Ethiopia and then entering Egypt into an alliance with them. Moses loves Nefretiri, who is the throne princess and must be betrothed to the next Pharaoh. She reciprocates his love. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God. An incident occurs when an elderly woman is almost crushed to death when her sash gets caught under the slab of stone, prompting Moses to scold overseer Baka. Moses frees the elderly woman, not realizing that she is his natural mother, Yoshebel. Moses institutes numerous reforms concerning the treatment of the slaves on the project, and eventually Prince Rameses, Moses's \\"brother\\", charges him with planning an insurrection, pointing out that the slaves are calling him the \\"Deliverer\\". Moses defends himself against the charges, arguing that he is simply making his workers more productive by making them stronger and happier and proves his point with the impressive progress he is making. Rameses had earlier been charged by Sethi with finding out whether there really is a Hebrew fitting the description of the Deliverer. Nefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. Nefretiri kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of Levite cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses goes...

Here's the thing: we haven't seen it yet, so for all we know the Johnny Depp vehicle could be a delightful comedy romp. But since Lionsgate hasn't screened the movie for critics (ahem), we're not particularly encouraged. (Rotten Tomatoes score currently? 7%.) So - assuming it's bad - just how bad will \\"Mortdecai\\" be? Could it possibly be worse than its respective cast members' most wretched films? Below we speculate as to whether the film will surpass the sheer awfulness of the most heinous cinematic atrocities from Johnny, Gwyneth, Ewan, Olivia and more. \\"Mortdecai\\" hits theaters this Friday. ||||| CLOSE It might be time to write the official eulogy or Johnny Depp’s career. He has so many box office bombs, we’ve almost lost count and USA TODAY’s Arienne Thompson has little hope for his latest, ‘Mortdecai.’ (Daily Dish, USA TODAY) Gwyneth Paltrow and Johnny Depp star in the comedy \\"Mortdecai.\\" (Photo: David Appleby) Whenever Johnny Depp finishes his long career of playing kooky big-screen characters, aristocratic idiot Charlie Mortdecai for sure won't be near the top of the greatest-hits list. With a varied wardrobe of retro men's finery and a hirsute upper lip, the title character of the silly comedy Mortdecai (*½ out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) is the center of a whirlwind of horrible British accents, too much gagging, not enough good gags and weak dialogue that, while not exactly terrible, is terribly boring. American audiences may initially be unaware, but Mortdecai hails from the same English literary tradition of Sherlock Holmes and James Bond: The movie by director David Koepp (who directed Depp previously in Secret Window) and screenwriter Eric Aronson is based on the first of Kyril Bonfiglioli's cult novels, Don't Point That Thing at Me. If only Depp's mustached dude was as sharp a master detective and as suave as 007. Instead, the dimwitted Mortdecai and his loyal manservant Jock (Paul Bettany) find themselves traveling from England to Russia to the \\"colonies\\" in order to track down a lost Goya painting with a secret worth a fortune. If anyone could use the money, it's Mortdecai and his wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow) — the couple rides and lives in luxury, but they're a few days from insolvency. Mortdecai owes the government roughly 8 million pounds in taxes so when Inspector Martland (Ewan McGregor) comes calling for his help in sussing out info in the shadier corners of society, the art-dealing rogue is unwittingly obliged to chip in for \\"Queen and country.\\" \\"I had no idea I was so deep in her majesty's hole,\\" Mortdecai quips in one of the film's many unfunny sex, fart and fat jokes. CLOSE Johnny Depp plays a British spy in 'Mortdecai' who is on a mission to save the world while his wife Johanna, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, sits back and wonders what he is up to. VPC Olivia Munn doesn't have a chance to show the chops she displays in The Newsroom since she's too busy being the movie's main cleavage-baring sex object. The nymphomaniac daughter of a rich Los Angeles guy (Jeff Goldblum), she, like a bunch of Russians, an international terrorist and various other ne'er-do-wells, is hot for the Goya. The one talent not wasted is Bettany, playing well against type as Mortdecai's loyal and oversexed bodyguard, who has to constantly bear the brunt — and the bullets — of his boss' mistakes. The violence is of the over-the-top Looney Tunes variety, which is fitting since Depp's Mortdecai is a clueless mash-up of Christopher Walken and Pepé Le Pew. He's also a complete horndog, though his well-manicured 'stache is shutting down his love game. It acts as an inadvertent chastity belt of sorts with his wife, who gets the dry heaves every time they try to kiss. Her response to his bedroom moves: \\"It looks like you have a vagina on your face.\\" (Yep, this one's not really for the kids — they should probably see better movies than this anyway.) Mortdecai adores his gravity-defying lip curls, though, and Depp overdoes every wacky aspect of his child-like character, from his constantly shifting eyes to the gap in his front teeth to his incoherent babbling. But when it comes to memorable roles, his antihero couldn't wear the feather boa of Ed Wood or the dreadlocks of Jack Sparrow, and the actor has done a lot better than this forgettable piece of bargain-basement low art.

The given information highlights that the data being discussed is notably higher than the estimates derived from the Canada Nutrition Survey conducted in 1973. The estimated seafood consumption from this survey ranged between 0.6 grams and 2.2 grams per day. However, it is crucial to understand that the disparity in the values could primarily be attributed to the methodology employed in the 24-hour recall survey. A 24-hour recall survey does not provide an accurate representation of actual seafood consumption, mainly because it only takes into account a small percentage of seafood consumers. This is due to the fact that the frequency of seafood consumption is generally low. Therefore, through a survey conducted in such a short timeframe, it becomes challenging to gauge the true extent of seafood consumption across the population.

In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.'

Terrill John Kasich, left, and Donald Trump, second from right, argue across fellow candidates during the CNBC Republican presidential debate at the University of Colorado, Wednesday, Oct. 28, 2015, in Boulder, Colo. Reporters from both conservative and liberal-minded news organizations seem to agree: the CNBC Republican presidential debate was kind of a trainwreck. That wasn’t really because of the candidates, though — it was because of the moderators. For the first hour, CNBC moderators Becky Quick, John Harwood, and Carl Quintanilla didn’t let candidates interact with each other, resulting in multiple moments of incomprehensible yelling. This may have been because of stricter time limits — this particular 10-candidate debate was only two hours, while the previous Republican debates have spanned three hours. But constant interruption wasn’t the only problem. Candidates were also highly critical of the CNBC crew, accusing them of being part of the “liberal media.” At one point, Ted Cruz ripped into the moderators for asking what he called unfair and non-substantive questions. And in two instances, audience members actually booed at questions the moderators asked of Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee. There was even a moment when moderator Becky Quick admitted she was unsure of Donald Trump’s position on high-skill immigrant visas after questioning him about it. She first asserted that Trump was critical of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg, who wanted to increase H-1B visas for highly skilled immigrants. This is true — Trump has been critical of Zuckerburg for that reason. But when Trump said he hadn’t been, and Quick admitted she was confused. “Where did I come up with this?” she asked, “That you were..?” Trump interrupted: “I don’t know. You people write this stuff.” Quick then apologized to Trump for ostensibly misquoting him — she accused Trump of calling Marco Rubio “Mark Zuckerburg’s personal senator,” and Trump said he “never said that.” But Trump did say that — the statement is literally on his campaign site.

It was a sharp contrast from the first two contests, when Trump dominated the discussion. On Wednesday, the braggy billionaire reverted to almost just another candidate on the stage, not even involved in one of the debate’s defining moments. Story Continued Below That came when Jeb Bush, in need of a jolt after money woes forced him to slash his campaign payroll in the last week, attacked Rubio, his onetime Florida ally, for his Senate attendance record. Bush lectured Rubio that if he wanted to continue skipping votes he should “just resign and let someone else take the job.” “Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term,” Bush said. “And you should be showing up to work.” Rubio was ready, dismissing Bush as a political opportunist turning on an old friend. “Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,” he said. It was the end of discussion. The mentor had gone after the protégé but came away bruised. While that exchange got the audience going, many of the candidates scored ovations by attacking the moderators and, more broadly, the mainstream media. “This is not a cage match,” said Ted Cruz, blasting the CNBC moderators' questions for almost every candidate in the field. “How about talking about the substantive issues people care about?” As the crowd roared in approval, Cruz didn’t let up. “Nobody watching at home believes that any of the moderators have any intention of voting in a Republican primary,” he added. Facebook and Twitter said Cruz’s media assault was the most talked-about moment of the debate on their influential platforms. And focus-group guru Frank Luntz gushed on Twitter that, “Ted Cruz's focus group dials hits 98 with his attack on media bias. That's the highest score we've ever measured. EVER.” Rubio also scored big with his media slam. When Rubio declared that, “Democrats have the ultimate super PAC. It’s called the mainstream media,” it was the second-most tweeted moment of the debate. Carson, meanwhile, delivered another low-key performance, dispassionately refuting critical questions about his flat-tax plan and his business relationship with supplement company Mannatech. But if his past unheralded performances are any indicator, it won’t likely hurt him at the polls. Carson has soared, especially in Iowa, even recently eclipsing Trump in some surveys. With Trump as headliner, the 2016 debates have become must-see TV and, as a result, taken on outsize importance in the contest. That is bad news for Bush who, on Wednesday, spoke the least of any candidate on stage just as most political analysts believed he needed a lift. Off stage, Danny Diaz, Bush’s campaign manager, could be seen in a heated conversation with a CNBC producer. Rubio didn’t just shine in his showdown with Bush. He turned around a tough question on how he’d managed his personal finances, including cashing out a retirement account early and paying thousands in fees, despite earning a six-figure Senate salary and writing a best-selling book. Rubio dismissed the inquiries as “a series of discredited attacks,” though they were accurate, pivoting smoothly to his family narrative as the son of a bartender and maid. And Rubio earned laughs when he said he had to explain to his wife why “someone named Sallie-Mae was taking 1,000” every month to pay down his student loans. When CNBC’s Becky Quick tried to follow up that some of his questionable financial decisions came after Rubio had earned large sums from his book, Rubio quipped back, “And it's available on paperback, if you're interested.” Rubio’s campaign was soliciting their email list for money even before the debate was over. “Marco is winning,” one email read. “If you’re not watching, get in front of a TV or computer — a radio, even — ASAP.” It was a different story for Trump, who shrank on stage after a combative start in which he challenged the CNBC moderators about the tone and substance of their questions. He began the event on his heels when the opening question from John Harwood was about whether his big promises amounted to running a “comic-book” campaign for president. “Not a very nicely asked question, the way you said that,” Trump replied. Trump insisted he would build a 1,000-mile wall on the border with Mexico, and make Mexico pay for it. “We can do a wall. We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall” for legal immigrants,” Trump said. Harwood followed up, saying he had talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties about Trump's tax plan: \\"They say you have as much chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your wings.\\" Trump exploded. \\"Then you would have to get rid of Larry Kudlow … who came out the other day and said 'I love Trump’s tax plan.” Ohio Gov. John Kasich was one of the few candidates to cast himself as the adult in the debate from the opening seconds, when he said he worried that the Republican Party was “on the verge perhaps of picking someone who cannot do this job.” \\"Folks, we've got to wake up,\\" Kasich said. He also mocked Carson's tax plan and said his health plan amounted to \\"getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.\\" \\"We cannot elect somebody who doesn’t know how to do the job,\\" Kasich said. Trump struck right back at Kasich on the Ohio economy. “John got lucky with a thing called fracking,” Trump said, adding that Kasich once worked for Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street bank that failed in the 2008 financial crisis. And he dismissed Kasich as desperately launching attacks on him. “His poll numbers tanked,” Trump said. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina used some of her familiar and well-received lines against Clinton but did not star as she did in September, when she surged in the polls following the debate, before dropping back into the middle of the pack. She did defend her corporate record, including 30,000 layoffs under her watch, as tackling “entrenched problems head-on.” \\"I cut bureaucracy down to size, reintroduced accountability focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market and every product segment,\\" she said. \\"And yes, it was a very difficult time. However, we saved 80,000 jobs, we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business.” Chris Christie, who along with Kasich, Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee is on the bubble to make the next debate, delivered a confident performance, pleasing the audience with his barbs against two popular targets: Democrats and the media. Of the Democratic field, Christie said, “I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist. And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.” He added of Clinton, “You put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House. Take it to the bank.” And Christie mocked a question about fantasy football gambling as a needless media aside. “We’re talking about fantasy football?” he asked incredulously. “Enough on fantasy football. Let people play. Who cares.” Huckabee piled on the media, too: “This is just a great big game and we’re just the players.” Cruz delivered perhaps the oddest pitch of the night, selling himself as America’s designated driver. “If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy,” he said. “But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.” Whatever momentum comes from the CNBC bout, it could be short lived. The next debate, in Wisconsin, is already less than two weeks away. ||||| Photo by Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images Marco Rubio was strong but not quite spectacular during the first two Republican debates, picking up some fans but largely failing to stand out on a stage dominated by Donald Trump. On Wednesday, though, the freshman senator finally lived up to his billing as the candidate who could sell his party’s more conventional views to its anti-establishment base. Josh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City. Rubio was polished and poised in Colorado, delivering a superior performance that included well-timed one-liners and powerful counterattacks. As important for Rubio, though, was that his biggest rival in the establishment lane—Jeb Bush—failed to turn in the type of performance that would soothe the fears of his nervous-and-getting-more-so backers inside the Republican Party. Advertisement It was clear early that Rubio came ready to fight. When CNBC’s John Harwood pressed him to respond to a newspaper in his home state, the Sun-Sentinel, calling on him to resign his Senate seat while he seeks the presidency over his history of missed votes, Rubio ticked off the percentage of votes Barack Obama and John Kerry missed when they were running for president and called media bias. “This is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservatives,” Rubio shot back. The partisan crowd went wild. Rubio was even better when Bush tried to pile on—a decision he’ll probably regret if he rewatches the tape. “I don’t remember you ever complaining about John McCain’s voting record,” Rubio said in a reference to Bush’s recent adoption of the 2008 nominee as his spirit animal. “The only reason you're doing it now is because we’re running for the same position,” Rubio told his former mentor. “Someone convinced you attacking me is going to help you.” Later, when CNBC’s Becky Quick pressed Rubio about whether his past personal bookkeeping problems suggest he doesn’t have the “maturity and wisdom” to be president, Rubio played the “think-of-the-children” card to great affect. “My four children received a good Christian education and I’ve been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did,” he said. “I’m not worried about my finances, I’m worried about the finances of everyday Americans who struggle in the economy that is not making good jobs.” When the moderator continued to press, Rubio spun it into an attack on the Democratic front-runner. “I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children and how expensive it is for working families,” he said. “We can’t afford another four years of that. Which is what we will get if we elect a big-government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.” It was somewhere between a nonanswer and a non sequitur, but it landed in the room. MSM attack? Check. Hillary attack? Check. The only question left was whether Rubio could combine the two. Before the night was over, though, he’d done one better by finding a way to check off Benghazi from his hit list. “The mainstream media is saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign,” he said. “It was the week she got exposed as a liar. But she has her super PAC helping her out: the American mainstream media.” While Rubio was shining, Jeb was stumbling. His suggestion that fantasy football be “looked at in terms of regulation” was overshadowed by his decision to get way too specific about his own fantasy football team, boasting about his record (7-0) and his starting QB (Ryan Tannehill). Christie mocked the very premise of the question, making Bush’s answer look even smaller: “Wait a second, we have 19 trillion in debt, people out of work, ISIS and Al Qaeda attacking us and we’re talking about fantasy football? Can we stop?” Earlier while talking about budget compromises, Bush had gone for laughs and missed badly: “The deal is gone, you find a Democrat that is for cutting spending 10 dollars, I’ll give them a warm kiss.” ||||| Tweets from https://twitter.com/politico/lists/debate-night-w-politico The 2016 Blast The latest POLITICO scoops and coverage of the 2016 elections.

(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Republican presidential candidates sparred over experience, took jabs at their Democratic opponents and even shared a few laughs during CNBC's main debate in Boulder, Colo., on Oct. 28. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) The third Republican presidential debate on Wednesday evening ended with a handful of winners – Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz – and one clear loser, former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Bush, who was the well-financed front-runner at the beginning of the year, had one good moment in the beginning of the debate, when he attacked Rubio for his record of absences in the Senate. But that moment quickly became a devastating one for Bush, as Rubio responded with a faux-friendly cutdown: “Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,” he told Bush. “It’s not.” After that, Bush was a minor presence – a night so bad for him that his campaign manager confronted CNBC producers off the stage, angry about Bush’s lack of airtime. Rubio, by contrast, used the debate to cast himself as someone who understood middle-class concerns about student debt and income. By taking down Bush, he blunted an entire line of questioning about his withdrawal from the daily work of the Senate. [Full coverage: Republican presidential debate] During the third GOP debate, candidates got feisty with the CNBC moderators. They took aim at the questions asked, at the \\"mainstream media\\" and at the moderators interrupting their answers. (Victoria M. Walker/The Washington Post) Cruz and Christie also had strong moments while criticizing the moderators: Cruz attacked their questions as too negative, and Christie criticized them for asking about whether government should regulate the lucrative ‘daily fantasy” sports business. Christie mocked the moderators for focusing on “fantasy football” with so many other problems in the country. It was certainly not a good night for the moderators, who were booed on at least two occasions for questions the audience thought were unfair. One of the strongest moments for Donald Trump, the billionaire front-runner, came at the very end of the debate, when he said he had teamed up with neurosurgeon Ben Carson to force CNBC to shorten the debate. There, Trump said, was proof of his basic campaign promise: nobody was better than him at getting a good deal. Moderator John Harwood denied Trump’s assertion. Earlier, Trump denounced gun-free zones in public places as “target practice for the sickos,” underlining his pro-gun credentials during the third main GOP presidential debate. “That’s target practice for the sickos, and the mentally ill. That’s targets. They look around for gun free zones,” Trump said, talking about recent shootings at schools and military installations. “I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe. They are feeding frenzy for sick people.” Trump had been uncharacteristically quiet during the first hour and a half of the debate. But he used this moment to talk about his experience with guns, including his permits to carry weapons in New York City. “I like to be unpredictable,” about when he actually carries a gun, Trump said. “Unlike our country, by the way, which is totally predictable.” The next question was to former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who was asked – as a minister – if Trump had the moral authority to be president. Some in the crowd booed. Huckabee rejected the question: “The last [thing] I need is to give him some more time,” Huckabee said. 1 of 18 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The top quotes from the third Republican presidential debate View Photos Memorable quotes from the third GOP debate.

Christie interjected himself into a discussion about whether the government should regulate the huge, high-earning “daily fantasy” sites that let people win huge amounts of money through the success of sports players. Bush, who got the question, seemed to indicate it should be treated as gambling, and regulated. Christie jumped in, apparently incredulous that the question was even being asked: Why would the government, with all of its problems, bother with something like this? “Enough on fantasy football! Let people play! Who cares?” he said. Later, Christie continued in his confrontational mood, stopping after Harwood had talked over him. “Do you want me to answer, or do you want to answer? Even in New Jersey, what you’re doing is called rude,” Christie said. Earlier, Rubio called Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton a liar, and said that the mainstream media had worked to cover up Clinton’s falsehoods about the attacks that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. “You know, the Democrats have the ultimate Super PAC, it’s called the mainstream media,” Rubio said. He mentioned an 11-hour hearing about Benghazi on Capitol Hill last week, in which Republicans grilled Clinton about her conduct as secretary of state at the time of the attacks. “It was the week she got exposed as a liar. But she has her Super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.” That comment came on a night when the media – and CNBC itself – became a punching bag for the GOP candidates. An exchange between a CNBC moderator and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson – which began with questions about Carson’s ties to a nutritional-supplement company – ended with the crowd booing the moderator himself. The boos seemed to indicate that the crowd believed Carson when he said he had no real relationship with the company, Mannatech, which news reports have said has a history of legal actions and accusations of false claims. When moderator Carl Quintanilla pressed Carson to say if he had made an error in judgment, the crowd itself booed. “See, they know,” Carson said. Rubio used a sharp comeback to defuse Bush’s attack on his voting record in the Senate, and turned a question about his personal financial struggles into a chance to empathize with voters’ own money worries. “I didn’t inherit any money. My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid…I know what it’s like to owe that money,” Rubio said, after a moderator asked about his personal debts, including student loans. “I’m not worried about my finances. I’m worried about the finances of everyday Americans.” Rubio defended his record of missed votes in the Senate in the third GOP presidential debate, saying he was rebelling against a GOP establishment that wanted to keep him out of the presidential race. “That’s exactly what the Republican establishment says too, wait in line. Wait for what?,” he said when asked by a moderator why he was in such a rush to leave his work in the Senate. Rubio, making an argument he’s made several times in recent weeks, said his ambitions for American could not wait on the slow-moving Senate. “The time to act is now. The time to turn the page is now.” That brought an attack from Bush – a onetime ally of Rubio’s, now a bitter rival as they battle for the establishment’s support in this race. Bush, a Florida resident, cast himself as a wronged constituent of Rubio’s. “I expected that he would do constituent service, which means he shows up to work,” Bush said. “Marco, when you signed up for this, this is a six year term, and you should be showing up to work…Or just resign, and let somebody else take the job.” Rubio clearly had been expecting this attack, and responded with a sharp attack on Bush – followed by a pledge that he would not attack people, as Bush just had. “Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you….It’s not,” Rubio said. “I’m not running against Gov. Bush. I’m not running against anyone else on the stage. I’m running for president.” Cruz attacked the moderators, for asking too-hard questions of the other candidates. “The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than any participant in the Democratic debate,” Cruz said. In that attack, Cruz used up the time he’d been allotted to answer a question about the debt ceiling, and why Cruz opposed a bill to raise it. When that was pointed out, Cruz offered to answer the question. When moderators didn’t let him, he seemed outraged. “You’re not interested in an answer? You’re not interested in an answer?” Earlier, Carson, a new front-runner in the Republican race, faced strong criticism of his tithing-based tax plan, when Kasich called Carson’s plan “fantasy.” “You can’t do it with empty promises. You know, these plans would put us trillions of dollars in debt,” Kasich said. “We cannot elect somebody that doesn’t know how to do the job.” Even at the moment when Kasich was attacking his rival, Carson, Trump – unable to let a chance to insult pass by -- intervened to attack Kasich for his low poll numbers. “That’s why he’s on the end,” Trump said. A few minutes earlier, the third Republican presidential debate had begun like an awkward job interview, with a moderator asking candidates to name their biggest weakness. The result, as in most job interviews, was a group of people who didn’t actually answer the question. “Good question,” said Kasich, who then ignored the question to insult his colleagues. “We’re on the verge of picking somebody who could perhaps not do this job.” “If I have a weakness, it’s that I try to play by the rules,” said Huckabee. “I share an optimism” about the country’s future,” said Rubio. “I’m a fighter,” said Cruz. The closest thing to a weakness that anyone admitted came from an unlikely source: Trump. “I’m too trusting,” Trump said. “And if they let me down, when they let me down, I never forgive.” Earlier on Wednesday, four low-performing Republican candidates faced off in another dinnertime “undercard” debate. The dominant figures in that debate were Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), the jokester; Lousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the hard-right conservative; and a large and growing cast of CNBC moderators, who at times seemed loathe to let the actual candidates speak. Graham – showing his trademark combination of humor and deadly seriousness – closed out the earlier debate by mocking Donald Trump, and then swinging to an emotional plea that American make him commander in chief. Graham (S.C.) joked that he’d heard – or maybe read it on a hat – that somebody wanted to “Make America Great Again.” That was a jab at Trump, who had made the slogan -- and the hats that bear it -- famous this year. Then Graham turned to his own message. “America is great. I intend to make America strong again,” he said, pledging to help the middle class, and to back American troops, even as he sent them into a new land war in Syria. “They have had our back. God knows, they have had our back. And I intend to have their back…Make me commander in chief.” [Transcript: CNBC undercard GOP debate] Jindal, formerly known as a wonk-Republican, made an appeal to pugnacious hard-core conservatives and Christian right. In the course of the debate, Jindal derided Democrats as socialists, and Republicans in Washington as weak and too quick to surrender. Jindal ended the first debate with an appeal for Americans to think of their country in Christian terms: with faith that a frightening situation could be saved. “The idea of America is slipping away. As Christians, we believe that the tomb is empty. As Americans we believe that our best days are ahead of us,” Jindal said, meaning the tomb of Jesus Christ, which Christians believe was found empty because Christ had been resurrected after death. “We can save the idea of America,” Jindal said. “Before it’s too late.” Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum sought to play the role of a business-focused realist: asked about the Export-Import Bank, a conservative bogeyman, Santorum defended the institution as a crucial aid to U.S. manufacturing. Without it, he said, other countries would use similar state-sponsored institutions to give their own industries a leg up over American firms. “In order to have a level playing field which is what conservatives talk about all the time, then we have to have export financing,” Santorum said. At one point, Graham launched into a diatribe about the state of the Republican Party, complaining that other candidates were making unrealistic promises – and that the GOP nominee might lose to a weak Democrat in 2016. “At the end of the day folks, I am trying to solve a problem and win an election. I am tired of losing!” Graham shouted, as moderators tried to quiet him. He complained that the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton, had made misleading claims that she’d been flat broke” after leaving the White House, and about Sen. Bernie Sanders’s long ties to socialism. “The number two guy [in the Democratic race] went to the Soviet Union and I don’t think he came back. If we can’t beat these people, then who in the hell are we going to beat!” Graham’s speech may have been the emotional high point of a rather sleepy undercard, in which four long shots debated soberly about their tax plans. Jindal had touted his plan to make poor people a 2 percent federal income tax, a change from the present system where 45 percent of Americans pay no federal income tax. Former New York governor George Pataki said his plan was better than Jindal’s tax plan because he had the political skills to get it passed. At one point, Pataki talked over another candidate in order to condemn Washington politicians for…interrupting. “In Washington, they talk over each other!” he said, while talking over Graham. “I’m not used to that. I listen when people talk.” Jenna Johnson, in Sioux City, Iowa, and David Weigel, in Boulder, Colo., contributed to this report. ||||| Cruz was also in fine fettle, delivering strong answers. The Texan offered far more specific economic policies than any of his rivals, though some of those ideas were politically risky or economically suspect. Cruz recommended partially privatizing Social Security, an idea that was roundly rejected when President George W. Bush attempted it. He called for auditing the Federal Reserve—stealing thunder from Rand Paul, who stood elsewhere on stage—and for abolishing the IRS, replacing it with a postcard-sized tax return. Somewhat bizarrely, Cruz also appeared to call for a return to the gold standard. But Cruz skipped a chance to deliver a specific answer about the budget deal under consideration in Congress right now—as did most of his fellow candidates. While the candidates discussed jobs and income inequality, their prescriptions tended toward the superficial: Get government out of the way, they said, and growth would follow. Perhaps the only policy that united most of the candidates was the need to protect existing federal entitlements for today’s seniors. Carly Fiorina, who proved to be one of the strongest debaters in the last two meetings but has fallen off the map since the last debate, was comparatively subdued and didn’t dominate as she did before. She called for a three-page tax code (to the moderators’ incredulity), on populist grounds. She attacked Hillary Clinton, and yet again, she defended her record at HP, where she was fired by the board. Moderators seem to insist on asking this question over and over, even though her answer has remained consistent—that she was sacked in a political struggle and did what was needed to save the company. Ben Carson was also, as usual, subdued—though so far it’s worked for him. Carson has been shaky when discussing policy, but he mostly managed to avoid potholes. However, when pressed by Becky Quick on the fact that his plan would create huge deficits, he insisted it wouldn’t, saying growth would replace it—the classic Laffer Curve argument. But his answer doesn’t conform with any serious analysis. Carson also parried a question about Mannatech, a questionable supplement company for which he cut ads, by saying it was a liberal attack and that he wasn’t really involved. That worked on stage, but it’s likely to bring new, unwelcome scrutiny to his relationship with Mannatech—a story that, by the way, was broken by the conservative National Review. This wasn’t Donald Trump’s night: He remained silent for long stretches, and much of the time he spent didn’t make him look good. After he denied to Becky Quick that he’d criticized H1B visas, Quick came back after break and pointed out that she read the quote on Trump’s own website. (Whoops!) Early on, Trump attempted a return to his political roots—way back in June!—with a stirring rant about the need to secure the border, the issue that took him to the top of the polls. Yet just as he delivered a strong defense of progressive taxation at the last debate, Trump sounded like a liberal Democrat on campaign finance Wednesday night: “Super PACs are a disaster, they're a scam, they cause dishonesty, and we've got to get rid of them.” ||||| A:","output":"The CNBC Republican presidential debate, held yesterday in Boulder, Colorado, has been widely criticized for the performance of the moderators.

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. How long did the affair, if true, between Trump and the adult film star most likely continue? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - a few weeks - not enough information - one night - several months to a couple of years Answer:","output":"not enough information"},{"instruction":"Choose your answer from: a). wants to leave. b). helps trump. c). not enough information. d). asks for water. Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: President Donald Trump's approval rating has headed into unfamiliar territory in recent weeks — upward. Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics. There is no way of knowing whether it will last.\\" It looks as though bipartisan cooperation will not extend to health care, where Senate Republicans are making one last attempt to replace Obamacare.

He entered his first race as a senior at Archbishop Curley-Notre Dame High School in Miami. Since he was only 17, he had to have his parents' permission so he thought when his mother said ok, it was forever, but she thought it was for only one race. Allison moved full-time to the Grand National circuit in 1965 and got his first victory at Oxford Plains Speedway on July 12, 1966. During the course of his career, Bobby Allison accumulated 84 credited victories and 2 uncredited victories making him fourth all-time, tied with Darrell Waltrip, including three victories at the Daytona 500 in 1978, 1982 and 1988, where he finished one-two with his son, Davey Allison. In 1972 he was voted national Driver of the Year for winning ten races and taking 11 poles (including a record 5 straight) and again in 1983 when he claimed his only championship. He was NASCAR Winston Cup Champion in 1983 driving for DiGard Racing. The 1982 Daytona 500 was fraught with controversy that became known as \\"Bumpergate\\". He also won the Firecracker 400 in 1982, making Allison the fourth driver to sweep both Sprint Cup point races at Daytona in the same year. Of note, after Allison accomplished this, no driver repeated such a feat until Jimmie Johnson did it in 2013. Allison ran in the Indianapolis 500 twice, with a best finish of 25th in 1975. His NASCAR team owners included DiGard, Junior Johnson & Associates, and Roger Penske, for whom Allison scored four of the five NASCAR wins for American Motors' Matador. The other AMC victory was accomplished by Mark Donohue also racing for Penske in 1973 at Riverside. He raced in NASCAR as a driver/owner of an AMC Matador. Allison was involved in an accident at Talladega in May 1987, that saw his car cut down a tire, turn sideways and go airborne into the protective catch fence that separates the speedway from the grandstands. The impact, at over 200 miles per hour (320 km/h), tore out over 100 yards of fencing. Parts and pieces of the car went flying into the grandstand injuring several spectators. This was the same race where Bill Elliott had set the all-time qualifying record at 212 mph (341 km/h). NASCAR then mandated smaller carburetors for the remaining 1987 events at Talladega and Daytona. The following year, NASCAR mandated restrictor plates at Daytona and Talladega to keep speeds under 200 miles per hour (320 km/h). Allison won the first Daytona 500 run with restrictor plates in February 1988 by a car length over his son Davey Allison, rendering him the first driver to have won the Daytona 500 both with and without restrictor plates. He is the oldest driver (50 years) ever to win the Daytona 500. Bobby and Davey Allison are the first one-two father/son finish in the Daytona 500. As a result of permanent injuries in a crash at Pocono (see below), Bobby now has no memory of the final win of his career or of celebrating together with his son in victory lane. He was elected to the NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2011. Did he ever have any big crashes during this time?","output":"Yes, Bobby Allison experienced several big crashes during his racing career. Some of the most notable ones are as follows: 1. 1987 Talladega Crash: As mentioned earlier, Allison was involved in a severe accident at the Talladega Superspeedway during the 1987 Winston 500. During the race, his car suffered a tire blowout, causing it to lose control, become airborne, and crash into the catch fence at over 200 miles per hour. The impact tore out a large portion of the fence, and debris from the car injured several spectators in the grandstands. This incident led to NASCAR introducing restrictor plates at Daytona and Talladega to limit speeds and improve safety. 2. 1988 Pocono Crash: Allison experienced a career-ending crash during a race at the Pocono Raceway on June 19, 1988. He suffered a tire blowout that sent his car spinning and causing it to collide with another vehicle. The impact caused severe damage to his car, and Allison sustained life-threatening injuries, including a head injury that left him with permanent memory loss. Due to the brain injury, he could not recall the final win of his career at the 1988 Daytona 500, where he finished ahead of his son, Davey Allison. The crash at Pocono effectively ended Bobby Allison's racing career, as he never fully recovered from the injuries sustained in the accident. Despite the setbacks and serious accidents, Bobby Allison's impressive career earned him a well-deserved place in the NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2011. His legacy as one of the NASCAR's greatest drivers remains strong, even in the face of adversity and personal tragedy."},{"instruction":"Context: We concluded that maybe we should hang on a bit anyway as its early days ...

Possible answers: pick from the following. 1). To rehydrate and clear my mind .; 2). To make sure my mind is fuzzy .; 3). To dilute the sausages I 've consumed .; 4). To enhance the alcohol I 've consumed .; The answer:","output":"1). To rehydrate and clear my mind. Drinking water after consuming alcoholic beverages is essential for several reasons. When you drink alcohol, it acts as a diuretic, which increases urine production and can cause dehydration. Dehydration can lead to various symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and headache. By drinking water, you help to rehydrate your body and alleviate some of these symptoms. Additionally, alcohol can impair cognitive functions and cause difficulties in processing information, leading to a fuzzy mind or slurred speech. Consuming water can help clear your mind by diluting the alcohol concentration in your bloodstream and facilitating the elimination of alcohol from your body. Furthermore, drinking water while consuming alcohol can help slow the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream, reducing its intoxicating effects and helping you maintain a clear mind. This is particularly important if you feel that you have consumed too much alcohol or if you're already experiencing symptoms such as repeating yourself or struggling to hold a conversation. In summary, drinking water after consuming alcohol is crucial in rehydrating your body, clearing your mind, and helping to minimize the negative effects of alcohol consumption."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Ben and Harry were studying about the climatic history of Earth. Ben was more attracted to learning about early Ice Ages, while Harry was curious about the Earth atmosphere and read about ozone depletion and its consequences. But I can use this background: Beginning in the late 1970’s, ozone depletion was recognized as a significant environmental issue. The most dramatic decrease in ozone occurs seasonally over the continent of Antarctica. The size and duration of the ozone hole steadily increased, with the largest hole recorded in 2006. Fortunately, most countries have recognized the danger of CFCs and dramatically curtailed their use in recent years. It is hoped that ozone depletion will slow and that the ozone layer may eventually be restored to its earlier levels. What is an answer for this question: Which person learned less about the most dramatic decrease in ozone? A:","output":"A: Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that Ben learned less about the most dramatic decrease in ozone. While both Ben and Harry were studying the climatic history of Earth, their interests and focus areas were different. Ben was more attracted to learning about early Ice Ages, which may encompass studies about glaciation and the effect of climate change on ice coverage. On the other hand, Harry was curious about the Earth's atmosphere, specifically reading about ozone depletion and its consequences. Since the most dramatic decrease in ozone is a crucial aspect of the topic Harry was exploring, it's likely that he would have learned about it while researching ozone depletion. The background information provided about the ozone hole, its steady increase over the years, and the efforts in recent times to restore the ozone layer may have been within the scope of Harry's research, while Ben's study on early Ice Ages would not necessarily involve learning about ozone depletion. Thus, the answer to the question is that Ben learned less about the most dramatic decrease in ozone."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Imagine that the rules of volleyball forbid the use of hands or arms---that's sepaktakraw . It's a difficult sport, but that isn't stopping the world from picking it up. The court where sepaktakraw is played is the size of one used for badminton doubles. A net and a plastic ball a little larger than a baseball are used. Two teams of three players(left inside, right inside, and server) take their places on either side. A teammate passes the ball to the server who kicks it over the net. Points are scored when the ball touches the court surface on the other side. How sepaktakraw began has been a hot topic. Many Asian cultures once had their own names and rules for it. In Thailand the sport can be found on a famous mural . It was also played to celebrate the writing of the nations' first constitution in 1933. however, various nations discussed to decide the official name and rules in 1960, At last, sepak is a Malay word for \\"kick\\", and takraw is Thai for \\"woven ball\\". International tournaments have been held for many years, but sepaktakraw continues to improve. It was introduced as an exhibition event at the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung. And though no other countries can b equal to Thailand in sepaktakraw, they will show improvement. Twenty-five continents on five continents now claim active teams that play internationally. Finally, a place in the Olympic Games is also being sought. If these changes continue, sepaktakraw may soon be familiar to all. Question: How did sepaktakraw get its name?

To do this, we will compare several key elements and assess their compatibility. 1. Number of subjects (\\"Two young girls\\" vs. \\"Two girls\\") Both the premise and the hypothesis feature two girls. While the premise specifically mentions \\"young girls,\\" the hypothesis contains \\"two girls.\\" Since the hypothesis can still apply to young girls, this part is compatible. 2. Activity described (\\"jumping on the couch\\" vs. \\"jump on the bed\\") The premise mentions the girls jumping on a couch, but the hypothesis states they jump on a bed. This change in object contradicts each other and shows that the hypothesis is not entirely entailed by the premise. 3. Emotional state (\\"jovial manner\\" vs. \\"angrily\\") The premise describes the girls' behavior as jovial, implying a happy and playful demeanor. The hypothesis, however, suggests that the girls jump angrily - a clear contrast. This emotional incongruity indicates that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. In summary, although there are some similarities between the premise and the hypothesis, the differences in the object of the action (couch vs. bed) and the emotional state (jovial vs. angry) mean that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."},{"instruction":"Here is a question about this article: On July 11, 1877, a few days after the Bell Telephone Company was established, Bell married Mabel Hubbard (1857–1923) at the Hubbard estate in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement.

(Richard Drew/Associated Press) In an appearance today on “CBS This Morning,” Gabriel Sherman, the unauthorized biographer of Fox News chief Roger Ailes, took aim at a central part of the network boss’s history. The issue concerns a great anecdote from Ailes’s early years as a professional. It was January 1968, and Ailes was executive producer of the Mike Douglas Show. Booked to appear on the Jan. 9 program was then-presidential hopeful Richard Nixon. Ailes ended up face-to-face with Nixon in his office, an encounter that came about via strange circumstances. Here’s how Ailes described those circumstances in a 2001 interview with Charlie Rose: “So somebody ran into me and said, ‘We’re having former Vice President Nixon come in and we have Little Egypt the belly dancer in the green room with a boa constrictor.’ So I said, ‘Put one of them in my office.’ And they ended up putting Nixon in my office. And I didn’t want to scare the boa constrictor or Nixon so I decided I had to keep them apart. I don’t think Nixon ever knew he was on the same show with a boa constrictor until maybe a week later somebody told him. And a belly dancer, by the way: Little Egypt was a famous belly dancer. Anyway, I went back to my office, there’s Nixon sitting there and he’s grumbling about, you know, it’s too bad a guy has to rely on a gimmick to get elected.” In his research for “The Loudest Voice in the Room,” Sherman has determined that things didn’t quite go down that way. “There was no belly dancer; there was no snake on the set of the Mike Douglas Show,” Sherman said this morning on CBS. He breaks things down on a just-posted mini-excerpt at New York magazine: [A]ccording to several of Ailes’s Mike Douglas colleagues who were present, there was no belly dancer named Little Egypt booked that day. Their assertion is backed up by the show’s talent logs, which I viewed. The guests during the Nixon taping, which took place on January 9, were the singer Margaret Whiting, the actress Stella Stevens, the Philadelphia Brass Ensemble, and Tony Sandler’s children. According to the talent log for that week’s shoots, the dance duo John Brascia and Tybee Arfa had been scheduled to come into the studio when Nixon was there, but were bumped back a day. Tybee, as she was known, was certainly exotic. But she never performed under the name Little Egypt. And the snake? “No one has any recollection of Tybee ever dancing with a boa,” recalled John Brascia’s daughter, Christina. On CBS, Sherman said that the story is “a wonderful cocktail party story that shows roger Ailes’s unrivaled ability to be a myth-maker.” The meeting with Nixon, insists Sherman, came in a “formative” period in the life of the then-27-year-old Ailes, who didn’t exactly stumble into a one-on-one with Nixon. “He wanted to work for Nixon. He wanted to become a media strategist,” said Sherman. This could be fun. Can the Fox News public relations team find any evidence that a snake appeared on the Jan. 9, 1968, edition of The Mike Douglas Show? What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses a claim made by Gabriel Sherman, the biographer of Fox News chief Roger Ailes, that Ailes fabricated a story about meeting Richard Nixon while Nixon was coincidentally on the same show as a belly dancer and a boa constrictor. Sherman states that, upon further investigation, there was no evidence of the belly dancer or the snake being on the show on the same day as Nixon, and suggests that Ailes's story is an example of his ability to create myths."},{"instruction":"Q:Given this review: \\"I like it....It is Very uesful Apps\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Context: Oh, yes, I accidentally insulted a bully. It was awesome. This was about a month ago. It was the last day I worked. Memorial Day at the city rec center is SLOW, especially when it's beautiful outside, but for some reason, we had two front desk attendants: me, and “bully #1”. Bully #1 clearly had a major distaste for me. She hated my tattoos, the way I would get into a heated debate one day with a police officer patron, then have a fantastic conversation with him days later about legalizing marijuana. She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me. Bully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day. I honestly never had a clue she didn't like me. She was intense and sarcastic with everyone. I liked her style. On this day, I really got the feeling they were trash talking me pretty hard, the way they kept disappearing, talking over me, laughing like mean girls. I blew it off, because I was down an internet rabbit hole, trying to wrap my brain around some concepts. I was looking at a word, and while I like to think I know exact definitions, sometimes I ask people their take on it. Many psychological terms have some subjective meaning. I spun around in my chair, locked eyes with #2, and asked her: “What do you know about Machiavellianism?” I swear to God, all I wanted was her take on it (she's a smart cookie), and all hell broke loose. I now realize that she thought I was passive-aggressively accusing her of said word. They got really nasty (behind my back, of course). They retreated to the back for awhile, and left me by myself. Cue loud, mean girl laughter. When #1 resumed her post next to me at the front desk, I calmly told her, “I'm cashing out, and leaving. I'm uncomfortable.” And I did. It was noon. We were closing at 1. I figured those bitches could handle it on their own.

The project is headed by Dr. Van Gelder, in order to test underwater colonization methods, while overseeing the installation of a new nuclear missile storage platform. Already nearing his deadline, Van Gelder's plans are threatened when geologist Burciaga (Elya Baskin) discovers a massive cavern system under the site. Van Gelder orders the use of depth charges to collapse the cavern, to the dismay of Dr. Scarpelli (Nia Peeples), who want to study the potentially primordial ecosystem inside. The ensuing detonation collapses part of the seabed, forming a massive fissure in the ocean floor. Submarine pilots Osborne and Hodges (Ronn Carroll, Thom Bray) send an unmanned probe to explore, but lose contact and venture in after it. Upon finding the probe, they detect a large sonar contact moments before being attacked and killed by an unseen force. The aggressor then attacks the observation pod, leaving Joyce Collins (Nancy Everhard) and a dying Burciaga trapped inside as it teeters on the edge of the ravine. Captain Laidlaw (Taurean Blacque) and submarine pilot McBride (Greg Evigan)- who is also Collins' paramour -attempt a rescue.

A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a 16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.\\" Question: This passage is mainly about _ .

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

(2) The central mainland of the Shetland Islands is part of the mainland between Hellister , Aith and Voe . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, these two sentences do mean essentially the same thing. Both are speaking about the geographic location of the Central Mainland of the Shetland Islands. They both indicate that it is a part of the Mainland, which is the main island of the Shetland Islands in Scotland, located between three places: Hellister, Aith, and Voe. The sentences' structures are slightly different, but they do not alter the overall meaning. In sentence (1), \\"The Central Mainland of the Shetland Islands is the part of the Mainland, between Hellister, Aith, and Voe.\\" the structure indicates that the Central Mainland is the part of the area under discussion and it specifies where this area lies by stating it's between Hellister, Aith, and Voe. Sentence (2), \\"The central mainland of the Shetland Islands is part of the mainland between Hellister, Aith, and Voe.\\" also carries the same meaning. The small difference here is the absence of the word \\"the\\" before \\"part of the mainland\\", however, this absence doesn't change the conveyed message about the location of the Central Mainland of the Shetland Islands. So, both sentences explain the same geographical detail about the Shetland Islands. They describe that the Central Mainland is a portion of the Mainland that lies between the same geographical landmarks: Hellister, Aith, and Voe. Therefore, any slight variations in the structure or phrasing of these two sentences do not alter the information that they provide about the Central Mainland's location. It is the same in both sentences."},{"instruction":"One of the following sentences is nonsensical. Which one is it?

Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms. Which group had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation? Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. A:","output":"Group B, which presented somatic mutations, had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation. This is because somatic mutations occur in body cells and cannot be passed to offspring. In contrast, germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells and can be passed to the next generation, potentially causing hereditary diseases."},{"instruction":"Process: - A fuel is heated in an oven - Above the oven is a tank of water that is sealed - The tank of water begins to boil above the oven - A the water boils steam is created - The steam is denser than air so it needs a place to go - The steam is forced out of the tank and into a piston - The piston moves up - The valve of the piston closes - The valve on the next piston opens - The steam fills the next piston, driving it up, and the other one down - suppose there is more moisture in the air happens, how will it affect more water vailable. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"The supposed perturbation of having more moisture in the air would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. To understand this, let's first examine the process in detail: 1. A fuel (such as coal, wood, or gas) is heated in an oven. This heating generates thermal energy. 2. Above the oven is a sealed tank of water, which starts to absorb the thermal energy from the oven. 3. As the water in the tank heats up, it begins to boil and turn into steam. 4. The steam produced is denser than air, creating pressure within the sealed tank. 5. This pressure causes the steam to be forced out of the tank and into a piston. 6. As the steam enters the piston, it moves the piston upwards, effectively converting the steam's energy into mechanical energy. 7. Once the piston has reached its apex, the valve on the piston closes, trapping the steam inside. 8. Simultaneously, the valve on the next piston opens, allowing the steam to expand into this new piston chamber. 9. This process continues, with the steam driving the next piston up and the previous one down, resulting in a continuous and smooth motion. Now, let's consider the effect of having more moisture in the air on this process. The presence of additional moisture in the air means there is more water vapor in the atmosphere surrounding the system. While this extra moisture does not directly impact any of the steps outlined above, it can indirectly affect the efficiency of the process. The increased moisture content in the air could affect the heat transfer between the oven and the water tank. As the air surrounding the system becomes more humid, it may reduce the efficiency of heat transfer from the oven to the tank of water. It might take longer for the water to heat up and boil, leading to a less efficient process. However, this indirect effect of more moisture in the air could be easily mitigated using proper insulation around the oven and the water tank to minimize the influence of the surrounding environment on the heat transfer process. This would ensure that the water tank receives the required thermal energy efficiently to continue the process as designed. Thus, the supposed perturbation of having more moisture in the air would indirectly impact a step of the process, but this effect can be minimized by employing appropriate preventive measures."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Spanish.

Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores. The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added. For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers.

Hypothesis: San'doro jerked at the sound of an animal. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise given is: \\"Instead, San'doro had jerked at the sound and it drew a line against his left shoulder blade.\\" This sentence provides us with three pieces of information: (1) San'doro jerked at a sound, (2) this action occurred as an alternative to some other action or event, and (3) a line was drawn against his left shoulder blade as a result of his jerking motion. The hypothesis provided is: \\"San'doro jerked at the sound of an animal.\\" This statement implies that the source of the sound that caused San'doro to jerk was an animal. Now, let's analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis. An entailment in logic and semantics exists when the truth of one statement (in this case, the hypothesis) follows necessarily from the truth of another statement (the premise). In the given premise, the focus is on San'doro's response (jerking at the sound) and the resulting physical consequence (a line being drawn against his left shoulder blade). However, no information is provided about the source or nature of the sound. The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifically states that the sound comes from an animal. Since the premise does not provide any details about the origin of the sound, we cannot conclude that the sound was indeed produced by an animal. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis might be a possible explanation for San'doro's reaction, but it does not necessarily follow from the given premise, and other sources of the sound could also be valid."},{"instruction":"Does \\"Robert Redford's 1992 film of Norman Mclean's novel, A River Runs Through It, was filmed in Montana and brought national attention to fly fishing and the state.\\" correctly answer the question of What Robert Redford movie was shot here in 1002?","output":"No, the statement \\"Robert Redford's 1992 film of Norman Mclean's novel, A River Runs Through It, was filmed in Montana and brought national attention to fly fishing and the state.\\" does not correctly answer the question of \\"What Robert Redford movie was shot here in 1002?\\" for a several reasons, which will be explained below. 1. Typographical error: The date mentioned in the question is \\"1002,\\" which is a clear mistake. The correct year should be \\"1992,\\" as is evident from the statement's details about the film adaptation of Norman Mclean's novel. Typographical errors can cause confusion and misunderstandings, and in this case, it leads to the incorrect interpretation of the time period in question. 2. Missing location information: The question asks about a specific location where a Robert Redford movie was shot, which the statement does not address clearly. Although the statement mentions that the film was filmed in Montana, it does not specify any particular location within Montana. 3. Clarify the question: To correctly answer the question, you must first ensure that you understand its purpose and the information it seeks. The question is asking about a specific Robert Redford film shot in a particular location and not about the impact or attention it brought to fly fishing and the state. The information about the film's impact is not directly related to the question and can be considered extra or supplementary information. A more accurate answer to the corrected query, \\"What Robert Redford movie was shot in Montana in 1992?\\" would be: \\"The 1992 Robert Redford film 'A River Runs Through It,' based on Norman Mclean's novel, was filmed in Montana.\\" This answer addresses the correct year, film title, and location, making it a suitable response to the question."},{"instruction":"8,000 Syrian refugees flee to Turkey overnight What is a sentence that would be (on a scale from 0 to 5) a 4 out of 5 in terms of textual similarity to the above sentence?","output":"Overnight, 8,000 refugees from Syria escape to Turkey I chose this sentence because it closely resembles the original sentence in terms of meaning and structure while altering some of the words and their order.

The Cycladic culture is one of the three significant early Aegean civilizations, along with the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures. The most common subject of Cycladic sculptures is the so-called \\"Cycladic figurines\\" or \\"Cycladic idols.\\" These figurines are predominantly found in the Early Cycladic II period (2800-2300 BCE) and are characterized by their simple, geometric and abstract forms. The majority of the sculptures depict female figures, nude and in various poses, suggesting that they may have represented goddesses or served a religious purpose, linked to beliefs in fertility, death, and afterlife. The aesthetic appearance of these figures emphasizes the aspects of minimalism and abstraction, which later became influential in the art world, especially in modern art movements like Cubism. Cycladic figurines are mainly made of local, high-quality marble that is abundant in the Cyclades and were carved using a variety of tools such as chisels, blades, and abrasives for a smoother finish. These figures are depicted standing or reclining, with their arms folded across their chest and elongated necks supporting their distinctive, lyre-shaped heads with prominent noses. They have little to no facial features other than the nose, and the lack of other details can be attributed to their symbolic or, perhaps, metaphysical nature. Although female figures dominate Cycladic sculptures, some male figures have been discovered as well. Male figurines are thought to have portrayed warriors, hunters, or possibly musicians, and are often classified as being anatomically distinguishable and engaged in an activity. For example, some figures hold weapons, musical instruments, or have their hands in positions indicating they would be handling tools. There are also a few abstract examples of Cycladic art in which the gender of the figure is difficult to identify. In addition to the figurines, Cycladic sculptures also involve pottery and smaller, functional objects such as stone vessels and tools. There are examples of engraved or painted pottery with themes related to the natural world, geometric patterns, and maritime scenes. However, the main fascination surrounding Cycladic art and its most common subject overwhelmingly revolves around the striking and enigmatic marble figurines. In summary, the most common subject of Cycladic sculptures is the Cycladic figurines, primarily representing female figures with minimalistic, abstract, and almost otherworldly characteristics. These marble figures not only provide unique insight into the artistic expressions of the ancient Cycladic civilization but have also played an influential role in shaping the course of modern art."},{"instruction":"\\"Exilia expeditionis\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?","output":"The title \\"Exilia expeditionis\\" does not clearly fit into any of the given categories.

Elizabeth Waller married Cowles in 1900 , and their daughter Harriet was born in 1912 .","output":"Yes, both sentences convey the same meaning. They provide information about Elizabeth's marriage to Waller Cowles in 1900 and the birth of their daughter Harriet in 1912. The primary difference between the two sentences is the arrangement of words and the use of possessive pronouns, but the overall meaning remains the same. In the first sentence, \\"In 1900, Elizabeth married Waller Cowles, and her daughter Harriet was born in 1912,\\" the information is presented in a straightforward manner. It establishes the timeline with \\"In 1900,\\" followed by the mention of Elizabeth and Waller Cowles' marriage. The sentence proceeds to directly state their daughter's birth year (1912) and name (Harriet). It uses the possessive pronoun 'her' to indicate Elizabeth's relation to Harriet as her daughter. The second sentence, \\"Elizabeth Waller married Cowles in 1900, and their daughter Harriet was born in 1912,\\" reorganizes the names, stating \\"Elizabeth Waller\\" instead of \\"Elizabeth\\" and \\"Cowles\\" instead of \\"Waller Cowles.\\" The sentence retains the same chronological order with the events of the marriage and Harriet's birth. However, the sentence now uses a plural possessive pronoun, 'their,' to emphasize the fact that Harriet is the daughter of both Elizabeth and Waller Cowles. In conclusion, both sentences share the same meaning, presenting the information about Elizabeth and Waller Cowles' 1900 marriage and the birth of their daughter, Harriet, in 1912. The primary differences are minor variations in the phrasing and word order, which do not affect the overall meaning."},{"instruction":"When the RPP was divided and Thapa broke away and joined the Rastriya Janshakti Party , Yadav formed RJP .

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which continent was inhabited by fewer turtles? A:","output":"Based on the provided background article, reptiles are a diverse group of animals that includes turtles, among other species. In the new situation presented, Asia is known to have a higher reptile population, while Africa has a larger bird population and very few reptiles.

The Native American tribes were excluded from the settlement; a subsequent conflict, known as Pontiac's War, was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status. In Europe, the war began disastrously for Prussia, but a combination of good luck and successful strategy saw King Frederick the Great manage to retrieve the Prussian position and retain the status quo ante bellum. Prussia emerged as a new European great power. The involvement of Portugal, Spain and Sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers. France was deprived of many of its colonies and had saddled itself with heavy war debts that its inefficient financial system could barely handle. Spain lost Florida but gained French Louisiana and regained control of its colonies, e.g., Cuba and the Philippines, which had been captured by the British during the war. France and other European powers will soon avenge their defeat in 1778 when American Revolutionary War broke out, with hopes of destroying Britain's dominance once and for all. What did Great Britain gain with respect to the French trading outposts on the subcontinent of India?","output":"Great Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War led to significant gains with respect to French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent. The British East India Company was already a dominant presence in India at the beginning of the conflict, but the French had also established strong trading posts and alliances with Indian rulers. As a result of the war, the British were able to further consolidate their power and control over the lucrative resources and trade routes in the region. Before the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, the French East India Company had a network of trading posts at strategic locations such as Pondicherry, Mahe, Karaikal, Chandernagore, and Yanam. These outposts were essential for the French to maintain their influence in India and compete with the British for control of the continent's resources. The French operated under the guidance of Joseph François Dupleix, who was successful in forming alliances with several Indian rulers to create a formidable power base in southern India. During the Seven Years' War, the British East India Company fought against the French and their Indian allies in a series of conflicts called the Carnatic Wars. The British were led by Robert Clive, who managed to secure a string of military victories. A major turning point in the conflict was the Battle of Plassey in 1757 when the British defeated Siraj ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, significantly impairing French influence in the region. By the end of the war, as a result of the 1763 Treaty of Paris, the British secured the Bengal Presidency and acquired French trading outposts like Pondicherry, Mahe, and Karaikal. Chandernagore was returned to France; however, it was no longer an influential center of power. The French were allowed to trade in India, but their political influence was drastically reduced. The British also gained the exclusive right to station troops in Bengal, further solidifying their position of power on the Indian subcontinent. As a consequence of these outcomes, British dominance in India was significantly expanded, and the groundwork was laid for the eventual creation of British India over the coming century. The demise of French power in India also meant that the British faced fewer challenges from other European powers in the region, allowing them to focus on their efforts to establish control over a vast and resource-rich land. In essence, the Seven Years' War marked the beginning of Great Britain's ascension to supremacy in India, which would ultimately give rise to the British Empire's \\"jewel in the crown.\\""},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: 1488 Also known as: 8814 1488 is a combination of two popular white supremacist numeric symbols.

This has been a very interesting live stream. #HeWillNotDivideUs pic.twitter.com/CqY9pLobWi — #HeWillNotDivideUs (@HWNDUS) January 23, 2017 LaBeouf, who has made multiple appearances in the live stream was there at the time, got into his face and screamed “he will not divide us” into the man’s ear. Before things got (more) physical, the man left, and the crowd cheered. Other moments have been much more positive. At one point, a man was there by himself for a while. Eventually, a woman came and joined him, saying she had been watching from home and had become inspired. [featured image via Featureflash Photo Agency/Shutterstock, Inc.] Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| He Will Not Divide Us/Twitter “He Will Not Divide Us,” the four-year-long anti-Trump participatory art installation from Shia LaBeouf, Nastja Sade Ronkko, and Luke Turner, was the site of a showdown between actor LaBeouf and an unidentified white supremacist on Sunday, Raw Story reports. The project, at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, invites visitors to say the words “He will not divide us” into a camera for a 24-hour livestream, which will be broadcast on the web for the entirety of the Trump presidency. The problem was that not everyone wanted to say “He will not divide us.” To be more specific, a Nazi showed up who wanted to say “1488,” instead. (Calling modern-day white supremacists Nazis may be imprecise in many cases, but this guy was literally wearing a SS M43 field cap, though he at least was ashamed of himself enough to remove the Totenkopf.) “1488,” of course, is a white supremacist code number that combines white supremacy’s 14-word creed with a reference to “Heil Hitler,” H being the eighth letter of the alphabet. It was created by white supremacist murderer David Lane, the same charmer who invented the “white genocide” myth. (Saying “Heil Hitler,” even in code, is another cutoff point where it probably ought to be ok to call someone a Nazi.) Advertisement LaBeouf, who was there at the time, sensed that a man wearing the uniform of a long-defeated army of racists might not be in the spirit of the thing, and, as can be seen in a video posted to a fan account for the project, successfully shut him down:* White supremacist yells into the camera and Shia LaBeouf shuts him down. This has been a very interesting live stream. #HeWillNotDivideUs pic.twitter.com/CqY9pLobWi — #HeWillNotDivideUs (@HWNDUS) January 23, 2017 Rather than engaging in the morally controversial act of Nazi-punching, LaBeouf decided that the answer to hate speech was more speech. He followed the guy around until he returned to the microphone (to tell the world, “We must secure the existence of the white race”) then simply out-yelled him while edging him out of frame. Watching the Nazi try to work his way back to the camera (and fail) is another bittersweet pleasure of the Trump era. Yes, the Nazi looks pathetic, and yes, this is a punch-free Nazi fiasco that we can all enjoy. But a funny web video is a poor consolation for the time—not so long ago!—when fewer Americans thought it was ok to become Nazis to begin with. ||||| Add a location to your Tweets When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Accordingly, it includes the history of the Julio-Claudian Dynasty and the Roman Empire, from Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BC to Caligula's assassination in 41 AD. The 'autobiography' of Claudius continues (from Claudius' accession after Caligula's death, to his own death in 54) in Claudius the God (1935). The sequel also includes a section written as a biography of Herod Agrippa, contemporary of Claudius and future King of the Jews. Claudius was the fourth Emperor of Rome (r. 41-54 AD). Historically, Claudius' family kept him out of public life until his sudden coronation at the age of forty-nine. This was due to his being perceived as being a dolt due to his stammering, limp and other nervous tics. This made others see him as mentally deficient and also therefore not a threat to his ambitious relatives. Even as his symptoms began to wane in his teenage years, he ran into trouble for his work as a budding historian. His work on a history of the civil wars was too truthful and too critical of the reigning emperor Augustus and his mother and grandmother quickly put a stop to it. This episode reinforced their initial suspicions that Claudius was not fit for public office. This is how he was defined by scholars for most of history, and Graves uses these peculiarities to develop a sympathetic character whose survival in a murderous dynasty depends upon his family's incorrect assumption that he is a harmless idiot. Graves's interpretation of the story owes much to the histories of Gaius Cornelius Tacitus, Plutarch and (especially) Suetonius (Lives of the Twelve Caesars). Graves translated Suetonius before writing the novels. Graves claimed that after he read Suetonius, Claudius came to him in a dream one night and demanded that his real story be told. The life of Claudius provided Graves with a way to write about the first four Emperors of Rome (Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius) from an intimate point of view. In addition, the real Claudius was a trained historian and is known to have written an autobiography (now lost) in eight books that covered the same time period. I, Claudius is a first-person narrative of Roman history from the reigns of Augustus to Caligula; Claudius the God is written as a later addition documenting Claudius' own reign. Graves provides a theme for the story by having the fictionalised Claudius describe a visit to Cumae, where he receives a prophecy in verse from the Sibyl, and an additional prophecy contained in a book of \\"Sibylline Curiosities\\". The latter concerns the fates of the \\"hairy ones\\" (i.e. The Caesars - from the Latin word \\"caesar\\", meaning \\"a fine head of hair\\") who are to rule Rome. The penultimate verse concerns his own reign, and Claudius assumes that he can tell the identity of the last emperor described. From the outset, then, Graves establishes a fatalistic tone that plays out at the end of Claudius the God, Claudius predicts his own assassination and succession by Nero. At Cumae, the Sibyl tells Claudius that he will \\"speak clear.\\" Claudius believes this means that his secret memoirs will be one day found, and that he, having therein written the truth, will speak clearly, while his contemporaries, who had to distort their histories to appease the ruling family, will seem like stammerers. Since he wishes to record his life for posterity, Claudius chooses to write in Greek, since he believes that it will remain \\"the chief literary language of the world.\\" This enables Graves to offer explanations of Latin wordplay or etymologies that would be unnecessary for native Latin speakers.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did he do as the emperor","output":"In \\"I, Claudius,\\" and its sequel \\"Claudius the God,\\" we are given an in-depth examination of Claudius's reign as emperor, and while Claudius's reign as emperor is quite extensively explored within the novel, specific quotes about his actions and achievements can be quite difficult to highlight as the novel is a pseudobiographical one. However, broadly speaking, Claudius is portrayed as an intelligent and competent ruler, who, though often underestimated because of his physical disabilities, displays strong administrative skills, enacting significant legal and bureaucratic reforms, expanding the empire by initiating the invasion of Britain in 43AD, and building a number of important public works projects, such as new roads and aqueducts. One of Claudius' significant actions as the emperor, as depicted in \\"Claudius the God,\\" was his initiation of the Roman invasion of Britain: \\"'I had always been interested in the island of Britain... I was only waiting for the proper moment to invade and now it had come... I intended to make Britain a province of Rome.'\\" Further along in the text, Graves discusses more of Claudius's rule schematically, such as his judicial reforms and infrastructure projects. He displays a diligent administration noted for public works projects, legal reforms and a balanced budget: \\"It was in the cause of justice that my work was to be done. ... I gave my attention to legal reform ... the laws were so numerous, confused, and oppressive ... I revised the tax system for the same reason.\\" While these quotes don't cover all of Claudius's achievements as an emperor, they certainly capture key aspects of his rule: strategic military expansion, conscientious rule of law, and infrastructural improvements. It's worth noting that Robert Graves's portrayal of Claudius's reign in his novel is considerably more positive than some historical accounts, which frequently tend to focus on the later decadent years of his rule marked by infamy of his manipulative and treacherous fourth wife Agrippina the Younger and his problematic relationship with the Praetorian Guards."},{"instruction":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: when was the Declaration of Independence Signed?

She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas.

While the ambiance was somewhat inviting, the overall experience was marred by a myriad of avoidable circumstances. For starters, the service was not at all satisfactory. Despite the restaurant having few other diners, our waiter was constantly distracted and took an unreasonable amount of time to attend to us. This, coupled with his nonchalant attitude when we made inquiries about the menu, made us feel neglected. The food, unfortunately, was no saving grace. We decided to stick with their special menu hoping for a delightful meal, but the dishes were substandard at best. The steak was overcooked, and the pasta was far too oily. The over-the-top prices were like salt to the wound. To charge such exorbitant amounts for meals without providing an experience to match is unfair. This restaurant lacks in value for money. Lastly, the noise levels from the adjoining bar made it impossible to hold a conversation without having to shout.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence? Pick your answer from: (i). unacceptable; (ii). acceptable;","output":"The linguistic integrity of the given sentence, \\"That evening John laughed with anybody he talked to,\\" can be considered (ii). acceptable. Here is a detailed explanation of the sentence structure, semantics, and pragmatics supporting its acceptability. Structure: The sentence follows a clear subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern. It begins with \\"That evening,\\" a time expression which helps establish the context. The subject \\"John\\" follows, accompanied by the verb \\"laughed.\\" The prepositional phrase \\"with anybody\\" functions as the object, and \\"he talked to\\" is a relative clause that further describes \\"anybody.\\" No syntactic rules are violated in this sentence. Semantics: The sentence conveys a clear and coherent meaning. It informs the reader about an event that occurred one evening, when John laughed with the people he conversed with. The use of the word \\"anybody\\" generalizes the type of person John shared laughter with, suggesting that he was socially open and engaging during these conversations. Pragmatics: From a practical point of view, the sentence is easily comprehensible and conveys contextually relevant information. The time expression \\"that evening\\" sets the stage for the reader to envision a particular scene, while the verb \\"laughed\\" paired with the preposition \\"with\\" suggests a positive, perhaps lighthearted, social atmosphere. The relative clause \\"he talked to\\" helps the reader understand that John's laughter was a result of his conversations and interactions. In summary, the sentence demonstrates linguistic integrity through its adherence to syntactic rules, coherent meaning, and pragmatically appropriate communication. Therefore, it is deemed acceptable."},{"instruction":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Most tours only sell 60 percent of the tickets.

It gets its name from the Vedas, which are liturgical texts containing details of life during this period that have been interpreted to be historical and constitute the primary sources for understanding the period. The Vedas were composed and orally transmitted by speakers of an Old Indo-Aryan language who had migrated into the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent early in this period. The associated Vedic culture was tribal and pastoral until c. 1200 or 1100 BCE, and centred in the Punjab. The commonly accepted period of earlier Vedic age is dated back to the second millennium BCE. After the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation, which ended c. 1900 BCE, groups of Indo-Aryan peoples migrated into north-western India and started to inhabit the northern Indus Valley. The Indo-Aryans were a branch of the Indo-Iranians, which--according to the most widespread hypothesis--have originated in the Andronovo culture in the Bactria-Margiana era, in present northern Afghanistan. Some writers and archaeologists have opposed the notion of a migration of Indo-Aryans into India. Edwin Bryant and Laurie Patton used the term \\"Indo-Aryan Controversy\\" for an oversight of the Indo-Aryan Migration theory, and some of its opponents. These ideas are outside the academic mainstream. Mallory and Adams note that two types of models \\"enjoy significant international currency\\" as to the Indo-European homeland, namely the Anatolian hypothesis, and a migration out of the Eurasian steppes. According to Upinder Singh, \\"The original homeland of the Indo-Europeans and Indo-Aryans is the subject of continuing debate among philologists, linguists, historians, archaeologists and others. The dominant view is that the Indo-Aryans came to the subcontinent as immigrants. Another view, advocated mainly by some Indian scholars, is that they were indigenous to the subcontinent.\\" The knowledge about the Aryans comes mostly from the Rigveda-samhita, i. e. the oldest layer of the Vedas, which was composed c. 1500-1200 BCE. They brought with them their distinctive religious traditions and practices. The Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, and the Indo-Iranian religion. According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the Zeravshan River (present-day Uzbekistan) and (present-day) Iran. It was \\"a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements\\", which borrowed \\"distinctive religious beliefs and practices\\" from the Bactria-Margiana Culture. What were differences after inhabiting the northern Indus Valley?","output":"The article doesn't specifically detail the changes or differences that occurred after the Indo-Aryan peoples migrated and started to inhabit the northern Indus Valley.

It has been 160 days since Obama nominated her on Nov. 8, and the delay in her confirmation is the longest since Ronald Reagan tapped Edwin Meese for the post in 1984. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is holding up Lynch's nomination as leverage to push Democrats to drop a filibuster on an unrelated anti-human trafficking bill. Democrats object to that measure because it contains an abortion provision. McConnell has said he won't bring up Lynch for a vote until the dispute is resolved. Obama called on Congress to move her nomination forward, saying that no one could articulate a reason beyond political gamesmanship as to why she has not been confirmed.

Republicans in the Senate have yet to offer a timeline as to a possible vote on Lynch's confirmation, and Eric Holder continues to serve as attorney general. McConnell's office insisted Friday that the majority leader is working to resolve Lynch's nomination. \\"The leader has already announced that the Lynch nomination will get a vote,\\" McConnell's Deputy Chief of Staff Don Stewart told CNN. \\"Members are continuing to work to find a way to overcome the Democrats' filibuster of a bipartisan bill that will help prevent women and children from being sold into sex slavery. Once that bill's complete, the Lynch nomination is next.\\" RELATED: Jeb Bush says Loretta Lynch deserves a vote Both Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate maintain they are working towards a resolution on the sex-trafficking bill.

RELATED: Senators narrowing in on deal that paves the way for Lynch vote But for all the optimism, the Senate wrapped up its business for the week Thursday without tackling Lynch's nomination. Some Republicans in the House have defended the delay. Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, a member of the Republican Study Committee, said that while he believes Lynch will eventually get a vote, the vetting process must be as thorough as possible. \\"I certainly think they ought to have a right to actually examine her positions, her views.

What is the answer?","output":"Nits, Blondels, Skots, Lamberts, and Footlamberts are various units of luminance used to describe the perceived brightness of light emitted, transmitted, or reflected by a surface. Luminance refers to the intensity of light per unit area of a surface in a specific direction. These units are employed in various fields such as photography, optics, lighting design, and display technology. Let's take a closer look at each unit to better understand their applications and conversions: 1. Nit: A Nit (also known as candela per square meter, or cd/m²) is a standard unit to describe the luminance of a surface and is part of the International System of Units (SI). One Nit represents a luminance value of one candela per square meter. It's a widely used unit to measure the brightness of TV screens, monitors, and any other flat panel displays. 2. Blondel: The Blondel (also known as the millilambert or mL) is another unit of luminance, where 1 millilambert represents 1/1000 of a lambert. The Blondel can be converted to Nits using the following relationship: 1 Blondel equals 3.18309 Nits (i.e., 1 Nit equals 0.31416 Blondels). Since it is a non-SI unit, it is rarely used today, but can still be found in some older texts and materials. 3. Skot: The Skot is a supplementary unit of luminance derived from the photometric system, which represents the brightness of a surface as perceived by the human eye. It is defined as 1/10,000 (0.0001) cd/m² or 0.0001 Nits. The Skot is often used to measure the brightness of a surface under extremely low light levels, such as in dimly lit spaces or at nighttime. 4. Lambert: The Lambert (L) is a unit of luminance named after the French physicist Johann Heinrich Lambert. One Lambert represents the luminance of a perfectly diffusing surface that uniformly emits light at a rate of 1/π (approximately 0.31831) candelas per square centimeter. To convert Lamberts to Nits, use the following equation: 1 Lambert = 3,183.099 Nits (1 Nit = 0.00031416 Lamberts). While not an SI unit, it played a significant role in photometry until being largely replaced by the Nit. 5. Footlambert (fL): The Footlambert is a non-SI unit of luminance used primarily in the United States. One Footlambert is equal to the luminance of a perfectly diffusing surface that emits light at a rate of 1/π (approximately 0.31831) candelas per square foot. To convert Footlamberts to Nits, use the equation: 1 Footlambert = 3.4262591 Nits (1 Nit = 0.2919 fL). The Footlambert is commonly used in the film industry to calibrate projector screens and in the design of commercial lighting fixtures. In summary, Nits, Blondels, Skots, Lamberts, and Footlamberts are all measures of luminance used to express the perceived brightness of light emitted, transmitted, or reflected by a surface. Though some of these units are not part of the SI system and have become less common over time, they still hold significance in certain contexts and industries. Understanding the relationships between these units is essential for accurate luminance calculations and conversions."},{"instruction":"Teacher:This task is about translating a given Spanish language sentence to English.

A set number of times A:","output":"Based on the information provided, I would choose the option (viii). A set number of times. Justification: The teacher's first hint suggests that \\"cells are programmed to divide only a set number of times\\". This means that cells can not divide as many times as they like or infinite numbers of time, ruling out options (i) and (iv). The teacher's second hint states \\"parts means something has been divided\\". This gives no direct answer, but further helps to conclude cells indeed go through division hence eliminating the option (iii) which means \\"No times\\". Options (ii), (v), (vi) and (vii) seem irrelevant to the given context as they mention about damage, day, heat, and temperature, respectively, none of which connect to the cell division process. So, by the process of elimination and based on the provided hints, we can conclude that the best answer would be (viii).

Combine like terms on the right-hand side of the equation: 0 = (-3*p + 11*p) + 8 The sum of -3*p and 11*p is: -3*p + 11*p = 8*p So, the simplified equation is: 0 = 8*p + 8 Step 2: Isolate the variable p. To do this, we will move the constant term (+8) from the right side of the equation to the left side by subtracting 8 from both sides: 0 - 8 = 8*p + 8 - 8 -8 = 8*p Step 3: Solve for p. Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate p: -8/8 = 8*p/8 -1 = p So, the value of p that satisfies the equation 0 = -3*p + 11*p + 8 is p = -1."},{"instruction":"Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Their families meet at the engagement party where Natasha learns that Kabir is planning a three-week bachelor road trip to Spain with his school friends Imran (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Kabir explains that the three have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip, each of them will have to pick an adventure sport which all three will try together. Initially, Arjun is reluctant to take trip as he does not want to lose his pay for missing work. It is later revealed that Arjun's former girlfriend left him due to his workaholism and his obsession with money. Imran has an additional personal agenda on the trip, to find his biological father Salman Habib (Naseeruddin Shah), an artist in Spain. They fly to Spain separately, where they plan to visit Costa Brava, Seville, and Pamplona. On the way to Costa Brava, Imran and Kabir find it annoying that Arjun works even during the trip. Imran nonchalantly throws Arjun's mobile phone out of their car while he is in the middle of an official call. This leads to a heated argument. Arjun, in a fit of rage, accuses Imran of having an affair, four years prior, with Arjun's previous girlfriend Sonali (a topic which was very sensitive both to Arjun and Imraan). After being pacified by Kabir and reaching their destination, they meet an Anglo Indian named Laila (Katrina Kaif) on a beach. Imran flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. Kabir reveals that he has chosen deep sea diving as their first sport, and they later find that Laila is their diving instructor. Arjun, who cannot swim and is aquaphobic, receives assistance from Laila. She helps him overcome his fears and finish the sport successfully. Upon a request by Laila, they attend the La Tomatina festival with her in BuÃ±ol and meet Nuria (Ariadna Cabrol), who falls in love with Imraan.

In the opening sequence she patrols the Los Angeles streets and stumbles into an old flame, who introduces Claire to his wife and ill-behaved daughter. Reeling from the chance encounter, she steps out onto the street and is hit by a passing vehicle. Returning to work three weeks later, Claire attracts the attention of another parking attendant, an extremely blunt and aggressive man named Jay whose home life consists mainly of entertaining himself using the services of a webcam porn site and phone service. Claire witnesses him fighting with her best friend, a neighbor working for a delivery service who parks on the curb to unload her consignment, but does not bring it up with either party. She develops a crush on Jay, but in each conversation Jay takes issue with some entirely innocuous comment Claire has made and storms off in disgust. Nonetheless, he keeps coming back for more. One night as Claire prepares to join him at the annual office Christmas party, she finds her mother slumped overâdeadâin a bowl of mashed potato. In shock, she simply picks up her coat and leaves for the party. She sits alone, watching Jay dance with another woman, until finally Jay asks in brutal terms what is the matter.

They had no idea who she was, but she liked to think that they could sense her strength and that it intimidated them. Not enough to stop them from staring openly at her chest of course, but what did she expect? They were still men. Duval Street, Key West's main tourist drag, buzzed with early evening activity. The sun had set less than an hour ago, and the throngs moving up from the nightly sunset ritual in Mallory Square now wandered about, trying to choose between the dozens of bars and restaurants vying for their attention.

Of this latter sort I have seen sixty on the shore in a flock together. The sea fowls are malls of all kinds—coulterneb, guillemot, sea cormorant, &c. The natives observe that the latter, if perfectly black, makes no good broth, nor is its flesh worth eating; but that a cormorant, which hath any white feathers or down, makes good broth, and the flesh of it is good food; and the broth is usually drunk by nurses to increase their milk. Similarly, Samuel Johnson noted that: At the tables where a stranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy is wanting. A tract of land so thinly inhabited, must have much wild-fowl; and I scarcely remember to have seen a dinner without them. The moor-game is every where to be had.

The Rashtrakutas contributed much to the architectural heritage of the Deccan. Art historian Adam Hardy categorizes their building activity into three schools: Ellora, around Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal, and at Sirval near Gulbarga. The Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, areas also occupied by Jain monks, located in present-day Maharashtra. The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the 6th century whose structural details show Pandyan influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods.The Rashtrakutas renovated these Buddhist caves and re-dedicated the rock-cut shrines. Amoghavarsha I espoused Jainism and there are five Jain cave temples at Ellora ascribed to his period. The most extensive and sumptuous of the Rashtrakuta works at Ellora is their creation of the monolithic Kailasanath Temple, a splendid achievement confirming the \\"Balhara\\" status as \\"one among the four principal Kings of the world\\". The walls of the temple have marvellous sculptures from Hindu mythology including Ravana, Shiva and Parvathi while the ceilings have paintings. The Kailasanath Temple project was commissioned by King Krishna I after the Rashtrakuta rule had spread into South India from the Deccan. The architectural style used is Karnata Dravida according to Adam Hardy. It does not contain any of the Shikharas common to the Nagara style and was built on the same lines as the Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka. According to art historian Vincent Smith, the achievement at the Kailasanath temple is considered an architectural consummation of the monolithic rock-cut temple and deserves to be considered one of the wonders of the world.

As shown in Figure below , the mucous membrane lining the jejunum is covered with millions of microscopic, fingerlike projections called villi (singular, villus). Villi contain many capillaries, and nutrients pass from the villi into the bloodstream through the capillaries. Because there are so many villi, they greatly increase the surface area for absorption. In fact, they make the inner surface of the small intestine as large as a tennis court!

Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who has more surface area available for absorption of nutrients? The answer is:","output":"Robert has more surface area available for absorption of nutrients. This is because, as described in the background article, the jejunum is the second part of the small intestine and is responsible for most nutrient absorption into the blood. The mucous membrane lining the jejunum is covered with millions of microscopic, fingerlike projections called villi (singular, villus). Villi are essential for nutrient absorption because they contain numerous capillaries, which allow nutrients to pass from the villi into the bloodstream.

Based on the new situation with Robert and John, the doctor discovered that Robert has more villi covering his jejunum compared to John. Since villi are responsible for increasing the surface area for nutrient absorption, having more villi means that Robert has a greater surface area available for absorption than John. This difference in villi covering may have implications on the health and digestive efficiency of Robert and John; it is important for them to consult with their doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment of their stomach problems. However, it is clear that in terms of surface area for nutrient absorption, Robert has more available than John due to the higher number of villi in his jejunum."},{"instruction":"Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"where to stay in south rim grand canyon?\\"","output":"There are several great options to consider when choosing where to stay in the South Rim of the Grand Canyon for enjoying its scenic beauty, accessibility to popular trails and viewpoints, and various amenities to enhance your stay. Here is a detailed and long answer, elaborating on some of the top options: 1. Grand Canyon Village: Grand Canyon Village is the most popular place to stay in the South Rim, offering a range of options suitable for different budgets and preferences. Key accommodations in the village include: a. El Tovar Hotel: A historic and upscale hotel, El Tovar offers stunning views of the canyon, comfortable rooms, fine dining, and exceptional service. It is an excellent choice for those seeking luxury and a classic Grand Canyon experience. b. Bright Angel Lodge: A more budget-friendly option, Bright Angel Lodge is situated on the Rim Trail and offers rustic charm through cabin-style accommodations. The lodge also has a restaurant, lounge, ice cream shop, and gift store. c. Kachina and Thunderbird Lodges: Ideally located between El Tovar and Bright Angel Lodge, these two lodges cater to families and modern travelers, offering contemporary rooms with spectacular canyon views and easy access to nearby trails. d. Maswik Lodge: Set amidst Ponderosa pine forest, Maswik Lodge provides guests with a nature-filled experience. It features a cafeteria, sports bar, and gift shop, and is just a short walk from the canyon's edge. 2. Yavapai Lodge: Yavapai Lodge is another popular option in the South Rim, located about a mile away from Grand Canyon Village. The lodge consists of Yavapai West and Yavapai East, offering a mix of modern and traditional rooms. Amenities include a cafeteria, general store, cafe, and shuttle bus access, making it an ideal base for those looking to explore the national park. 3. Trailer Village RV Park: For RV travelers, Trailer Village RV Park offers pull-through and back-in sites with full hookups, including electricity, water, and sewer. The park is located within Grand Canyon Village and provides easy access to hiking trails, restaurants, and other amenities. A nearby shuttle stop ensures that visitors can easily reach popular viewpoints and attractions across the South Rim. 4. Mather Campground: For a more rustic experience, consider staying at Mather Campground, which offers tent and RV sites without hookups. Amenities at the campground include coin-operated showers, restrooms, picnic tables, and fire pits. Mather Campground provides an opportunity to connect with nature and enjoy the tranquil environment of the South Rim. 5. Phantom Ranch: Phantom Ranch, at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, is accessible only via hiking, mule ride, or rafting trip, making it a unique and more adventurous choice. The ranch features dormitories and cabins, and provides bedding, meals, and basic amenities. Prior reservations are essential, and due to its remote location, visitors should be prepared for the physical demands of reaching the ranch. 6. Nearby towns: If you're unable to secure accommodation within the Grand Canyon National Park or prefer staying in a nearby town, Tusayan and Williams are excellent alternatives, located 7 miles and 60 miles away from the park, respectively. These towns offer various hotels, motels, dining options, and other services for tourists. In summary, the best place for you to stay in the South Rim of the Grand Canyon depends on your budget, preferred accommodation style, and desired proximity to the canyon itself. Options range from luxury lodges and hotels to RV parks and campgrounds, ensuring that all travelers can find a suitable place to enhance their Grand Canyon experience."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

Uruguay's president has accused six former Guantanamo Bay inmates of lacking a work ethic and being 'middle class' for refusing to get jobs since arriving in the South American country three months ago. President Jose Mujica has appeared to criticise the men, who were locked up for more than 12 years in the American detainment camp in Cuba, saying they lacked a work ethic. But the men are equally disappointed with their new lives - with one telling the press they had simply swapped one prison for another. The men arrived in Montevideo in December, after Mujica said his country would take them in and help them get resettled. The six, who were detained as suspected militants with ties to al-Qaeda in 2002 but were never charged, were cleared for release in 2009. But they were stuck in Guantanamo for the next five years because they could not be sent home - and no one wanted them, until Uruguay stepped into the breach. It offered them a residential facility to study Spanish, learn about Uruguayan culture and integrate to their new home - which has about 300 Muslim residents out of a total population of 3.3million. A labour union was drafted in to help find the men work, but it has since said the men have turned down jobs they have been offered. Local newspapers reported they were supposed to start work this month in the construction industry. Refused: The six men have so far turned down the jobs which have been offered to them. Pictured: Adel bin Muhammad El Ouerghi from Tunisia, Syrians Ali Husain Shaaban, Abedlhadi Omar Faraj and Ahmed Adnan, and Palestinian Mohammed Abdullah Taha Mattan at their home in Montevideo. Mujica has since taken matters into his own hands, visiting the home of five of the six men to encourage them to take work. But he returned from his visit despondent. On his radio programme he said the former detainees are far from the ancestors of Uruguayans, who he described as gritty, hard-working immigrants. 'If these people were humble people of the desert, poor people, they'd surely be stronger and more primitive, but they're not,' Mujica said of the former prisoners. 'Through their hands, features and family histories, it seems to me that they're middle class.' His comments have not been universally welcomed. Senator Ope Pasquet, of the Colorado Party, defended the men Wednesday, tweeting: 'The Guantanamo six were jailed for more than 10 years in dreadful conditions. 'The psychological damage must be terrible. Making them work now? Premature.' His comments about their state of health appear to be backed up by lawyers working for the six men. Cori Crider, of Reprieve UK, told the Buenos Aires Herald last month: 'My client [Abu Wa'el Dhiab] has lost ability to walk after 13 years in Guantánamo. But he is now not just in wheelchair, he is able to walk with crutches.' Unable: Cori Crider, of Reprieve UK, told the Buenos Aires Herald last month her client Abu Wa'el Dhiab lost the ability to walk during his incarceration - but had managed to start using crutches. Cleared: The men were detained in Guantanamo from 2002, but charges were dropped in 2009. Trapped: But one former inmate has said his new life in Uruguay is simply swapping one prison for another. However, Dhiab - a Syrian who cannot return to his country because of the ongoing violence - has also complained about his new home. He recently said the men have 'walked out of a prison to enter another one'. In a TV interview, Dhiab expressed thanks to Uruguay, but said it needs a plan for helping the ex-detainees, who need 'their families, a home, a job and some sort of income that allows them to build a future'. While at Guantanamo, Dhiab was at the center of a legal battle in U.S. courts over the military's use of force-feeding. When he arrived in Uruguay, he was reportedly weak as a result of repeated hunger strikes. In recent videos, Dhiab appears thin but not overly so. Since January 2002, when the Guantanamo detention center opened, about 620 prisoners have been released or transferred, with the vast majority making no public statements or appearances.","output":"The president of Uruguay, Jose Mujica, visited six former prisoners from Guantanamo Bay who had been taken in by his country. He thought they were acting like people who didn't want to work. They had been given jobs, but they didn't want to take them. They had been in Guantanamo Bay for 12 years, but were allowed to leave in 2009 as they weren't charged with anything. When they got to Uruguay, they were supposed to study Spanish, learn about the culture, and start to feel at home. They were also helped to find work. But they didn't want the jobs they were offered. One of them even said living in Uruguay was like being in another prison. They have even said they want to have their families with them, a home of their own, and a steady job to earn money for the future."},{"instruction":"Question: Pick one category for the following text.

Article: We're so well educated - but we're useless students who have lost the ability to do anything practical. The only thing we've mastered is consumption . Large numbers of students have entered higher education in the past 10 years, but despite being the most educated generation in history, it seems that we've grown increasingly ignorant when it comes to basic life skills. Looking back on my first couple of weeks of living in student halls, I consider myself lucky to still be alive. Unfamiliar to fresher's, there are many hidden dangers in the dirty corners of students accommodation. I have survived a couple of serious boiling egg incidents and lots of cases of food - poisoning, probably from dirty kitchen counters. Although some of my clothes have fallen victim to ironing experimentation, I think I have now finally acquired all the domestic skills I missed out in my modem education. In 2006 and 2010, the charming educationist Sir Ken Robinson gave two very amusing talks in which he discussed the importance of creativity in education. Robinson's main viewpoint is that our current education system dislocates people from their natural talents. I would like to go a step further and propose that besides our talents, the system takes away what used to be passed from generation to generation - a working knowledge of basic life skills. Today's graduates may have earned themselves honor in history, law or economies, but when it comes to simple things like putting up a shelf to hold all their academic books, or fixing a hole in their on - trend clothes, they have to call for help from a professional handyman or tailor. Since the invention of the internet, it has never been easier for people to access information, but our highly specialized education has made us more one - sided than ever.

Louise Eccles and Keith Gladdis In Mombasa, Kenya. PUBLISHED:. 17:08 EST, 26 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 05:11 EST, 27 May 2013. Anti-terror police in Kenya have accused the British of ignoring their warnings that Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo was a dangerous radical. Adebolajo was arrested in Kenya in 2010 on suspicion of leading a jihadist plot to cross the border into lawless Somalia and join the ranks of the Al Shabaab terrorist group. But the Kenyans claim that when they presented their evidence to the British Embassy, it was insisted Adebolajo had no criminal record. Scroll down for video. Michael Adebolajo in a Kenyan court in 2010 with five other men after he attempted to cross the border. Adebolajo (centre in black top) was sent back to Britain after claiming he had been tortured in Kenya. Sources in Kenya also claim the. British Embassy put them under pressure to release Adebolajo after he. complained he had been tortured, starved for two days and denied access. to a lawyer. And another Kenyan source yesterday claimed the British failed to help them build a case against Adebolajo. Adebolajo was detained for several days before being deported to the UK. It came as Adebolajo’s family claimed harassment by MI5 in the months before the attack may have ‘pushed him over the edge’. On his return to the UK from Kenya,. family members claim he was ‘pestered’ by MI5 agents who tried to. recruit him as an informant and infiltrate Islamic extremist groups. Adebolajo’s brother-in-law Abu Zuybyr. claimed the intelligence services put Adebolajo under pressure to spy on. Muslim clerics and become an informer. Mr Zuybyr, who is married to. Adebolajo’s sister Christiana, said: ‘That is what [Adebolajo’s] family. is saying: that the secret service pushed him over the edge.’ He said Adebolajo was ‘elated’ following the birth of his child, but ‘then things became a little strange’. The family of Adebolajo, pictured during a 2007 march in London, said he was harassed by MI5 in the months before the attack. Speaking to The Independent on Sunday, Mr Zuybyr said Adebolajo went to Nairobi in 2010 to study Arabic and Islam. Following his return to England, Mr Zuybyr said authorities repeatedly questioned family members about Adebolajo. His elder brother, Jeremiah, who had. gone to Saudi Arabia to teach English, was arrested and quizzed. And Mr. Zuybyr said he was questioned at gunpoint when he visited Yemen four. years ago to learn Arabic with his wife. He said: ‘When I came back to Britain,. MI5 contacted me and showed significant interest in Michael. I was. harassed for a while, with constant calls from people claiming to be. from the FBI.’ In Kenya, Adebolajo was seized with. five others after travelling by speedboat to an island off the coast. near Lamu Island, 68 miles from the Somali border. A married couple who owned a guest house where they had been staying and a worker were also arrested. The Kenyans believed Adebolajo, 28,. had played a crucial role in recruiting his co-accused, including two. secondary school-aged boys, after they were radicalised during weekly. visits to a mosque in Mombasa. It is believed the Kenyan cleric Sheikh Aboud Rogo – who was killed by gunmen in Mombasa last year – had helped to fund the men. Adebolajo was eventually deported without charge but the Kenyans insist they warned the British that he was dangerous. Mombasa’s anti-terrorist police chief Elijah Rop said: ‘We advised the British police about the man but they ignored us. ‘That is the man we deported to the UK. in 2010 after discovering he is among Islamic radicals who were. recruited to train as Al Shabaab in Somalia three years ago.’ A man identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28,. brandishes a meat cleaver with bloodied hands near the scene of the. killing. It was claimed that MI5 offered Adebolajo a job six. months ago. Adebolajo, right, is pictured at an English Defence League march in 2009. Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, with a knife in his hand at the scene where Lee Rigby was stabbed to death. At the. time of Adebolajo’s arrest, the security services were aware of the risk. that radicalised British Muslims were heading to Somalia to join with. Al Shabaab, which has links to Al Qaeda. Only two months before, the then-head. of MI5 Jonathan Evans had warned Britons were training in Somalia and it. was ‘only a matter of time before we see terrorism on our streets. inspired by those who are today fighting alongside Al Shabaab’. It is now accepted that Al Qaeda cells in Mombasa were at their peak around 2010. Samantha Lewthwaite, the fugitive. ‘white widow’ of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay is still on the run over. her role in a suspected plot to bomb western hotels in the city. However the security forces appear to. have been relaxed that Adebolajo – who was travelling under the name of. Michael Olemindis Ndemolajo – may have been prepared to train and fight. with the brutal Al Shabaab. Kenyan government spokesman Muthui. Kariuki said: ‘We handed him to British security agents in Kenya and he. seems to have found his way to London and mutated to Michael Adebolajo. The Kenyan government cannot be held responsible for what happened to. him after we handed him to British authorities.’ Father Lee Rigby was killed in the attack on Woolwich last week. Father of one and soldier Rigby, of Greater Manchester, pictured relaxing on Army leave. After their arrest Adebolajo and the. eight co-accused were taken to Mombasa and spent a number of days in. prison before appearing before a magistrate. Kenyan detectives suspected Adebolajo. may have been a ringleader because he was most vocal in court and. appeared to know how to ‘play the system’. In court he claimed: ‘We are being tortured by police and we haven’t eaten for two days now. ‘We have been denied the right to talk. to our family members and lawyer. We are being treated as criminals and. we are innocent.’ The court told police it had three. days to build a case but after the clean bill of health from the British. embassy Adebolajo was deported. Another Kenyan source yesterday. accused the British of failing to help them build a case against. Adebolajo. He said: ‘It was a major anti-terror investigation and we. were given three days by the courts to build up a case.’ Last night the Foreign Office. confirmed Adebolajo had been arrested in 2010 and it gave consular. assistance ‘as normal’ in the circumstances. A Foreign Office statement said: ‘We. can confirm a British national was arrested in Kenya in 2010. The. Foreign and Commonwealth Office provided consular assistance as normal. for British nationals.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.

I appreciate that they close at 1130p. Located in Chinatown above Tea Station and next to Ichiza. Personally, I always get the almond cookie crisps, the chocolate/green tea/ or pistachio almond cookies, the honey cake, and their cream puffs. Their best item hands down, has got to be the almond cookie crisps. Don't pass on it. Prices are from 2.50 and up. Tried a latte from here once and it was alright. Also tried their mochi bread which was too heavy for my liking and their macarons. Macarons were meh. Place is \\"cute.\\" Very Korean drama like. It is small but it has a cozy feel.

His experience in addressing diverse audiences enabled him to tailor his communication style to suit various groups, making it easier for listeners to understand and engage with his message. From the beginning, Neil focused on developing his emotional intelligence and empathy, which were crucial in connecting with his audience on a deeper level. By understanding their perspective and being in tune with their emotions, he could deliver his speeches with the perfect combination of sophistication and simplicity. His ability to build rapport with his listeners ensured that even the most challenging topics were accessible and relatable for everyone in the room. Moreover, Neil was exceptionally skilled in using strategic storytelling and effective analogies to clarify complex ideas, helping his audience to visualize concepts more easily and commit them to memory. By weaving personal anecdotes, relevant examples, and vivid imagery into his speeches, he not only made his presentations more relatable but also managed to keep the audience's attention focused on him. In contrast, Lawrence often struggled with maintaining his composure during public speaking engagements. He was more likely to be apprehensive and hesitant, which was readily apparent to the audience. Unlike Neil, Lawrence had not invested as much time and effort into mastering his public speaking skills, which meant that he often failed to convey his ideas smoothly and convincingly. Additionally, Lawrence's lack of audience awareness was a significant hindrance in his speaking ability. He consistently fell short in recognizing the audience's needs and expectations, leading to presentations that were less engaging and impactful. His inability to adapt his tone and style to suit different demographic groups made it harder for people to connect with his message. Furthermore, Lawrence's speeches often suffered from a lack of structure and coherence, making them difficult to follow. His tendency to jump from one idea to another without logical transitions left his listeners disoriented and unable to retain the key points of his discourse. On the other hand, Neil's well-organized and seamless speeches allowed his audience to grasp the essential components of his presentations with ease. Lastly, Neil exhibited a strong command over body language and non-verbal cues, which played a pivotal role in enhancing his stage presence. His confident posture, steady eye contact, and animated facial expressions conveyed assertiveness and credibility, thus giving his presentations a persuasive edge. On the whole, Neil's dedication to perfecting his public speaking skills, his commendable ability to connect with and captivate his audience, and the clarity and organization of his speeches made him a significantly better public speaker than Lawrence."},{"instruction":"What is the best way to: how to season squash Choose your answer from: a). with a bit of sugar to bring out natural sweetness. b). with a bit of banana and avocado to bring out natural sweetness. Answer:","output":"Answer: a). with a bit of sugar to bring out natural sweetness. Seasoning squash with a bit of sugar is the best way to bring out its natural sweetness, enhancing its flavor and making it more enjoyable to eat. Squash, whether it's a summer or winter variety, can have a subtle sweetness that marries well with other flavors, making it a versatile ingredient in multiple dishes. When seasoning squash with sugar, you can also add a combination of spices and herbs for a harmonious mix of flavors. Here is a detailed method on how to season squash using sugar and other ingredients: 1. Choose the right squash: Select a fresh, ripe squash for the best results. For summer squash varieties like zucchini or yellow squash, look for firm skin with no blemishes. For winter squash varieties like butternut or acorn squash, choose one with a hard skin and without soft spots. 2. Prepare the squash: Wash and dry the squash. Depending on the variety and your desired preparation method, you can then peel, slice, or cut the squash into desired shapes or pieces. For some winter squashes, roasting them before peeling and slicing is an easier method. 3. Add sugar: Sprinkle a small amount of sugar over the squash. The amount will vary depending on the size of your squash and your personal taste preferences, but you can start with 1-2 teaspoons for a medium-sized squash. You can use white, brown, or even coconut sugar, depending on your desired flavor profile. 4. Incorporate spices and herbs: To bring out the best flavors in your squash, add a mix of spices and herbs. Some common pairings include: - Cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger for a warm, spicy flavor that works well with winter squash varieties. - Basil, thyme, or oregano for a more savory, herbal touch for summer squash varieties. - Paprika, cayenne, or chili powder for a bit of heat. 5. Season with salt and pepper: Don't forget to add salt and pepper to taste. This will not only enhance the natural flavor of the squash but also help balance the sweetness from the sugar. 6. Cook the squash: Depending on your chosen cooking method, proceed to cook the squash. Some popular options include roasting in the oven, sautéing in a pan on the stovetop, or grilling on a barbecue. When cooking, be sure to turn the squash occasionally to ensure even cooking and caramelization of the sugar. 7. Taste and adjust seasonings: Once cooked, taste the squash and adjust seasonings as necessary. You may want to add more sugar, salt, pepper, or spices to achieve the perfect flavor balance. By seasoning your squash with sugar and a mix of complementary spices and herbs, you can enhance its natural sweetness and create a delicious dish enjoyed by all."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Gorbachev also radically expanded the scope of Glasnost, stating that no subject was off-limits for open discussion in the media.

Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Is this ritual more of an indication that they relate to the church or to their deity?\\" in relation to the baptism practices of Jehovah's Witnesses can be found by examining the key aspects of the ritual and its significance within their belief system. Firstly, baptism is a requirement for being considered a member of Jehovah's Witnesses and is regarded as a crucial step in one's journey as a believer. This already establishes a strong connection between the ritual and the church as an organization. Jehovah's Witnesses do not practice infant baptism and do not recognize baptisms performed by other denominations, which implies that their own baptism process is unique and integral to their faith. Individuals undergoing baptism must publicly affirm that dedication and baptism identify them \\"as one of Jehovah's Witnesses in association with God's spirit-directed organization.\\" This statement highlights the connection between the baptism ritual, the individual's commitment to their deity (Jehovah), and their association with the church organization. However, Witness publications emphasize that baptism symbolizes personal dedication to God and not \\"to a man, work or organization.\\" This clarification suggests that even though the baptism ritual is tied to the church organization, its primary purpose is to symbolize the individual's dedication to Jehovah. The literature also stresses the importance of being obedient and loyal to Jehovah and to \\"his organization,\\" acknowledging the intertwined relationship between the individual's commitment to their deity and to the church itself. In conclusion, the baptism ritual practiced by Jehovah's Witnesses is an indication of both their relationship with the church and their deity, Jehovah. While the ritual has organizational elements, such as being a requirement for membership and needing to be performed in accordance with the church's specific guidelines, its ultimate purpose is to symbolize the individual's dedication to Jehovah. Therefore, it can be said that the ritual signifies a dual connection to both the church and the deity in the context of Jehovah's Witnesses' beliefs and practices."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Arabic.

When I installed gas heat I included a humidifier on the hot air furnace. Now the unit leaks water on the basement floor. The installers adjusted filters or something without success. How can I stop the leaks? A. Turn it off. These units have a drain that is supposed to drain condensate water, and often, it seems, they don’t work very well. I had one and it also leaked, so I shut it off. You can do the same. If you feel you really need humidity, install a console model on the first floor. Since humid air rises, the one console should work for both floors. They are easily adjusted and cleaned. Q. I dropped a nice dessert dish into an equally nice coffee mug, and they stuck fast. I can wiggle them, but they won’t separate. Can I do something about it? A. Spray WD-40 where they touch. Still no luck? Put boiling water into a large, separate bowl. Put the coffee mug into the hot water, then put a bunch of crushed ice cubes in the dessert dish. The cold dish will shrink and the hot mug will expand, and, voila: Separation! Q. My first-floor bathroom fan light works well enough when it’s on, but when it shuts off in winter, it creates a big back draft. How can I prevent that draft when it’s off? A. You mentioned that you put a lead fishing weight on the flapping lid of another fan. Do the same with your fan light. You will have to experiment to reach a point of opening for power and closing properly when closed. Q. I’ve moved back into my childhood home. It has oil heat with baseboard radiators. I can remember my Dad “bleeding” the radiators when I was a kid. Is this something that needs to be done? If so, is there somewhere I can go to read about how it is done? Again, if so, how often should this be done? A. Sounds similar to my childhood home in Michigan, but mine goes back maybe further than yours, and I never saw my father bleed the radiators, let alone show me how. It was a gravity system, and maybe that’s why. So call your oil dealer and ask him the same questions. He knows the answers. Q. John Deegan wrote Dec. 8 regarding adding insulation to his attic. He wants to remove his old insulation and have “TAP insulation installed to a minimum of 14 inches to bring the attic to R-49. For an additional 600 he could have more insulation added to bring it to R-60.” You advised him to go ahead, as he has oil heat. I simply do not understand the question or reply. What is TAP insulation? What does he mean by 14 inches, R-49, and R-60? I own an antique Colonial home. I have a large unfinished attic, and I also have oil heat and very high heating bills. I believe there is little or no insulation in my attic. I had an energy audit two years ago. At the time, I was interested in learning where I could add insulation to reduce my heating bills. The man who performed the audit told me that my walls are not insulated, but he would not recommend adding insulation to the walls without first having an electrician replace the electrical wiring. He said nothing about insulating the attic. Although I am not planning on replacing wiring or insulating my walls at this time, I would be interested in adding insulation to the attic if it would reduce my heating bills. What would you advise? A. TAP insulation is just another insulation such as cellulose or fiberglass. Fourteen inches is simply the thickness of the insulation, and the R-49 and R-60 refer to how well the insulation resists the passage of heat from inside to outside. The man was talking telephone numbers (how great I am!) to confuse you. His advice not to insulate until an electrician removed wiring was also talking telephone numbers because he neglected to say what kind of wiring. If it is BX (steel clad), or Romex (cloth or plastic clad), it is OK to insulate in the walls and attic floor. If it is knob and tube (cloth-covered wires exposed), you cannot put in the insulation. Since this man confused you, fire him and call Anderson Insulation in Abington, who will tell you in plain English what you can and cannot do. If he is too far away to help, he can find a competent insulator.

The primary components include water (H2O), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), and traces of other salts, as well as organic compounds like lactic acid (C3H6O3) and urea (CH4N2O). However, it is essential to note that perspiration is a mixture, not a chemical reaction, and so it does not have a chemical equation. Instead, it contains various elements and compounds released through sweat glands onto the skin's surface to help regulate body temperature. Urine, on the other hand, is a waste product formed in the kidneys as a result of various metabolic processes within the body, principally to remove excess water, salts, and other compounds. The primary components include water (H2O), urea (CH4N2O), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), creatinine (C4H7N3O), and traces of other substances such as hormones and metabolites. Like perspiration, urine is a mixture and not a chemical reaction - therefore, it does not have a chemical equation. Instead, it contains various compounds excreted by the kidneys and stored in the bladder before being released from the body.

Answer:","output":"When evaluating whether the right answer to the question \\"what helps an animal move through a river better?\\" is \\"scales,\\" considering the fact that a long tail helps an animal navigate through a river, it is important to weigh the benefits of both scales and long tails in the context of river locomotion. Scales do provide some advantages in river environments. They could help protect the animal from external damage, parasites or infections due to a tough outer coating. In some cases, they could help decrease friction between the animal's body and water, allowing for more streamlined motion. Fish would be the most relevant example of a scaled animal that moves efficiently through water. However, the importance of a long tail should not be underestimated. The tail is a critical appendage for many aquatic animals when it comes to navigating through rivers. A long, flexible tail allows animals to maintain balance, steer effectively in different directions, and generate thrust for propulsion. In the context of moving through a river, a tail provides notable advantages. Animals such as beavers, crocodiles, and otters are well-equipped with long tails to maneuver effectively in aquatic environments. Considering the advantages of both characteristics, it seems that the right answer to the question might not necessarily be \\"scales.\\" Although scales provide some benefits for an aquatic animal, the role of a long tail in navigating through rivers appears to be significantly more vital. The tail is a versatile and powerful appendage that enables animals to maintain control of their movement, adapt to various conditions, and maintain a strong sense of direction in river environments. Overall, when directly comparing the importance of scales and long tails for river locomotion, it is more likely that a long tail would be the better answer to the question \\"what helps an animal move through a river better?\\", as tails provide animals with greater control, stability, balance, and maneuverability in aquatic environments."},{"instruction":"Given this review: \\"Thanks I've been keeping a list of anime and manga that I've watched /read since 2012.

There are four bases in baseball - first, second, third and home plate. When a baseball player hits the ball, he must run to each base - in order - and touch it with his foot. It is the only way to get a point. If the player hits the ball and fails to touch all the bases, the point will not be counted. The importance of touching all the bases was shown at the start of the 1974 baseball seasons. Hank Aaron was a player with the Atlanta Braves team. He was trying to find the record for hitting the most home runs . Aaron needed just one home run to be well matched with the record held by Babe Ruth, the greatest hitter in baseball history. Aaron got that home run the very first time he had a chance to hit the ball. That gave him 714 home runs - the same as Babe Ruth. After that day, baseball fans held their breath every time when it was Hank Aaron's turn to hit. When would he hit home run number 715? The wait was not long. In the second week of the season, Aaron again hit the ball over the wall. He had beaten Babe Ruth's record. But first, he had to run around the four bases. The other players on his team watched carefully to make sure he touched each one. So, to touch all bases means to do what is necessary to complete an activity. The expression is used to business and politics. No business deal or political events are really complete until you discuss all the problems involved. Or, as it is said, until you touch all bases. Question: When was the importance of touching all the bases shown? Answer: Options are: [i] At the start of the 1974 baseball seasons. [ii] At the end of the 1974 baseball seasons. [iii] Before the baseball rules made. [iv] In the second week of 1974. A:","output":"The importance of touching all the bases was shown at the start of the 1974 baseball seasons."},{"instruction":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"Where were Bactria, Sogdiana, and Margiana located in modern maps?\\" is in \\"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"Yes, according to the given text, Bactria, Sogdiana, and Margiana were located in most of present-day Afghanistan."},{"instruction":"Given a simple high-school level math question, you are required to solve it and provide the final answer. The final answer is always a single number. These questions can range from a variety of topics like simple arithmetic, solving equations, converting a quantity from one unit to another, finding remainders/GCD/LCM, finding probabilities etc. Each question has only one correct answer. This answer can be a positive or negative integer, a fraction or a decimal number. If the answer is a negative number use the hyphen (e.g. -42) symbol for the minus sign. For decimal numbers, do not add extra zeros after the decimal point. For fractional numbers, separate the numerator and denominator using a forward slash (e.g. 3/25). Q: Let l be ((-26)/(-6))/(1/(-36)). Find the common denominator of 3 + (-2 - l/(-40)) and 1/4. A:","output":"The first step is to evaluate the value of l, which is ((-26)/(-6))/(1/(-36)). ((-26)/(-6)) can be calculated as 26/6 = 4.33 (to 2 decimal places). Then divide this by (1/(-36)), that calculates to -4.33 * -36 = 156. This value is a decimal number and there are no extra zeros after the decimal point, so it satisfies the conditions given. l = 156 Next simplify the expression for which we need a common denominator: 3 + (-2 - l/(-40)) = 3 + (-2 - 156/(-40)) We can simplify further: = 3 + (-2 + 3.9) = approximately 4.9 (to 1 decimal place). Now, we have to find the common denominator of 4.9 and 1/4. Here, since the first number is not a fraction, we simply convert it to a fraction format, which would be 49/10. So, now we need to find the common denominator of 49/10 and 1/4. For this, we can take the least common multiples (LCM) of 10 and 4. The multiples of 10 are: 10, 20, 30, 40, ..... The multiples of 4 are: 4 , 8, 12, 16, 20, ..... The first common multiple of 10 and 4 is 20; therefore, 20 is the least common multiple (LCM).

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.\\"?

For example, Micron's acquisition of Elpida Memory in 2013 significantly boosted its market share and presence in the DRAM segment, potentially contributing to its competitive advantage over Hynix. In conclusion, the primary topic of discussion is the possibility of Micron Technology Inc., a United States-based company, overtaking Korea's Hynix Semiconductor Inc. as the world's second-largest computer memory chipmaker during the third quarter, according to market researcher IDC. This development highlights the highly competitive nature of the global memory chip market and the ongoing race between major players for market share, technological advancements, and overall dominance in the industry. It is crucial to consider various factors that influence such shifts in ranking, as they offer valuable insights into the dynamics of the memory chip market and its potential future outlook."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person that notes the large amount of locales in the opera written by the man who had practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man?, using the article: In the view of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main influences were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.Although when he chose, Massenet could write noisy and dissonant scenes – in 1885 Bernard Shaw called him \\"one of the loudest of modern composers\\" – much of his music is soft and delicate. Hostile critics have seized on this characteristic, but the article on Massenet in the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians observes that in the best of his operas this sensual side \\"is balanced by strong dramatic tension (as in Werther), theatrical action (as in Thérèse), scenic diversion (as in Esclarmonde), or humour (as in Le portrait de Manon).\\"Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly attracted by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists a great number of locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question, \\"What is the last name of the person that notes the large amount of locales in the opera written by the man who had practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man?\\" is Macdonald. Hugh Macdonald is the biographer mentioned in the article who discusses the various locales depicted in the operas composed by Massenet. Massenet, the composer with practical experience in orchestra pits, created numerous operas featuring exotic locales, which Macdonald elaborates upon in his analysis of Massenet's work and influences."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Jordan turned the car to the right to avoid the person on the bike.

Art conservators are looking to see whether the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between – such alterations are called pentimenti when made by the original artist. This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the prime version by the original artist or a copy, and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work.

What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","output":"The first step of the digestive process is the ingestion of food. This begins with the consumption of food and its preparation for digestion within the oral cavity, also known as the mouth. During this initial phase, several key actions occur to initiate the breakdown of food and facilitate its smooth passage through the subsequent stages of the digestive system. 1. Mastication: Also known as chewing, this mechanical action involves the grinding and breaking down of food into smaller particles. The teeth play a crucial role in mastication, with each type of tooth having a specific function. Incisors are responsible for cutting and biting food, canines are used for tearing, and molars and premolars grind and crush the food. 2. Secretion of Saliva: The salivary glands present in the mouth secrete saliva, which is a mixture of water, mucus, enzymes, and electrolytes. Saliva moistens the food and makes it easier to swallow. It also contains the enzyme salivary amylase, which initiates the chemical breakdown of complex carbohydrates, such as starch, into simpler sugars. 3. Bolus formation: The tongue plays a vital role in this process by mixing the chewed food with saliva to form a soft, smooth, and spherical mass called a bolus. The tongue also assists in tasting the food, enabling us to recognize four basic tastes - sweet, sour, salty, and bitter, as well as the more recently discovered umami taste. 4. Swallowing: Lastly, the act of swallowing represents the transition from the first step of the digestive process to the subsequent stages. The process of swallowing involves a coordinated effort between the tongue, which propels the food bolus backward towards the throat, and the muscles of the pharynx and esophagus, which contract and relax in a wave-like manner, a process known as peristalsis. This propels the food bolus down through the esophagus and towards the stomach. In conclusion, the first step of the digestive process involves the ingestion of food, which is then mechanically broken down through mastication and mixed with saliva to create a bolus. Additionally, the initial phase of chemical digestion, particularly of carbohydrates, begins with the secretion of salivary amylase present in saliva. The process is then followed by swallowing, which directs the bolus into the esophagus and subsequently through the remaining stages of digestion."},{"instruction":"Solve this math problem Solve -135*v + 2136 = 105*v + 27*v for v.","output":"Alright, buddy, let's solve this math problem together!

Here are possible answers to this question: - office - bar - barn - industrial area - museum I believe the correct choice is \\"barn\\", here's why:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"barn\\", and here's why: A milking machine is a device used to extract milk from animals, particularly cows and goats. It is designed to ease the process of milking and improve efficiency, especially in large commercial dairy farms. In addition to increasing productivity, milking machines also help maintain hygiene and reduce the risk of contamination. Now let's examine the potential locations listed and why a barn is the most appropriate place for a milking machine: 1. Office: An office is a space where business operations take place, and employees perform administrative tasks. It is unsuitable for housing a milking machine as it is not designed to accommodate farming activities or animals. 2. Bar: A bar is an establishment where alcoholic beverages are served and consumed. It is not an appropriate location for a milking machine because it primarily focuses on providing drinks and socializing opportunities for patrons rather than agricultural activities. 3. Barn: A barn is a structure used to house livestock, store agricultural products, or serve as a workspace for farmers. This makes it the ideal location for a milking machine, as it is designed to accommodate animals, provide suitable conditions for efficient milking, and ease the process of milk collection. 4. Industrial area: Industrial areas are dedicated to housing factories, warehouses, or manufacturing plants where various products are produced or processed. While milking machines are produced in factories, once they are set up, they need to be located near the animals they are designed to milk. As a result, an industrial area is not the best location for a milking machine. 5. Museum: A museum typically houses and displays objects of historical, artistic, or cultural significance. While it is possible that a milking machine might be placed in an agricultural museum for exhibition purposes, it would not be used for its intended purpose as it would not be connected to the live animals being milked. Considering these factors, a barn is the most suitable location for a milking machine as it provides the necessary conditions for housing livestock and facilitates the efficient and hygienic process of milk extraction."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: It is difficult to imagine what life will be like without memory.

When the letters and the honor came knocking on the door of his house in Maidenhead, and the filmmakers came calling, Nicholas Winton always protested that he was no hero. Heroes faced danger; he never had. They put their lives on the line; he had just worked at home in Hampstead, after a day being a stockbroker in the City. They avoided bullets and the secret police; he wrote letters, made telephone calls,and composed lists. The fact that he had rescued 669 children from Czechoslovakia just as the Nazis invaded did not, in his mind, constitute heroism. He hadn't gone out there in 1938 with any burning urge to do good; just for a holiday, in fact. Nor had he gone looking for children to rescue. Instead they and their parents had come to him, as soon as word got round that he might be able to help them leave Prague and get to the West. From 6.00 a.m. the knocks would come at the door of his room in the Europa Hotel, and he would open it to find some shivering, starving, desperate figure.

So he made lists of the children, took their photographs, got them Home Office entry permits, found them foster families and organised their departure on trains, via the Netherlands, to Liverpool Street. After just three weeks in Prague, he went back to Britain and carried on the work from there. The British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia gave him almost no help, so he took sole charge himself. The Home Office was slow with entry permits, so he copied some illegally. In search of foster-parents for the children he put their photos in Picture Post; in the hope of farther havens for them he wrote to governors and senators in America and even to President Roosevelt, to no avail. He could have rescued at least 2,000 more, he said later, if America had been willing to take any. A hero might have got involved in the stress and distress of individual cases.

Although this statement briefly explains the primary purpose of clothing, it is essential to understand all facets of the role clothing plays in providing advantages and improvements to the wearer. Clothing serves multiple purposes in our lives. The most apparent improvement it provides is maintaining a comfortable level of warmth, protection, and support against natural elements such as weather conditions, temperature changes, ultraviolet (UV) rays, and other environmental hazards. Protection from weather conditions: Different types of clothing shield us from various weather conditions, including rain, snow, wind, and heat. The materials used in the construction of our garments, like waterproof and thermal fabrics, help keep us dry, warm, and safe from harsh weather conditions. Temperature regulation: Clothing is essential in maintaining an optimal body temperature, especially during extreme conditions. For instance, during cold temperatures, the layers we wear trap a layer of air that is warmed by our body heat, offering insulation against the cold. In warmer temperatures, lighter fabrics and loose-fitting clothing allow air circulation, facilitating the evaporation of sweat to keep us cool and comfortable. Ultraviolet protection: Clothing acts as a barrier against harmful UV rays emitted by the sun. Some specifically designed fabrics even offer ultraviolet protection factors (UPF) that block or absorb these damaging rays to protect our skin from sunburn, aging, and skin cancer risks. Protecting from physical harm: Apart from weather conditions, clothing offers a layer of protection against injuries caused by accidents, cuts, abrasions, and burns. For example, people who work at construction sites wear protective clothing like helmets, gloves, and steel-toed boots to prevent injuries. Hygiene: Clothing helps maintain good hygiene by acting as a barrier against dirt, dust, and bodily fluids. It also prevents our bodies from spreading or catching contagious germs, bacteria, and viruses, protecting us from diseases and infections. Social and cultural purposes: Clothing also plays a significant role in expressing our individuality, social status, and cultural identity. It helps us adhere to societal norms, professional dress codes and communicates aspects of our personality and affiliations without verbally addressing them. In conclusion, the statement mentioned initially does indeed answer the question by outlining the most apparent function of clothing, which is to improve the wearer's comfort. However, it is essential to realize that the benefits of clothing extend beyond that, offering long-lasting protection, temperature regulation, social expression, and overall well-being."},{"instruction":"Write an email with the subject line \\"PB-KBB - Construction of Cavern #1 (Napoleonville)\\".","output":"Subject: PB-KBB - Construction of Cavern #1 (Napoleonville) Dear [Recipient's Name], I trust you are in great health and high spirits. I am writing to you as part of the PB-KBB project management team to provide an update regarding the construction of Cavern #1 in the Napoleonville Storage Complex. As you may be aware, the PB-KBB project is a joint venture undertaken by Parks&Burton Geological Services and the KBB Underground Technologies Group. The construction of Cavern #1 in Napoleonville, Louisiana, is a strategic part of our ongoing mission to expand underground storage capacities for natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon products. The underground storage complex will offer increased capacity for supply flexibility, enhanced trading opportunities, and improved energy security. Project Progress: The construction of Cavern #1 commenced in April 2022, and since then, significant progress has been made: 1. Excavation has been completed, with a cavern volume of approximately 4 million m³. 2. The cavern's leaching system installation is on track and expected to be commissioned before the end of October 2022. 3. The casing and cementing process of injection and withdrawal wells is well underway, with substantial completion planned for November 2022. 4. Construction of surface infrastructure, including metering stations and control systems, remains in progress, and we anticipate it to reach completion by early December 2022. Health, Safety, and Environmental Measures: Throughout the entire project, the highest priority has been given to the health, safety, and environmental aspects to preserve both our workforce and the surrounding community. Therefore, we have put in place strict adherence to OSHA safety standards, continuous environmental monitoring, and collaboration with local communities to minimize any potential impact. Challenges and Mitigation: Due to the current unprecedented global supply chain disruptions, we have faced a few persistent challenges, including shortages of equipment and materials leading to minor delays in the construction process. To address these difficulties, we have established alternative sourcing strategies and optimized on-site inventory management. As a result, these measures enabled us to minimize the overall impact on the project timeline. Next Steps: In the coming weeks, we will focus on the installation and testing of the brine disposal system, electrical infrastructure, and emergency response equipment. The commencement of cavern integrity tests is scheduled for mid-December 2022, followed by the gradual transition towards operation. To ensure that all our stakeholders are well-informed of the project's progress, further updates and insights on construction milestones will be communicated periodically. Finally, we would like to express our gratitude for your ongoing support and cooperation in this major project. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly. I will be more than happy to provide you with any additional information that you may require.

Goal: To play a VHS tape. Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Pick your answer from: -Insert the tape into the VCR and press fast forward.; -Insert the tape into the VCR and press play.;...I think the answer is","output":"Although both methods technically allow you to play a VHS tape, the more reasonable and efficient method for accomplishing the goal of playing a VHS tape is to insert the tape into the VCR and press play. First, let's briefly analyze both options: 1. Insert the tape into the VCR and press fast forward: This method initially fast forwards through the content of the tape, meaning you will not watch the tape's content in real-time, nor from the beginning. The primary purpose of the fast forward feature is to quickly move to a specific part or segment of the tape that the user wishes to view, not to play the entire tape. If you choose this method, you would have to stop fast-forwarding at a specific point, then press play to actually view the content. This method works, but it is not the most reasonable choice for simply playing a VHS tape. 2. Insert the tape into the VCR and press play: This method ensures that the tape is played from the beginning, assuming the VHS tape's position is reset. By pressing play, the VCR initiates the playback process, and the tape's video and audio content is transmitted to the connected display device, such as a television, for immediate viewing. This is the primary function of the VCR, and this method is the most straightforward and effective way to begin watching a VHS tape from the start. In conclusion, the more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of playing a VHS tape is to insert the tape into the VCR and press play. This approach allows you to view the content of the tape from the beginning, as intended, without the need to navigate to a specific point using fast forward or any other VCR functions."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Carson was feeling sad about his breakup and told Kai he couldn't hang out that day. Given the context: How would Carson feel as a result? A:","output":"Carson would likely feel a mix of emotions as a result of his breakup and decision to not hang out with Kai that day. Here is a detailed analysis of the various emotions Carson might experience: 1. Sadness: Carson is already feeling sad about his breakup, which shows that he was attached to the person he was in a relationship with. This sadness can manifest in various ways, such as feeling down, crying, or a sense of emptiness. 2. Loneliness: Since Carson decided not to hang out with Kai, he might experience a sense of loneliness. Being alone at a time when he is emotionally vulnerable can intensify his feelings of sadness and make coping with the breakup more difficult. 3. Regret: It's possible that Carson may feel regret over his decision to not hang out with Kai. He might later recognize that the support and companionship of a friend could have helped him deal with his emotions more effectively. 4. Guilt: Carson may feel guilty for canceling plans with Kai, especially if they had been looking forward to spending time together. This guilt can add to his emotional burden and could potentially strain his friendship with Kai. 5. Anxiety: Breakups can cause anxiety as people worry about their future without the person they were partnered with. Carson might worry about how he will cope with his new-found single status, whether he will find love again, or if he will be able to maintain his friendships. 6. Loss of self-esteem or confidence: Depending on the circumstances of the breakup, Carson might feel inadequate or question his worth. These feelings can result in lowered self-esteem and a loss of confidence in his ability to form and maintain meaningful relationships. 7. Denial or disbelief: If the breakup was sudden or unexpected, Carson could experience denial or disbelief. He may struggle to accept that the relationship is truly over and fluctuate between hope and despair. 8. Relief: In some cases, ending a relationship can lead to feelings of relief, especially if it was causing significant stress or unhappiness. Carson might experience a sense of liberation from a situation that was no longer fulfilling or healthy. These emotions are not mutually exclusive, and Carson could experience several or all of these feelings at different times or concurrently. As time passes and he begins to heal from the breakup, some of these emotions may fade, while others may evolve or persist for an extended period. Various factors, such as the length of the relationship, the nature of the breakup, his personality, and his support system, can all impact how Carson processes his emotions and navigates this challenging time in his life."},{"instruction":"If you've ever seen this movie, you'd know that it!

The differences were remarkable in terms of overall well-being and health. Which patient had more red blood cells, Dan or Jim? Hint: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.","output":"In terms of the number of red blood cells, Jim, the patient with sickle-cell anemia, may have a similar count or even slightly higher count compared to Dan, the normal patient. However, it is important to note that the main issue in sickle-cell anemia is not related to the number of red blood cells, but rather their functionality and shape. Sickle-cell anemia is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin protein. Hemoglobin is responsible for binding to oxygen and transporting it throughout the body. In patients with sickle-cell anemia, the abnormal hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S, causes red blood cells to become misshapen and crescent or sickle-shaped. These sickle-shaped red blood cells are prone to clumping together and can cause blockages in small blood vessels, restricting blood flow to tissues and organs. As a result, the tissues don't receive an adequate amount of oxygen, leading to various health complications and causing the patient to feel unwell. Furthermore, normal red blood cells have a life span of about 120 days, whereas sickle-shaped red blood cells only last for about 10-20 days before they break apart. This rapid breakdown leads to a shortage of red blood cells, causing a condition called hemolytic anemia in sickle-cell patients. To compensate for this shortage, the bone marrow of these patients may produce more red blood cells, which could sometimes result in a higher red blood cell count. However, even with a higher count, the overall functionality of these cells is severely reduced due to their abnormal shape and the altered hemoglobin protein. In summary, while Jim may have a similar or slightly higher number of red blood cells in comparison to Dan, Jim's overall well-being and health are significantly affected due to the compromised functionality of his red blood cells."},{"instruction":"Given the fact that: Less massive objects also have less gravity than more massive objects.

And if you clicked over to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Web site, you'd see that hackers took him on, too.

One such initiative includes collaborating with member countries to develop advanced cybersecurity strategies and exchanging best practices in a bid to safeguard their online presence. Furthermore, the EU has been working on enhancing public-private partnerships to ensure comprehensive protection for both government and private sector institutions. In light of these embarrassing hacks, the Spanish government has reportedly acted swiftly to rectify the situation, restoring the original images and content on the EU and Ahmadinejad's websites. Spain's Ministry of Industry, which oversees the country's internet infrastructure, has also launched an investigation into the breach, aiming to identify the perpetrators and enforce strict penalties on those responsible. While the hackers' motives may have been to ridicule prominent figures, they inadvertently drew attention to the crucial issue of cybersecurity. As the world continues to evolve digitally, threats to privacy and security are on the rise. It is imperative that governments recognize the significance of investing in comprehensive cybersecurity solutions to protect their citizens and defend their virtual borders.

Named in memory of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated here in 1995, the square is a center for gatherings, events, and protests. The square is surrounded by notable buildings like the Tel Aviv City Hall and the architecturally unique government complex known as \\"The Culture Square.\\" Next, we stroll down Rothschild Boulevard, a tree-lined avenue that features many cafés, restaurants, and shops, as well as some of Tel Aviv's most famous Bauhaus-style buildings.

From the port, we continue to the famous Jaffa Clock Tower, built by the Ottoman Empire in 1903. It's one of several clock towers throughout Israel and serves as a symbol of the city's rich and diverse history.

Q: What is the logarithmic scale that measures the largest jolt of energy released by an earthquake called? A: A:","output":"The logarithmic scale that measures the largest jolt of energy released by an earthquake is called the Richter scale. This scale, developed by Charles F. Richter in 1935, quantifies the magnitude of an earthquake by evaluating the amount of seismic energy released during the event. The scale ranges from 0 to above 9, with each whole number increase on the scale representing a tenfold increase in the amplitude of the seismic waves and approximately 31.6 times more energy released. The Richter scale is based on the logarithm of the amplitude of seismic waves, which are triggered by the sudden movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. By employing logarithms, the Richter scale can account for the vast range of earthquake magnitudes, from minor ones that are barely noticeable to extremely powerful events that can cause widespread destruction. When an earthquake occurs, seismographs at different locations record the ground motion produced by the seismic waves. Data collected by these instruments are used to calculate the magnitude of the earthquake using the Richter scale. An equation derived by Richter himself, the Richter magnitude formula, is used in this calculation. The formula is expressed as M_L = log10(A) - log10(A0), where M_L represents the local magnitude on the Richter scale, A is the maximum amplitude (in millimeters) of the seismic waves recorded on a specific type of seismograph, and A0 is the amplitude at zero magnitude. It is essential to note that the Richter scale is not the only method used to measure the magnitude of earthquakes. There are other scales, such as the moment magnitude scale (Mw) and the surface wave magnitude scale (Ms), which are also used by seismologists to analyze and report earthquake magnitudes. The moment magnitude scale, in particular, is widely used today, as it better accounts for the energy released in large earthquakes and provides more consistent results across different seismic events. In summary, the Richter scale is a logarithmic scale that measures the largest jolt of energy released by an earthquake. It was developed by Charles F. Richter in 1935 and uses a specific equation to calculate the local magnitude of an earthquake based on the amplitude of seismic waves recorded by seismographs. The Richter scale has been and continues to be a fundamental tool in the field of seismology, allowing for the quantification and comparison of earthquake magnitudes across different regions and times."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Remember the Titans Movie plot: It's 1971 in Alexandria, Virginia and successful high school football coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) has just been deprived of the head coaching job at the new integrated T.C. Williams High School to make way for equally successful black coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). Yoast debates pursuing opportunities elsewhere, but when most of his white players vow to sit out the season unless he coaches, he changes his mind and stays on as Boone's assistant.Throughout training camp and the season, Boone and Yoast's black and white players learn to accept each other, to work together, and that football knows no race. As they learn from each other, Boone and Yoast also learn from them and in turn, the whole town learns from the team, the Titans. Thus, they are prepared to pursue the State Championship and to deal with an unthinkable tragedy that threatens to sink their perfect season.Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Donald Faison, Ryan Gosling, Hayden Panettiere, and Kate Bosworth co-star.This makes for a good story, but not totally true. Northern Virginia Schools, which consist of Arlington and Fairfax County, the Cities of Alexandria, Fairfax and Falls Church Schools were already integrated when T.C.

For this, we can use dynamic programming to build a 2D matrix that stores the lengths of the common substrings found in both strings. Then, we can iterate through the matrix to find the maximum length and extract the longest common substring. Step 2: Convert this substring to all lowercase and sort it alphabetically. We can use the built-in \`lower()\` function to convert all the characters in the substring to lowercase, and the \`sorted()\` function to sort the characters alphabetically. Finally, we can join the sorted characters back into a string using the \`join()\` function. Step 3: Replace the substring at its respective positions in the two lists with the updated substring.

From Reichenau, the Alpine Rhine flows east, passing Chur and turning north, forms the border between the canton of St. Gallen of Switzerland on the left, west side and first Liechtenstein and then Vorarlberg, Austria on the right, east side. The Swiss-Austrian border follows the historical bed of the Rhine, but today the river follows an artificial canal within Austria for the final . The Rhine Valley in this area extends to about . Its upper third has the character of an Alpine valley, enclosing a bottom plain of about across. Downstream of Vaduz, the valley widens considerably, developing into a broad plain, measuring some across at its lower end along the southern shores of Lake Constance. From the point of the Rhine's emergence from Lake Constance, it is known as High Rhine. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - A principality (or princedom) can either be a monarchical feudatory or a sovereign state, ruled or reigned over by a monarch with the title of prince or by a monarch with another title within the generic use of the term \\"prince\\". Terminology. Most of these states have historically been a polity, but in some occasions were rather territories in respect of which a princely title is held. The prince's estate and wealth may be located mainly or wholly outside the geographical confines of the principality. - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation. - The Rätikon is a mountain range of the Central Eastern Alps located at the border between Vorarlberg, Liechtenstein and Graubünden. It is the geological border between the Eastern and Western Alps and stretches from the Montafon as far as the Rhine. In the south, the Prättigau is its limit, in the north the Walgau. In the east, it borders the Silvretta groups. - Vorarlberg is the westernmost federal state (\\"Bundesland\\") of Austria. Although it has the second-smallest area (Vienna is the smallest) and population (Burgenland is less populated), it has the second-highest population density (after Vienna).

A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities. - The Prättigau Valley, in the canton of Graubünden (Grisons), Switzerland, is home to the world-famous ski resorts of Klosters and neighbouring Davos in the Landwasser Valley. At its heart is the river Landquart. The valley extends upwards from Landquart, a key transport terminal just north of Chur, the capital of Grisons. It is a popular tourist destination for winter and summer activities, including downhill and cross country skiing, tobogganing and hiking. Traditionally, towns in the Prättigau were reliant on the lumber industry, although the income from tourism has largely replaced that. - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.

The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \\"strategic awakening\\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope or V4. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The name Western Alps refers to the western part of the Alpine range. The term has different meanings according to the classification of the Alps in use. The peaks and mountain passes are higher compared to the Eastern Alps, while the range itself is not so broad and more arched. - The Splügen Pass (German: \\"Splügenpass\\"; Italian: \\"Passo dello Spluga\\"; el. 2,115 m) is a high mountain pass which marks the boundary between the Lepontine and Rhaetian Alps, respectively part of the Western and Eastern Alps. - Balzers is a town and community located in southern Liechtenstein. As in 2014, the community has a total population of 4,587. The main part of the village is situated along the east bank of the Rhine. - Lake Constance (German: Bodensee) is a lake on the Rhine at the northern foot of the Alps, and consists of three bodies of water: the \\"Obersee\\" (\\"upper lake\\"), the \\"Untersee\\" (\\"lower lake\\"), and a connecting stretch of the Rhine, called the \\"Seerhein\\". - Montafon (in local dialect: \\"\\"Muntafu\\")\\" is a 39 km long valley in the federal state of Vorarlberg (Austria) that is crossed by the river Ill (Vorarlberg). It extends from the city of Bludenz and the Verwall Alps in the north, to the Silvretta and Rätikon mountain range in the south. Piz Buin is with 3312m the highest peak within the Silvretta mountain range. - Eastern Alps is the name given to the eastern half of the Alps, usually defined as the area east of a line from Lake Constance and the Alpine Rhine valley up to the Splügen Pass at the Alpine divide and down the Liro River to Lake Como in the south. The peaks and mountain passes are lower compared to the Western Alps, while the range itself is broader and less arched. - The city of Bern or Berne (; Bernese German: \\"Bärn\\" ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their (e.g. in German) \\"Bundesstadt,\\" or \\"federal city\\". With a population of 141,762 (November 2016), Bern is the fourth most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second most populous of Switzerland's cantons. - Geneva (, , , ) is the second most populous city in Switzerland (after Zürich) and is the most populous city of Romandy, the French-speaking part of Switzerland.

But drug watchdog NICE says while this \\"disease-modifying therapy\\" can help in some cases, the benefits need to be weighed carefully against side-effects. It is reviewing exactly when and how some of these relatively new treatments should be used. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an incurable condition that can lead to sight loss, pain, fatigue and disability. It affects around 100,000 people in the UK. Many have a relapsing, remitting version - where they experience flare-ups of symptoms and then have periods where symptoms ease or disappear. The new review - a result of meetings between patients, medics, charities and researchers - suggests that contrary to some previously held views, the disease may continue to get worse during the remitting phase. It argues that prompt treatment with disease-modifying medicines may help in these cases. Michelle Mitchell, of the MS Society, said: \\"Relapsing, remitting MS has been redefined - we now know the clock never stops with this disease and neither should our fight against it. \\"In the UK, the most common treatment option for MS in its early stages is currently no treatment and this needs to change for the sake of tens of thousands of people's health.\\" The organisation is encouraging doctors and patients to agree plans for treatment quickly - within six months of diagnosis. But Dr Paul Cooper, a brain specialist who advises the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says although disease-modifying drugs have a role in established relapsing, remitting disease, there is still debate about their use early on in the condition. He added: \\"These drugs are potent with potentially long-term side-effects and consequences, therefore we have to balance the risks and benefits. \\"NICE is looking into these issues but the analysis is not yet complete and the data needs to be looked at carefully.\\" He says there are other things that can help people with multiple sclerosis, including better accesses to specialists and physiotherapy. NICE plans to publish a new appraisal of drugs used to treat MS in 2017. In the meantime, doctors can prescribe these drugs, guided by specific criteria, including the number of previous relapses. People with multiple sclerosis can also be diagnosed with a primary progressive form of the condition where symptoms get gradually worse over time - without periods of remission. According to the NHS, there is currently no treatment that can slow the progress of this form of the disease. This article was about:","output":"This article talks about a report from the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Society. It says that doctors should not wait to give medicine to people with a kind of MS called \\"relapsing, remitting MS.\\" In this type, people feel worse sometimes and then feel better or have no symptoms. The report explains that waiting to give medicine might not be helpful, and patients should get treatment within six months of being diagnosed. However, a group called NICE thinks that we should be careful about giving medicines too early, because the medicines can have side effects. They are studying when and how to use these new treatments.

Hypothesis: A boy is sitting on a couch inside. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"No, the given premise - that a boy is jumping onto a large pile of leaves - cannot lead to the conclusion of the hypothesis, which states that a boy is sitting on a couch inside. The two scenarios do not have a direct connection, as they describe two different activities set in two different locations. It is possible for either situation to occur independently or at different points of time, but the premise does not necessarily support or lead to the hypothesis. The premise involves an outdoor activity, taking place likely during the autumn season when leaves fall from trees, accumulating on the ground in a pile that can be jumped on. The boy's action, jumping onto the pile of leaves, suggests that he is likely engaging in playful behavior, enjoying the feeling of leaping into the soft cushion of autumn foliage. Moreover, this situation implicates that the environment is suitable and safe for outdoor play, and the weather conditions possibly allow for such activities. On the other hand, the hypothesis describes a boy sitting on a couch indoors, which is a completely different context from the premise. It is not connected to the season, weather conditions, or outdoor activities. This scenario could take place at any time of the year and is not dependent on the presence of a pile of leaves for jumping. The act of sitting on a couch implies relaxation, rather than the active play suggested by the premise. The hypothesis, a boy sitting on a couch inside, is a separate situation unrelated to the premise about jumping into a pile of leaves. In summary, the premise about a boy jumping onto a large pile of leaves does not support or lead to the conclusion of the hypothesis, which states that a boy is sitting on a couch inside. Both scenarios are independent of each other and describe different situations happening in distinct locations and context. Therefore, we cannot conclude the hypothesis based on the given premise."},{"instruction":"Here is a news article: DENVER – A missing elderly man who authorities discovered dead in an elevator at a Denver apartment complex last month may have reached out for help by pressing the elevator’s emergency button. Isaak Komisarchik, 82, had early-onset dementia and was last seen July 5. He was reported missing, and Denver Police made a concerted effort with Komisarchik’s family to locate him. Despite their efforts, Komisarchik’s body was located in an elevator car at the Woodstream Village apartments, 10050 East Harvard Avenue, on July 31. Tenants at the apartment complex complained of an awful smell coming from the parking garage elevator, leading to the discovery of the body. Denver Police continue an active investigation into the man’s death, and Denver Fire officials are now revealing new details about the events leading up to Komisarchik’s death. First reported by the Denver Post, Denver Fire officials say they’ve learned Komisarchik pressed an emergency button in the elevator twice on July 6 before he died. “Something is not right, and police are going to make a determination on what that is,” Capt. Greg Pixley, of Denver Fire, said. Pixley said the activation of the elevator’s emergency button was recorded electronically twice, although officials never received the call. Pixley said Denver Fire was never notified that the elevator was taken out of service and it met the appropriate fire code standards for 2016 and had the appropriate permits for operation in 2017. Tenants say the elevator wasn't working and that few people parked in the garage during summer months. If that's the case, it raises questions about why an elevator company wasn't called. Pixley said MEI Total Elevator Solutions monitors the elevator for Woodstream Village. The company issued the following response. \\"We are saddened by the tragic loss of life and extend our deepest condolences to Mr. Komisarchik's family and friends. The elevator cab where he was found is located in a parking garage that is under renovation construction and not currently in active use. We are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident with the local authorities,\\" a Greystar Management Services representative said Thursday. Denver Police said MEI Total Elevator Solutions received the distress call from the elevator and notified Woodstream's management. However, police say apartment workers failed to check the parking garage elevator after checking two other elevators in the building. Police in Denver are now working to learn why Komisarchik wasn’t able to escape the elevator and why authorities weren't notified of the emergency call. Read past reporting here. ||||| An elderly man who died in a parking garage elevator pushed the emergency button twice during an 8-minute span on July 6, but got no response despite Denver code requiring elevator operators to monitor emergency notifications around the clock. Unable to escape the elevator car — possibly because of dementia — 82-year-old Isaak Komisarchik died some time between the morning of July 6 and Aug. 2, when elevator repair workers finally discovered the body after multiple residents of the apartment complex reported a terrible stench. When a Denver firefighter responded she watched an elevator maintenance worker push the button. The elevator doors opened. Elevator maintenance workers had just found Komisarchik’s body inside the car, Denver Fire Department spokesman Capt. Greg Pixley said. A criminal investigation confirmed the number of times the emergency button was pushed, Pixley said. Now detectives are trying to determine why no one responded. “Something is not right,” Pixley said. Komisarchik died in an elevator that served a parking garage at the Woodstream Village apartments, 10050 E. Harvard Ave., that had been closed for renovation. On Aug. 8, Pixley said MEI Total Elevator Solutions monitors the elevator for Woodstream. He later said that he may have misspoken. MEI is not Woodstream’s elevator’s monitor, he said on Aug. 16. On Aug. 15, Mike Klehr, MEI Vice President of Field Operations, sent an email to the newspaper saying that although the company provides maintenance for the elevators for Woodstream, the company does not provide the elevator emergency monitoring service. “On behalf of MEI – Total Elevator Solutions, we offer our deepest condolences to Mr. Komisarchik’s family. MEI has fully cooperated with local authorities in their investigation of this matter,” Klehr wrote in the message. “We are saddened by the tragic loss of life and extend our deepest condolences to Mr. Komisarchik’s family and friends,” Greystar Management Services, which manages Woodstream, said in a statement released by spokeswoman Lindsay Andrews. She wrote that the elevator was not in use due to the renovation and said Greystar is “continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident with the local authorities.” She declined to comment about why no one responded to the emergency calls. Denver Medical Examiner’s spokesman Steven Castro said the cause of Komisarchik’s death has not yet been determined. Pixley said it can be difficult to determine a cause of death when a body is badly decomposed. Numerous Woodstream residents complained to managers of a strong odor emanating from the garage area but nothing had been done. Andrews declined to comment about the complaints. The fact that Komisarchik pushed the emergency button twice adds a new perplexing dimension to the incident. It appears Komisarchik did what he needed to do to get help and yet the closely regulated system for rescuing people trapped in elevators failed. “The elevator wasn’t inoperable,” said John White, spokesman for Denver police, contradicting numerous reports that elevator was not working. “How he got in there and when he got in there is obviously what we’re trying to figure out.” Misconceptions about the discovery of Komisarchik’s body make it impossible to fully grasp just how bizarre the incident was, according to officials and residents of the apartment complex. Some officials initially reported that Komisarchik’s body was found in the elevator shaft, Pixley said. Komisarchik was last seen wearing pajamas at 2:30 p.m. on July 5 at a nearby nursing facility on the 9900 block of East Yale Avenue. His disappearance sparked a large dragnet in which missing persons posters were distributed and Denver firefighters searched five ponds near Woodstream in an attempt to find him. According to city codes adopted in 1981, the interior of all elevator cars must have signaling devices including an emergency switch labeled “alarm” adjacent to the car’s operating panel and a phone or intercom labeled “help” allowing two-way communication with security. In some cases the alarms are connected to the Denver Fire Department or an elevator monitoring company, which is responsible for investigating an emergency call. When the two-way communication phone or intercom is not connected to on-site security, a call must automatically be forwarded within 30 seconds to the elevator-monitoring company. Elevators are regularly inspected by the fire department. The garage elevator at Woodstream Village was last inspected in December and found to be in good working order, Pixley said. The fire department did not receive any emergency calls from that particular elevator car during the period of time Komisarchik was in it. When police checked, two elevator calls from the same elevator car where Komisarchik was found were electronically logged at 9:09 a.m. and 9:17 a.m. on July 6, the morning after he disappeared. Nearly a month later, a Denver fire lieutenant was inspecting an apartment complex adjacent to Woodstream that is also managed by Greystar when the maintenance manager received a call from elevator repair staff saying they thought there was a body in the elevator. The fire lieutenant followed the manager to the nearby parking garage, Pixley said, but when she reached the garage, she smelled an odor so intense that she knew it was a body. Updated Aug. 16, 2017 at 7:30 a.m. The following corrected information has been added to this article: Mike Klehr, MEI Vice President of Field Operations, said the company maintains the elevators at the apartment complex, but does not provide the emergency monitoring service. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"An 82-year-old man with early-onset dementia, Isaak Komisarchik, was found dead in a parking garage elevator at the Woodstream Village apartments in Denver after he had pressed the emergency button twice on July 6.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

Article: Today, home-ownership has reached extremely high levels. Modern generations tend to believe there is something wrong with them if they rent. However, is high home-ownership really as rosy as people imagine? Staring at data first, we realize that the most successful, stable, attractive country in the Western world is Switzerland. It has tiny unemployment; wealth; high happiness and mental-health scores. Does it have high home-ownership rates? Absolutely not. In Switzerland, about seven in ten of the population are renters. Yet, with Europe's lowest home-ownership rate, the nation thrives. Now go to the other end of the misery distribution. Spain has approximately the highest home-ownership rate in Europe (at more than 80%). But one-quarter of its population are unemployed. A likely reason is that high levels of home-ownership mess up the labour market. In a sensibly functioning economy it is easy for people to move around to drop into the vibrant job slots thrown up by technological change. With a high degree of owner-occupation, everything slows. Folk get stuck. Renters can go to new jobs. In that way they do the economy a favour. As Friedman said, the rate of unemployment depends on the flexibility of the housing market. Next we come to economic breakdown. Most analysts accept that at heart it was the housing market--obsessive pursuit of homes, the engendered mortgage lending and an unavoidable house-price crash--that sank the Western world. Germany, say, with its more efficient rental market, had a far smoother ride through trouble.

Has ambition become pretension? You have to hand it to Ryan Gosling. He could have kept his multitude of devoted fans happy by coasting through romantic comedies and action movies for decades. But instead he gravitated towards edgier indie fare, including Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive and Derek Cianfrance’s Blue Valentine and A Place Beyond the Pines. Now he’s venturing even further from Hollywood’s comfort zone, not just by making his first film as a writer-director, but by making a film that is extravagantly, spookily odd. Quite a number of his devoted fans may rip up their Gosling posters after they’ve seen it. Still, Lost River should earn him some new fans to take their place. It’s the work of a surprisingly confident and experimental young filmmaker, even if he’s not yet confident enough to move beyond his influences. In the film’s opening minutes, the most obvious of those influences are Terrence Malick and David Gordon Green. The setting is the poverty-ravaged rural Deep South, where lyrical views of meadows lit by the low sun are contrasted with stark shots of derelict wooden houses. During the closing credits, a logo informs us that Lost River was filmed in Michigan, the go-to location for grimly post-apocalyptic decay, and it affords some striking imagery here. One scene is set in a defunct zoo, now engulfed in vegetation – the former residence of jungle animals is becoming an actual jungle. One of the few remaining family homes in the area is occupied by a single mother (Christina Hendricks from Mad Men) and her two sons. Falling behind on her mortgage payments, she accepts a mysterious job offer made by her bank manager (Ben Mendelsohn). At this point, just as we’re settling into a gritty, naturalistic report from recession-era America, Gosling makes a sharp turn into David Lynch territory. The woman’s new job is in a creepily retro nightclub where the ghoulish cabaret involves gory faked stabbings and the ironic crooning of easy-listening songs. To give him his due, Gosling is so open about his debt to Lynch that he chooses Deep Purple as the film’s theme song – which is as close as you can get to Blue Velvet without it being Blue Velvet. And there’s plenty more Lynchian weirdness where that came from. The woman’s son (Iain De Caestecker) meets a girl (Saoirse Ronan) who lives with her pet rat and her mute, reclusive grandmother. But their romance is threatened by a vicious thug named Bully (Matt Smith, the last Doctor Who), a man so nasty that he once removed his henchman’s lips with a pair of scissors. Why the henchman sticks by him is never explained, but nothing much makes sense in Lost River. Gosling is having so much fun with slow-motion, garish colours and offbeat editing that he soon gives up on logic. When he introduces a town at the bottom of the local reservoir, you start to wonder if he will ever be able to pull all of the macabre freakishness together into something coherent. He doesn’t. As a piece of storytelling, Lost River is so hazy and fanciful that it could easily be dismissed as a bored A-list star’s pretentious self-indulgence. But as a fever dream of memorably strange visuals and disconcerting atmospherics, there’s no denying that it’s quite an accomplishment. When Gosling makes his next film, he should probably leave his Lynch and Malick DVDs on the shelf and hire a co-writer. But, if the skill and boldness he demonstrates in Lost River are any indication, his career behind the camera is worth following.

Summary:","output":"Lost River is a movie directed by Ryan Gosling. Ryan is a famous actor who did something very different by directing this movie. The movie has beautiful scenes of nature, but also shows very old and broken houses. It's a little scary and strange, but also very interesting. In the movie, there's a mother and her two sons who live in a broken house and she has to do a weird job to pay for it. The movie might confuse some people because it's not like a normal story, but it shows that Ryan Gosling is good at making movies, not just acting in them."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"What was the name of the holder of thee title \\"\\"Earl of Essex\\"\\" who was executed in 1501?\\" Answer:","output":"The name of the holder of the title \\"Earl of Essex\\" who was executed in 1501 was Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset. However, it's important to note that Thomas Grey was never actually the Earl of Essex; he was the Marquess of Dorset. The confusion may arise from the fact that Thomas Grey's mother, Elizabeth Woodville, got married to King Edward IV, and Elizabeth's son from her first marriage, Thomas Grey, subsequently rose in ranks. Thomas Grey was born in 1477, as the eldest son of Marquess Thomas Grey, the first Marquess of Dorset and Elizabeth Woodville. His mother, Elizabeth Woodville, was the queen consort of England as the wife of King Edward IV from 1464 until his death in 1483. As a member of the powerful House of York, Thomas Grey held various positions within the court and nobility. For a time, he was even the sixth-most important person in King Edward IV's court. As tensions developed between the House of York and the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses, Thomas Grey's role in the politics of the time expanded as well. Following the death of his stepfather, King Edward IV, in 1483, Thomas Grey's family lost much of their prominence as the throne was claimed by Richard III, a member of the House of Lancaster. In response, Thomas Grey and his family began supporting the claim of Henry Tudor, who eventually ascended to the throne as King Henry VII after defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. During the early part of King Henry VII's reign, Thomas Grey remained loyal to the crown and enjoyed royal favor, even being made the Earl of Huntingdon. However, he later became embroiled in the political intrigues surrounding the king's rule. In 1501, he was accused of being involved in a conspiracy to overthrow King Henry VII and replace him with the Yorkist claimant, Edmund de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk. As a result, Thomas Grey was arrested, tried, and executed for treason on July 10, 1501. Though Thomas Grey held the title of Marquess of Dorset and not Earl of Essex, it's plausible that his connection to the House of York and his dramatic downfall could have led to some confusion between the two titles. Nevertheless, the nobleman executed in 1501 was Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I have been married twice. My wedding experiences were both very different, even though I cried at both ceremonies. At my first wedding, I had been doing a lot of manual labor in the day prior to the wedding. Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands. By the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves. During the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn’t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain. Although I managed to remain silent, I couldn’t keep the tears from falling down my face. The more I cried, the harder she squeezed and the more painful it was. She always thought that I was crying due to emotion on our wedding day, and I never told her any differently — I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. Some years after that lengthy incarceration ended, I was fortunate to wed again. I had not done any manual labor before our wedding day. My hands were fine. Also, my bride did not have a lot of intricate buttons on her dress, nor did she wear gloves or even have sleeves. We were wed on a beach, just the two of us. No one else was in attendance. We had written our own vows, in fact, our own ceremony, including our own rituals. And yes, I cried, because I was / am so in love with my bride.

Where did the last name saavedra come from? OK. Let's think. My stream of consciousness:","output":"The last name Saavedra is of Spanish origin. It is a geographic or locational surname, which means that it is derived from the location where the person with this surname or their ancestors originally lived or held land. The Saavedra last name comes from a place in the province of Lugo, in the Galicia region of northwestern Spain. Saavedra consists of two elements: \\"Saa,\\" which is a Galician term referring to a willow tree or a place with willows, and \\"vedra,\\" a word meaning \\"green\\" or \\"verdant,\\" often applied to lush or fertile lands. Thus, the last name Saavedra represents an individual or family from an area characterized by its green, fertile lands and willow trees. Over time, as people migrated and families with the Saavedra name spread throughout Spain and the broader Hispanic world, the use of Saavedra as a surname became more common. Carrying the geographic origins of their ancestors, Saavedra would eventually become recognizable as a distinguished Spanish surname."},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -342*t + 931 + 779 = 0 for t.","output":"Alright kiddo, let's solve this problem step by step. We have this equation: -342 * t + 931 + 779 = 0 First, let's add 931 and 779 together: 931 + 779 = 1710 Now our equation looks like this: -342 * t + 1710 = 0 Now, we want to get \\"t\\" by itself. To do that, we will move the 1710 to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: -342 * t = -1710 Now, we need to divide by -342 to find the value of \\"t\\": t = -1710 / -342 When we do this division, we get: t = 5 So, the solution to the math problem is t = 5.

Article: There is not enough oil in the world now. As time goes by, it becomes less and less, so what are we going to do when it runs out? Perhaps we will go back to using horses, carriages and bicycles. In the Second World War, some people didn't use gas made from petroleum in their cars. They made gas from wood and plants instead. The car didn't go fast, but they ran, so this was better than nothing. However, in the future, we can't cut down all our trees to make gas; we need our trees for other things, too. Besides different types of gas, we can also use electricity to run our cars, but first we must make the electricity! Some countries have coal and they make electricity with that, but we might not always have coal, either. Other countries have big, strong rivers, and they can use the power of water to turn turbines and make electricity more easily and cheaply. We are also able to get power from the ocean tides.

Given people's opinion of congress what place might they give the mascot of a weasel to? Options: - state - washington dc - henhouse - public office - out of doors","output":"Based on the given question, we need to determine the most likely place where people would assign a weasel as a mascot regarding their opinion of Congress. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Understand the context: People usually have a negative opinion of Congress, associating it with dishonesty and deceitful actions. Weasels are often associated with these traits as well. 2. Analyze each option: a. State: This option seems too broad and doesn't specifically address a place where weasel-like behavior is most associated with. b. Washington DC: While this option may seem fitting, as Congress resides in Washington DC, it doesn't explain why a weasel specifically would be the mascot. c. Henhouse: A henhouse implies vulnerability, as weasels are predators that can wreak havoc in a henhouse. However, this option fails to make a strong connection to Congress. d. Public office: This option could be a viable choice since it implies that people believe a weasel might represent the dishonest and deceitful behavior often found in public offices, including Congress. e. Out of doors: This option is too vague in its relation to Congress, as it doesn't clarify any connection between a weasel and people's opinion of Congress. 3.

However, the statement does not provide enough information to infer the intended recipient of the cut fruit or the reason behind cutting the fruit. It is not explicitly mentioned that the man is cutting fruit for his child. There could be numerous reasons why the man is cutting the fruit. Some possibilities include: 1. For personal consumption – The man could be cutting the fruit to enjoy it himself as a snack or a part of a meal. 2. For someone else – The man could be cutting the fruit to share it with another adult, a group of people, or even with animals or pets. 3. To prepare a dish – The man could be cutting the fruit as a part of a recipe or a dish that may involve fruit as one of its components. 4. For preservation or storage – The man could be preparing the fruit for later use or to preserve it through methods such as freezing, drying, or canning. While it is possible that the man could be cutting the fruit for his child, it is not a logical conclusion based solely on the given information. To arrive at that conclusion, we would need additional context or evidence showcasing that the man has a child and his intention behind cutting the fruit is for feeding his child."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Where did Eve grow up?

He grew up in nearby Sodertalje. As a child, Borg became fascinated with a golden tennis racket that his father won at a table-tennis tournament. His father gave him the racket, beginning his tennis career. With 11 Grand Slam titles, Borg ranks sixth in the list of male tennis players who have won the most Grand Slam singles titles behind Roger Federer (20), Rafael Nadal (16), Pete Sampras (14), Roy Emerson (12), and Novak Djokovic (12). The French Open--Wimbledon double he achieved three times consecutively was called by Wimbledon officials \\"the most difficult double in tennis\\" and \\"a feat considered impossible among today's players.\\" Only Nadal (in 2008 and 2010) and Federer (in 2009) have managed to achieve this double since, and Andre Agassi, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are the only male players since Borg to have won the French Open and Wimbledon men's singles titles over their career. Ilie Nastase once said about Borg, \\"We're playing tennis, and he's playing something else\\". In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, had already included Borg in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time. And in 2003, Bud Collins chose Borg as one of his top-five male players of all time. In 2008, ESPN.com asked tennis analysts, writers, and former players to build the perfect open era player. Borg was the only player mentioned in four categories: defense, footwork, intangibles, and mental toughness--with his mental game and footwork singled out as the best in open era history. Borg famously never won the US Open, losing in the final four times. Borg also never won the Australian Open, as he only played in the event once, in 1974 as a 17-year-old. The only players to defeat Borg in a Grand Slam final were fellow World No. 1 tennis players John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors. Even though it was then played on grass, a surface where he enjoyed much success, Borg chose to play the Australian Open only once, in 1974, where he lost in the third round. Phil Dent, a contemporary of Borg, has pointed out that skipping Grand Slam tournaments--especially the Australian Open--was not unusual then, before counting Grand Slam titles became the norm. Additionally, another contemporary Arthur Ashe told Sports Illustrated, \\"I think Bjorn could have won the U.S. Open. I think he could have won the Grand Slam, but by the time he left, the historical challenge didn't mean anything. He was bigger than the game. He was like Elvis or Liz Taylor or somebody.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in the article, one of which is a quote by Ilie Nastase about Borg, stating, \\"We're playing tennis, and he's playing something else.\\" This quote highlights Borg's exceptional talent and skill in tennis, setting him apart from other players at the time. Additionally, the article mentions Borg's achievements, such as being the only player mentioned in four categories by ESPN.com in 2008 and being revered for his mental game and footwork as the best in open era history."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Punjab Power for the following movie plot: Have you ever stopped to think if the most ordinary, uninteresting, unobtrusive man you might see on the road or around you might have a love story to tell?Maybe not!

Alternatively, you could have been in a negative family situation since you were born and then decided that you needed to make life better. Whatever your case, try to determine the contributing factors to the situation. Think about things people said and did, patterns of behavior (your own and others’), tones of voice, and patterns of your own thinking. Make a list of negative things you tend to repeat to yourself. Find evidence for and against this thought. Look for facts, rather than opinions. Ask yourself what makes you think this way. Put systems in place that will ensure that you don’t repeat the negative things that happened in the past. Create plans to follow whenever you notice feelings that trigger behavior that you regret. For example, perhaps you’ve noticed that when you feel sad, you tend to drink alcohol: form a plan for dealing with your sadness that will keep you from drinking. Talk to a friend and ask him to help you with this problem. When you’re feeling sad, you can call him and ask them to come over. You can both play a sport or do something different. You could even try to talk about what is making you feel sad to help you deal with the situation. Try to come up with more than one plan to follow in these situations in case something prevents you from following your original one. If you understand why things happened the way they did, try to think of solutions that will prevent history from repeating. If other people are the reason that your life was negative, it can be more difficult to change the situation. For example, if you’re a teenager and your parents make your home life difficult, maybe you can encourage your parents to seek help for their lifestyle. You know your loved one best. It can be difficult to convince others to seek the help they need to better their life. Think of ways that you can help him yourself, consult with others on how best to approach the situation or read psychology articles related to your issue. You can’t simply stop doing things -- you have to start doing other activities to replace them. For example, if you had a habit of coming home from school and smoking in your room, form a routine that will help you achieve your goals instead. Plan ahead and ask a friend to help you, if you like. Once you come home, wash up, eat lunch then immediately leave for the public library to study. New habits may be harder to form than new routines. Start by consciously engaging in behavior that you want to become habit. Take for example, trying to maintain your personal hygiene. Make a conscious effort to brush your teeth before going to bed and after waking up in the morning. Set a daily reminder on your phone to help you or ask a parent to check that you’ve brushed your teeth. Once this becomes habit, you’ll feel uncomfortable if you don’t brush your teeth at these times. In your day to day life and in the long run, keep your goals in mind when you’re making decisions. Think about how your decision will affect your day and your future. Remember the poor choices you’ve made in the past. Choose that which is better for you. Sometimes, you might make a decision that would have worked for you in the past but doesn’t any more. Maybe playing video games used to refresh your mind and now it doesn’t bring you that same peace of mind. This is okay. You can outgrow anything. Don’t force yourself to do something that no longer serves you well.","output":"This article is about recognizing negative patterns in your life, making a plan to change them, and creating new habits for a happier and better future."},{"instruction":"Question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

A spokesman for AT&T, Apple’s exclusive iPhone partner in the United States, said that for now, it would not change the monthly prices on its iPhone voice and data plans. Apple also announced it would sell the previous eight-gigabyte iPhone 3G for a price of 99, reduced from 199, on top of data and voice plans. That could make the iPhone accessible to cost-conscious consumers and undercut competitors like Palm. Palm’s new smartphone, the Pre, which went on sale Saturday, costs 199 after a mail-in rebate. Sprint, which is selling the Pre exclusively, offers a two-year service contract that is cheaper than the one AT&T offers for the iPhone. “This puts a lot of pressure on the likes of RIM and Palm,” said Charles Wolf, an analyst at Needham & Company, referring to the BlackBerry maker Research in Motion. “It sorts of upsets Palm’s apple cart two days after the launch of the Pre.” Apple also used the industry gathering to announce new features and price cuts on its MacBook Pro line of laptops. All new MacBook Pros will feature up to seven hours of battery life — a 40 percent increase from the last version, because of the new lithium-ion batteries Apple is using. The new batteries are sealed into the laptops, as opposed to the removable batteries that have been in previous MacBooks. Apple is saying the power units can be recharged up to 1,000 times — up to three times as much as other batteries. New MacBook Pros will also feature an SD memory-card slot for simpler photo transfers. The new, lower prices suggest the company is taking aim at recession-wary consumers and is willing to sacrifice at least some profit to increase its share of the market for personal computers. But Apple did not budge on prices significantly. For example, the new 15-inch MacBook Pro now costs 1,699, 300 less than the previous version. “I think there was a recognition that their prices are becoming increasingly disconnected from the market,” said Toni Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “But this was not a bold step into new price points.” AT&T said iPhone owners with existing contracts would have to pay more to upgrade to a new phone: 299 for the eight-gigabyte, 399 for the 16-gigabyte and 499 for the 32-gigabyte. However, current customers who are eligible for upgrades and those whose contracts have expired would pay the same price as a new customer, said Mark Siegel, executive director of media relations for AT&T mobility and consumer markets. The original iPhone was sold two years ago. TomTom, the maker of GPS systems for cars or personal use, also made a presentation at the conference, in which it said it was introducing a portable navigation application and car kit to provide drivers with turn-by-turn directions. TomTom executives were acknowledging that the iPhone and other smartphones were killing its market for stand-alone GPS hardware and that the company was entering the accessories and applications business. The new software for the iPhone also pushed the device more clearly into the portable game console arena occupied by Nintendo’s DS and Sony’s PSP. In what looks like another play for the iPhone to resemble a handheld gaming device, the new peer-to-peer connection feature will locate nearby users using Bluetooth and connect the two using Wi-Fi, allowing them to compete in various games. Much of Apple’s presentation was devoted to software, both for the Macintosh computer and the iPhone. The company said a new version of its operating system for the Macintosh, called Snow Leopard, would be available in September. It will cost 29 for current Mac owners to upgrade and the operating system will be shipped with all new Macs. Snow Leopard includes new features that include enhanced global search that can now read URLs and text in Web pages; better compatibility with Microsoft Exchange, the dominant e-mail system used in businesses; and faster computing over all. Apple also said the new version of the iPhone’s operating system, iPhone OS 3.0, will be made available free to current iPhone owners beginning June 17. The software will have more than 100 new features, including capabilities for multimedia messaging; cut, copy and paste tools; and search functions. It will also unlock features developers have eagerly awaited, like the ability to buy virtual goods or new gaming levels within applications. ScrollMotion, a start-up based in New York, unveiled an application at the convention called Iceberg, a digital bookstore that will let users purchase best sellers from within the application without having to open a browser. An article on Tuesday about new Apple products misstated the costs for some existing iPhone customers to upgrade to the new iPhone 3G S. Under what the company calls “early upgrade pricing,” customers who do not yet qualify for an upgrade, which usually occurs late in the two-year contract, will pay 499 for the 32-gigabyte model, 399 for the 16-gigabyte model and 299 for an older 8-gigabyte iPhone 3G  not 699, 599 and 499, respectively.

Keep Your Photos Dry and Warm Have you ever seen a wet piece of paper? It gets all wrinkly, doesn't it? The same thing can happen to your photos if they get wet or stay somewhere damp, like a basement. To keep your photos safe, store them in a dry place like a drawer or a special box. Make sure the place you choose isn't too hot or too cold, because heat can also hurt your pictures. Just like Goldilocks and the Three Bears, we want the temperature to be \\"just right!.\\" 2. Clean Up Stains Quickly Uh-oh! Did you accidentally spill juice on your photo? Don't worry - we can fix that. But we need to act fast! When something spills on your picture, it's important to clean it up right away. Gently wipe off the juice with a soft cloth, and be careful not to rub too hard. Then, let your photo dry in a clean spot before you put it away. If you clean up spills quickly, your photo will stay looking fresh and nice. 3. Touch Photos with Clean Hands Our hands can sometimes be dirty without us even knowing it. Did you know that the oils from our fingers can leave marks on pictures? That's why it's important to have clean hands when we touch our photos. Remember to wash your hands before you look at your favorite pictures, and try to hold the photos by the edges. This way, you won't leave fingerprints on the important parts of the picture. Taking care of your photos is easy if you follow these steps. By keeping them dry, cleaning up stains, and having clean hands when you touch them, you can make sure your special memories stay bright and colorful for a long time.

Indeed Dubuffet, who, alongside artists like Alberto Giacometti and Francis Bacon, is often associated with the generation of Europeans who emerged in and around World War II, made work that refused to bend to convention—it’s an attitude that also shaped Dubuffet’s life. Born in Le Havre, France in 1901 to a family of bourgeoisie wine merchants, Dubuffet’s early involvement with art was marked by periods of inactivity, during which time he preoccupied himself with the family business. But in 1942, he decided to devote himself to his art full time. But unlike Giacometti and Bacon, whose disquieting works directly reflected the wartime period, Dubuffet explored subtler terrain—many times depicting in his work caricatured representations of friends, women, and even, cows. “Dubuffet never painted a tortured figure in his life. Rather, he took off on another existential path as if to say, I’m going to do what I want to do—he was more concerned with subverting conventional ideas of art,” says Rosenthal, formerly of the Detroit Institute of Art. At the same time, a number of portrait shows went up in Paris, featuring paintings of handsome war heroes and members of the elite. “He was doing everything to transgress against that,” says Rosenthal. “He made paintings that had very rough surfaces, often containing stones and plaster and tar. He deliberately made his figures look wild and grotesque.” Later, his resistance to the traditional led Dubuffet to champion outsider art— which he coined art brut (“raw art”)—in the form of a collection of art works by African artists as well as those suffering from mental illness. Of course, as Rosenthal is quick to point out, these subjects weren’t unknown—Picasso was interested in African art as far back as the turn of the century, as was Paul Klee—but it’s undeniable that Dubuffet certainly furthered the idea that such art was as legitimate as that by European traditionalists. This latest exhibition at Acquavella surveys Dubuffet’s work from 1943 to 1959, on view together for the first in over two decades, showcases an passion that influenced countless neo-avant-garde artists like Georg Baselitz and Anselm Kiefer. “Dubuffet was one of the great disruptors of art history,” says Rosenthal. “He utilized the most humble of materials, all of which projected new visions of beauty.” Jean Dubuffet: Anticultural Positions is on view at Aquavella Galleries in New York City through June.","output":"\\"Exploring the Unusual Art of Jean Dubuffet: From Silly Cows to Bumpy Paintings\\""},{"instruction":"Повторная депортация была назначена на 9 мая, однако 1 мая Эбенизир Сонтса покончил с собой.

Thorn and Ezell left the band in the mid-1990s, with Rocky Thacker taking over on bass guitar; Keyboardist Stan Munsey joined the line up in 1995. The band split up in 1997 after Raybon left. Seales, Munsey, Thacker and McGuire reformed the band in 2000 with lead singer Brent Lamb, who was in turn replaced by Curtis Wright and then by Jimmy Yeary. Context: The band achieved its biggest hit in 1990 with the three-week number-one single \\"Next to You, Next to Me.\\" Written by then-solo singers Robert Ellis Orrall and Curtis Wright, this was the first of five singles from Shenandoah's third album, Extra Mile. \\"Ghost in This House,\\" \\"I Got You\\" (co-written by Teddy Gentry of the band Alabama) and \\"The Moon Over Georgia\\" all peaked in the Billboard top ten between late 1990 and mid-1991, with the latter two reaching number one on Gavin Report; \\"When You Were Mine,\\" the fifth single, stopped at number 38 on Billboard in 1991. Also that year, the band won the Academy of Country Music's Vocal Group of the Year award. Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly gave Extra Mile a B rating, saying that it was \\"unflinchingly commercial\\" but adding that \\"the band goes beyond Alabama's jingoistic flag-waving and Restless Heart's vapid mood-brighteners to showcase intelligent ballads and jaunty rhythm numbers.\\" An uncredited review in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that the band \\"proved that no matter how overcrowded the field is, there's always room for quality.\\" Extra Mile earned a gold certification in the United States. Following the release of Extra Mile, a band from Kentucky threatened to sue Shenandoah over the use of the name Shenandoah. After a financial settlement was made with the Kentucky band, two other bands filed lawsuits over Shenandoah's name. The lawsuits depleted the money earned by the band on the road, which led to the band asking the label and their production company to all pay one-third of their legal costs. The production company refused, and Shenandoah was forced to filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 1991 after paying more than 2 million dollars on court settlements and legal fees. Although the lawsuits allowed Shenandoah to keep its name, the bankruptcy filing terminated the contract with Columbia after a 1992 Greatest Hits package. The production company's officials then filed a lawsuit against the band, claiming that it had tried to void its agreement with them. After Shenandoah's departure, there were no other bands on Columbia's Nashville division; as a result, producer Larry Strickland assembled three musicians to create a new band called Matthews, Wright & King in an attempt to keep a commercially successful band on the label. Question: What was the issue with their name?. Whats the answer?","output":"The issue with Shenandoah's name was that another band from Kentucky claimed they were using the name \\"Shenandoah\\" first. This led to a lawsuit and a financial settlement with the Kentucky band. After this, two more bands also filed lawsuits over the use of the name.

Within the cradle of ancient civilization empires are built, wars fought, alliances forged, and heroes born.Agamemnon (Brian Cox), king of Mycenae, has united most of Greece's kingdoms under his rule and now advances his army upon the nation of Thessaly, hoping to include it in his collection of ever-growing conquests. King Triopas (Julian Glover) bargains with Agamemnon to each let one of their best fighters decide who wins the battle rather than engaging in open war. Triopas calls upon the giant Boagrius (Nathan Jones) while Agamemnon calls to Achilles, but the legendary warrior is nowhere to be found. A messenger boy (Jacob Smith) is sent to fetch him and Agamemnon curses the stubborn nature of the fiercest warrior Greece has ever seen. A half-god and blessed with incomparable strength and skill, Achilles lives to fight but he refuses to associate with Agamemnon, preferring instead to seek his own destiny and be immortalized in history. Achilles easily defeats Boagrius, sealing Agamemnon's control over the nation, and calls out if there is anyone else worthy enough to fight him.Meanwhile, Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) of Troy feast in the banquet hall of King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) as honored guests and peace ambassadors to their home nation. However, young Paris sneaks away to be with Menelaus' beautiful wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), whom he loves dearly. He convinces her to come back with him to Troy, stowing her away on his brother's ship. When Hector finds out he is clearly angry but it is too late to return to Sparta with Helen and seek pardon. Finding Helen gone, Menelaus vows revenge on Troy and seeks the approval of his brother, Agamemnon, who is only too happy to oblige, though Agamemnon's decision comes mostly from his desire to sack Troy.Odysseus (Sean Bean), king of Ithaca and under command of Agamemnon, goes to convince Achilles to accompany them in the...

QPR boss Harry Redknapp has suggested his side's shock cup loss at Burton could hasten the departure of several players. Redknapp paid the price for making nine changes as League Two Albion claimed a 1-0 win in their Capital One Cup second-round tie at the Pirelli Stadium. The likes of Shaun Wright-Phillips, Nedum Onuoha, Karl Henry, Junior Hoilett and Adel Taarabt were among the players to come in and Redknapp was far from impressed by most of them. Redknapp did single out Taarabt - who was making his first appearance for the R's in 16 months - for praise but, with Monday's transfer deadline looming, many of the rest could be heading out. Asked if any business was possible, Redknapp said: 'Absolutely. I still think we need a bit of quality in one or two areas. 'There are one or two who played last night or are not going to get in my team who I think might be better moving on.' The future of former Manchester City, Chelsea and England winger Wright-Phillips at Loftus Road is again in question. The 32-year-old has faded from the limelight since joining Rangers three years ago in a move that was supposed to rejuvenate his career. On Wednesday he was completely overshadowed - almost literally - and outplayed by his marker, the towering 6ft 5in defender George Taft, and was withdrawn after 78 minutes. Goal: Burton celebrate Adam McGurk's 77th-minute winner to knock QPR out. Out? Shaun Wright-Phillips' QPR future is in doubt after struggling against Burton on Wednesday night. Hoilett hit the bar in one of Rangers' better moments, but the Canadian is also in danger of drifting to the periphery. Redknapp said: 'I wanted an awful lot more (from the wide areas). I thought Junior did all right first half but Shaun had a tough night.' Redknapp did say he would like Taarabt to stay but did not know the intentions of the Moroccan, who spent last season on loan at Fulham and AC Milan and has a buy-out clause. Struggle: Taarabt is another player who could be leaving Loftus Road, despite Redknapp's desire to keep him. As well as any transfer business, Redknapp is also anxious to get QPR's season up and running this weekend. The Londoners have lost all three of their games, with the Burton defeat compounding woes after last weekend's 4-0 defeat by Tottenham. Redknapp said: 'Saturday is important, it's massive for us. It won't be easy against Sunderland, that's for sure. 'They were a team in form at the end of last season and have started decent this year. We have got to pick ourselves up and get ready to go on Saturday.' Out: Redknapp watches on in disappointment as his QPR side crash out of the Capital One Cup to Burton. The mood was considerably different at Burton, the modest but well-run Staffordshire club who have made steady progress since promotion to the Football League in 2009. After missing out on promotion in the play-offs last season, the Brewers have made a solid start to the new campaign and are unbeaten in six games across all competitions. Striker Adam McGurk, who curled home the 77th-minute free-kick that settled the tie, said: 'Everyone is buzzing. It's a great win. We worked as hard as we could and we nicked the goal to get the win. 'We have had the likes of Wigan, Stoke and Derby here and given everyone a game. We just work away and stick to the game plan and it is paying off. 'When the goal went in and at full-time you could hear the roar. 'It is great for the fans to get memories like this. It's brilliant for them. 'But these are bonuses for us. Our main aim is obviously promotion. We can't get sidetracked from that. 'We have to get back down on Friday morning and make sure we keep our run going in the league.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"QPR manager Harry Redknapp has hinted that several players may depart from the team after their unexpected Capital One Cup second-round loss to Burton.

With Monday's transfer deadline approaching, it is possible that some of these players may be on their way out.

In the second sentence, the score formatting is inconsistent. The first score (6-3) uses a single hyphen (-), while the second score retains the double hyphen (--). The single hyphen (-) is more common and acceptable in sports scores notation. Though the sentences have these slight differences, their main message remains the same, conveying the results of a match between Arthur Ashe and Dick Stockton with Ashe as the winner. To correct the second sentence, it should read: \\"Arthur Ashe defeated Dick Stockton, 6-3, 6-2.\\" This revised sentence would match the meaning of the first sentence more accurately."},{"instruction":"Question: Which 2009 animated film features a floating house suspended by helium balloons?

( 1976 ) is a documentary film shot in the IMAX format . It follows the history of flight , from the first hot air balloons in the 19th century to 20th century manned space missions . It was created for performance at the National Air and Space Museum 's IMAX Theater in Washington , D.C. - Film stock is an analog medium that is used for recording motion pictures or animation. It is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals. The sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of the film. The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to X-rays and high-energy particles. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum. - The National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, also called the NASM, is a museum in Washington, D.C.. It holds the largest collection of historic aircraft and spacecraft in the world. It was established in 1946 as the National Air Museum and opened its main building on the National Mall near L'Enfant Plaza in 1976. In 2014, the museum saw approximately 6.7 million visitors, making it the fifth most visited museum in the world.

A smaller designation, sometimes referred to as the \\"Mall proper\\", excludes both the Capitol grounds and the Washington Monument grounds, applying only to an area between them. The National Mall contains a number of museums and memorials and receives approximately 24 million visitors each year. - The Bell X-1 was a rocket engine-powered aircraft, designated originally as the XS-1, and was a joint National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics-U.S. Army Air Forces-U.S. Air Force supersonic research project built by Bell Aircraft.

Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the lunar module \\"Eagle\\" on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected of lunar material to bring back to Earth.

Immediately below the plaza and the buildings is the \\"La Promenade\\" shopping mall. The plaza is located south of Independence Avenue SW between 12th and 9th Streets SW (9th Street actually runs underneath the centers of the buildings on the easternmost side of the plaza). It was built perpendicular to L'Enfant Promenade, a north-south running street and pedestrian esplanade part of which is directly above 10th Street SW. The plaza is named for Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, the architect and planner who first designed a street layout for the capital city.

They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft on December 17, 1903, four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 190405 the brothers developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft. Although not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft, the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible. - IMAX (an acronym for Image maximum) is a motion picture film format and a set of cinema projection standards developed in Canada by Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor, Robert Kerr, and William C.

The man was reportedly stranded on a very small piece of rock about three-quarters of the way down. A California Highway Patrol helicopter was used to lower a firefighter to the man and rescue him. That man has been identified as Michael Banks of Fresno. The firefighter who rescued him says Banks told him he climbed the rock in order to propose to his girlfriend over FaceTime.

In this specific instance, we can infer that \\"triple x\\" possibly refers to the action film \\"XXX\\" (pronounced as \\"Triple X\\") released in 2002 and starring Vin Diesel as the lead actor. However, since the provided phrase doesn't offer any explicit information about the reviewer's opinion or sentiment toward the film, it is insufficient to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The statement itself could be seen as neutral, as it does not contain any information or terms that would definitively indicate the writer's opinion on the movie. To better analyze the sentiment of a movie review, it's important to take into account the context in which the phrase appears. Typically, movie reviews contain statements about the plot, characters, acting, special effects, and the overall experience of watching the movie, including emotional reactions, thoughts, and opinions. These can range from feelings of happiness and excitement to boredom and disappointment, which define whether the overall sentiment of the review is positive, negative, or neutral. To ensure an accurate sentiment analysis, the statement should contain adjectives, adverbs, or other descriptive phrases that indicate the reviewer's feelings. For example, the statement \\"I loved Triple X because of its adrenaline-pumping action sequences\\" would be considered positive, while a statement like \\"I hated Triple X for its weak acting and nonsensical plot\\" would be considered negative. A neutral statement might be something like \\"Triple X is an action movie released in 2002 that stars Vin Diesel,\\" which does not convey the reviewer's opinion or emotions. In conclusion, the sentiment of the provided phrase \\"triple x\\" cannot be accurately determined based on the information given, as it lacks contextual details and emotional descriptors that would specify whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. For a more comprehensive sentiment analysis, it's crucial to have a broader understanding of the context and emotions expressed within the movie review."},{"instruction":"If \\"A woman in a dark shirt stands facing, but looking away from the large aquarium window she is leaning against, while a seal swims on the other side of the glass.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A woman is leaning against a large aquarium.\\"?","output":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"A woman is leaning against a large aquarium\\" based on the initial statement. Let's break down the original statement and analyze the information provided so we can understand why this is true. The original statement provides a few key pieces of information that directly relate to the claim: 1. \\"A woman in a dark shirt\\" - This part of the statement tells us that there is a woman, and she is wearing a dark shirt. 2. \\"stands facing, but looking away from the large aquarium window\\" - This part informs us about the woman's position and orientation in relation to the large aquarium window. She is standing and facing the window, though she is not directly looking at it. 3. \\"she is leaning against\\" - This crucial part of the statement tells us that the woman is not just standing near the window, but she is actually leaning against it. This confirms that she is in physical contact with the window and, by extension, the aquarium itself. 4. \\"while a seal swims on the other side of the glass\\" - This part doesn't directly relate to the woman leaning against the aquarium, but it does provide context about what's happening inside the aquarium, further establishing the presence of the large aquarium. Based on the information provided in the original statement, we can draw a conclusion that the woman is indeed leaning against a large aquarium.

In these faiths, Krishna is considered a supreme deity, and by offering your food to Krishna first, it's traditionally thought that it purifies the meal and absolves those who consume it from any negative karma associated with the killing of the plants or animals that were harvested for the food. The specifics of this belief can vary among different traditions or interpretations. Some believe that by making a conscientious act of devotion, such as offering your food to a deity, it helps foster an attitude of mindfulness and gratitude about everything. Others interpret it more literally and believe such an offering can actually change the spiritual nature of the food. It's important to note that this interpretation can also vary depending on a person's specific beliefs about how karma operates. For example, some people might interpret karma only in terms of intentional actions, while others might believe seemingly \\"indirect\\" actions, such as consuming food that indirectly came from causing harm, can also generate karma.

When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk. Now, I have a new situation: James spent a lot of time indoors, and didn't get out much like Rob, his friend, who loved outdoors stuff. Answer this question please: Which friend breathes more fresh air on a daily basis? A:","output":"Given the information provided, Rob, who loves the outdoors, is the friend who breathes more fresh air on a daily basis. Here is the step-by-step justification: 1. James spends a lot of time indoors, while Rob spends more time outdoors. 2. Indoor air pollution can be a significant health risk when there is not enough fresh air circulating inside. 3. People typically spend more time indoors, which can cause exposure to indoor air pollution. 4. In contrast, spending time outdoors exposes a person to fresh air, which is less polluted than the indoor environment.

Define membrane potential 2. Discuss factors influencing membrane potential 3. Explain how an increase in membrane potential occurs 4. Elaborate on the significance of an increased membrane potential Step 1: Define membrane potential Membrane potential is the electrical potential difference (voltage) across the cell membrane due to the separation of charged particles (ions) between the cell's interior and exterior. The membrane potential is typically expressed in millivolts (mV). Step 2: Discuss factors influencing membrane potential The membrane potential is influenced by the concentration of ions, such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and calcium (Ca2+) inside and outside the cell. Ionic gradients are maintained by ion channels, which selectively let ions pass through the membrane, and ion pumps, which actively transport ions against their concentration gradients utilizing cellular energy. Step 3: Explain how an increase in membrane potential occurs An increase in a cell's membrane potential typically refers to the process of membrane potential becoming more positive or less negative. This occurs when the distribution of ions across the membrane becomes less polarized (i.e., the difference in charge between the inside and outside of the cell decreases). An increase in membrane potential can be caused by the influx of positive ions (such as Na+ or Ca2+) into the cell or the efflux of negative ions (such as Cl-) from the cell. Opening of specific ion channels can trigger these processes. Step 4: Elaborate on the significance of an increased membrane potential An increased membrane potential plays a crucial role in neuronal signaling, particularly during the initiation and propagation of action potentials. In neurons, an increase in membrane potential (depolarization) may bring the membrane potential closer to the threshold potential, at which point an action potential is triggered. Action potentials are all-or-none electrical events that transmit information along the neuron's axon and ultimately lead to the release of neurotransmitters. This process is essential for communication between neurons, allowing the nervous system to function effectively."},{"instruction":"Sentence from a movie review: the first mistake Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"As an AI, I am unable to access the preceding review since only a single sentence is provided.

Vice Minister of Health Gao Qiang told reporters in Beijing that the \\"public health care system in China is insufficient.\\" The Vice Minister of Health also suggested that the government would pick up the costs of care to earthquake victims, many of whom have little or no insurance: \\"The government should be responsible for providing medical treatment to them,\\" he said.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer is:","output":"The area that has been largely neglected by China's economic rise, according to the provided text, is the public healthcare system, particularly in inland areas such as Sichuan. The issue is further intensified by a widening disparity between the prosperous urban dwellers and the struggling rural inhabitants. The public health care system's inadequacies directly impact these populations, reflecting the neglect of some regions amid China's economic surge. Numerous individuals in these regions have limited or no insurance, an issue that has gained attention following the earthquake that struck Sichuan. This state of underinvestment and inattention is made clear by the quotes from Vice Minister of Health Gao Qiang, who asserted that Chinese public healthcare's capacity is insufficient, and the government should cover the medical treatment costs for earthquake victims, most of whom lack adequate insurance. So, the area that remains untouched by the economic prosperity of China, as underlined by experts in the text, is the public health care system with more emphasis on the more rural and inland regions, reflecting a broader systemic neglect rather than a specific geographic region. This issue highlights the social inequality prevailing in China despite its fast-paced economic growth. This reality paints a picture of two Chinas: one urban and prospering, and the other rural and struggling. The government's role in addressing these healthcare disparities, particularly following unprecedented events like the Sichuan earthquake, underscores the gravity of these inequities."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What's the answer to that question: where did pres. obama go to school?

Article: Speakers of different languages not only describe the world differently but think about it differently too, according to a new study. Researchers used a cartoon cat Sylvester to study how language was reflected in the gestures people made. Dr. Sotaro Kita of the University of Bristol's Department of Experimental Psychology , showed the cartoon to a group of native English, Japanese and Turkish speakers and then watched their gestures as they described the actions they had seen. He found speakers of the three different languages used different gestures to describe the same event, which appeared to reflect the way the structure of their languages expressed that event. For example, when describing a scene where the cat swings on a rope, the English speakers used gestures showing an arc trajectory and the Japanese and Turkish speakers tended to use straight gestures showing the motion but not the arc. Dr. Kita suggests this is because Japanese and Turkish have no proper verb to express the English meaning \\"to swing\\". While English speakers use the arc gesture as their language can readily express the change of location and the arc-shaped trajectory, Japanese and Turkish speakers cannot as easily express the idea of movement with an arc trajectory so they use the straight gesture. Dr. Kita said, \\"My research suggests that speakers of different languages cause different spatial images of the same event in a way that matches the expressive possibilities of their own languages. In other words, language influences spatial thinking at the moment of speaking.\\" Question: 70.What is mainly discussed in the text?

The social experiment was the idea of Jason Roberts, who hosts the YouTube channel Simple Misfits. Scroll down for video Jason Roberts, left, who hosts the YouTube channel Simple Misfits and his friend Quentin Brunson, right, carried out a social experience to film the different reactions to them breaking into a car The mechanic who arrived was black and","output":"immediately noticed the disparity in reactions as he began to assist with the \\"break-in.\\" In the video, when Roberts, a white male, attempted to break into the car, passersby either ignored him or assumed he owned the vehicle and was experiencing technical issues. Some bystanders even stopped to help Roberts open the car without questioning his motives or calling the authorities. This demonstrated the implicit bias individuals may possess, associating a white person carrying out such an act with innocence or rightful ownership. On the other hand, when Quentin Brunson, a black male, attempted the break-in, the responses were alarmingly different. Many people stopped and stared at him suspiciously, recording his actions on their smartphones. Some openly accused him of theft, while others immediately called the police. The experiment revealed a stark contrast in perceptions, showing that people are more likely to associate criminal acts with black individuals. The black mechanic, witnessing these events, experienced a range of emotions, including frustration, disappointment, and sadness. The man realized how pervasive racism and prejudice continue to be in American society. He stated that his experience as a mechanic has exposed him to microaggressions and racial profiling in the past, but witnessing this social experiment brought a new perspective to the forefront. The video highlights the ongoing issue of racial bias, which still permeates various aspects of American life. It raises awareness about the implicit stereotypes that people may unknowingly carry, leading them to treat individuals of different races differently when encountering similar situations. The social experiment exposes the double standards that still exist, unintentionally contributing to systemic racism. Roberts and Brunson, in collaboration with the mechanic, hope that the footage sparks an open and honest discussion about race and inequality in the United States. They want to encourage individuals to question their biases and assumptions, fostering empathy, understanding, and positive change. In this way, the video serves as a sobering reminder that substantial progress is needed to rid American society of racial prejudice and disparities. Moving forward, the creators of the social experiment emphasize the importance of ongoing activism, promoting racial equity, and addressing the root causes of these biases. They hope that generating awareness will lead to policy changes, educational initiatives, and community-based efforts aimed at fostering a more just, equitable, and accepting society for all Americans, regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic background. In conclusion, the video created by Roberts and Brunson reveals the deep-rooted racial biases present in American society. It highlights the need for a shift in mindset and emphasizes the urgency of addressing the issue of racial inequality. By generating a thought-provoking conversation, the creators of the social experiment hope to inspire change and bring awareness to the systemic racism that continues to plague the United States."},{"instruction":"Write the answer: What was the title of John Wayne's last movie, made in 1976?","output":"John Wayne's last movie, made in 1976, was called \\"The Shootist\\".

Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street.

Answer:","output":"Austen Harrison"},{"instruction":"Imagine a question and stream-of-consciousness explanation for which this is the answer: yes","output":"Question: Is it possible to perform household tasks more efficiently using a multitasking approach? Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When we think of accomplishing daily household tasks, we usually consider completing them one at a time. This approach often leaves us feeling like there isn't enough time in the day to finish everything on our to-do list. However, there may be a better way to tackle these tasks: multitasking. Multitasking involves doing two or more things at once, which can lead to increased efficiency and productivity. For instance, consider the process of doing laundry. While the washer runs, you could also tackle cleaning the kitchen. As the dishwasher takes care of your dirty dishes, you might squeeze in a quick workout or prepare dinner. By effectively managing these tasks concurrently, you can save valuable time and energy. Now, there is some debate about whether multitasking is actually beneficial, as it can sometimes result in more errors or reduced attention. But when it comes to household tasks, it's generally easier to multitask since the activities usually require less critical thinking or problem-solving skills. Plus, as you become more experienced with multitasking and develop a rhythm for switching between tasks, you'll likely reduce the negative consequences associated with multitasking. To sum up, using multitasking as a way to perform household tasks can be helpful in adding efficiency to our daily routines. This approach allows us to accomplish more things in the same amount of time, ultimately freeing up more moments for relaxation and leisure. So, can multitasking make our household chores more efficient? The answer is yes."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: (This synopsis contains spoilers.)\\"Bruce Almighty\\" is the story of a news reporter named Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) who covers fluff stories for TV news in Buffalo, New York.

The premise and the hypothesis are separate statements that describe different scenarios, and there is no direct connection between them. In the premise, we learn that there is a man walking with two donkeys, and one of those donkeys is carrying a heavy load. This statement focuses on the man and the donkeys, explaining the situation in which they find themselves. There is no mention of any harmful interaction between the man and the donkeys. This statement seems to describe a peaceful, uneventful scenario, where the donkeys are presumably helping the man transport the heavy load. On the other hand, the hypothesis, \\"A donkey eating a man,\\" describes a completely different and violent situation. This statement is disturbing and implies a dangerous situation where a donkey is attacking and consuming a human being. This action is highly unlikely, as donkeys are herbivorous animals, and they do not naturally possess predatory instincts towards humans or other animals. In conclusion, the premise provided does not give us any information or evidence to determine the truth of the hypothesis. The two statements describe separate events without a direct connection, and one cannot be used to support or discredit the other. The premise describes a scenario involving a man and two donkeys working together to transport a load, while the hypothesis details a surreal and unlikely situation in which a donkey harms a human."},{"instruction":"I am so so so so so bored of studying REALLY... anyone got any other ideas than studying?

Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.

Q: Article: The young policeman, Constable Rider, walked more quickly than usual, because of the cold, but he did not consciously neglect any part of his work. His torch flashed on doorways and windows as he looked for anything that was at all suspicious, and when he ever thought that anything was unusual, he went to try the door and window, probably unheard by the people sleeping in the room just above his head. As he turned a corner, he heard a slight rustling sound -- it might be a cat, it could even be a dog, although few dogs wandered about at night. Rider saw nothing. A cat then? Usually if you disturbed a cat, it ran off and jumped, and you heard or noticed something else. By doing a lot of night, you learned to notice these things, but now all Rider noticed was the silence which had followed the rustling sound. So he acted cautiously. He did not flash his torch about the houses near the corner but walked on, and, a little way from the spot where he heard the sound, stopped and bent his head, as if he was lighting a cigarette. A policeman who stopped to light a cigarette seemed the most unsuspicious policeman in the world. There was still no sound. There were bushes in the garden of the house where Rider had first heard it and he knew that a man could hide there out of sight. But if he went back, it would warn any such man. So instead he stood and shone his torch at the window nearest him, and as if he had noticed something unusual, he walked towards it and opened the wooden gate, which made no sound at all. He reached the entrance and shone the torch on the keyhole of the front door -- and as he did so, the rustle came again, this time much more softly. He looked round quickly.

Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls for himself and his queen. It was rebuilt by Edward I at a cost of over £300 and again by Henry VIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19th century. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built at the same time as the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a portcullis and gate. The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16th century, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663 just over £4,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor. answer the following question: What building as it currently stands dates from the period of Henry VIII?

Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment.

More than simply an inquiry into Cambodias experience, however, ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE is a profound meditation on the nature of good and evil, shedding light on the capacity of some people to do terrible things and for others to forgive them.Winner of a dozen top documentary festival awards, including a Special Jury Prize at Sundance and the Grand Jury Award at the Full Frame Documentary Festival, this is a riveting film that takes audiences as close to witnessing evil as they are ever likely to get. It is also a personal journey into the heart of darkness by journalist/filmmaker Thet Sambath, whose family was wiped out in the Killing Fields, but whose patience and discipline elicits unprecedented on-camera confessions from perpetrators at all levels of the Khmer Rouge hierarchy. This is investigative journalism of the highest order.In 1974, Thet Sambaths father became one of the nearly two million people who were murdered by the Khmer Rouge when he refused to give them his buffalo. Sambaths mother was forced to marry a Khmer Rouge militiaman and died in childbirth in 1976, while his eldest brother disappeared in 1977. Sambath himself escaped Cambodia at age 10 when the Khmer Rouge fell in 1979.Fast forward to 1998, and Sambath, now a journalist, got to know the children of some senior Khmer Rouge cadre and gradually earned their trust. Then, for a decade, he spent weekends visiting the home of the most senior surviving leader, Nuon Chea, aka Brother Number Two under Pol Pot. But he never used to say anything different from what he told Western journalists, says Sambath, I was low-ranking, I knew nothing, I am not a killer.

Historically, the term was invented by Russian Turkologists like Nikita Bichurin in the 19th century to replace the term Chinese Turkestan, which referred to the Tarim Basin in the southwestern part of Xinjiang province of the Qing dynasty. The medieval Persian toponym \\"Turkestan\\" and its derivatives were not used by the local population of the greater region, and China had its own name for an overlapping area since the Han Dynasty as Xiyu, with the parts controlled by China termed Xinjiang from the 18th century onward. The historical Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is Altishahr, which means \\"six cities\\" in Uyghur. - The World Uyghur Congress (WUC) is an international organisation of exiled Uyghur groups that aspires to \\"represent the collective interest of the Uyghur people\\" both inside and outside of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China.

The statement \\"want to see another car chase, explosion or gunfight again\\" suggests that the film contains numerous action sequences, which have become repetitive and uninteresting for the critic. The sarcastic tone in the review indicates that the critic is displeased and tired of watching the same scenes over and over again. Moreover, it appears that the critic is disappointed with the lack of originality and variety in the movie. This comment can also be an observation of the greater trend in action films and their overreliance on these various tropes, such as car chases, explosions, and gunfights. This could represent a broader taste or expectation from a critic seeking something fresh rather than simply recycling old ideas. Additionally, it is possible that the critic values other aspects of filmmaking that are overshadowed by the continuous action in the movie. This could include character development, plot complexity, engaging dialogue, and cinematography – elements that have been sidelined to prioritize the on-screen spectacle. In this case, the critic is expressing dissatisfaction in this particular film and possibly urging the industry to divert from the trend of focusing primarily on high-octane action sequences. To summarize, the critic's thoughts regarding the movie are negative because of the repetitive nature of the action scenes, lack of originality and depth in the film, and the overemphasis on spectacle rather than substance. This short review reflects a desire for something more innovative and engaging within the action film genre."},{"instruction":"Succeeding the EOS 5D Mark II, it was announced on 2 March 2012, the 25th anniversary of the announcement of the first camera in the EOS line, the EOS 650, and was also Canon's 75th anniversary.

Doctors believed the 15-year-old was suffering from appendicitis and operated to remove the organ. Upon opening her up, they were shocked to find scores of writhing and glistening worms all over her appendix. The girl had gone to the Royal Cornwall Hospital, Truro, complaining of nausea and pain on her right side, near to her hip. Immediately the doctors suspected appendicitis as she was displaying typical symptoms. A 15-year-old went to hospital with nausea and pain in her side, and doctors believed she had appendicitis. But when they opened her up, they discovered scores of writhing worms (pictured) all over her appendix But blood tests, a urine sample and an ultrasound results came back clear of infection, which puzzled the medics. They decided to operate because they couldn’t definitively rule out appendicitis – which can kill if left untreated. Dr Luke Allen, part of the medical team who cared for the patient, said they decided to perform a laparoscopy. This is a type of keyhole surgery that allows access to the inside of the stomach without having to make large incisions in the skin. A camera was also inserted, which is how doctors were able to film the procedure. The operation showed no disease in the ovaries, uterus and small bowel, but bizarrely, the appendix was ‘lily white’ when it is usually pink or red. While they were preparing the appendix for removal they were shocked when a ‘multitude of worms’ came out of it. They swiftly removed the appendix and sucked up any stray worms with a suction pipe, preventing them from falling into her abdominal cavity. Doctors confirmed the unnamed girl was suffering from an intestinal infection called pinworm - caused by tiny parasitic worms. The unnamed girl was suffering from an intestinal infection called pinworm - caused by tiny parasitic worms. Pictured are pinworm eggs under the microscope Also called threadworms, this one of the most common type of worm infections in the UK and US. Global estimates of prevalence of the condition in children range from 61 per cent in India to 29 per cent in Denmark. The prevalence in British children may be as high as 50 per cent, doctors said. Pinworms are not harmful but are contagious. They get into the body when people ingest the microscopic pinworm eggs that can be found on contaminated hands and surfaces underwear, toilets, kitchen counters and food. The eggs pass into the digestive system and hatch in the small intestine. From the small intestine, pinworm larvae continue their journey to the large intestine, where they live as parasites, with their heads attached to the inside wall of the bowel. After removal of the pinworms during surgery, the girl along with her family, were treated with medications to kill any of remaining parasites and eggs. Her pain disappeared and she made a full recovery. ||||| Woman admitted to intensive care after infection from pet dog An elderly woman was admitted to intensive care due to organ failure following a rare, yet potentially life-threatening infection believed to be transmitted by her household pet, an Italian greyhound. Writing in the online journal BMJ Case Reports, doctors who treated the 70-year-old patient explain that she developed acute kidney failure after a few days of being admitted to hospital. Paramedics discovered her slumped in a chair, with decreased consciousness, after she had slurred speech and became unresponsive while on the telephone to a relative. Upon admission to hospital, her symptoms temporarily improved, but on the fourth day, she developed confusion, headache, diarrhoea, and rigors, along with high fever. She was transferred to intensive care for kidney failure. Blood cultures revealed Capnocytophaga canimorsus, a rare yet significant cause of sepsis. It is a bacterium frequently isolated in the oral cavities of cats and dogs. After two weeks of intensive care and antibiotic treatment, the patient made a full recovery. Only 13 cases of sepsis related to C. canimorsus have been reported in the UK since 1990. Mortality rates of 26%, with 60% of cases reporting a dog bite and 24% reporting other dog contact, have been documented. \\"This is an interesting case\\", the doctors explain, \\"because neither scratch nor bite was established, although close petting including licks was reported.\\" Diseases which can be transmitted to humans from animals are frequently missed diagnoses, explain the doctors, and they summarise important infections transmitted by cats and dogs (see table 1). Pinworms found in teenage girl's appendix **video available** A teenage girl admitted to hospital with suspected appendicitis was found to have pinworms in her appendix (see video footage), according to an article published in the online journal BMJ Case Reports. The 15-year-old patient was admitted to the paediatric department in the UK following abdominal pain with nausea, but without vomiting. Her pain was located on the right hand side of her hip, a common sign of appendicitis. Even though blood tests, a urine sample and abdominal ultrasound were inconclusive, surgeons decided to operate because appendicitis is a common and potentially life threatening condition. After removal of the pinworms during surgery, the girl along with her family, were treated with medications to kill any of remaining parasites and eggs. Her pain disappeared and she made a full recovery. After surgery, microscopic examination confirmed the presence of pinworms and absence of appendicitis. Parasitic worms are one of the most common infections worldwide. Estimates suggest that up to 50% of British children may have a related infection. Concerns over traditional Indian herbal remedy A 26-year-old student developed lead poisoning from taking Indian Ayurvedic herbal medicine, write doctors in the online journal BMJ Case Reports. During a trip to India, he took the herbal medications to treat his low back pain. On returning to the USA, he began to use them regularly, but developed pain in the upper central region of his abdomen, weight loss, dark stools, nausea and vomiting. A blood test showed he was suffering from anaemia and a high level of lead in his blood. No other source of lead exposure was evident, so doctors advised him to discontinue use of his four different types of Ayurvedic medications. He was given morphine and medications for nausea and vomiting. Treatment to remove excess iron, known as chelation therapy, was initiated, and within months the patient's symptoms resolved. \\"This case follows similar reports in the USA of acute lead toxicity from Ayurvedic medications produced in India,\\" writes Dr Judith Green-McKenzie, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. \\"Concern regarding the use of Ayurvedic herbal medicines originates from their easy availability, increasingly international use and global reach, lack of focused scientific research and the possibility of abuse in an unregulated industry,\\" she concludes. # ||||| Casual Agent: The nematode (roundworm) Enterobius vermicularis (previously Oxyuris vermicularis) also called human pinworm. (Adult females: 8 to 13 mm, adult male: 2 to 5 mm. ) Humans are considered to be the only hosts of E. vermicularis. A second species, Enterobius gregorii, has been described and reported from Europe, Africa, and Asia. For all practical purposes, the morphology, life cycle, clinical presentation, and treatment of E. gregorii is identical to E. vermicularis. Life Cycle: Eggs are deposited on perianal folds . Self-infection occurs by transferring infective eggs to the mouth with hands that have scratched the perianal area . Person-to-person transmission can also occur through handling of contaminated clothes or bed linens. Enterobiasis may also be acquired through surfaces in the environment that are contaminated with pinworm eggs (e.g. , curtains, carpeting). Some small number of eggs may become airborne and inhaled. These would be swallowed and follow the same development as ingested eggs. Following ingestion of infective eggs, the larvae hatch in the small intestine and the adults establish themselves in the colon . The time interval from ingestion of infective eggs to oviposition by the adult females is about one month. The life span of the adults is about two months. Gravid females migrate nocturnally outside the anus and oviposit while crawling on the skin of the perianal area . The larvae contained inside the eggs develop (the eggs become infective) in 4 to 6 hours under optimal conditions . Retroinfection, or the migration of newly hatched larvae from the anal skin back into the rectum, may occur but the frequency with which this happens is unknown.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about the implementation of new guidelines aimed at regulating and organizing the global Internet domain name market to foster a more orderly system and contribute to the growth of electronic commerce. The updated rules, which became effective on Friday, seek to address concerns related to the governance, registration, and management of domain names in the digital world. The domain name market refers to the buying, selling, and registering of domain names, which essentially serve as the website addresses that individuals and businesses use to establish their online presence. As the Internet continues to grow and evolve, the number of domain names has increased significantly, making it essential to have well-defined guidelines and rules in place to ensure smooth and efficient functioning. These new guidelines may include measures like tightening the registration process to prevent cybersquatting (registering domain names in the hope of reselling at a higher price or misleading customers), streamlining the dispute resolution process to handle conflicts between domain registrants, and enhancing the management of domain name extensions (e.g., .com, .org, .net) to support the diversification of the market. By implementing these new regulations, the governing bodies responsible for managing the domain name system aim to create a more reliable and accessible digital world for everyone. In turn, this should result in boosting electronic commerce, as businesses and consumers can more confidently engage in online transactions with greater trust in the stability and security of the domain names.

This indicates that Carson's primary intention was to spend meaningful time with their daughter and bond over the activity of reading together. Answer A (teach their daughter to read) and Answer B (show what they read when they were an adult) are both related to the specific activity of reading, but they do not capture the main purpose of the situation as much as Answer C does. In the context, it's evident that Carson wants to create a shared experience with their daughter and foster a positive relationship. This can be achieved by engaging in activities that they both enjoy, like reading. Choosing a book as the medium for their bonding experience can also spark conversations, evoke emotions, and stimulate imagination. This helps create lasting memories between the parent and the child. Furthermore, spending quality time together is essential for the overall well-being and growth of a child. It fosters emotional closeness, builds trust, and strengthens family bonds. By investing time in sharing experiences and enjoying each other's company, Carson is not only providing their daughter with a sense of love and security, but they are also setting the foundation for a healthy and enduring parent-child relationship.

In 1885 and '86, after winning N.L. pennants, the White Stockings met the short-lived American Association champion in that era's version of a World Series. Both seasons resulted in match ups with the St. Louis Brown Stockings, with the clubs tying in 1885 and with St. Louis winning in 1886. This was the genesis of what would eventually become one of the greatest rivalries in sports. In all, the Anson-led Chicago Base Ball Club won six National League pennants between 1876 and 1886. As a result, Chicago's club nickname transitioned, and by 1890 they had become known as the Chicago Colts, or sometimes \\"Anson's Colts\\", referring to Cap's influence within the club. Anson was the first player in history credited with collecting 3,000 career hits. After a disappointing record of 59-73 and a 9th-place finish in 1897, Anson was released by the Cubs as both a player and manager. Due to Anson's absence from the club after 22 years, local newspaper reporters started to refer to the Cubs as the \\"Orphans\\".

Theories ranged from it being Martian art to a volcanic eruption– but now geologists believe there could be a simpler explanation. They claim it was caused a geologic condition called 'collapsible soils' where refilling of a lake caused soil to collapse, creating a small eruption. Gary Dalton and his two brothers recently discovered a round hole or crater in the bottom of their irrigation pond on their farmland in Circleville, in Piute County, Utah. The outer ring is a depression filled with algae. An inner circle looks as though something erupted from beneath, forming what looks like a small volcanic crater WHAT ARE 'COLLAPSIBLE SOILS'? This type of soil that can rapidly settle or collapse the ground is known as collapsible soil. 'Hydrocompactive soil' is the most common type of collapsible soil. The term hydro – implies the introduction or presence of water, which is the case with the mystery crater. The pond has been drained and refilled more than a dozen times in the last two years. The theory is that the repeated loading of weight on the soil eventually led some of the soil under the pond to collapse, creating a small eruption. 'As it collapsed and compacted,' said geologist Bill Lund, 'it forced some air and some water up and created this thing. It looks like a one-off thing. It just happened one time. That's it.' The crater was discovered last month by Gary Dalton of Circleville after he saw an unusual hole in a lake. 'The sun was just right,' Mr Dalton said. 'So, I saw this blasted thing that no one had ever seen.' He noticed it after most of the water was drained from the pond for irrigation. Just beneath the surface he saw concentric circles in the pond bottom with a diameter of about 25ft (7.6 metres). The outer ring is a circular depression filled with algae. An inner circle looks as though something erupted from beneath, forming what looks startlingly like a small volcanic crater. 'My heck, I guess that's Martian art,' Mr Dalton said. 'I don't know.'

But Mr Lund said that theory was quickly disproved by aerial photos that were taken before the pond was excavated two-and-a-half years ago. 'This was an alfalfa field and there was no spring here,' Mr Lund said. 'It's not a spring.' The central depression is about 17.8cm (7in). The Dalton family were able to push the handle of a pitchfork another 33cm (13in) or so straight down in the soft centre THE THEORIES SO FAR Some had speculated that the feature was caused by a natural spring, pushing up from under the pond after being supercharged by recent rains. Another theory was that a buried pipeline had been punctured during construction of the pond. But experts said there is no pipeline. Scientists then proposed that there was a burp of methane gas from decaying organic material under the pond. Earthquakes sometimes will cause similar features in sand or mud, due to liquefaction of soils. But there have no earthquakes in the Circleville area powerful enough.

This involves isolating the variable h on one side of the equation. In this case, you want to get rid of the \\"-14\\" on the left side of the equation. To isolate the variable h, add 14 to both sides of the equation to balance it out. Here's how you do it: 2h - 14 + 14 = 0 + 14, which simplifies to: 2h = 14. Step 3: Divide both sides by 2 in order to solve for h. 2h ÷ 2 = 14 ÷ 2, which results in h = 7.

Passage:HMS Defender was a D-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she was transferred to the China Station in early 1935. She was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea during late 1935 during the Abyssinia Crisis, before returning to her assigned station where she remained until mid-1939. Defender was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet just before World War II began in September 1939. She briefly was assigned to West Africa for convoy escort duties in 1940 before returning to the Mediterranean. The ship participated in the Battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan over the next year without damage. Defender assisted in the evacuations from Greece and Crete in April–May 1941, before she began running supply missions to Tobruk, Libya in June. The ship was badly damaged by a German bomber on one of those missions and had to be scuttled by her consort on 11 July 1941.

Oreo cookies 2. Pretzel sticks 3. M&M candies, preferably in brown or black 4. A knife or scissors (to cut the pretzel sticks) Step 2: Prepare spider's legs Using a knife or pair of scissors, I will carefully cut the pretzel sticks into smaller pieces that will serve as the spider's legs. Step 3: Insert legs into Oreo Given that a spider has eight legs, I will choose option (I) to make the Oreo look like a spider. I will carefully insert four pretzel stick pieces on each side of the Oreo, sticking out like a spider's legs. To do this, I can gently push the sticks into the cream filling of the Oreo, making sure not to break the cookie. Step 4: Add M&M candies as eyes To make the spider look more realistic, I will use two M&M candies (preferably brown or black) as the spider's eyes. To attach them, I can add some frosting or edible glue on the back of each M&M and stick it on the top edge of the Oreo, above the legs. Alternatively, I can gently push the M&Ms into the cream filling, making sure not to break the cookie. Step 5: Adjust the legs I can arrange the pretzel stick pieces so that they're evenly spaced and angle them in a way that makes them look like real spider legs. Step 6: Evaluate and repeat Finally, I will evaluate the outcome and decide if the Oreo spider looks realistic. If it needs adjustment, I will do so and repeat the process with other Oreos until I am satisfied with the result. In summary, I will create an Oreo spider by inserting pretzel sticks as legs and adding M&M candies for the eyes. These steps will help transform ordinary Oreo cookies into a fun and creative edible spider."},{"instruction":"43 Organizational and Technical Interfaces Add punctuation.","output":"4.3 Organizational and Technical Interfaces In a world where technology plays an increasing part in our everyday lives, it is crucial to understand the ways in which organizational and technical interfaces work together. These interfaces play significant roles in key aspects of businesses, manufacturing processes, systems engineering, and project management. Firstly, let us examine the organizational interfaces. Organizational interfaces refer to the interactions and linkages between various departments, teams, or stakeholders within an organization. These might include communication between departments, team meetings, and resource allocation. It is essential to recognize that organizational interfaces are critical for effective collaboration, as they allow different teams and departments to understand project goals, identify potential risks or issues, and effectively cooperate throughout the entire project or business process. Now, let us move on to technical interfaces. Technical interfaces are the connections and interactions between various technical systems, components or subsystems. These can include communication protocols, data exchange formats, or hardware and software integration. The primary goal of technical interfaces is to ensure seamless functionality between different technical processes, systems, or components. Considering the importance of organizational and technical interfaces, let us now examine the ways in which they must work together to accomplish the project and business objectives. 1. Clear communication and collaboration: For any project to succeed, effective communication and collaboration between organizational and technical interfaces is crucial. This may involve regular meetings or workshops between organizational managers and technical teams to ensure a clear understanding of project requirements and to coordinate their efforts toward achieving them. 2. Resource planning and allocation: It is essential for effective resource planning to consider both organizational and technical requirements. This can involve allocating human resources, such as project managers, engineers, or technicians, as well as physical resources, such as equipment or facilities. A thorough understanding of the interface needs will enable organizations to make better informed decisions about resource management. 3. Integration and compatibility: As the technical interfaces are designed and implemented, it is important that they are compatible with existing organizational processes, systems, and technologies. This may involve conducting compatibility tests or adapting existing processes to fit with new technologies. 4. Risk identification and management: Both organizational and technical interfaces pose potential risks and issues that may arise during a project or business process. Identifying these risks early on will allow stakeholders to develop appropriate mitigation strategies and effectively manage them. 5. Continuous improvement: Organizations must continually assess and review the effectiveness of organizational and technical interfaces to ensure continuous improvement and adaptation to changes in technology, project requirements, or business objectives. This may involve regular performance evaluations, feedback, and iterative adjustments to processes, systems, or technologies. In conclusion, organizational and technical interfaces play a vital role in modern businesses and projects. Understanding their functions, the interactions between them, and how they must work together to achieve project or business objectives is essential for success. With clear communication, collaboration, resource planning, integration, risk management, and continuous improvement, organizations can optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of these interfaces, ultimately leading to improved project outcomes and business performance."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Dust away the cobwebs. Use a mild dish soap. Clean around the edges. Article:","output":"Title: Deep Clean Your Home: Dusting Away the Cobwebs, Scrubbing with Mild Dish Soap, and Tackling the Edges Introduction A well-maintained and clean house is not just a matter of aesthetics, but it also plays an essential role in maintaining a healthy living environment. Dusting away the cobwebs, using a mild dish soap, and cleaning around the edges are all crucial steps in ensuring that your home remains spotless, clutter-free, and hygienic. Dusting Away the Cobwebs Cobwebs, those delicate and almost invisible structures spun by spiders, can be found lurking in corners and out-of-reach areas of a home. They may seem harmless, but cobwebs are capable of trapping significant amounts of dust, dirt, and allergens. In some cases, their presence may also trigger allergic reactions and respiratory issues. It's essential to routinely dust away the cobwebs to maintain a clean and healthy living space. Begin by using an extendable duster with a long handle, which will help reach high or hard-to-access areas. If you don't have an extendable duster, try attaching a cloth to a broom or mop handle. Fan the duster or cloth over each area gently to avoid breaking the delicate cobweb structures—the goal is to collect the cobwebs rather than break them apart, creating even more of a mess. Using Mild Dish Soap for Cleaning When it comes to cleaning surfaces like countertops, windows, and floors, mild dish soap is an excellent alternative to commercial cleaning solutions that may contain harsh chemicals. This is particularly relevant for households with young children, pets, or individuals with allergies or sensitivities to chemical irritants. To use mild dish soap for cleaning tasks, simply mix a few drops of the soap with water in a spray bottle or bucket (depending on the surface you wish to clean). This will create a gentle cleaning solution that will effectively remove dirt, grime, and stains without causing harm to your surfaces or emitting fumes. Apply the solution to the surface at hand and use a soft cloth or sponge to scrub gently. Once the surface is clean, use a damp cloth to remove any soap residue and then dry the area. Cleaning Around the Edges Often overlooked, the edges of our living spaces are where dirt, grime, and dust tend to accumulate. Neglecting these areas can lead to the gradual buildup of dirt, allergens, and potentially harmful microorganisms. To tackle the edges of your home, start by vacuuming or sweeping along your baseboards to remove loose debris. Next, mix your mild dish soap solution as described above. Use a microfiber cloth or sponge to scrub the edges, including the tight areas around your door and window frames, baseboards, and the edges of your countertops or cabinets. Don't forget to clean the top edge of wall trim, which can often collect large amounts of dust. A clean home is a healthy home, and the above-mentioned steps play a vital role in ensuring that your living space remains well-maintained and conducive to good health. Remember that consistency and regular maintenance are key to a clean home—dust away the cobwebs, use mild dish soap for scrubbing, and pay special attention to the edges of your living spaces to establish an orderly and hygienic environment that you and your family can thrive in."},{"instruction":"Q:- Suns heat enters atmosphere - Green house gases enter from the earth - Heat is trapped in atmosphere - Different things on earth are hotter What might be the last step of the process?

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, based on the given premise, it is possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true. The premise states that setting up a college fund for them was extremely important, mainly to avoid putting them through the same experiences the speaker went through. This strong emphasis on the importance of creating a college fund serves as the basis for the hypothesis, which simply restates the significance of the action. The hypothesis, \\"It was very important to us to set up a college fund,\\" is a reiteration of the core message conveyed in the premise. Therefore, if the premise is true, it logically follows that the hypothesis is also true. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that the premise and the hypothesis present the same idea: the importance of establishing a college fund for the children. The premise effectively communicates the urgency and significance of taking this step for the speaker, stemming from difficult personal experiences. On the other hand, the hypothesis distills this concept into a straightforward statement that encapsulates the central sentiment shared in the premise. In conclusion, if the premise, \\"a um college fund for them because it was just so important i said i don't want them to go through what i went through,\\" is true, then the hypothesis, \\"It was very important to us to set up a college fund,\\" is also true.

Here's a brief analysis of each option: A: More - High heat could cause certain materials (such as plastics) to melt or deform, potentially increasing the volume of those materials that needs to be separated and processed before they can be recycled. In some cases, this might lead to more materials being recycled. However, this also can depend on the recycling technology used and the specific materials in question. B: Less - In certain situations, high heat could cause some materials to become less recyclable if they are damaged or altered in a way that makes them difficult to recycle or if they lose their properties that make them valuable for recycling. For example, paper and cardboard might be damaged by exposure to excess moisture and heat, reducing their quality and recyclability. C: No effect - If the recycling process is well-controlled and the high heat does not significantly affect the properties or usability of the materials, it could have little or no effect on the recycled materials. Many recycling processes already involve some level of heat, and the equipment and processes may be specifically designed to accommodate and handle these temperatures. In conclusion, the effect of high heat on materials being recycled into new substances would depend on the specific materials, the stage of the recycling process where the heat is applied, and the technology and processes used in the recycling process. Thus, it's difficult to choose just one option (A, B, or C) as the correct answer, as the impact of heat on recycled materials could vary significantly and even have mixed effects depending on the context."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Agatha Christie's Marple (or simply Marple) is a British ITV television series loosely based on the books and short stories by British crime novelist Agatha Christie.

Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is probably true about the author? Pick from: (a). He/she is a chef; (b). He/she works out vigorously; (c). He/she is very health conscious; (d). not enough information; Answer:","output":"(c).

Sixty English-speaking teachers from Shanghai will be placed in schools from September to promote methods such as rigorous daily maths lessons and homework, ministers will announce today. The move, brokered by Education Minister Liz Truss following a fact-finding trip to China, is the latest in a series of initiatives aimed at reversing a slide in maths standards. It follows research showing that the children of cleaners and catering assistants in Shanghai were better at maths than the children of doctors and lawyers in Britain. Mrs Truss said: ‘We have some brilliant maths teachers in this country but what I saw in Shanghai, and other","output":"Chinese cities, has only strengthened my belief that we can learn much more from their approach to teaching maths. The emphasis on deep understanding, structured lessons, and mastery of core skills in Chinese methods has consistently led to impressive results. The children there are not necessarily more intelligent, but they benefit from a culture of discipline, hard work, and high expectations which enables them to excel in this crucial subject.’ The collaboration between British and Chinese educators is an important step toward enhancing the quality of mathematics education in the UK. Under this initiative, a significant number of Chinese teachers will come to British schools, not only to teach, but also to train and share their expertise with local educators. As part of a comprehensive strategy, the following measures are proposed to ensure the success of this initiative: 1) Training seminars and workshops should be held to familiarize the Chinese teachers with the British cultural context, curriculum, and pedagogical techniques. This will help them adapt to the new environment, bridge any cultural gaps, and tailor their methods to the needs of British students. 2) Collaboration between the British and Chinese teaching teams should be fostered, with regular meetings and joint planning sessions. This will facilitate the sharing of best practices, innovation, and the adaptation of new teaching methods. 3) The British government should invest in the development and distribution of high-quality teaching materials, including textbooks, exercise books, and digital resources, which support the Chinese teaching methodologies being introduced. 4) Regular assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of the program should be carried out to identify successes, challenges, and areas for improvement. Based on these findings, necessary adjustments could be made to achieve the desired outcomes. 5) A long-term commitment should be made to the program, ensuring continuous support, funding, and resources are available. Developing effective teaching methods and achieving significant improvements in math standards may take time, and sustained commitment is crucial in order to see the desired results. 6) A public relations campaign should be launched to promote the benefits of the Chinese teaching methods and gather support from parents, educators, and the wider community. This will help create a positive environment and mindset for change. The introduction of Chinese teaching methodologies in British schools has the potential to significantly improve mathematical proficiency and reverse the decline in standards. By adopting these six measures, the UK can ensure that their students have access to world-class math education and ultimately become more competitive in the global market."},{"instruction":"- The dishwasher heats the water - The detergent dispenser opens at the right time - Water is shot through the jets to clean the dishes - The dirty water is drained - More water is sprayed to rinse the dishes - The water is drained again - The air is heated in the dishwasher to dry the dishes. What might be the first step of the process?","output":"The first step of the dishwasher's cleaning process involves loading and organizing the dishes properly, ensuring it is connected to electricity and water, and selecting the appropriate wash cycle. 1.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The scenario mentioned above, where a person undergoes a complete physical more often, could have an indirect impact on kidney function. While the regular physical checkups themselves might not directly affect kidney function, the information obtained during these checkups can be employed to make lifestyle adjustments and decisions that might help the individual to maintain proper kidney health. 1. Directly impacting a step of the process: In this case, undergoing more frequent physical exams does not directly affect any step of the kidney functioning process. Kidneys will continue carrying out their tasks of filtering waste, regulating blood composition, maintaining blood volume, and preserving pH levels, regardless of how often an individual goes for a checkup. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: It is possible that, by having a complete physical exam more often, one would become more aware of their overall health status and any potential risks to their kidneys. Consequently, they may adopt a healthier lifestyle and engage in practices that promote better kidney function. For instance, they could monitor their blood pressure, maintain a balanced diet, drink sufficient water, and exercise regularly. These actions could indirectly contribute to improved kidney function and may help in preventing or delaying the onset of kidney-related problems. 3. Not impacting any step of the process: If an individual with regular physical checkups does not make the required lifestyle changes or is unable to achieve better kidney function through preventive strategies, it is possible that frequent physicals would not have any significant impact on their kidney health. In such cases, additional medical intervention may be required to manage or treat kidney-related issues. In summary, frequent complete physical exams can indirectly impact the kidney functioning process by raising awareness about health issues and encouraging individuals to adopt healthier habits that promote better kidney function.

This activity involves understanding different materials, tools, and construction techniques to ensure a safe and functional structure. Let's explore the steps, materials, and tools needed for building a treehouse. 1. Choosing the Tree: The first step involves assessing the available trees to determine their age, size, strength, and overall health, as they will be supporting the treehouse structure. It's essential to choose a mature, healthy tree with sturdy branches for added stability. 2. Designing the Treehouse: To create a suitable design, one needs to account for the tree's growth patterns and available space. The treehouse should include essential elements such as support beams, floor platforms, walls, a roof, windows, and an access point (like a ladder, staircase, or rope). 3. Acquiring Materials: Based on the design, there is a need to gather raw materials like weather-resistant wood (e.g., cedar or treated pine), screws and nails, hinges, roofing materials (e.g., shingles or corrugated metal), and windows. Additional elements like lighting, furnishings, and decorations will enhance the functionality and aesthetic appeal of the treehouse. 4. Tools: Adequate tools are crucial in building a treehouse. The essential tools include a saw, drill, hammer, wrench, level, measuring tape, ladder, and safety gear (such as gloves and safety goggles). 5. Constructing the Platform: The platform is the base on which the treehouse stands. To build the platform, one needs to attach support beams to the tree, construct a frame, and install the floorboards. The support structure must distribute the weight evenly and allow for tree growth, while not causing any harm to the tree. 6. Building the Walls: Next, the walls are constructed, taking into account the shape of the platform, the desired design, and the tree's branches. The walls can be pre-assembled on the ground and later attached to the platform for added convenience. Remember to leave space for windows and a door. 7. Installing the Roof: The roof provides protection against the weather and lends a finished look to the treehouse. Depending on the chosen design, the roof can be flat, angled, or curved. Be sure to use weather-resistant materials and consider proper drainage to avoid water pooling. 8. Access and Safety: A safe and secure entry to the treehouse is essential. Options like ladders, ropes, or stairs should be structurally sound and easy to use. Additionally, consider installing safety features like railings or a safety net around the treehouse and ensure all fastenings and load-bearing elements are secure. 9. Finishing Touches: Once the structure is complete, it's time to paint or coat the wood with a protective sealant. This will help preserve the lumber and improve the treehouse's overall appearance. Then, it's time to add lighting, furnishings, and decorations to personalize the space further. In conclusion, a task like building a treehouse requires knowledge of physical objects such as trees, materials, tools, and construction techniques. It's crucial that every aspect, from design to execution, is carefully planned and carried out to ensure the treehouse is safe, functional, and enjoyable to use."},{"instruction":"Question: What key details about betty harper can be extracted from the following bio?

Chain of thought:","output":"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of medications commonly prescribed for depression. They work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which is a neurotransmitter that helps stabilize mood. SSRIs are generally considered safe and effective for treating depression in adults, but there is some concern about their safety when used in teenagers and young adults. Here is a detailed chain of thought on this topic: 1. Age-specific risks: In 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black box warning for SSRIs, which is the most serious warning for prescription medications. This warning is specifically related to an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults (up to age 24) taking these medications for major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders. 2. Suicidal thoughts and behaviors: The increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors with SSRI use in young people is relatively small, but significant. The FDA analysis found that the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors was about 4% in patients treated with an SSRI, compared to 2% in those taking a placebo. It is important to note that the actual risk of a suicide attempt or completed suicide remains low, but any increase in such risk is cause for concern. 3. Monitoring and communication: Because of this increased risk, it is crucial for healthcare providers to closely monitor young patients taking SSRIs for any changes in mood, behavior, or suicidality, especially during the initial weeks of treatment or when medications are changed. It is equally important for parents and caregivers to maintain open communication with the patient and the healthcare provider during the course of treatment. 4. Risk-to-benefit considerations: Despite the potential risks associated with SSRIs for young people, they can still be a valuable treatment for depression. For some individuals, the benefits of using an SSRI to treat depression may outweigh the risks. The decision to prescribe an SSRI should always involve a careful evaluation of the risks and benefits in consultation with a qualified healthcare professional. 5. Alternative treatments: In situations where the risks of SSRIs appear to outweigh their benefits, other treatments can be considered. Psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), is an evidence-based non-pharmacological intervention that can be effective in treating depression in young people. Additionally, other classes of antidepressant medications (e.g., atypical antidepressants) may be considered based on the patient's specific circumstances and needs. 6. Adverse effects: Aside from the increased risk of suicidality, SSRIs are generally well-tolerated. However, they can cause side effects, including but not limited to insomnia, weight gain, headaches, gastrointestinal issues, and sexual dysfunction. These side effects can be more prevalent or harder to manage in teenagers and young adults, making it essential to monitor and adjust treatment plans accordingly. In conclusion, while SSRIs can be effective in treating depression for some teenagers and young adults, their safety profile in this age group is somewhat less favorable compared to that of adults. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors warrants close monitoring and clear communication between patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers when prescribing these medications to young people. As always, treatment decisions should involve a careful evaluation of the risks and benefits, and alternatives should be considered when appropriate."},{"instruction":"Definition: Given a sentence, generate what should be the most likely next statement.

But last week #39;s quake at Parkfield, Calif., is likely to be remembered for insights that could improve earthquake-hazard assessments, quake-resistant","output":"engineering, and perhaps even earthquake prediction. The Parkfield earthquake, which occurred on September 28, 2004, was a moderate magnitude 6.0 earthquake that struck the remote and sparsely populated community of Parkfield in central California. It was well anticipated by scientists, as the town has been the site of numerous earthquakes over the past century. Notably, Parkfield has experienced an earthquake of approximately magnitude six every 22 years since the 1800s, making it an ideal location for scientific study on earthquake behavior. The San Andreas Fault, where the quake occurred, is one of the most studied and monitored fault lines worldwide. This quake provided a unique opportunity for researchers to collect valuable data on fault activities that could be used to improve earthquake hazard assessments. The Parkfield Earthquake Prediction Experiment aimed to better understand the complex processes governing earthquake occurrences by measuring fault strain, seismic velocity, pre-shocks, and other triggering factors. The comprehensive array of instruments that were installed in the region allowed scientists to get a detailed view of the inner workings of earthquakes. One of the key insights gained from this quake was about the inner mechanics of earthquakes and how they can impact structural engineering and building codes. The extensive monitoring and data collection enabled researchers to make advancements in understanding how the ground motion caused by earthquakes can affect various structures. This knowledge, in turn, has informed the development of more robust building designs, improving earthquake-resistant engineering. The collected data from the Parkfield quake also helped refine hazard assessments by revealing that small earthquakes can occasionally have more destructive shaking than larger ones. This discovery has influenced the strategies for managing earthquake risks, emphasizing the need for adaptable and resilient building designs that can withstand the unexpected intensity of ground motions caused by quakes. Furthermore, the Parkfield experiment generated new insights into the complex and diverse nature of fault systems. While the regularity of earthquakes in Parkfield led many to believe that a linear pattern of seismic activity could be established, the 2004 quake proved that periodicity was less predictable than previously thought. Given this, researchers have adapted their seismological analysis techniques to identify precursory signals and generated more versatile predictive models. Although earthquakes are still highly unpredictable, the Parkfield earthquake has contributed valuable information. This event demonstrated that enhanced monitoring, coupled with thorough modeling, could improve both the accuracy of terrestrial hazard predictions and our understanding of the intricate fault mechanics that precede an earthquake. These insights have also informed public policy, leading to better infrastructure planning and building designs that are more resistant to earthquakes. In conclusion, the 2004 Parkfield earthquake serves as a paradigm of the scientific pursuit of understanding the complex processes of seismic activity. The data gleaned from this event has led to improvements in earthquake hazard assessments, quake-resistant engineering, and the continued development of predictive models. While this earthquake may not have made history for its destructive force, it remains a watershed moment in advancing our understanding and mitigation of natural disasters, ultimately making our world a safer place to live."},{"instruction":"Compose the next sentence for this paragraph.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: When considering whether it's possible to predict the exact weather conditions in a specific location several months in the future, it's essential to understand the inherent complexity and variability of weather systems. Weather is driven by numerous factors such as temperature, wind patterns, air pressure, ocean currents, and humidity levels. These factors constantly interact with each other, causing weather conditions to change dynamically over time. One of the primary tools used to forecast weather is computer-based numerical models, which simulate the Earth's atmosphere and oceans. These models receive input data from a vast array of sources, including satellite observations, weather stations, and aircraft, among others. When the models process this data, they generate forecasts by making calculations based on the laws of physics and the known behavior of the atmosphere. Despite the sophistication of these models, there are limitations in their ability to accurately predict weather weeks or months in advance. For starters, the models themselves have inherent uncertainties, which often stem from the approximations made in their equations and algorithms. These uncertainties propagate through the model, causing errors to accumulate as the forecast is extended further into the future. Additionally, the atmosphere is a chaotic system, meaning it is highly sensitive to even the smallest changes in initial conditions. This sensitivity results in small errors in data input and model representation, which can quickly grow into significant forecast errors over longer periods. This effect is often referred to as the \\"butterfly effect.\\" Moreover, technological limitations and gaps in observational data make it difficult to monitor the entirety of the Earth's surface in real-time, further limiting the potential accuracy of long-range forecasts. While modern weather forecasting methods can provide reasonably accurate predictions several days in advance, beyond that timeframe, forecasts become increasingly uncertain. The factors mentioned above, such as the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the limitations of numerical models, and the gaps in observational data, make it effectively impossible to predict the exact weather conditions down to the minute at a specific location months in advance.

Methods employed ranged from expulsion to outright genocide; within nations, often the threat of these extreme methods was sufficient to silence dissent. The history of antisemitism includes the First Crusade which resulted in the massacre of Jews; the Spanish Inquisition (led by Tomás de Torquemada) and the Portuguese Inquisition, with their persecution and autos-da-fé against the New Christians and Marrano Jews; the Bohdan Chmielnicki Cossack massacres in Ukraine; the Pogroms backed by the Russian Tsars; as well as expulsions from Spain, Portugal, England, France, Germany, and other countries in which the Jews had settled. According to a 2008 study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, 19.8% of the modern Iberian population has Sephardic Jewish ancestry, indicating that the number of conversos may have been much higher than originally thought. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What methods were never used on Jewish populations?","output":"While it is difficult to comprehensively list all the methods that were never used against Jewish populations throughout history, one can highlight a few notable examples of methods that were either not directed specifically at Jews or were not commonly employed. 1. Biological Warfare: Although Jewish communities have faced significant persecution and violence, there is no widespread historical evidence of the use of biological weapons to target Jews specifically. 2. Cyber Warfare: Since cyber warfare is a modern form of aggression, it has not had a historical impact on Jewish populations. While instances of online antisemitism exist, it is not comparable to the large-scale, state-sponsored persecution experienced by Jews in the past. 3. Forced Mass Migration: While Jews have faced expulsions from various countries, there is no known instance of an entire Jewish population being forcibly relocated as a collective group to a specific, distant location. This starkly contrasts with incidences like the Trail of Tears for Native Americans and the Armenian Genocide, where entire populations were forced to move en masse. 4. Cultural Assimilation Policies: While some regimes have sought to assimilate Jews into the broader population to reduce their distinctiveness, direct, large-scale policies specifically targeting Jews for cultural assimilation, similar to Canada's residential schools for indigenous peoples, have not been widely documented. Most assimilation efforts in Jewish history were either voluntary or involved small groups of people converting under duress. 5. Forced Sterilization: Throughout history, there have been instances of forced sterilizations as part of eugenics movements or population control efforts, such as in Nazi Germany (not only against Jewish populations) or the United States (targeting various minority groups). However, large-scale sterilization campaigns were not a significant aspect of the persecution faced by Jews specifically. It is crucial to remember that this list is not exhaustive and there may be other methods that were not used against Jews. However, the scale of antisemitism and persecution throughout history makes it challenging to entirely rule out any specific method as entirely unused against Jewish populations. It is always essential to approach sensitive historical topics like antisemitism with empathy and understanding, recognizing the deep and lasting impact it has had on Jewish communities worldwide."},{"instruction":"Test for natural language inference.

Ancient Greece was not a unified nation as we know today, but rather a collection of city-states or \\"poleis\\" with their own governing systems. The political structures in ancient Greece varied from monarchies, oligarchies, tyrannies, and the most famous system, democracy. While the term \\"republic\\" is commonly associated with the Roman Republic, the ancient Greek political system, particularly the Athenian democracy, does share some similarities. The closest approximation to the establishment of the Greek republic, in the context of democracy, is the emergence of the Athenian democratic system. The Athenian democracy was not just formed in an instant or on a specific date. It was more of a gradual process, evolving through reforms implemented by several lawgivers and influential figures. Here are some key events and figures in the development of democracy in Athens: 1. Draco's reforms (circa 621 BCE): Draconian law was the first written code of law in Athens and introduced the idea of a constitution. The laws were known for their harshness and brutality, but this marked a significant step towards a more organized legal system. 2. Solon's reforms (circa 594 BCE): Solon was an Athenian lawmaker and is considered one of the \\"Seven Wise Men of Greece.\\" He introduced a series of significant reforms to Athenian society, including political, social, and economic changes. These reforms, such as cancelling farmers' debts and dividing the population into four classes based on wealth, laid the groundwork for a more democratic Athenian society. 3. Cleisthenes' reforms (circa 508/507 BCE): Cleisthenes is often referred to as the \\"Father of Athenian Democracy\\" for his significant contribution to the formation of the democratic system in Athens. He introduced the concept of \\"isonomia,\\" which means equal rights and participation for all citizens. His reform included a new way of organizing the citizens into ten tribes, the creation of the Boule (Council of Five Hundred), and the establishment of ostracism, which allowed the citizens to vote out a politician considered harmful to the democracy. As you can see, the establishment of what could be called an \\"ancient Greek republic,\\" in the context of Athenian democracy, was not a single event that happened at a specific date. Instead, it was a gradual process that took place over several centuries with significant contributions from various leaders and lawgivers in ancient Greece."},{"instruction":"Karen had the giant box of crayons, containing twice as many crayons as were in Beatrice's box.

If Karen's box contained 128 crayons, how many crayons were in Judah's box? Let's be accurate as possible.","output":"Let's break this down step by step. 1. Karen's box contains 128 crayons. 2. Karen's box has twice as many crayons as Beatrice's box. 3. Beatrice's box has twice as many crayons as Gilbert's box. 4. Gilbert's box has four times as many crayons as Judah's box. We'll start by finding how many crayons are in each person's box, working our way down from Karen to Judah. 1. Since Karen's box contains twice as many crayons as Beatrice's box, we divide Karen's crayon count (128) by 2: 128 / 2 = 64 crayons. So, Beatrice's box contains 64 crayons. 2. Since Beatrice's box contains twice as many crayons as Gilbert's box, we divide Beatrice's crayon count (64) by 2: 64 / 2 = 32 crayons. So, Gilbert's box contains 32 crayons. 3. Since Gilbert's box contains four times as many crayons as Judah's box, we divide Gilbert's crayon count (32) by 4: 32 / 4 = 8 crayons. Therefore, Judah's box contains 8 crayons."},{"instruction":"Question: What is Syndrome's former name? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\".

Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below . and the situation: Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D. Answer the following question: Which electron would be farther from the nucleus, cat A or cat B? The answer is:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background, electrons with more energy are found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When considering the process of learning a second language, one might wonder if age plays a significant role in achieving fluency. People often assume that children have an advantage in language learning due to their brain's plasticity and natural immersion in social settings. However, research suggests that adults can also become fluent in a second language, even if they begin learning later in life. While it's true that children tend to grasp new languages easier and more quickly, adults also possess cognitive attributes that facilitate language learning, such as problem-solving skills, metalinguistic awareness, and the ability to use learning strategies. Furthermore, with the increased availability of language learning resources, such as apps, courses, and video platforms, adults have an abundance of opportunities to practice and enhance their language skills.

If we have 788764*t and subtract 788936*t, we can write this as (788764 - 788936)*t. Step 2: Calculate the difference (788764 - 788936). 788764 - 788936 = -172 So, the equation becomes -172*t = -9460. Step 3: Solve for t. To get t by itself, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -172. t = -9460 / -172 Step 4: Calculate the value for t. -9460 divided by -172 is approximately 54.9884 (rounded to 4 decimal places).

While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has been found to be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 discovered the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).Fish are plentiful in the waters surrounding the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African red snappers (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island. The sandbar of Carabane has very few mammals other than pets, although the French first noted the presence of monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island.

This eliminated the prospect of being short-sided which can be ruinous on the firm greens of Sawgrass. Converting this promising position into the biggest win of his career remains a huge challenge but at least he has given himself a chance.

President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize?

Musgrave has already prepared a team for Ethan: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and his old partner Luther Stickell. The team rescues Lindsey and collects two damaged laptop computers. As they flee, Ethan discovers an explosive pellet implanted in Lindsey's head. Before he can disable it, it goes off and kills her. Back in the U.S., Ethan and Musgrave are reprimanded by IMF Director Theodore Brassel. Ethan learns that Lindsey mailed him a postcard before her capture and discovers a magnetic microdot under the stamp. IMF technician Benji Dunn recovers enough data from the laptops to determine Davian will be in Vatican City to obtain a mysterious object called the \\"Rabbit's Foot\\".

Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and... Question: Why are some teams not productive Answer: Answer:","output":"Some teams are not productive due to a lack of proper coordination, unclear goals and ambitions, the absence of a structured plan, and inadequate focus on leveraging the skills, time-availability, and resources of individual team members. This unstructured approach can lead to confusion, a sense of being directionless, and ultimately hinder the team's ability to work together effectively on larger projects.

He adds 1 rep a day and once he gets to 15 reps he will start training high elevation push-ups. and then low elevation push-ups, and finally floor push-ups. How many weeks will it take him to get to floor push-ups? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Let's break this down step by step: 1. John starts with wall push-ups and adds 1 rep a day until he reaches 15 reps. This will take him 15 days. 2. Once he reaches 15 reps of wall push-ups, he starts training high elevation push-ups. He will also need to reach 15 reps for this exercise. Since he is adding 1 rep a day, it will take him another 15 days for high elevation push-ups. 3. After completing high elevation push-ups, he moves on to low elevation push-ups. Following the same pattern, it will take him 15 more days to reach 15 reps for low elevation push-ups. 4. Finally, he will be ready to start floor push-ups after completing the previous three stages. Now let's calculate the total number of days and convert them into weeks: - 15 days wall push-ups + 15 days high elevation push-ups + 15 days low elevation push-ups = 45 days - To convert days to weeks, we'll divide the total number of days by 7 (days in a week): 45 days / 7 = 6 weeks and 3 days. It will take John 6 weeks and 3 days to work up to doing floor push-ups, training 5 days a week. However, since he only trains 5 days a week, we need to take into account the rest days (2 days a week). John trains for a total of 45 training days. At 5 days per week, he'll train for 9 full weeks (45 training days divided by 5 days per week).

Let's analyze each of the choices and compare them with the clue provided in the question: 1. Shortness of breath: This condition might occur when someone has been running for a long time, but it may not necessarily be a definitive reason for the person to stop running. It could be a temporary sensation that eases as the person continues to run and catches their breath. 2. Sore feet: While sore feet can be a consequence of running for long periods, they may not be the primary reason to stop running. Some runners may experience sore feet even at the beginning of their runs due to various reasons, but they still continue to run. 3. Was cramping (presumably in the muscles): Muscle cramps can result from decreased electrolytes, dehydration, or fatigue. Although cramps can be painful and prompt someone to stop running, they do not occur consistently in every situation where someone has been running for a long time. 4. Leg cramps: Similar to the previous point, leg cramps can occur during running, but they may not always be the reason for stopping. 5. Becoming tired: When someone has been running for a very long time, it's natural for their energy levels to deplete, causing them to feel tired. \\"Becoming tired\\" is a strong potential reason for the person to stop running since it encompasses both the physical and mental aspects of fatigue brought on by prolonged activity.

Los hoteles han tomado medidas para proteger la información de sus clientes, invirtiendo en tecnología y sistemas que les permitan mantener la seguridad de los datos que manejan. Por ejemplo, muchos hoteles utilizan sistemas de gestión hotelera (PMS) que les permiten almacenar y proteger la información de sus clientes de manera eficiente y segura. Estos sistemas suelen contar con firewalls, encriptación de datos, y protocolos de autenticación para evitar accesos no autorizados. Asimismo, los hoteles también emplean políticas y procedimientos para capacitar a su personal en el manejo adecuado de la información de los clientes. Esto incluye instrucciones sobre cómo acceder, almacenar y compartir de forma segura los datos de los clientes, así como la importancia de mantener la confidencialidad de dicha información. Sin embargo, es importante mencionar que, a pesar de los esfuerzos realizados, los hoteles no están exentos de enfrentar riesgos en lo que respecta a la protección de los datos de sus clientes. La ciberdelincuencia y los ataques informáticos son una realidad en el mundo digital actual, y los hoteles pueden ser objetivos atractivos para los criminales que buscan información valiosa para cometer fraudes y otros delitos. Por esta razón, es crucial que los hoteles continúen adaptándose e implementando nuevas medidas de seguridad y actualizando sus sistemas y políticas de protección de datos. En resumen, los hoteles han tomado medidas importantes para proteger los datos de sus clientes y garantizar la seguridad de su información. Aunque se han logrado avances significativos, es esencial que los hoteles sigan mejorando y adaptándose a los desafíos que presenta la protección de datos en el mundo digital actual. Por lo tanto, aunque las acciones realizadas por los hoteles reflejan el compromiso y la responsabilidad con la protección de la información de sus clientes, aún queda trabajo por hacer para garantizar que estén completamente preparados para enfrentar todos los riesgos y amenazas asociadas a la seguridad de estos datos."},{"instruction":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: members load cargo onto military transport aircraft before it departs airport","output":"The keywords in the given sentence are: 1.

'We are treating them as a normal food item, incorporating insect protein as an ingredient but using normal flavours we are familiar with and everyday food items we recognise.

On his Tuesday show, Beck joked about the death of Sean Hoare, who was the first journalist to go on the record about the phone-hacking crisis at the News of the World in a 2010 New York Times article. Hoare was found dead in his London home on Monday. Beck said he loved the story of the death. \\"I'm not saying that foul play was involved, but it is suspicious that he's dead,\\" Beck said, laughing. (On Tuesday, police categorically concluded that no third party was involved in Hoare's death.) He then joked that Vladimir Putin was involved in the death, before turning to Fox News, which, like the News of the World, is owned by News Corp. Beck said he was worried that the scandal would be used by opponents of Fox News to try and bring it down, but that, as far as he knew, there had never been a hint of a scandal at the network. \\"Pray that that is so and that they are thwarted,\\" Beck said. \\"...They will use this and it will shut down.\\" LISTEN: ||||| A postmortem into the death of the News of the World whistleblower Sean Hoare found no evidence of third-party involvement and confirmed that his death was non suspicious, the police have said. No specific cause of death was given by the police, who said they were waiting for the results of toxicology tests and were continuing to examine \\"health problems\\" identified during the autopsy. Hertfordshire police said the results were \\"inconclusive\\", but detectives could not rule out suicide until they knew the results of the tests, which could take weeks. \\"There was no suicide note found at the scene,\\" the spokesperson said. \\"We cannot categorically say one way or another whether this was suicide, as we have not got the toxicology results.\\" Hoare was the first named journalist to allege that the former News of the World editor Andy Coulson was aware of phone hacking carried out by his staff. Hoare worked for the Sun and NoW with Coulson, before being dismissed for drink and drugs problems. He had spoken openly to a number of news organisations about the practice of phone hacking. Hertfordshire police had previously said they were treating the death of 47-year-old Hoare as \\"unexplained but not thought to be suspicious\\". In a statement released on Tuesday, the force said of the postmortem: \\"There is no evidence of third-party involvement and the death is non suspicious … there is an ongoing examination of health problems identified at the post mortem.\\" The postmortem was conducted by a Home Office-accredited forensic pathologist and it began at 2pm on Tuesday. The examination was a section 20 autopsy, which would ordinarily be used in suspicious death cases. Hertfordshire police said this was just a precaution. \\"Because of the circumstances surrounding the case and the high-profile nature of the person believed to be involved, a decision was taken for a Home Office postmortem to take place to thoroughly investigate the matter,\\" a spokesman said. The former tabloid journalist is understood to have lived in a first-floor flat in Watford with his wife, Joanne. Hertfordshire police, which asked its major crime unit to investigate the death, also answered questions concerning their approach after the discovery of Hoare's body on Monday. He was found dead in the flat at 10.40am. Neighbours said police and an ambulance were at the site until about 3pm. It was not until after 9pm, two hours after TV and website reports of the whistleblower's death, that more uniformed and plainclothes police, including scientific officers, arrived at Hoare's flat. Police said the \\"log detailing response activity in relation to the incident shows clearly that the initial response to this incident was correct\\". They added: \\"Throughout the day the tragic incident was treated as an unexplained but non suspicious death. As an additional measure, following a routine review of the incident and in light of a clearer understanding of the former position of the person, officers returned to the property to make routine follow-up inquiries, which are now ongoing. The incident continues to be treated as non suspicious.\\" Hoare returned to the spotlight last Tuesday after he told the New York Times that reporters at the NoW were able to use police technology to locate people via mobile phone signals, in exchange for payments to officers. He said journalists were able to buy mobile-phone tracking data from police for £300. That evening Hoare had dinner with two New York Times journalists involved in the story – Don Van Natta Jr and Jo Becker. Van Natta Jr, via a web tweet on Monday night, said: \\"RIP Sean Hoare. Jo Becker and I had dinner with him last Tues night. He was ailing but defiant and funny. And no regrets. All-courage.\\" Hoare had given further details about \\"pinging\\" to Guardian journalists last Tuesday and Wednesday. He described how reporters would ask a news desk executive to get the location of a person. \\"Within 15 to 30 minutes someone on the news desk would come back and say 'right, that's where they are'. \\" He added: \\"You'd just go to the news desk and they'd come back to you. You don't ask any questions. You'd consider it a job done.\\" Hoare repeatedly expressed the hope that the hacking scandal would lead to journalism \\"being cleaned up\\", and said he had decided to blow the whistle on the activities of some of his former NoW colleagues with that aim in mind. Calls to Hoare's home phone on Thursday and Friday went unanswered. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The news article discusses Glenn Beck's reaction to the death of Sean Hoare, a whistleblower in the phone hacking scandal involving the News of the World.

He noticed that some other car seats didn't have any padding. He marked it as case A. On the other hand, most of the seats he designed had padding. He marked it as case B. Keith needed to know pros and cons of both designs. and a hint : Extending the period of time over which a force acts in order to lessen the force is a common practice in design. Padding in shoes and seats allows the time to increase. The front of automobiles are designed to crumple in an accident; this increases the time the car takes to stop. Similarly, barrels of water or sand in front of abutments on the highway and airbags serve to slow down the stoppage time. These changes all serve to decrease the amount of force it takes to stop the momentum in a car crash, which consequently saves lives. Please answer this question : Would case B take less or more time for the force to act than case A? Answer:","output":"Case B, with padding, would take more time for the force to act than case A, which doesn't have padding.

The story is documented in the four canonical gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—which provide an account of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. Mary Magdalene was a dedicated disciple of Jesus and a pivotal figure in early Christianity. She is frequently mentioned throughout the New Testament and is described as a devoted follower who provided financial support to Jesus' ministry, accompanied him during his travels, and witnessed his crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. On the morning of the resurrection, Mary Magdalene, along with a few other women, went to Jesus' tomb to anoint his body with spices, as per the Jewish burial customs. Upon arrival, they found the large stone that sealed the tomb rolled away and the tomb empty. The accounts of the specific events that followed differ slightly among the gospels, but all four agree that Mary Magdalene was the first to encounter the risen Jesus. Here is a summary of the encounters according to each gospel: 1. Matthew (28:1-10): In Matthew's account, Mary Magdalene and \\"the other Mary\\" visit the tomb to find an angel who informs them that Jesus has risen. As they are leaving, Jesus appears to them and speaks with them. The women fall at his feet and worship him before going to inform the disciples of the encounter. 2. Mark (16:1-11): According to Mark's gospel, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome visit the tomb. They are met by a young man, presumed to be an angel, who tells them that Jesus has risen and is not there. Mary Magdalene is the first to see the risen Jesus, who instructs her to go and tell the disciples about his resurrection. Initially, the disciples do not believe her, but later Jesus appears to them as well, confirming her account. 3. Luke (24:1-12): In this gospel, Mary Magdalene and several other women visit the tomb and find it empty. Two angels appear to them and declare that Jesus has risen. They leave the tomb and report the event to the disciples, who are initially skeptical. Peter decides to go to the tomb to see for himself but finds it empty, and no mention of Jesus' appearance to Mary Magdalene is described in Luke’s account. 4. John (20:1-18): In John's version of the resurrection story, Mary Magdalene goes to the tomb alone and discovers it empty. Distraught, she turns away and notices a man whom she initially mistakes for the gardener. When he addresses her by name, she recognizes him as the risen Jesus. Jesus instructs her not to touch him but to go and tell the disciples about his resurrection, which she does. Despite slight variations in some elements of the story, all four New Testament gospels agree that Mary Magdalene was the first individual to encounter Jesus after his crucifixion and resurrection. This consensus highlights the significance of Mary Magdalene's role as a close follower of Jesus and establishes her place in the Christian tradition."},{"instruction":"Of the below sentences, which one does *not* make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"He put his clothes in his oven\\" - Sentence B: \\"He put his clothes in his dresser\\" Let's reason step by step:","output":"To determine which sentence does not make sense, let's analyze each sentence and the context in which these actions would take place: Sentence A: \\"He put his clothes in his oven\\" - Ovens are typically used for cooking and heating food, not for storing clothes. Putting clothes in an oven would be an unusual and potentially dangerous action, as the clothes could catch fire if the oven were turned on accidentally or intentionally. Sentence B: \\"He put his clothes in his dresser\\" - Dressers are common storage spaces for clothes like pants, shirts, and other garments. Putting clothes in a dresser is a normal and expected action. So, after analyzing each sentence, it is clear that Sentence A: \\"He put his clothes in his oven\\" does not make sense in the context of typical behavior for managing and storing clothes."},{"instruction":"Question: He took a toll road and ended up in a state he couldn't spell, it was probably which one? Options: - new jersey - new york - minnesota - eastern united states - connecticut Explain why a human would choose \\"connecticut\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"Connecticut\\" to answer the question above for a few reasons: 1. Difficulty in spelling: Among the given options, Connecticut is arguably the most difficult to spell due to its unique combination of letters and pronunciation, making it a likely candidate for a state that someone might struggle to spell. 2. Geographic location: Connecticut is located in the Eastern United States, making it a plausible destination for someone who ended up in an unfamiliar state after taking a toll road. This eliminates the option \\"Eastern United States\\" which is more of a general region rather than a specific state. 3. Elimination of other options: Comparing the other options: - New Jersey and New York are relatively easy to spell and are quite well-known, making it less likely that someone would have trouble spelling their names. - Minnesota, while more challenging to spell than New Jersey or New York, is not located in the Eastern United States, which makes it less likely to be the correct answer considering the context. Taking into account the factors mentioned above, a human would choose \\"Connecticut\\" as the most likely answer to the question. Not only does it fit the criterion of being difficult to spell, but it is also located in the appropriate region, making it a logical choice."},{"instruction":"What is the answer to this question? what causes the tide to come in and out?","output":"Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun on the Earth's oceans. Imagine the moon and the sun are like big magnets, and the ocean water is like a stretchy blanket. When the moon or the sun is closer to one side of the Earth, they pull the blanket towards them, making the water rise on that side. This is known as \\"high tide.\\" When the moon and the sun are far away from a part of the Earth, the pull is weaker, and the blanket doesn't stretch as far, causing the water level to be lower. This is called \\"low tide.\\" The tide comes in (high tide) and goes out (low tide) because the Earth rotates, and the moon and the sun keep pulling on the ocean water as our planet turns."},{"instruction":"Note the options at the end.

Article: It was an early September day, cool and bright and just right for running, and I was in the first few miles of a lO-knownmile race over a course with a few high hills. Still, I felt energetic; despite the hills it was going to be a fine run. Just ahead of me was Peggy Mimno, a teacher from Mount Kiseo, New York. She too was running easily, moving along at my speed. The pace felt comfortable, so I decided to stay where I was; why pay attention to pace when she was setting such a nice one? I'd overtake her later on when she tired. So I ran behind her. The course headed north for miles, wandered west for a hilly mile, then turned south again along a winding road. The race was getting harder. We had four miles left and already it was beginning to be real work. Peggy overtook a young runner. She seemed to know him, for they exchanged a few cheerful words as she passed him. Their exchange worried me. You don't chat during a race unless you feeling good, and Peggy plainly was. Still, I was close enough to overtake her if she tired, so I didn't give up hope completely. We were getting nearer to a long, punishing hill now and it would be the test. We were a mile from the finish line, so whatever happened on the hill would almost determine who crossed it first. As I moved up the hill, my attention wandered for a few minutes. When I looked up, Peggy was moving away--first five yards, then ten, then more. Finally it was clear that there was no help of catching her. She beat me soundly. There is an important lesson in that race. Women are thought to be weaker, slower and not nearly as skilled in sport. Yet as Peggy Mimno so clearly showed, the similarities between men and women runners are more important than differences. I have run with a number of women, and I can say it is often hard work.

He scratched at an imaginary itch on his right hand (just below his thumb) to take his mind off the man in the lab coat who sat across from him at the beaten, scarred, wood table. It didn't work. And whoever this man in the lab coat was, he was insistent about paperwork. He had three inches clipped onto a weathered clipboard which he flipped through with precision. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" asked the boy's captor in a calm, sensitive tenor. The boy, Kurt, continued to scratch the imaginary itch, which had leapt magically from his right hand to the left. Eventually the falseness of the itch would be deduced, and the lab coated man would disappear out of the cell and return with... God knows what. He had seen torture hundreds-if not thousands-of times on TV, and he was glumly certain that there would be no commercial breaks for him. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" The question was repeated without urgency, like a forgetful waiter. The itch now leaped with the dexterity of a trained flea onto the boy's leg, and the dutiful fingers followed. He watched as the man in the lab coat, without name tag or company insignia, studied his stack of papers attached to the clipboard. Several yellow forms near the top half inch were labeled 27B. The man frowned and wrote a note on the top page. \\"Note: Find out who isn't duplicating 27B in Pink.\\" \\"I'm sorry,\\" he said, \\"I wasn't listening. Was that a yes or no to the water?\\" Kurt remained in his chair, almost motionless, except for the itching-and-scratching routine. It had leapt again, this time onto his scalp, and the twitching fingers followed. He wondered how long he could keep this up without drawing blood. Question: The boy is afraid: === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"Yes, the boy, Kurt, is unquestionably afraid in this situation. There are several clues and indications in the passage that highlight his fear and anxious state. Firstly, one can observe that Kurt plays with his fingers, scratching an imaginary itch, as a means of trying to distract himself from the man in the lab coat who is sitting across from him. This fidgeting behavior is a classic sign of nervousness and anxiety, suggesting that he feels uneasy and threatened in this scenario. Furthermore, Kurt seems to be unable to concentrate on what the man is saying, which is evidenced by his lack of response when offered a glass of water. This is another hint that the boy is so afraid he can't even focus on something as simple as a question about whether or not he'd like a drink. Kurt's fear is heightened when he considers the potential for torture in his situation. The fact that he's speculated about experiencing something he's only ever seen on television, and the thought that there may be no relief, such as commercial breaks, in his own real-life experience, indicates that the boy is indeed very scared. Lastly, Kurt's increasing desperation to maintain the illusion of the imaginary itch emphasizes his fear and anxiety. He tries so hard to keep up this facade, going so far as to worry about drawing blood in the process, which ultimately suggests that he is struggling with deep fear. In conclusion, the boy in this passage is most certainly afraid, a fact that is evidenced through his various actions and thoughts as described in the text."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer: Who is they in the following sentence?

The purpose of the visit was to get a new rabies shot for her pet. Rabies is a serious and potentially fatal disease that affects mammals, including humans. By getting her pet vaccinated, Cameron is taking a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of both her pet and others who come in contact with the pet. Now, let's consider what will happen to Cameron in this scenario: As Cameron is simply taking her pet to the veterinarian for a rabies shot, and because this is a routine procedure, it is likely that nothing out of the ordinary will happen to her. After the veterinarian administers the vaccine to her pet, Cameron will have peace of mind knowing that her pet is protected against rabies. Moreover, Cameron may also have to pay for this routine check-up and vaccine, which could range from a low-cost clinic to a more expensive one, depending on the location and veterinarian. In conclusion: Cameron will take her pet to the veterinarian for a rabies shot, pay for the service, and have peace of mind knowing her pet is protected against the disease.

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill.

The other options (juggling, trees, chess set, and flying) are not directly related to the way a child might perceive or refer to a rook in a chess game.

Avoid creating questions that (i) can't be answered correctly without actually understanding the passage and (ii) uses the same words or phrases given in the passage. Input: Context: The effect of in vitro expansion of human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) on stem cell properties is controversial. We examined serial subcultivation with expansion on the ability of ASCs to grow and differentiate into osteoblastic lineages.', 'Flow cytometric analysis, growth kinetics, cell population doubling time, light microscopy and confocal analysis, and osteogenesis induction were performed to assess growth and osteogenic potential of subcultivated ASCs at passages 2 (P2), P4 and P6.', 'Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ASCs at P2 express classical mesenchymal stem cell markers including CD44, CD73, and CD105, but not CD14, CD19, CD34, CD45, or HLA-DR. Calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity were the highest at P2 but completely abrogated at P4. Increased passage number impaired cell growth; P2 cultures exhibited exponential growth, while cells at P4 and P6 showed near linear growth with cell population doubling times increased from 3.2 at P2 to 4.8xa0d at P6. Morphologically, cells in various subcultivation stages showed flattened shape at low density but spindle-like structures at confluency as judged by phalloidin staining.

Simplify the equation: The first step is to simplify the equation by combining like terms. In this case, we can combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation (43 and 3). 23*g = 43 + 3 Now, we simplify: 23*g = 46 2. Isolate variable g: The next step is to isolate the variable g by dividing both sides of the equation by 23. (23*g) / 23 = 46 / 23 As we are dividing both sides by the same number, we can simply cancel out 23 on the left side of the equation, leaving just g: g = 46 / 23 3.

Crock pots are great for making delicious meals for our family, but we need to keep it clean so it works properly and makes yummy food every time. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to clean your crock pot. 1. Remove Leftover Food After enjoying the lovely meal your mom or dad made using the crock pot, there may be some bits of food remaining inside. To start cleaning, we need to get those bits out of the pot. Use a spoon or a spatula to scoop them out and put them in the trash. Make sure you remove as much as you can to make the cleaning process easier. 2. Clean with Warm Soap and Water Now, let's clean the inside of the pot. Take the pot to the sink and fill it with warm water. Add a few drops of dish soap inside. Use a sponge or a soft cloth to scrub the inside of the pot gently. Make sure you reach all the corners and the bottom of the pot, too. This will help get any remaining food bits and stains out. 3. Wipe the Heating Base Once the inside of the pot is clean, we need to clean the base where the pot goes. This part gets hot when we cook food, so it's important to keep it clean too. Take a soft cloth (like a washcloth) and dip it in some warm, soapy water. Then, wipe the surface of the heating base gently. Be careful not to get any water in the electrical parts of the base! 4. Remove Water Spots with Vinegar After cleaning the pot and the base, you might notice some spots where hard water dried and left marks. Don't worry; we can easily clean those with some vinegar. Mix equal parts of water and white vinegar in a small bowl or cup. Dip a soft cloth in the vinegar solution, and then gently wipe the spots on the pot and the base. The vinegar will help remove the hard water spots and make the crock pot shiny and clean! 5. Finished! Great job, little helper! Now your crock pot is all clean and ready for the next delicious meal your mom or dad wants to cook. Remember always to ask for permission or help from an adult when cleaning kitchen appliances, and be careful with the warm water. Happy cleaning!"},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given commands (in terms of logical operations) to select relevant rows from the given table.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Ty Warner Faces Four-Year Prison Term After Hiding 25 Million in Swiss Bank Accounts Hiding substantial income from Swiss Bank Accounts has landed Ty Warner, the 69-year-old plush toy-maker, a proposed four-year prison sentence as part of an 18-page plea deal. Highlighting the severity of tax evasion and the potential ramifications, this case stands as a reminder about the importance of tax compliance and the consequences of withholding information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Ty Warner, the founder and owner of Ty Inc., a plush toy manufacturer known for producing the popular Beanie Babies amongst other soft toys, has been caught in the act of evading taxes by not disclosing income from an offshore bank account in Switzerland. The concealed sum of 25 million, a significant amount by any standard, prompted the IRS to take immediate action and initiate a legal procedure against the multi-millionaire. The plea deal, which is extensive in its content, outlines the charges against Warner for not reporting income from the offshore bank account, the details of the hidden money, and the legal implications of breaching tax laws. Furthermore, the plea agreement suggests a four-year prison term for the 69-year-old plush toy-maker to atone for his offense. Despite the prison sentence potentially impacting Warner's personal life and business substantially, the plea deal is aimed at ensuring a fair outcome for both parties and the wider society. Tax evasion is a serious offense with the potential for damaging consequences, not only for the individual, taxpayers but also undermining the entire tax system. The Ty Warner case demonstrates the importance of conforming to the established tax laws, as well as displaying transparency with financial institutions. The four-year prison term proposed for Warner is meant to both penalize the toy-maker and dissuade other potential tax evaders from engaging in similar activities. The high-profile nature of this case also serves to highlight the role played by Swiss banks in global tax evasion schemes. While Swiss banks have historically been perceived as the bastion of secretive banking and wealth management, pressure from various governments and international organizations has forced significant changes in transparency and cooperation regarding tax matters. Although there are ongoing efforts to curb the use of offshore bank accounts and secret financial dealings, this case shows that tax evasion continues to persist on a large scale. By levying substantial fines and prison sentences, the IRS seeks to discourage individuals from resorting to such strategies in the pursuit of wealth preservation and accumulation. Furthermore, the increase in global cooperation and information sharing between financial institutions has made it increasingly difficult for tax evaders to hide their wealth and avoid paying their fair share of taxes. In conclusion, the proposed four-year prison term for Ty Warner indicates that tax evasion is an offense that can have significant consequences for all. This case serves as a stark reminder of the importance of staying compliant with tax laws, maintaining transparency with financial institutions, and cooperating with legal authorities to ensure an equitable and just taxation system for all citizens. As global compliance standards continue to evolve, it remains crucial for everyone to understand the implications of tax evasion and to act responsibly in managing our financial affairs."},{"instruction":"New legislation means killers will get a mandatory life sentence. Previously, killers could be pardoned by a victim's family to avoid a jail term. Now forgiveness will only spare them the death penalty. It is being seen as a step in the right direction in a country where attacks on women who go against conservative rules on love and marriage are common. According to the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), nearly 1,100 women were killed by relatives in Pakistan last year in such killings, while many more cases go unreported. The loophole allowed the perpetrators of \\"honour killings\\" - often a relative acting on the pretext of defending family \\"honour\\" - to avoid punishment because they can seek forgiveness for the crime from another family member. In recent months, a number of high-profile deaths have made headlines both in Pakistan and abroad, including the killing of British woman Samia Shahid in July, allegedly by her father and her former husband. The same month, Pakistani social media celebrity Qandeel Baloch was strangled to death, allegedly killed by her brother in the province of Punjab. The amended law was debated by Pakistan's National Assembly for four hours on Thursday, before being passed unanimously. Campaigners have been calling for tougher legislation to protect women from violence for years. A 2005 amendment to the law pertaining to \\"honour killings\\" prevented men who kill female relatives pardoning themselves as an 'heir' of the victim. Pakistani activist and filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid - who won an Oscar earlier this year for a documentary on \\"honour killings\\" - paid tribute to the people who had worked to get the bill through. \\"It may not change much over night but it is certainly a step in the right direction,\\" she said in a Facebook post. \\"And today I am proud that we have gone the distance on this bill.\\" Others were more cautious, raising concerns over the fact the bill still allows a judge to decide whether a murder qualifies as an 'honour killing' or not. The bill - pending for a long time - has now been passed by both houses of parliament, which means they will soon make it to the statute books. But it is yet to be seen how effective a deterrent the anti-honour killing law may prove. The crime is often committed either as a result of sudden provocation or under tremendous social pressure. Killers have largely enjoyed impunity due to a legal provision under which a relative of the victim could pardon the perpetrator. That clause has now been tweaked to ensure the offender pays the price. This may prove to be a deterrent in the long run. In rape cases, the parliament has for the first time introduced a provision allowing DNA tests to ascertain identity of the offender. Experts believe this will effectively cover up for the weakness in the previous legislation that relied heavily on circumstantial evidence.

WePay, a Website that helps people collect, manage and spend money online, has analysed tons of research, reports and surveys from different sources, and the results were surprising! Are Gift Cards a Good Idea? Rather than give someone a gift that they might not like, it's better just to pick up a gift card so they can buy what they really want, right? Wrong. This year, 2.5 billion in gift cards went unspent. Of that amount, 1.3 billion went unspent because people didn't bother making the time. Another I billion or so was forgotten altogether. How Much Do We Really Value the Gifts We're Given? The lucky recipient of a gift, like a cashmere sweater, will value it less than the amount it was purchased for. And ladies, contrary to what you might think, place less monetary value on the diamond ring they are given than the guys who have bought it for them. What Happens to Our Gifts After They're Given? Many complain that the holiday season means shopping and crazily spending money, but studies show that once the big day arrives, we are less focused on gifts than we think. Every year, at least one gift per person is regifted, returned or never even opened And How Do We Really Feel About Fruit Cakes? We all know that no one likes fruit cakes, right? Wrong, once again. Although fruit cakes continue to be taken away behind the rest of the holiday cookies and cakes on the dessert table, one in four people still consider giving them as gifts.

(CNN) -- The new president of Egypt, Mohamed Morsy, is a 9-11 truther who doubts that America is telling the whole story about the collapse of the World Trade Center. He believes that a Christian or a woman should not be Egypt's leader. The ascent of his Muslim Brotherhood has been widely compared to Ayatollah Khomeini's rise to power in Iran, including most recently by Republican nominees Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. Egyptians recently breached the walls of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, immediately calling to mind the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. Watching Morsy take to the podium at the U.N. General Assembly Wednesday for his first major address on the world stage, Americans could be forgiven for worrying that another anti-Western firebrand had just assumed power in Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country and its political bellwether.

As the political landscape in Egypt continues to evolve, along with the rise of new leaders like Mohamed Morsy, it is crucial for the international community to respect and understand the variety of perspectives that emerge. This includes acknowledging the historical context and unique cultural aspects that shape Egypt and its people. Inclusion of diverse perspectives allows for a greater chance of fostering open dialogue and enhancing political stability. By being receptive to the opinions and ideas of the Egyptian people, American policymakers and the broader international community can pave the way for a more cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship. This, in turn, contributes to global peace and security. It is important to bear in mind that Egypt's transition to democracy is still a relatively recent occurrence. As with any young democratic state, it will undergo a series of transformations as its leaders and institutions are refined. Therefore, it is essential to remain open to the possibility that some new leaders may hold views deemed controversial or unpopular by the international community. Moreover, as Egypt progresses in its democratic journey, its citizens must also be granted the opportunity to engage in the decision-making process. This includes having the freedom to express their thoughts and opinions on critical issues affecting their nation and the wider world. In acknowledging and respecting these views, the international community demonstrates its commitment to upholding the values of democracy and human rights - even when dealing with countries that might hold divergent political or social perspectives. In conclusion, as Egypt continues to grapple with the challenges of its newfound democracy, it is vital for the international community to demonstrate its willingness to listen and be receptive to the concerns and aspirations of the Egyptian people. Only by embracing the diverse range of voices from Egypt can the world truly work towards fostering understanding, enhancing stability, and promoting global peace."},{"instruction":"By.

A trainee physics teacher has been declared the best Scrabble player in the UK, after a gruelling Bank Holiday weekend showdown. Kevin McMahon, from Dublin, clinched the crown when he managed to conjure up the word 'immortal' - taking advantage of two 'triple word score' squares to score 158 points. He was competing against 120 players at the British Matchplay Scrabble Championships, and claimed victory following a nail-biting 21 rounds. Final reckoning: The board that clinched Mr McMahon the title. Clincher: The eight-letter word 'immortal' secured victory. During the Great Depression, Scrabble was invented in 1938 by American-born architect Alfred Butts. He wanted to create a game that combined the vocabulary skills of crossword puzzles and anagrams, with the additional element of chance. The game was originally named Lexico, but Mr Butts eventually decided to call the game 'Criss-Cross Words.' The name was later changed to Scrabble and he sold the rights and it was trademarked in 1948. The game is sold in 121 countries and there are 29 different language versions. Approximately 150 million sets have been sold worldwide. After winning the tournament at the Yarnfield Park Conference Centre in Staffordshire, Mr McMahon told The Independent: 'I'm really happy; it feels brilliant.' He collected a trophy and the £1,000 prize money, admitting that score of 158 with the word immortal 'sealed the deal'. 'I don't really play the words. for their beauty; I just do it for points,' he explained. The competition is the flagship event of the Association of British Scrabble Players. In Scrabble, players try to gain the highest points by making words with individual letter tiles on a grid board. Each letter tile has a points value between one and 10, based on the letter's frequency in standard English. Various coloured squares on the board can double or triple a player's points. The recent Scrabble tournaments coincides with new research by Scrabble into what makes words beautiful. Celebrities offering up their own favourite words include the actor and comedian Stephen Fry who suggested snuffle and Jamiroquai singer Jay Kay, who put forward whippersnapper, reported the newspaper.

Then he takes three more smaller antacids that weigh 1 gram each and have 15% zinc. How many milligrams of zinc does he eat? Your thoughts:","output":"To find the total milligrams of zinc Jerry eats, we need to calculate the amount of zinc in each type of antacid and then add them together. First, let's determine the amount of zinc in the two larger antacids: 1. Each antacid weighs 2 grams. 2. They contain 5% zinc by weight, so to find the amount of zinc, we can multiply the weight by the percentage (in decimal form): 2 grams * 0.05 = 0.1 grams of zinc per antacid. 3. Since Jerry takes 2 antacids, he consumes 2 * 0.1 grams = 0.2 grams of zinc from the larger antacids. Now, let's find the amount of zinc in the three smaller antacids: 1. Each antacid weighs 1 gram. 2. They contain 15% zinc by weight, so we can multiply the weight by the percentage: 1 gram * 0.15 = 0.15 grams of zinc per antacid. 3. Jerry takes 3 of these antacids, so he consumes 3 * 0.15 grams = 0.45 grams of zinc from the smaller antacids. Finally, let's add the two amounts of zinc together and convert grams to milligrams: 1. Total zinc from larger antacids: 0.2 grams 2. Total zinc from smaller antacids: 0.45 grams 3. Combine both amounts: 0.2 grams + 0.45 grams = 0.65 grams 4.

He was a Republican member of the House of Representatives from California's 52nd, 45th and 42nd districts from 1981 to 2009. Hunter was the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during the 108th and 109th Congress. Hunter sought the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States for 2008, but his campaign failed to attract significant voters or delegates in early primary and caucus states, and he dropped out after the Nevada Republican caucuses. Context: In 1980, Hunter was recruited to run for Congress in what was then the 42nd District against 18-year incumbent Democrat Lionel Van Deerlin. Hunter was initially an underdog in a district where Democrats outnumbered Republicans by almost 2 to 1. However, his attacks on Van Deerlin's record on national defense gained traction in a district dominated by military bases and personnel. Van Deerlin did not respond quickly enough, and Hunter narrowly defeated him. He was one of many Republicans swept into office from historically Democratic districts as a result of the \\"Reagan revolution\\"; Van Deerlin had been the district's only congressman since its creation in 1963. After the 1980 census, many of the more Democratic areas were cut out of Hunter's district, and he was reelected 13 more times with no substantive opposition. His district was renumbered as the 45th District in 1983 and the 52nd in 1993. In the 2006 general election, he defeated Navy veteran/minister John Rinaldi, a Democrat, and Michael Benoit, a Libertarian. Hunter was re-elected with 65 percent of the vote, a 33-point margin over Rinaldi. On March 20, 2007, Hunter announced that, as part of his presidential bid, he would not seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 2008. After his son, Duncan D. Hunter, announced his candidacy for his father's seat, the younger Hunter was recalled by the United States Marine Corps to serve in the Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan. During Duncan D. Hunter's active service, his wife, Margaret Hunter, campaigned on his behalf. On June 3, 2008 Duncan D. Hunter won 72% of the Republican Primary vote and became the Republican nominee to replace his father representing the 52nd District. Question: what did he do instead?.

Hugo Gye. PUBLISHED:. 10:59 EST, 26 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 15:10 EST, 26 July 2013. Archaeologists looking for Roman remains have stumbled across an even more historic find - a wooden railway which was instrumental in the development of the Industrial Revolution. An excavation on the banks of the Tyne unearthed a stretch of waggonway which is more than 200 years old, making it the earliest surviving example of the standard-gauge railway. The discovery was originally part of a network which linked the ports of the North East with collieries in Tyneside and Northumberland in the late 18th century. Discovery: A wooden railway which carried waggons from collieries to the River Tyne has been unearthed. Archaeology: The excavation was expected to find Roman remains but instead stumbled upon the railway. The railway was found by archaeologists digging on the site of the Neptune shipyard, which is currently being redeveloped. Because the site is near the Roman fort of Segedunum, in Wallsend, lead excavators Richard Carlton and Alan Williams were expecting to find remains from the Roman period. Instead, they stumbled across the 25-metre stretch of wooden rails, an early contributor to the mining industry which transformed the North East. The waggonway is made up of a heavy duty 'main way' with two sets of rails laid on top of each other to preserve their longevity, with a loop from the main line descending into a dip. That depression would have been filled with water where coal wagons' wooden rails were rested to stop them drying out and cracking. In the middle of the loop is a stone elevation where the horse pulling the waggon would have stood. Pioneering: The waggonways helped the North East develop and were the precursor to Britain's train network. Breakthrough: Standard-gauge railways ended up being used for steam trains around the world. A waggonway from the former mining town of Tanfield in County Durham. 'The wooden waggonway uncovered by the excavation is the direct ancestor of the modern standard-gauge railway,' Mr Carlton said. With horses and carts eventually replaced by steam trains, railways quickly became the fastest form of transportation the world had ever seen and facilitated the creation of the modern world. In Newcastle and the surrounding areas, the railways allowed coal to be transported around Britain, leading to the rapid growth of the region. Mr Carlton added: 'The coal industry was so vitally important for the North East, and there are so few signs of it left now.' The archaeologists' find is remarkably well-preserved - Mr Williams said: 'It looks as if it has just been covered up and left yesterday.' The discovery has revealed features which were previously known only from drawings and the notebooks of engineers such as John Buddle, who lived near the dig site. Work: The dig on the former site of the Neptune shipyard comes as it is redeveloped for new construction. Preserved: The wooden rails have not rotted because they have been kept from biodegrading under the ground. 'We have drawings describing what has been found by the dig but this is the real thing,' said local historian Les Turnbull. 'It is tremendous to be able to see these features rather than just looking at them in historic drawings and notebooks. 'Because the line is standard railway gauge, it is tremendously important as the earliest example in the world and this is of international significance. The waggonway complex is at the forefront of late 18th-century engineering.' Mr Turnbull, who has written a book on waggonways, claimed that the discovery was more important than any Roman find could be. 'One of the gifts of the North East to world history is the development of the railways,' he said. 'Coal and the railways are Tyneside's heritage and this waggonway was part of that, because without the waggonways the coalfields would not have developed.' In the late 18th century, hundreds of waggons ran from collieries to wharves on the Tyne, where coal would be loaded onto brigs for transport to London and abroad. The excavated remains were part of the Willington waggonway, which took in collieries at Willington Quay and Bigges Main on the edge of Wallsend. In 1801 the Killingworth waggonway, for which George Stephenson's first locomotives were built, joined the Willington line. Stephenson and his son Robert went on to build locomotives at their works in South Street in Newcastle to the Willington gauge, which was 4ft 8½in wide - this became the standard width for railways throughout Britain and much of the world. A waggonway was a timber track used for transporting coal in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. They were an ingenious solution to a problem facing coal barons in Northumberland and Durham - namely, how to efficiently get coal from pit-head to port. The alternative, slower, option was via pack-horse or ox cart. A waggonway was a timber track used for transporting coal in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Where possible, the waggonway would slope gently downhill so that the waggons could roll under their own weight. The driver sitting on the back would control the brake while the horse trotted behind on a tether. After the contents were emptied, the horse would pull the empty cart back up the slope. The rails on the Newcastle waggonway were made of wood, four or five inches thick and five or six inches broad. Although the use of wood as a travelling surface was not new - Neolithic man had used it for carrying trackways across bogs - it was the use of the flanged wheel, which made all the difference, allowing the wagon to move snugly on the track. By 1810, the wooden waggonways began to be phased out, replaced by iron. Over the years, the wooden networks fell into disrepair. In 2000, North Tyneside Council successfully bid for £2million worth of funding to transform more than 30 miles of routes as part of the Government's Liveability Fund. The former haulage routes were made into a welcoming and accessible community leisure, travel and learning resource.","output":"A team of archaeologists has discovered a historically significant wooden railway, which predates the Industrial Revolution, during an excavation near the River Tyne.

North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.\\".

Amidst growing scrutiny towards the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of such partnerships, recent security failures of G4S at the Olympics have sparked renewed concerns among high-ranking officials. Two senior ministers have openly questioned the wisdom of private companies having a significant role in the delivery of public services. This article aims to examine the key arguments in this debate, using the G4S Olympic security failure as a case study to identify potential risks and advantages in outsourcing critical functions to private firms. The Privatization Debate: Key Considerations Proponents of involving private firms in delivering public services argue that these partnerships can lead to increased efficiency, cost savings, and better resource allocation, thus improving the overall quality of public services offered to citizens. In contrast, opponents express concerns about the potential loss of public sector control, transparency, and accountability, which could adversely affect service quality and even pose risks to national security. The G4S Olympic Security Failure: An Overview G4S, a leading international security firm, was awarded a £284 million (454 million) contract to provide security services at the 2012 London Olympics. However, the company failed to fulfill its obligations – it was unable to recruit, train and deploy the required number of security personnel, leading to a last-minute scramble for additional staff. Consequently, the British government was forced to deploy 4,700 additional troops to ensure the safety of the Games, costing taxpayers millions of pounds. This incident raised serious concerns over the fundamental assumptions about the efficiency and effectiveness of private sector involvement in public service delivery. Implications of the G4S Failure in Assessing Private Sector Involvement 1. Quality Control and Accountability Issues The G4S debacle highlights the potential risks associated with the lack of effective quality control and inadequate accountability mechanisms. As private firms prioritize profit maximization, they might cut corners to minimize costs, leading to compromised service quality. Therefore, establishing robust monitoring and evaluation systems is crucial to ensure adherence to performance standards and delivery excellence. 2. National Security Concerns The G4S fiasco also raises concerns over national security implications when outsourcing sensitive functions to private firms. In the event of a security failure, state agencies might struggle to manage the fallout, as they might possess limited operational control over the contracted firm. Governments should carefully consider these risks when deciding on public-private partnerships in areas with significant national security stakes. 3. Cost-Effectiveness While private firms can potentially deliver cost savings, the G4S case demonstrates that unreliable private sector performance can lead to substantial unbudgeted expenditures, such as the deployment of additional troops at the taxpayer's expense. Governments should carefully assess the true cost of public-private partnerships by taking into account potential hidden costs and risks. Conclusion The G4S Olympic security failure provides valuable insights into the potential risks and pitfalls of partnering with private firms in public service delivery. Policymakers must approach such decisions with caution, balancing the potential efficiency gains against potential risks in terms of quality control, national security, and cost-effectiveness. Ensuring adequate control, transparency, and accountability mechanisms must be a top priority when involving private firms in the provision of critical public services."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Question: when did classification of races begin?

The polyurethane treatment enhances the fabric's durability, resistance to various environmental factors, and overall performance, making it more suitable for these applications. In summary, textile fabrics impregnated, coated, covered, or laminated with polyurethane are versatile materials that provide enhanced performance characteristics compared to untreated textiles. These treated fabrics are used in various industries and applications, with the notable exclusions of wall coverings and certain floor coverings, which are classified separately."},{"instruction":"Here is an article: The Business Roundtable and other lobbyists pushing for regulation of proxy advisors may be wise to consider Saint Theresa of Avila’s advice that “More tears are shed over answered prayers than over unanswered ones.” The association of big-company chief executive officers welcomed a June 30, 2013 legal bulletin from the Securities and Exchange Commission “providing guidance on the availability and requirements of two exemptions to the federal proxy rules that are often relied upon by proxy advisory firms.” Meanwhile the European Union’s Securities and Markets Authority has asked the proxy-advisor industry to develop an EU Code of Conduct, which it has announced it will review in 2015; rules may follow. But a new analysis suggests that regulating proxy advisors could make them even bigger boardroom powers than they are now. Entitled Great Expectations: The Peril of an Expectations Gap in Proxy Advisory Firm Regulation, the study by Dr. Asaf Eckstein of Tel Aviv University explains how regulation could increase the reputation and credibility of proxy advisors, while allowing them to shift blame onto the SEC in case of governance failures. It could also lead institutional investors to rely more heavily on advisors. “I think it may make it more difficult for boards to ignore advisors’ recommendations,” he told Risk & Compliance Journal. In sum, there is an “expectations gap” between what people think regulation will accomplish and what it actually does. The unintended consequences could be especially worrisome in light of an increasing body of data indicating that proxy advisor recommendations aren’t good for companies or their shareholders. We’ve previously noted studies showing that the highest long-term performers in the S&P 1500 don’t follow proxy advisor recommendations, while companies that dance to the proxy advisor tune destroy shareholder value.

A U.S. Treasury Department investigation has found Jay-Z and Beyoncé’s 2013 Cuba trip did not violate sanctions law. Superstar Beyoncé and her husband, the rapper Jay-Z, had obtained permission to visit the blacklisted country from the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control, under a license that allows cultural exchanges. But some members of congress complained that media images of the couple having fun in the streets of Havana showed they went too far. U.K. announces extractive industry disclosure rules. The U.K. unveiled draft rules on Thursday governing how oil, gas, mining and logging companies would disclose the payments they make to foreign governments for access to natural resources across the globe. Under the draft regulations, as of Jan. 1, 2015, companies would have to report payments they make to governments, such as for taxes, royalties, permits, bonuses and the like. Those payments can be used to hide bribes and other illicit deal-making, activists and observers say. FinCen fines casino worker. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network fined a former casino staffer over anti-money laundering violations and barred him from working at financial institutions. FinCen fined George Que, the former VIP services manager at a Northern Mariana Islands casino, 5,000 and said he helped high-end gamblers avoid detection of large cash transactions by agreeing not to file suspicious activity reports or currency transaction reports.

Pay attention to the critical assets of a company or an industry sector, Joe Nocera, an advisory principal in PwC’s financial services division and a leader in their cybersecurity sector, said this week during a webinar on the subject. U.S. puts sanctions on hawala. The U.S. Treasury Department said Thursday it placed sanctions on a Pakistan-based hawala funding the Taliban, as well as its owner. BofA settlement earmarks 7 billion for homeowners. Consumers are set to receive 7 billion in “relief” from Bank of America Corp. as part of the lender’s record settlement with government agencies, the WSJ reports. That is more than the combined relief awarded in similar settlements reached by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. The relief to be provided by Bank of America includes reductions in mortgage principal and monthly payments for consumers struggling to hold onto their homes, funds to take over and tear down derelict housing and assistance for building or refurbishing affordable rental properties. But the Bank of America deal also shows a move by the government to respond to criticisms of their past deals, specifically that they weren’t focused enough on problems lingering from the recession for low-income borrowers. Citi faces hedge-fund sales curbs. Citigroup Inc. faces restrictions that will prevent it from selling investments in hedge funds and private-equity funds to wealthy clients, following a recent deal with U.S. regulators, the WSJ reports. The curbs result from the Aug. 5 approval of a settlement between Citigroup and the Securities and Exchange Commission of claims related to the bank’s earlier sale of certain debt products. The setback for Citigroup is partly due to timing. Other banks with similar settlements have been able to escape the restrictions because they came before a change in the law last year. Prosecutors probe General Motors lawyers. Federal prosecutors are scrutinizing whether employees inside and outside General Motors Co.’s legal department concealed evidence from regulators about a faulty ignition switch, potentially delaying a recall of vehicles with the fatal problem, people familiar with the matter told the WSJ. The investigation is at an early stage, one of the people said, and it is possible that the probe could end without any charges being brought. Germany set to approve deal with Russia investors. Germany’s economy ministry will approve the sale of utility RWE’s oil and gas unit DEA to a Russian investor despite tensions between Russia and the West over the Ukraine crisis, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The economy ministry said in June it was investigating whether to block the 5.1 billion euro (6.9 billion) sale of the DEA unit to the Letter One group of investors led by Russian tycoon Mikhail Fridman, which was announced in March. Tax-code ace leads Obama inversion effort. The Obama administration’s point man in the effort to deter U.S. companies from restructuring overseas to avoid taxes is a career government economist known for his loosened neckties, Pez dispensers and sweeping grasp of the U.S. tax code, the WSJ reports. Mark J. Mazur, the Treasury’s assistant secretary for tax policy, is helping assemble a menu of administrative options for Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew that would aim to upend the economic benefits of the so-called inversions that occur when a cross-border acquisition allows a U.S. firm to avoid paying U.S. taxes. Buffett compliance in question. In the past two weeks, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it missed filing deadlines for investments in Dow Chemical Co. and wallboard maker USG Corp. The latter resulted in an 896,000 penalty. Buffett, 83, has boasted for years about running Berkshire with a shoestring staff and delegating responsibilities to the heads of operating units like Geico and railroad BNSF. Yet the mistakes raise questions about whether his management approach is suited to an era of increased reporting requirements, according to Bloomberg. Mexico puts limits on food marketing. Mexican authorities are restricting food marketing to children on television and in movie theaters, part of an attack plan against rising health problems as Mexicans get fatter, the WSJ reports. The new limits, which became effective in mid-July, go far beyond any measures taken in the U.S. to restrict food advertising. With a third of children in Mexico overweight, and the country’s entire population struggling with a high rate of Type 2 diabetes, the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto pitched the restrictions as a tough follow-on to the adoption this year of special taxes on sugary beverages and calorie-dense snacks. Twitter walks fine line on death images. Twitter Inc. this week appeared to be taking its most aggressive steps ever to scrub sensitive content from its site as it scrambled to remove grisly images showing the beheading of a U.S. journalist. In reality, the company is maintaining the same reactive approach that has allowed violent and pornographic content to proliferate on the social-media service, according to the WSJ. Like its social-media brethren, Twitter tries to walk a fine line between a dedication to free expression, an aversion to being held legally responsible for the actions of its users, and the reality that people will use such platforms to share highly offensive material—a particular concern as it seeks to expand its advertising business. Delaware eases access to digital data of dead. As policy makers wrestle with how to handle the digital remains people leave behind on sites like Google and Facebook after they die, a new state law expanding access to the deceased’s accounts could set a national trend, the WSJ reports. Delaware Gov. Jack Markell this month signed a bill that gives estate attorneys and other fiduciaries more control of their deceased clients’ digital data, including email, social media and cloud storage data. The law, which takes a novel approach, deals with the sensitive issue of what to do when people are outlived by their email and social-media accounts, sometimes to the dismay of loved ones who lack access. It extends that access to executors authorized to carry out the instructions of a person’s will. The executor can then transfer email and other data to a family member, but isn’t required to. FTC settles with medical transcription company. The Federal Trade Commission has finalized a settlement which resolves data security charges against a California provider of medical transcription services, SC Magazine reports. GMR Transcription Services was accused of “deceptive and unfair information security practices,” when the FTC filed a complaint saying that medical information belonging to thousands of consumers was exposed online by the company. Under the settlement, GMR and its owners are barred from misrepresenting their privacy and security practices to consumers. The company must also create a comprehensive information security program, which will be evaluated by a third-party every two years. European banks not greatly concerned over Russia. For now, European banks with exposure to Russia don’t appear too concerned about the effect on their bottom lines of economic sanctions against Moscow, but that outlook could change if the sanctions linger, the New York Times reports. On Thursday, the Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank International and Rabobank of the Netherlands echoed comments from other European lenders in saying they expected a “low” or “limited” impact on their earnings as a result of Western sanctions imposed on Russia over the crisis in Ukraine. Shippers eye Iceland volcano. FedEx Corp., DHL Express and United Parcel Service Inc. said they were keeping an eye, Thursday, on Iceland’s Bardarbunga volcano for signs that they would need to enact contingency plans, the WSJ’s CIO Journal reports. Iceland’s civil protection authority began evacuating people from the surrounding area, Wednesday, as earth tremors sparked fears of an impending eruption. At the same time, Bloomberg reports that airlines face less disruption than from a major emission of ash from an Icelandic volcano in 2010. China fast-food troubles add to risks. Recent hygiene problems at fast-food chains in China come as the rapidly growing industry is grappling with a host of other issues, the FT reports.

It drew strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and for the people has not perished from the Earth.

When choosing a destination for a vacation or a trip, you need to decide what that destination has to offer to you. Meanwhile, you should also take many factors into consideration, so that the decision-making will get easy. The amount of money you want to spend is an important factor and plays an important role in deciding a destination. For example, cities like London, New York, Vegas etc are expensive.

Therefore, it is important to estimate your budget before selecting a destination. When you plan your vacation, another important thing to plan is the number of the days you want to spend. There are many travel destinations in the world that can be covered in a week's time. Some destinations like Africa, or Maldives beaches can be planned in a week's time.

It is widely considered the world's oldest religion, originating in India around 1500 BCE and having undergone numerous transformations and reinterpretations throughout its existence. Hinduism is a complex and highly diverse religion that cannot be traced back to a single founder or sacred text. It encompasses a wide range of beliefs, practices, and religious expressions that have evolved over thousands of years. It is classified as a “way of life” embedded within the Indian subcontinent, with a rich philosophy that emphasizes tolerance, moral conduct, and spiritual growth. According to the 2011 Census of India, about 79.8% of the Indian population identifies as Hindu, making it the most common religion among the roughly 1.3 billion people who live in the country. This equates to more than 966 million followers, making it not only the most practiced faith in India but also the third-largest religious group globally, after Christianity and Islam. Hinduism encompasses a variety of beliefs and practices based on these core concepts: 1. Dharma: The concept of duty, morality, and righteous living. 2. Karma: The law of cause and effect, which determines the consequences of actions in both past and future lives. 3. Samsara: The cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (reincarnation) that all beings experience. 4. Moksha: The ultimate spiritual goal to attain liberation from the cycle of samsara, achieved through self-realization and a deep understanding of the divine. Hinduism also features a vast pantheon of gods and goddesses, each representing different aspects of the divine. The primary deities in the Hindu pantheon are Brahma (the creator), Vishnu (the preserver), and Shiva (the destroyer), often known as the Trimurti or Holy Trinity. However, many other lesser gods and goddesses also feature in the intricate mythology and religious practices of Hinduism. Hindu rituals and worship practices vary greatly, from daily prayers and devotional offerings at home to elaborate temple rituals and festivals. Many Hindus observe specific rites of passage, such as birth and naming ceremonies, marriages, and funerals, which all serve to reinforce their cultural and religious identity. Despite Hinduism's prominent position in Indian society, the country is also home to several other major religious communities, such as Islam (14.2%), Christianity (2.3%), and Sikhism (1.7%). India is known for its religious diversity and vast cultural history, which has led to a unique blend of beliefs, customs, and ways of life. In summary, Hinduism is the most common religion in India, accounting for approximately 79.8% of its population. It is a highly diverse and interconnected system of beliefs and practices rooted in the rich cultural history and traditions of the Indian subcontinent."},{"instruction":"NEW YORK - The curse is dead.

Are James Glickenhaus and Dallas M. Fitzgerald both assocaited with silent films? A:","output":"Yes, both James Glickenhaus and Dallas M. Fitzgerald have associations with silent films, though their contributions to these films and the nature of their engagement with them differ significantly. James Glickenhaus is a film director, producer, and financier known for his work on B-movies and action films. While he wasn't actively involved in the production of silent films, Glickenhaus has expressed admiration for this era of film history and the skills possessed by silent film artists. In interviews, he has described silent films as being \\"creative and amazing\\" while highlighting the importance of visual storytelling they showcased. In this context, it's fair to say that James Glickenhaus is associated with silent films in the sense of his admiration and respect for the filmmaking techniques and the artists involved in their creation. On the other hand, Dallas M. Fitzgerald was a more direct participant in the silent film era. He was an American film director, producer, and screenwriter who was active in the industry between the 1910s and 1930s. His career began during the silent film era, working on numerous silent films such as \\"The Midnight Message\\" (1926), \\"Winners of the Wilderness\\" (1927), and \\"Sister Against Sister\\" (1930). His involvement in the production of silent films establishes a more active and direct connection than Glickenhaus'. In summary, both James Glickenhaus and Dallas M. Fitzgerald are associated with silent films, albeit in different ways. While Glickenhaus has expressed admiration for the era and its approaches to filmmaking, Fitzgerald was an active participant in the industry during the silent film era, directing, producing, and writing for these films."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who offers to help Crucial Taunt make a video? is inside the article: In Aurora, Illinois, rock fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar host a public-access television show, Wayne's World, from Wayne's parents' basement. After they sell the rights to the show to television producer Benjamin Oliver for 10,000, they celebrate at a night club, where they avoid Wayne's troubled ex-girlfriend Stacy. Wayne falls for Cassandra Wong, vocalist and bassist of the band performing that night, Crucial Taunt, and impresses her with his Cantonese. He purchases a 1964 Fender Stratocaster electric guitar he has long coveted. Benjamin attempts to steal Cassandra from Wayne by using his wealth and good looks. He distracts Wayne and Garth with all-access tickets to an Alice Cooper concert in Milwaukee, while offering to produce a music video for Crucial Taunt. At the concert, Wayne and Garth make the acquaintance of a bodyguard to music producer Frankie Sharp, head of Sharp Records. While filming the revamped Wayne's World under Benjamin's oversight, Wayne and Garth find it difficult to adjust to the professional studio environment. Their contract obliges them to give a promotional interview to their sponsor, Noah Vanderhoff, who owns a franchise of amusement arcades. After Wayne publicly ridicules Vanderhoff, he is fired from the show, causing a rift in his friendship with Garth. Jealous of the attention Benjamin is giving Cassandra, Wayne attempts to prevent her from participating in the Crucial Taunt music video shoot. She breaks up with him, furious at his lack of trust. Wayne and Garth reunite and hatch a plan to win Cassandra back by having Sharp hear Crucial Taunt play. While Garth and their friends infiltrate a satellite station with the aid of Benjamin's assistant, Wayne goes to Cassandra's video shoot, but embarrasses himself in an attempt to expose Benjamin's ulterior motive.

Let me explain that better for you. The word \\"opportunity\\" means a chance to do something. Imagine you find a shiny rock while playing outside, and you take the chance to show it to your friends. That's an opportunity! Now, \\"absurdist observations\\" are funny or silly things people say about stuff that doesn't make much sense. Like when you see someone wearing a giraffe costume and you say, \\"Wow, that giraffe is really good at walking on two legs!\\" It's something that doesn't really happen, so it's an absurd observation. So, if you like finding the funny side of things and have a good sense of humor, it can be a positive experience, because you can enjoy making these silly comments and making people laugh. But if someone doesn't like this type of humor, they might think of it as negative, because it's not serious or real. Remember, whether something is positive or negative can sometimes depend on how a person feels about it. And that's okay!

One inspirational success story. USA TODAY A raccoon stretches itself on the window sill of the Paige Donnelly Law Firm on the 23rd floor of the UBS Tower in St. Paul, Minn., on June 12. (Photo: Evan Frost, AP) After a perilous journey that captured the attention of thousands, a brave raccoon has made it to the top of a Minnesota skyscraper. The raccoon, who became stranded on the ledge of a building in St. Paul, climbed a 25-story tower and turned into an internet celebrity overnight. The saga started Monday, when the animal was spotted in a shallow recess of a wall on a Town Square building, Minnesota Public Radio's KNOW-FM reports. A maintenance crew attempted to help the raccoon by offering it a makeshift ladder. That didn't work — it scared the animal to a nearby office tower, where it began its death-defying ascent. Tuesday afternoon, local coverage of the climb trended on Twitter with #mprraccoon, and the world began rooting for the little guy. People became concerned it might not make it up the UBS Tower. Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn even tweeted he would donate 1,000 to help rescue the raccoon. But, an attempted rescue is what sparked this dangerous feat. The raccoon surprisingly clawed up the side of the 25-story tower. (Photo: Evan Frost, AP) “The best thing is to leave him alone,\\" Laurie Brickley, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Safety and Inspections, told the Star Tribune Tuesday. Animal control workers did set live traps on the tower's roof, believing that would be the safest option for capture, MPR reports. Then, rescuers could bring the critter back down to safety. Windows on the building do not open, workers said. As of Tuesday evening, the raccoon had climbed to the 23rd floor. Around 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, live feeds showed the raccoon reached the roof. A Twitter account following the frightened raccoon's journey declared \\"I made it!\\" The raccoon was captured in a live trap, a law firm occupying the top floor of the building told MPR reporter Tim Nelson. Rescuers plan to release the raccoon to safety, hopefully far away from any tall buildings. After a delicious meal of soft cat food, #mprraccoon has been caught and will be picked up by Wildlife Management.

We were all worried about him,\\" said Sheila Donnelly-Coyne, an attorney whose firm, Paige Donnelly, is on the 23rd floor of the UBS building. (It was later determined that the critter is female.) The raccoon was spotted more than 20 stories above street level, in a downtown escapade that our colleagues at Minnesota Public Radio tracked closely — she was, after all, just across the street from them, giving them front-row seats as the animal avoided death and capture with equal aplomb. Enlarge this image toggle caption Sheila Donnelly-Coyne/Paige Donnelly Law Sheila Donnelly-Coyne/Paige Donnelly Law Dubbed the #mprraccoon on Twitter, the raccoon drew thousands of breathless observers as she scampered, scaled and explored her unlikely high-rise habitat. Her occasional naps were followed closely, analyzed for clues about her mental state, hopes and dreams. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter spun her adventure as a positive for the city's tourism industry — proof that even a raccoon knew Minnesota's capital \\"is a great place to reach for higher heights.\\" Meanwhile, tensions were reaching such great heights of their own that a local Good Samaritan roughly two dozen stories below the raccoon even offered — rather ambitiously — to catch the little one. Happily, no such extreme measures were necessary. Folks with the UBS Plaza announced Wednesday morning that the raccoon had reached the roof overnight, grabbed a snack of soft cat food and found herself trapped in one of the cages laid out for her there. The building's management hired the local Wildlife Management Services to trap the raccoon. The group says it then brought the tiny hero's cage to a private residence in the suburbs outside the city — where, after consultation with the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Minnesota, the raccoon was released Wednesday afternoon \\"with permission from the homeowner.\\" Wildlife Management Services posted video of the release, which shows a rather reluctant raccoon eventually dashing off into the wild green yonder. But one question remains: What inspired her Alex Honnold-like heroics? Probably something pretty mundane, frankly. Before she became an online sensation, the #mprraccoon was likely looking for food in a lower skyway, Tim Nelson of MPR News reported. He said the animal had been stranded on the building for at least two days. At any rate, she's safe now.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The proposed perturbation, planting seeds that are not compatible with the soil type, may not directly impact the process of photosynthesis, particularly the water breaking down within the plant, but it can indirectly affect the overall health and growth of the plant which can in turn limit its ability to conduct photosynthesis. If a plant is not suited to the soil in which it's planted, it may struggle to absorb necessary nutrients and water from the soil, which are crucial for photosynthesis to occur. The nutrients, particularly nitrate, phosphate, and potassium, are necessary for a plant's general health and ability to conduct photosynthesis. If a plant is unhealthy due to a lack of these nutrients, it may not be able to conduct photosynthesis properly. The plant might struggle with root development, which would directly impact its ability to absorb water. Even though the inability of plant to break down water might not be directly linked to the compatibility between the plant and the soil, an unhealthy plant may carry out photosynthesis at a slower rate or may not be able to perform the process at all. Moreover, if the plant is water-stressed due to an inability to absorb enough water, the plant's stomata may close to prevent water loss, which also prevents the intake of carbon dioxide, a necessary component in photosynthesis. In summary, while the proposed perturbation does not directly affect the molecule-level process of photosynthesis, i.e., the breaking down of water, planting seeds that aren't compatible with the soil can indirectly limit a plant's ability to perform photosynthesis by compromising its overall health and growth."},{"instruction":"how will the cap shape up after 2013?

The statement regarding the choir ensemble refers to a musical performance involving women, while the statement about the woman reading the Bible refers to an individual engaging in a religious activity. It is essential to understand the context of each statement to understand why there is no logical connection between them. The \\"Choir ensemble of women dressed in red\\" implies a group of women performing music together, most likely in a coordinated or harmonized fashion. A choir typically performs in various settings, such as at religious services, concerts, or special events. They may sing various genres of music, including but not limited to sacred songs or hymns. While there is a possibility that some of the women in the choir ensemble may have an interest in religious activities, such as reading the Bible, the fact that they are in a choir and dressed in red does not provide any connection to any individual reading scripture. On the other hand, \\"A woman reads the Bible\\" depicts an individual engaging in a religious or educational activity and has nothing to do with the choir ensemble or their attire. Reading the Bible may be for personal belief, study, or even research. Moreover, it does not necessarily imply any association with a choir or musical performance. To sum it up, while both statements might be related to religion in some way, they do not logically follow one another. The claim about the choir ensemble addresses a collective and their attire during a musical performance, whereas the statement about the woman reading the Bible involves a personal and independent religious activity. Without any additional context or information to connect the two, it is incorrect to assume that one statement logically follows the other."},{"instruction":"\\"and thanks to nicole and his own stupidity , he 'd destroyed his relationship with his one true friend , and hurt the only woman he truly trusted and loved . that rift was only beginning to heal after seven years . he was n't repeating the mistakes that had led to it in the first place . no , tonight he was making an entirely new _ ...\\" What is the word in the blank space (_)? The answer is","output":"set of mistakes. In the given context, the protagonist has learned from his past experiences and understands that he should not repeat the mistakes he made before, which caused a significant rift in his relationships. However, as a flawed human being, he may still find himself making errors in judgment. The phrase \\"an entirely new set of mistakes\\" signifies that he is not repeating his past mistakes but instead making different, unforeseen errors in the present. These new mistakes may include not communicating openly with his loved ones, not expressing his feelings honestly, or failing to recognize the warning signs of potential conflict in his relationships. In any case, the protagonist's journey involves learning from both old and new mistakes to grow as an individual and, hopefully, repair and maintain his relationships with those he cares about. Furthermore, the concept of making an \\"entirely new set of mistakes\\" emphasizes that human growth and personal development are ongoing processes. No one becomes an expert in relationships or communication overnight; learning from our mistakes and missteps is an essential part of our emotional and social education.

In his early 30s, he was already making waves at the IT firm he worked at, rapidly scaling the corporate ladder. Kevin was smart, diligent, and driven — qualities that earned him a comfortable income and a much-envied lifestyle. However, his success came at a cost. His long working hours had led him to neglect his personal life, and all his relationships had become peripheral. One day, as Kevin was out for a walk, he noticed a stunning red sports car on display at the local dealership. Entranced by its beauty, he began to daydream about cruising down the highway, the wind in his hair and the purr of the engine filling the air. Kevin had always been fascinated by sports cars, and owning one was an unfulfilled dream. However, upon returning home, he found his solitary apartment to be a stark reminder of the emptiness in his personal life. Kevin suddenly wondered if owning a sports car would be the right choice, given the lonely state of his relationships. That night, he struggled to sleep, lost in a maze of uncertainty. The following weekend, Kevin decided to visit his childhood home. He shared his dilemma with his parents, who had always been a pillar of support throughout his life. While his father understood the appeal of owning a sleek car, his mother was more concerned about the emotional void that seemed to be hurting him. During their heartfelt discussions, Kevin's parents took him back to the park where he had spent countless hours playing as a child. The familiar sights and sounds brought back a flood of memories, and as he watched the families enjoying picnics and children running around, he experienced a longing for a deeper connection in his life. After returning to the city, Kevin felt that perhaps purchasing a lavish sports car wouldn't remedy his loneliness. He soon began exploring other options and discovered an opportunity to purchase a beautiful house in a serene suburban neighborhood. It was a charming, cozy abode surrounded by lush greenery and friendly neighbors. As he walked around the property, he could envision himself starting a family there and filling the home with laughter and warmth. Kevin realized that investing in a home could provide the foundation he needed to build a meaningful future with relationships and experiences that mattered. In the end, Kevin's decision led him to prioritize what truly mattered in his life. Excitement and speed may be exhilarating, but it was the depth and beauty of human connections that he ultimately desired. It was the right time for him to take a leap of faith for emotional fulfillment. And so, a new chapter in Kevin's life began. A chapter that brought great change and renewed happiness. Surrounded by blossoming friendships and the love of his caring family, Kevin finally found solace in his decision.

On 15 January, Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, a former Finnish general of the Imperial Russian Army, was appointed the commander-in-chief of the Civil Guards. The Senate appointed the Guards, henceforth called the White Guards, as the White Army of Finland. Mannerheim placed his Headquarters of the White Army in the Vaasa-Seinäjoki area. The White Order to engage was issued on 25 January. The Whites gained weaponry by disarming Russian garrisons during 21-28 January, in particular in southern Ostrobothnia. The Red Guards, led by Ali Aaltonen, refused to recognise the Whites' hegemony and established a military authority of their own. Aaltonen installed his headquarters in Helsinki and nicknamed it Smolna echoing the Smolny Institute, the Bolsheviks' headquarters in Petrograd. The Red Order of Revolution was issued on 26 January, and a red lantern, a symbolic indicator of the uprising, was lit in the tower of the Helsinki Workers' House. A large-scale mobilisation of the Reds began late in the evening of 27 January, with the Helsinki Red Guard and some of the Guards located along the Vyborg-Tampere railway having been activated between 23 and 26 January, in order to safeguard vital positions and escort a heavy railroad shipment of Bolshevik weapons from Petrograd to Finland. White troops tried to capture the shipment: 20-30 Finns, Red and White, died in the Battle of Kämärä at the Karelian Isthmus on 27 January 1918. The Finnish rivalry for power had culminated.

They don’t brag about how great they are or show off; instead, they act modest and wait for other people to note their achievements. They don’t make a spectacle of themselves, they are in awe of how big and complicated the world is, and they don’t march into a room like they own the place. If you want to be humble, then be happy to be who you are without showing off about it. Always give other people credit. If someone says you’ve done great work on a project, mention that you couldn’t have done it without the help of your other co-workers. Treat other people with kindness and respect – even if they don’t always deserve it. Be punctual if you said you were going to be somewhere. Hold doors for people. Don’t text your friends or look distracted when you’re supposed to be giving another person your full attention. Make eye contact, don’t curse, and treat people kindly regardless of their social status or their position within your social network or company. Treating people with respect means treating everyone the same, regardless of what you think they can do for you. Having tact means not saying anything that is offensive, off-color, or just plain weird. Tactful people think before they speak and they are discreet if they have to say something slightly uncomfortable – like if they have to tell a person that he has something in his teeth. Be aware of what you say and also of how you say it – you may mean well, but your comment may be taken the wrong way because of your tone or the words you used. Being tactful means not bringing up anything that can cause a stir. If you know you’re hanging out with two people who have very opposite views on Obamacare, for example, then don’t bring it up in their company. Generous people are able to give – whether it’s their time, their money, or their love and kindness. Be a person who is always looking for a way to help others, whether we’re talking about your closest friends or perfect strangers who are in need. Cultivate a generous spirit that is always looking for ways to help other people and to improve and expand their lives. Being generous with your time is important. Sure, helping your friend clean her apartment will be a time suck, but she’ll really appreciate all of the help since she’s been so down in the dumps lately because of her break-up. Being generous also means recognizing opportunities when you can help out. Your sick friend may not say that he’d love it if you picked up chicken soup for lunch, but that doesn’t mean he won’t appreciate it. It’s important to take a compliment the right way if you really want to be gracious. Thank people for their compliments, and show how much their words mean to you. You don’t have to downplay it or make it sound like you don’t deserve it; sounding overly-modest can get a little bit annoying. Instead, say something like, “Thank you so much for saying that. It means so much to me.” If you can give a return compliment at the time, that would be great. For example, if someone says, “Thank you so much for helping me with my math homework,” you can say, “It was my pleasure. And thank you for helping me with the English homework last week. That was so helpful.” Gracious people know how to handle criticism – whether it’s constructive or not. If the criticism is constructive, then you have to be able to see the value from it, learn from it, and make a plan for growing or improving the qualities you were criticized for. And if the criticism was just meant to hurt you, then you can let it roll off your back and take the higher ground by not saying something negative about the person in return. A great deal about your character can be revealed depending on how you take criticism. If you immediately get angry and defensive then this shows that you are uncomfortable acknowledging your flaws. Furthermore, it just won’t be very gracious. Gracious people act the way they do because they know how to count their blessings instead of focusing on the challenges they have to face. They know exactly what they have to be thankful for, whether it’s their health, their friends, their family, and/or their opportunities, and they never forget any of those things for a second. If you want to be grateful, then you have to always know how much you have to be thankful for, no matter how upset or frustrated you may be feeling at any given moment. If you’re really feeling out of your element or down in the dumps, it helps to write a gratitude list. This can include all of the things you’re thankful for, and you can add to it whenever another thing occurs to you. Taking the time to read over the list and smile can make you feel more grateful no matter how bad your day was.","output":"Gracious people are humble, modest, and don't brag about their achievements.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person's Geiger count has less current running through it? Hint: One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below.

(CNN) -- Every year the brains behind your favorite reality TV shows flock to Santa Monica, California, to talk shop and honor the best in nonfiction TV. This year's Realscreen West: The Factual Entertainment Forum took place recently over two days; reality TV darling Kim Kardashian was awarded the Hall of Fame Personality of the Year award, while producer Thom Beers, producer of the über hit \\"Deadliest Catch,\\" was inducted into the Hall of Fame and took home three trophies -- most original concept, best docu-reality programming and the 2012 Award of Excellence. At the forum, CNN's KJ Matthews chatted up two of the most successful reality TV producers: SallyAnn Salsano, owner of 495 Productions, better known as the creator of the MTV super-hit \\"Jersey Shore,\\" and Brent Montgomery, owner of Leftfield Pictures, also known as the entity behind the successful History Channel show \\"Pawn Stars.\\" The two talked about everything reality TV-related -- from the shows they wish they had produced to the ongoing struggle to find people for their shows to why they get annoyed at all the people who think creating a reality show is easy. They also touched on how long \\"Jersey Shore\\" might continue, and their thoughts on CNN's decision to partner with celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain. CNN: Recently I've noticed that networks which had no reality TV shows are now getting into the reality game. What do you think about that? Brent Montgomery: I love it because that means there are more people for us to sell to. CNN: Is it becoming more difficult to cast or find people in reality TV shows. Some failed actors are using the route of reality TV to get their name out. Montgomery: That's why you don't cast in L.A. I did \\"Blind Date\\" in New York and L.A., and every \\"Blind Date\\" contestant in L.A. was like, \\"Here's my head shots and um, when do I get my 100 and what are the chances of me, you know, when do film directors get to see this and do you guys get a lot of calls?\\" I said never. ... SallyAnn Salsano: (Steven) Spielberg is not watching \\"Blind Date.\\" I mean maybe but not to find talent. I mean he may be watching it. I don't know. But certainly not to cast his next film. CNN: Have you both gotten better at pitching reality shows to networks since you've had a successful track record with some of your shows? Montgomery: I think so. Because I think you get better at anything you do over the course of time. I think I'm better at knowing the steps that it's gonna take to (make a show with) subsequent seasons and how you'll have to have a show that will have room to grow. Salsano: No one wants a \\"one and done.\\" Not a producer and not a network, because in the end of season one, everyone spends so much time behind the scenes in our offices and at the network level trying to crack it. ... But in the end, you put so much into it that if you can get to season two, then you are off to the races. You know what works and you know what didn't work and then you can move forward. CNN: People watch reality TV, and some people think that some of it is crap, and (it) has led many to believe that anybody can create a reality show. Montgomery: This p*sses me off more than anything because people think because they watch TV they can make TV, and that may sound kind of simplistic, but people may actually think that these shows are very simple. I watch \\"Jersey Shore,\\" and I know that for every minute of on-camera drama there is probably an hour or two or more of off-camera drama. My show people say all the time, \\"Wow, it's just such a simple show.\\" We work hard to make them look simple! Salsano: Here is my least favorite (expletive) thing. ... You are in the process of deciding if you want to work with someone, and you show up with your camera, and they say you should have been here yesterday it was so funny. OK, well I'm here today, and if I'm shooting a show; I'm not going to schedule good TV. You're telling me you're so great that you should have your own TV show, then go (show me what you've got)! CNN: Sally, can you ever envision the \\"Jersey Shore\\" (still shooting even in a nursing home)? Salsano: The thing about \\"Jersey Shore\\" is that there is a guido born every day. ... So for me it's an endless supply. CNN: Which show do both of you wish you had created? Montgomery: I like \\"1000 Ways to Die\\"! Salsano: I'm so crazy because I love, like \\"Storage Wars,\\" but I (expletive) love \\"Toddlers & Tiaras\\" so much it hurts. I literally like, (expletive) love it. It's just like crack. I literally can't get enough of that show. Montgomery: Can I change mine? It's \\"An Idiot Abroad.\\" I love that show! CNN: As you both know, CNN recently hired Anthony Bourdain. What do you guys think about that? Salsano: I think it's a great fit. Montgomery: I think it's a great fit, too. I think when you are a network doing something new, why not go after a big name? I'm sure the cross over between your viewers and his show is a high-income viewer. Salsano: I think it's going to be fine. And I actually would like to see the new twist on it. Like I do watch \\"No Reservations\\" like crazy and I (DVR) it, and I'm into it, but now I'm excited to see what happens on another network.

He moves into a crummy Manhattan studio apartment and prepares for work.When he arrives at the firm, he finds that it's closing because it was acquired in a hostile takeover and that 90% of the workforce, including himself, is now jobless. However, even without employment, Brantley refuses to give up looking for another job. He's repeatedly turned down with all his interviewers telling him that he lacks the experience necessary.With no good prospects, Brantley decides to play his last card: prior to leaving Kansas, his mother tells him that he's related to Howard Prescott (Richard Jordan), a distant uncle & the CEO of Pemrose, a large New York investment firm and one of the richest in the world.

This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks.

As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

Translate to English.","output":"In recent years, distance learning has become an important aspect of capacity building worldwide; it will complement the one provided by seminars. Over the past few years, distance education has emerged as a crucial component in enhancing capacities across the globe. This form of education has not only helped to address various challenges associated with traditional learning systems but has also bolstered the role of seminars in facilitating access to quality education. Distance learning, enabled by advancements in technology, allows students and professionals to take courses and engage in studying at their own pace and convenience. This has proven to be an increasingly important factor in a rapidly globalizing world, where individuals need to acquire new skills and knowledge constantly to remain competitive and employable. As a result, distance education is becoming more and more popular among professionals who seek flexibility and balance between their work and personal lives. Moreover, distance learning greatly enhances accessibility to learning resources. People living in remote locations or in areas with limited resources can access education and training through digital means, such as online platforms, mobile applications, and other multimedia tools. This has opened up a wealth of opportunities, especially for individuals in developing countries, who otherwise would not have had the chance to improve their skills and education levels. Furthermore, distance learning often allows for a more personalized approach towards learning, where learners can customize their study materials, schedules, and courses to suit their specific needs. This kind of individualized attention increases the chances of success, satisfaction, and retention among learners. In light of these benefits offered by distance learning, it serves as a valuable complement to traditional seminars. Seminars remain a crucial source of networking, interaction with experts, debates, and hands-on experiences for students and professionals in various fields. They reinforce the learning experience by providing opportunities for real-time discussions, experiential learning, and peer-to-peer collaboration. Hence, they contribute significantly to the overall growth and development of learners. In conclusion, distance learning and seminars, when combined, provide a comprehensive, versatile, and dynamic approach to capacity building. This collaboration enables individuals around the world to acquire new skills, adapt to changing job markets, and enhance their professional development while offering a flexible, convenient, and accessible way to learn. As such, the future of education will continue to incorporate these two critical components, promoting learning and development at all stages of an individual's professional journey."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence in Spanish.","output":"\\"El gato es bonito.\\" This sentence means \\"The cat is pretty\\" in English.

These novels were written by the noted American author, George R.R. Martin. Just to provide more context, Stannis is a complex character, often described as stern, unyielding, and duty-bound. He doesn't appear directly until the second book, \\"A Clash of Kings\\", but he plays a crucial role in the storyline. He is introduced as the rightful king of the Seven Kingdoms following the death of his brother, King Robert Baratheon, given that Robert's children are born of incest and thus considered illegitimate. Unlike his charismatic and well-liked brothers, Stannis is not a people-person and isn't normally inclined towards charm or diplomacy. Nevertheless, his unbending sense of duty and justice mark him as a key player and potential ruler in the turbulent realm of Westeros. Stannis has a particular relationship with a red priestess named Melisandre, who worships the Lord of Light and foresees him as the promised prince in her prophecies. She exercises significant influence over him, fueling his ambition while drawing him into a new and controversial faith that involves human sacrifice, creating conflict within his ranks. In addition to his roles in the novel, Stannis Baratheon is adapted to the screen in the TV series \\"Game of Thrones\\", where he's portrayed by actor Stephen Dillane from the second to the fifth season.

Le travail du Rapporteur spécial revêt une importance particulière car il rappelle aux États leur obligation de respecter, protéger et garantir les droits de l'homme et les libertés fondamentales dans le cadre de leurs efforts pour lutter contre le terrorisme. En outre, il contribue à sensibiliser et à fournir des orientations sur les normes internationales applicables en matière de droits de l'homme dans la lutte contre le terrorisme, garantissant ainsi que les actions entreprises pour contrer ce fléau soient conformes à ces normes."},{"instruction":"Question 1: What are the steps to be taken to become a good TopCoder? Question 2: Where does TopCoder Petr work? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: What are the steps to be taken to become a good TopCoder? To become a good TopCoder, individuals should follow a systematic approach that involves learning, practice, and consistent growth in their programming skills. Here are several steps to be taken: 1. Master the foundational skills: Begin by understanding basic programming concepts and learning a programming language like C++, Java, or Python. Gain a strong foundation in data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues) and algorithms (searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming). 2. Familiarize yourself with TopCoder: Create an account on TopCoder and explore the site to understand its resources, competition formats, and rules. Start participating in Single Round Matches (SRMs) and practice those problems that cater to your current skill level. Gradually move to more complex problems. 3. Learn advanced concepts: As you progress, learn more advanced data structures (binary trees, heaps, graphs) and algorithms (greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, backtracking, memoization). Delve deeper into programming paradigms like object-oriented, functional, and multithreaded programming. 4. Practice, practice, practice: The more problems you solve, the better you'll become. Start with the TopCoder archives to find problems from previous competitions and solve as many as possible. Look for high-quality educational resources, such as competitive programming courses, websites, books, and online tutorials to further enhance your skills. 5. Participate in contests: Regularly take part in TopCoder contests and competitions like SRMs and Marathon Matches to test your skills and gain exposure to the variety of problems that you'll encounter on the platform. The more experience you gather, the better your chances of improving your ranking and skill level. 6. Collaboration and Networking: Engage with the TopCoder community and join forums or chat rooms to interact with other programmers. Discuss problem-solving strategies, share your experiences, and learn from others' approaches. Networking with fellow competitive programmers can broaden your perspectives. 7. Keep track of your performance: Monitor your progress and analyze your performance after each competition. Identify areas where you struggle and work on them. Set realistic goals and be persistent in your efforts to improve. 8. Learn time management: In competitive programming, solving problems quickly is crucial. Develop effective time management skills and learn how to optimize and prioritize your code execution accordingly. Question 2: Where does TopCoder Petr work? Petr Mitrichev is a renowned competitive programmer and TopCoder competitor. He currently works at Google as a Software Engineer.

It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 album A Night at the Opera. It is a six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda. The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre. I'm going to shatter some illusions, it was just one of those pieces I wrote for the album: just writing my batch of songs. In its early stages I almost rejected it, but then it grew. We started deciding on a single about halfway through. There were a few contenders - we were thinking of \\"The Prophet's Song\\" at one point - but then \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" seemed the one. There was a time when the others wanted to chop it around a bit, but I refused. If it was going to be released, it would be in its entirety. We knew it was very risky, but we had so much confidence in that song - I did anyway. I felt, underneath it all, that if it was successful it would earn a lot of respect. People were all going, You're joking, they'll never play it, you'll only hear the first few bars and then they'll fade it out. We had numerous rows. EMI were shocked - a six-minute single? You must be joking! The same in America - oh, you just got away with it in Britain. When we finished the album, the Night at the Opera album, that was the track on it that we thought we were gonna release as a single in the UK first. And when we released it in Britain we didn't necessarily think it'd be released in America, cause we know even over here, you know, the AM tastes are even more [hesitates] stricter. Anyway we did have thoughts about even in the UK, perhaps editing it down at all, but we listened to it over and over again and there was no way we could edit it. We tried a few ideas, but if you edited it, you always lost some part of the song, so we had to leave it all in. And luckily it took off anyway. The vocal harmonies was something we wanted to do from the beginning, as we are always keen to do that kind of thing. We wanted to be a group that could do the heaviness of hard rock, but also have harmonies swooping around all over the place. We thought there was some real power and emotion in that combination. The guitar solo was pretty much off the cuff, except I think I had plenty of time to think about that one. I remember playing along with it in the studio for a while when other things were being done. I knew what kind of melody I wanted to play. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Oh absolutely, dear! You see, this article tells us that \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" is no ordinary song. The band Queen created it with many different parts instead of a repeated set of verses and choruses that most songs have. Think of it like a beautiful and fun story instead of a simple thing! Also, there were times they almost didn't finish the song because it was so long. It's like when you are trying to build a very big lego castle and think about giving up because it's so big. But they didn't give up, they built their lego castle (the song) exactly like they wanted to! This might be a bit of a stretch for a five year old, but it's like they created a fairytale story, full of magic and adventure.

Step 1: Research the event in which the British schooner Gaspee was attacked. The Gaspee Affair was a significant event leading up to the American Revolution in 1772. The British naval schooner HMS Gaspee, commanded by Lieutenant William Dudingston, was tasked with enforcing the customs regulations in the Narragansett Bay area in Rhode Island. Due to the strict enforcement and subsequent mistreatment of local merchants, tensions were high between the colonists and the Gaspee's crew. Step 2: Identify who led the attack on the Gaspee. On the night of June 9, 1772, a group of American colonists, disguised as Narragansett Indians, rowed out to the grounded Gaspee and attacked it. The group was led by a prominent Rhode Island merchant named John Brown. Step 3: Verify the information. Cross-referencing multiple sources, such as historical texts and reputable websites, confirms that John Brown did indeed lead the attack on the Gaspee. In conclusion, John Brown led the attack on the British schooner Gaspee. The event known as the Gaspee Affair played a pivotal role in escalating tensions between the American colonies and the British Empire, ultimately culminating in the American Revolution."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What happens when there is too much happening at once?\\" is in \\"Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks.

Over the next few weeks, the mysterious woman becomes a regular at the convenience store, always arriving shortly before midnight to grab a quick snack and a cup of coffee. Shuichi starts to dream about the fascinating world that she hopes to be part of, and the melodies she hums become a vital part of his life. Intrigued by the music, Shuichi discovers that the woman is an aspiring singer named Yumi, who sings by night and writes songs by day, seeking the perfect opportunity to share her music with the world. Fascinated by her voice and her passion for music, Shuichi begins to confide in her about his own love for the art. Their chance meetings eventually turn into late-night conversations about life, music and their dreams, with Shuichi finding solace in Yumi's company while she sees him as a steadfast source of support and encouragement. As their connection grows stronger, Shuichi decides to secretly take up learning an instrument in hopes of surprising Yumi and joining her in her musical journey. Unfortunately, their happiness is short-lived, as a record producer from Yumi's past appears with an offer that could change her life forever. But accepting it would mean leaving her life in Tokyo behind, including her friendship with Shuichi. Torn between her dreams and her bond with Shuichi, Yumi ultimately makes a heart-wrenching decision that will alter both of their lives forever. With her choice having a profound impact on Shuichi, he must find a way to come to terms with the harsh realities of life and hold on to his love for music. As the story unfolds, \\"Midnight Melodies\\" captures the beauty of music and the power of friendship, showing how sometimes, even the most fleeting of connections can leave a lasting impression. In moments of despair, it's the memories of passion and hope that resonate the loudest, reminding us that, just like a song, some people can leave an indelible mark on our hearts."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"I would buy this product at this store whose address is www.loja.com.\\" to Russian?","output":"To translate the given phrase to Russian, I will first identify the key elements of the sentence and then translate them, making sure to maintain correct grammar and a natural sentence structure in Russian.

We know we can close the gap. It’s been done or almost been done before in Scottish education, but the answers have been ignored as they pass us by. The simple clue is this: poverty is single biggest predictor of achievement, and according to research (Hammonds sic, reference required), aged 10, a child living in poverty is 60% less likely to get to university. Boyd borrowed from his own mother’s report card to ask us what kind of education we desire. Is it the academic success at all costs route, or is there another option we need to value as much, if not more? His mother’s report card, one that prevented her from becoming a secondary school pupil in Glasgow, is filled with G and FG, until the last point: Character and conduct - excellent. What kind of pupils do we want to develop in Scotland? What do we value in our assessment system? Opening up opportunity for all is a tough game to play when the examination system rewards only certain types of behaviour, few of them related to what the Curriculum for Excellence says we stand for. In his own small community in East Kilbride, three secondary schools enter a period of meltdown as the local rag sets about creating its own local league table of performance, with those three ‘teams’ in competition for the top spot (or at least not the bottom one). Therefore, we must stop basing “the gap” largely on attainment. First of all, Boyd would like us to remove the traditional, and non-sensical academic/vocational divide.

He usually hires young pickpockets or small-time criminals as his local help, whom he usually murders after the end of the job to prevent any identification. He uses multiple aliases and also has middlemen between him and his handlers. He also carries a watch to perform a hit in specific time and correctly visualizes his every target. After completing a hit in Prague and killing his current help, Joe travels to Bangkok for an assignment to assassinate four people for notorious Bangkok crime boss Surat, whom he never meets. Joe occasionally provides insight via voiceover narration throughout the film. He hires a local pickpocket with simple English knowledge, Kong, as his go-between in Bangkok, a condition of the contract being that the gang will never meet Joe. Contracts from the Bangkok gangsters are passed to Kong one by one via a nightclub dancer, Aom. Joe's first execution in Bangkok is done on motorcycle; when the target car stops at a red light, Joe kills all the passengers with a machine pistol. Kong retrieves information about the second target, again via Aom, and the pair become friendlier with every contact. Before Joe executes his mission, Kong informs him of the target, Pramod Juntasa, another notorious gang lord and Surat's rival crime boss who acts as sex trafficker, buying young girls from impoverished parents and selling them after sex deals. Joe sneaks into the target's penthouse and drowns him in his pool. Unsatisfied with Kong's assistance, Joe contemplates killing him, but after a brief confrontation when Kong is ambushed by local gangsters regarding a briefcase containing information files of Surat's/Joe's targets, he instead decides to act as Kong's mentor and trains him for self-defense.

Possible A: lie down, like heat, eating fish, drink water, come to dinner Why is \\"like heat\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Like heat\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it takes into consideration the behavioral traits and preferences of cats. In general, cats are known to be creatures that appreciate and are drawn to warmth. They often seek out and bask in warm spots, as it provides comfort and is reminiscent of the warmth they experienced as kittens from their mother's body. The connection between cats and warmth can be observed in their tendency to lounge in sunlit areas, rest near heaters, and even snuggle with humans for body heat. In the context of the question, cats are laying by the refrigerator, and \\"like heat\\" becomes a plausible explanation when we take into account that the refrigerator's motor can generate heat. The working mechanism of a refrigerator includes a motor and a condenser coil, which dissipate heat as a part of the cooling process. While it may not be the most obvious source of warmth, the heat generated by the refrigerator's components would still be noticeable, especially to a cat seeking warmth. Therefore, their actions of laying by the refrigerator can be attributed to their preference for heat. The other possible answers mentioned (\\"lie down,\\" \\"eating fish,\\" \\"drink water,\\" and \\"come to dinner\\") may apply to cats in general, but they don't specifically target the reason behind choosing the refrigerator as a resting spot. \\"Lie down\\" merely suggests that the cat is resting, but it does not provide insight into why they chose the refrigerator. \\"Eating fish,\\" \\"drink water,\\" and \\"come to dinner,\\" on the other hand, focus on feeding behaviors but don't take into account the location of the cats and their possible attraction to warmth, making them less aligned with human common sense in this particular context."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"\\"Le chat est mignon.\\" Now, let me explain it to you like I would to a five-year-old: This sentence is written in French, and it means, \\"The cat is cute.\\" \\"Le chat\\" means \\"the cat,\\" and \\"est\\" means \\"is,\\" and finally, \\"mignon\\" means \\"cute.\\" So when we put it all together, we get \\"The cat is cute.\\""},{"instruction":"Article: While you're hurrying around picking up gifts in the last few days before Christmas, do you have any time to think about how much your s, or friends will actually value what you find? WePay, a Website that helps people collect, manage and spend money online, has analysed tons of research, reports and surveys from different sources, and the results were surprising! Are Gift Cards a Good Idea? Rather than give someone a gift that they might not like, it's better just to pick up a gift card so they can buy what they really want, right? Wrong. This year, 2.5 billion in gift cards went unspent. Of that amount, 1.3 billion went unspent because people didn't bother making the time. Another I billion or so was forgotten altogether. How Much Do We Really Value the Gifts We're Given? The lucky recipient of a gift, like a cashmere sweater, will value it less than the amount it was purchased for. And ladies, contrary to what you might think, place less monetary value on the diamond ring they are given than the guys who have bought it for them. What Happens to Our Gifts After They're Given? Many complain that the holiday season means shopping and crazily spending money, but studies show that once the big day arrives, we are less focused on gifts than we think. Every year, at least one gift per person is regifted, returned or never even opened And How Do We Really Feel About Fruit Cakes? We all know that no one likes fruit cakes, right? Wrong, once again. Although fruit cakes continue to be taken away behind the rest of the holiday cookies and cakes on the dessert table, one in four people still consider giving them as gifts. What does this all really mean? To be clear, it's certainly not that you shouldn't enjoy the holiday spirit and feel great about giving gifts to those most important to you.

Article: Let Children Roam Free Everyone agrees that playing outside keeps children thinner. The loss of opportunities for outdoor play is one of the main causes of childhood obesity. What is more remarkable is the growing evidence that children's mental health and emotional well-being are enhanced by contact with the outdoors, and that the restorative effect appears to be strongest in natural settings. Researchers are convinced of the depth of the connection between children's well-being and the environment, claiming that contact with nature may be as important to children as good nutrition and adequate sleep. But now children seem to get less touch with outdoor activities. The root causes of the dramatic loss of children's freedom lie in changes to the very fabric of their lives over the last 30 years or so. The growth in road traffic, alongside poor town planning and shifts in the make-up and daily rhythms of families and communities, have left children with fewer outdoor places to go. These changes coincided with the \\"culture of fear\\": a generalized anxiety about all imaginary kinds of threats, even though children are statistically safer from harm now than at any point in human history. These physical, economic and social changes and fears have been made use of by manufactures and advertisers, whose products and messages both reinforce the logic of keeping children virtual prisoners, and force us to compensate them in the only way our cash-rich, time-poor society seems to know: by spending money on them. Government must bear some of the blame for keeping children prisoners indoor, through their promotion of planning policies that favour cars over communities and profit over people. The real planning crimes lie in housing companies occupying attractive parks and green spaces, and in town plans that force families to depend largely on their cars. There is no doubt that traffic danger, unlike stranger danger, is a real threat to children and a constant worry for parents. Around 100 child pedestrians are killed...

What might be the first step of the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"The first step of the process in deploying a satellite into space involves carefully planning and determining the desired orbit for the satellite. This crucial step lays the foundation for the subsequent steps in the satellite deployment process and ensures that the satellite effectively performs its intended functions once in space. 1. Determining the satellite orbit: The initial stage revolves around selecting the most appropriate orbit for the satellite, taking into account its intended purpose, mission duration, coverage area, and other relevant factors. This selection often involves choosing between various orbit types, such as low Earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), or highly elliptical orbit (HEO). The chosen orbit will impact the satellite's communication capabilities, power requirements, sensitivity to atmospheric drag, and susceptibility to space debris. 2. Satellite and rocket design: Once the desired orbit is determined, the satellite and accompanying rocket systems must be designed and built accordingly. This may include optimizing the propulsion system, onboard instruments, and communication equipment, as well as ensuring that the satellite and rocket can withstand the harsh conditions of launch and space operations. 3. Preparing for launch: Next, preparations for the launch of the satellite-bearing rocket begin. This includes procuring and setting up the necessary ground support equipment, assembling the rocket and payload fairing, performing extensive pre-flight checks and tests, and choosing an appropriate launch window. Additionally, the satellite must be fueled and fitted with the necessary launch adapter hardware. 4. Crew training and mission readiness: Concurrently with the above steps, the launch vehicle crew and satellite mission control personnel must be appropriately trained and prepared for the launch day. This involves a comprehensive understanding of the satellite's mission objectives, launch vehicle systems, and contingency procedures. 5. Countdown and launch: On the scheduled launch date, the countdown process commences, involving a series of carefully timed activities and checks to ensure that all systems, both on the ground and onboard the rocket, are functioning optimally. Upon reaching the final moments of the countdown, the rocket's main engines ignite, and the vehicle lifts off the launch pad, propelling the satellite towards its target orbit. 6. Satellite deployment and orbit insertion: During the ascent to orbit, the rocket stages separate in a predefined manner, and the satellite is ultimately released from the rocket's payload fairing. A series of propulsion maneuvers is performed to place the satellite into its intended orbit, where it can begin its mission operations. 7. On-orbit operations and mission life: After successful orbit insertion, the satellite undergoes a series of additional tests and checks to ensure that all systems are functioning correctly, and the mission objectives can be adequately fulfilled. Once all checks are completed, the satellite transitions to its routine operational phase, during which it carries out its intended tasks for the duration of its mission life."},{"instruction":"Yes / no, is the following a verifiable fact? \\"People who engage in Geocaching like finding treasures.\\" Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"Yes, it is a verifiable fact that \\"People who engage in Geocaching like finding treasures.\\" Here is the step-by-step reasoning process: 1.

On the homes of Christians they marked “Nassarah,” an archaic Arabic term for Christians. But on the homes of Shiites they marked “Rafidha,” which means “those who reject” the Sunni line of authority as to who should be caliph, or leader of the Muslim community, after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. But here’s what was interesting, the Iraqi official said, the term “Rafidha” was largely unknown in Iraq to describe Shiites. It is a term used by Wahhabi fundamentalists in Saudi Arabia. “We did not know this word,” he told me. “This is not an Iraqi term.” I was intrigued by this story because it highlighted the degree to which ISIS operates just like an “invasive species” in the world of plants and animals. It is not native to either the Iraqi or Syrian ecosystems. It never before grew in their landscapes. I find it useful at times to use the natural world to illuminate trends in geopolitics and globalization, and this is one of them. The United States National Arboretum website notes that “invasive plant species thrive where the continuity of a natural ecosystem is breached and are abundant on disturbed sites like construction areas and road cuts. ... In some situations these nonnative species cause serious ecological disturbances. In the worst cases, invasive plants ... ruthlessly choke out other plant life. This puts extreme pressure on native plants and animals, and threatened species may succumb to this pressure. Ultimately, invasive plants alter habitats and reduce biodiversity.” I can’t think of a better way to understand ISIS. It is a coalition. One part consists of Sunni Muslim jihadist fighters from all over the world: Chechnya, Libya, Britain, France, Australia and especially Saudi Arabia. They spread so far, so fast, despite their relatively small numbers, because the disturbed Iraqi and Syrian societies enabled these foreign jihadists to forge alliances with secular, native-born, Iraqi and Syrian Sunni tribesmen and former Baathist army officers, whose grievances were less religious and more about how Iraq and Syria were governed. Today, ISIS — the foreigners and locals together — is putting pressure on all of Iraq’s and Syria’s native species with the avowed goal of reducing the diversity of these once polycultural societies and turning them into bleak, dark, jihadist, Sunni fundamentalist monocultures. It is easy to see how ISIS spread. Think about the life of a 50-year-old Iraqi Sunni male from Mosul. He first got drafted to fight in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war that ended in 1988. Then he had to fight in the Persian Gulf war I after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. Then he lived under a decade of U.N. sanctions that broke Iraq’s middle class. Then he had to endure the years of chaos that followed the U.S. invasion, which ended with a corrupt, brutal, pro-Iranian Shiite regime in Baghdad led by Nuri Kamal al-Maliki that did all it could to keep Sunnis poor and powerless. This was the fractured political ecosystem in which ISIS found fertile ground. How do you deal with an invasive species? The National Arboretum says you should “use systemic herbicides carefully” (President Obama’s air war), while also constantly working to strengthen and “preserve healthy native plant habitats” (Obama’s effort to forge a national unity government in Baghdad with Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds together). Generally speaking, though, over the years in Iraq and Afghanistan we have overspent on herbicides (guns and training) and underinvested in the best bulwark against invasive species (noncorrupt, just governance). We should be pressing the Iraqi government, which is rich with cash, to focus on delivering to every Iraqi still under its control 24 hours of electricity a day, a job, better schools, more personal security and a sense that no matter what sect they’re from the game is not rigged against them and their voice will count. That is how you strengthen an ecosystem against invasive species. “It was misgovernance which drove Iraqis to contemplate a relationship with ISIS with the view that it was less detrimental to their interests than their own (Shiite-led) government,” explained Sarah Chayes, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment who is a former U.S. adviser in Afghanistan and author of the upcoming “Thieves of State: Why Corruption Threatens Global Security.” The Iraqi Army we built was seen by many Iraqi Sunnis “as the enforcer of a kleptocratic network.” That army got “sucked dry by the cronies of Maliki so it became a hollow shell that couldn’t withstand the first bullet.” The goal of ISIS now is to draw us in, get us to bomb Sunni towns and drive the non-ISIS Sunnis away from America and closer to ISIS, “because,” notes Chayes, “ISIS knows it can’t survive without the support of these non-ISIS Sunnis.” We always overestimate military training and force and underestimate what Arabs and Afghans want most: decent and just governance. Without the latter, there is no way to cultivate real citizens with a will to fight — and without will there is no training that matters. Ask any general — or gardener.

A:","output":"Given the information provided, it appears to refer to a Polish prince from the Lubomirski family, most likely one by the name of Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski. Here's why: Several clues point to this conclusion. First and foremost, the title of “Prince” and the coat of arms (CoA) image file name containing 'Lubomirski' suggests that this individual is from the Polish noble Lubomirski family. The Lubomirski family was a powerful and influential noble family in Poland during the 16th to 18th centuries, and indeed many members of this family held the princely title. Coupled with this information is the note that this individual's mother's name was Magdalena Tarło. Historical records state that Prince Jerzy Dominik Lubomirski, a prominent member of the Lubomirski family, was married to Magdalena Tarło. Their son, Prince Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski, was a confirmed figure in the 18th century, which aligns with the supplied birth date. Moreover, 'Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski.png' being referred to as an image file could possibly suggest that this is a historical figure whose portrait or illustration might have been captured during his lifetime or could be a posthumous artistic representation of him. Lastly, the fact that his spouse is listed as Anna Zofia Ożarowska only confirms the identity of this figure. Detailed records list Anna Zofia Ożarowska as the spouse of Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski. Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski's death is also noted to have occurred in 1761, a fact that further supports this conclusion. Thus, examining these clues, the figure in question is most likely Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski, a Polish prince from the Lubomirski family. He was a notable figure in the 18th century, son of Jerzy Dominik Lubomirski and Magdalena Tarło, and was married to Anna Zofia Ożarowska. His death is recorded to have occurred in 1761. His significance is further highlighted by the existence of a named image file, suggesting he is a documented historical figure with relevance to Polish history."},{"instruction":"If Somehow this man had crossed the torrent., can we conclude that \\"The man crossed the torrent, something nobody else had figured out.\\"?","output":"Yes, sweetie!

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: When thinking about human survival, it quickly becomes clear that water is a crucial element to support life processes. Our bodies constantly need water to carry out essential functions like maintaining body temperature, transporting nutrients and oxygen, aiding digestion, absorbing nutrients, facilitating the excretion of waste products, and more. Dehydration is a serious concern, as it can lead to issues such as fatigue, dizziness, headaches, and, in severe cases, life-threatening conditions like heatstroke and kidney failure. The human body is made up of approximately 60% water, showcasing its importance in maintaining homeostasis. Furthermore, the daily water intake recommendations set by various health organizations indicate that the average adult male needs about 3.7 liters (125 ounces) of total water per day, while the average adult woman needs about 2.7 liters (91 ounces) per day – these numbers take into account water from both liquids and food in one's diet. Considering these factors – the necessity of water to support vital processes in the body, the dangers of dehydration, and the daily water intake recommendations – it becomes evident that attempting to survive without consuming any water is not a viable option for humans.

Recognize the language: I need to translate the given phrase from English to Finnish. 2. Identify parts of speech: In this case, we have an interrogative pronoun (what), a modal verb (can), a pronoun (we), and a main verb (do). 3. Translate the individual words: - What: \\"mitä\\" or \\"mikä\\" - The translation depends on the context; \\"mitä\\" is generally used for inanimate objects, while \\"mikä\\" could be used for living beings. In this case, I will use \\"mitä\\" since the context is unclear. - Can: \\"voi\\" - In Finnish, the modal verb is translated as \\"voida\\" and needs to be conjugated to match the pronoun \\"we.\\" - We: \\"me\\" - This is the direct translation for the pronoun \\"we.\\" - Do: \\"tehdä\\" - This is the infinitive form of the verb \\"do\\" in Finnish. 4.

But is it a must? The iPhone 3GS is available in two versions: 16GB and 32GB. The 16GB version costs 199, while the 32GB version costs 299. From the outside, the iPhone 3GS looks exactly like the iPhone 3G. Like the iPhone 3G, the new model comes in black and white versions, and sports a 3.5-inch touch screen. Most of the changes to the iPhone 3GS have been made on the inside. Apple says that battery life is better, but the biggest boost is in the iPhone's speed: The iPhone 3GS runs twice as fast as the iPhone 3G. Instead of a lot of software installed on it, the iPhone 3GS comes with the most recent version of the iPhone Software --version 3.0- installed, but it does come with easy access to Apple's App Store. The speedier performance of the iPhone 3GS extends to surfing the Web, too. You can see entire Web pages, and can zoom in and out with ease. The notable new messaging feature on the iPhone 3GS is support for MMS. You can send pictures and videos by SMS, rather than having to send them via e-mail. Other new and very-handy e-mail features include the ability to search through your e-mail messages and contacts, as well as the option to use a landscape-oriented keyboard when composing messages. The camera has been upgraded from 2 megapixels to 3 megapxiels, and adds auto-focus. If you already own an iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3GS may not be worth the additional cost, since you can get many of its cool features for free with the iPhone 3.0 software upgrade.
