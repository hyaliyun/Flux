D: P(AB)=frac{1}{3}","output":"To analyze the relationship between events A and B, we need to consider the definition of each type of event mentioned. 1. **Complementary Events**: Two events are complementary if the occurrence of one event means the other cannot occur. Since event A (the first coin is heads up) and event B (the second coin is tails up) can both occur simultaneously (for example, if the outcome is heads for the first coin and tails for the second), they are not complementary. 2. **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time. Given that both A and B can occur together (as illustrated in the scenario where the first coin shows heads and the second shows tails), they are not mutually exclusive. 3. **Independent Events**: Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other. In this case, the result of the first coin flip does not influence the result of the second coin flip, making A and B independent events. This aligns with option C. 4. **Calculation of P(AB)**: To further confirm our understanding, we calculate the probability of both A and B occurring. Since A and B are independent, P(AB) = P(A) cdot P(B). Given that the probability of heads or tails for a fair coin is frac{1}{2}, [P(AB) = P(A) cdot P(B) = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{4}] This calculation disproves option D, which incorrectly states P(AB) = frac{1}{3}.

The number of such sequences (paths) is given by the binomial coefficient:    [    C_{m+n}^{m}    ]    This is because we are choosing (m) positions for the horizontal steps out of a total of (m+n) steps. 3.

Therefore, as one area increases, the other decreases. 4. **Conditions for Minimum and Maximum Areas:**     - For t_1, since its variable term is non-negative, its minimum value occurs when:         [         x_0 = frac{a+b}{4}         ]     - For this x_0:         [         t_{1 min} = ab - left(frac{a+b}{4}right)^2         ]     - This is valid when x_0 lies within the interval:         [         x_0 = frac{a+b}{4} leqq b implies b geqq frac{a}{3}         ] 5. **Maximum Area Calculation for t_2:**     - Under these conditions:         [         t_{2 max} = left(frac{a+b}{4}right)^2         ] 6. **Case Analysis:**     - If b geqq frac{a}{3}, the minimum of t_1 and the maximum of t_2 have already been determined.     - If b < frac{a}{3}, the optimal value x_0 lies outside [0, b]:         [         x_0 = frac{a+b}{4} > b         ]     - Therefore, t_1 decreases throughout, reaching its minimum at x = b:         [         t_{1 min}' = b^2, quad t_{2 max}'= ab - b^2         ] 7. **When Two Areas are Equal:**     - Solving for when t_1 = t_2:         [         4x^2 - 2(a+b)x + ab = 0         ]     - The solutions are:         [         x_1 = frac{a}{2}, quad x_2 = frac{b}{2}         ]     - x_1, x_2 are guaranteed to fall within the interval when b leqq a leqq 2b. # Conclusion: Hence, the optimal measurement sections are: 1.

Hence, the function f(x) is increasing on the interval left(frac{1}{2}, 1right) and decreasing on the interval (1, 2). Since the function has only one critical point at x=1, this point must be the maximum on the interval. Therefore, the maximum value on the interval left[frac{1}{2}, 2right] is f(1) = 2.

On the interval left(frac{-b + sqrt{b^2 + 8a}}{4a}, +inftyright), the derivative is positive, and the function is increasing.

Because P, D, and P' are collinear with PD = DP', P', being the reflection of P about D, must lie on the perpendicular to BC through D. 4. **Analysis using known geometry theorems and properties:**    By the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, the angles subtended by the same arc are equal. Consider H' as the point where the extension of AH intersects the circumcircle of triangle ABC again.    - Since angle HCB and angle BAH' intercept the same arc BH' on the circumcircle of triangle ABC, we have angle HCB = angle BAH' = angle BCH'.    - This implies HA' = A'H' by property of the circumcircle and isosceles triangle formed. 5. **Symmetry and angle equality:**    By reflection properties PP' perp BC and P'D = DP, if PH' perp BC and P'H relates to BC as PH', conclude that angle PH'H = angle P'HH'. 6. **Use of Simson Line:**    Now, bringing the perpendiculars PF, PD, and PE to intersect AB, BC, and AC, respectively. The Simson line tells us that points F, D, and E are collinear.

The cost of the tomato is 1.5 pounds at 2.00 per pound, so: 1.5 pounds * 2.00/pound = 3.00 The cost of the pickles is 2.50, but Lauren had a 1.00 off coupon, so: 2.50 - 1.00 = 1.50 Now, let's add up the costs of these items: 7.00 (meat) + 1.50 (buns) + 3.00 (tomato) + 1.50 (pickles) = 13.00 Lauren paid with a 20 bill and got 6 change back, so the total amount spent was: 20 - 6 = 14 The cost of the head of lettuce is the difference between the total amount spent and the cost of the other items: 14 - 13.00 = 1.00 Therefore, the head of lettuce cost boxed{1.00} ."},{"instruction":"Prove that the set of real numbers satisfying the inequality  sum_{k=1}^{70} frac{k}{xk} geq frac{5}{4}  is a union of disjoint intervals whose total length is 1988.","output":"1. Define the function:    [    f(x) = sum_{k=1}^{70} frac{k}{x-k}    ] 2. Identify the intervals in which the function ( f(x) ) is defined, excluding singularities ( x = 1, 2, 3, ldots, 70 ):    [    I_0 = (-infty, 1), quad I_1 = (1, 2), quad I_2 = (2, 3), ldots, quad I_{69} = (69, 70), quad I_{70} = (70, +infty)    ] 3. The function ( f(x) ) is continuous in its domain because it is a sum of continuous functions in each interval ( I_i ). 4. Since ( f(x) ) involves sums of strictly decreasing functions ( left(frac{1}{x-1}, frac{2}{x-2}, ldots, frac{70}{x-70}right) ), ( f(x) ) is strictly monotonically decreasing in each interval ( I_i ). 5. In the interval ( I_0 ), the function ( f(x) ) takes only negative values because each term ( frac{k}{x-k} ) is negative for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 70 ). 6. For the intervals ( I_1, I_2, ldots, I_{69} ), ( f(x) ) takes all real values. At the left boundary ( x rightarrow k^+ ), we get:    [    lim_{x rightarrow k^+} f(x) = sum_{k=1}^{70} frac{k}{x-k} = +infty    ]    since for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 70 ), ( frac{k}{x-k} = frac{a}{x-a} ) approaches ( +infty ). For other terms, ( frac{k}{x-k} ) remains finite. 7. Similarly, for the right boundary ( x rightarrow k^- ),     [    lim_{x rightarrow k^-} f(x) = -infty    ] 8. Thus, each interval ( I_i ) contains exactly one value ( x_i ) such that ( f(x_i) = frac{5}{4} ). 9. Consider the interval ( I_{70} ). As ( x rightarrow +infty ),    [    lim_{x rightarrow +infty} f(x) = sum_{k=1}^{70} lim_{x rightarrow +infty} frac{k}{x-k} = 0    ]    Therefore, ( f(x) ) in ( I_{70} ) takes all positive values. 10.

So, the width of the bottom surface of the box will be: 36 m - (5 m + 6 m) = 36 m - 11 m = 25 m Now, let's calculate the height of the box. Since squares are cut from the corners, the height of the box will be the length of the smallest square cut from the corners, which is 4 m.

Denote these projections by (P_1) and (P_2) respectively.     - The midpoint of the line segment joining (P_1) and (P_2) in the plane will be the projection of the midpoint of the line segment joining ((x, y, z)) and ((1-x, 1-y, 1-z)) in space, which is (P = left(frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}right)). 5. **Centrally Symmetric Region**:     - Since every point and its symmetric counterpart project in such a way to maintain central symmetry around (P), the entire projection of the cube onto any two-dimensional plane will be centrally symmetric around (P). 6. **Pentagon Symmetry**:     - A simple convex pentagon does not possess central symmetry. Convex pentagons are five-sided polygons with vertices connected in a single cyclic sequence.     - Since the projection of the cube maintains central symmetry around the point (P), it cannot be a pentagon, as that would require the projection to not have such central symmetry. # Conclusion: The projection of the unit cube onto any two-dimensional plane cannot be a simple convex pentagon due to the inherent central symmetry of the projection region.

We need to find the number of distinct strings that can be formed by reversing some contiguous substring of ( S ). First, let's count the number of ways we can choose a contiguous substring from ( S ).     3. To select a contiguous substring, we choose two positions in the sequence to indicate the start and end of the substring. There are 50 positions (digits) in total. Selecting two positions out of 52 (including the boundaries) to form a substring can be calculated by:    [    binom{52}{2} = frac{52 times 51}{2} = 1326    ]        Here, (binom{52}{2}) represents the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of the 52 possible positions. 4. Next, we account for overcounting in two scenarios:    - **Substrings of length 0 or 1**: These substrings, when reversed, remain the same as the original string, contributing no new variations.       - There are 51 possible substrings of length 0 (by choosing two adjacent positions), and 50 possible substrings of length 1.      - So, total non-contributing substrings are ( 51 + 50 = 101 ).     5. We should also consider the overcount for other substrings which, when reversed, do not change the sequence.    - **Palindromic substrings**: A substring that is the same forward and backward contributes repeated counting. This is complicated to count generally but necessary for complete accuracy.           Let us illustrate an overcounting scenario for digit repetitions. Consider every starting and ending digit to be the same, this leads us to repeating the same central digits, hence we look for combinations where:    - The ends (digit repeated) contribute ( 10 times binom{5}{2} = 10 times 10 = 100 ) substrings.     6. Subtract the counts obtained from overcounting:    [    text{Total} = binom{52}{2} - 101 - 100 = 1326 - 101 - 100 = 1126    ] Therefore, the number of distinct strings similar to ( S ) is [ boxed{1126} ]"},{"instruction":"A company made significant adjustments to its product structure to meet market demand.

Suppose there exists an integer k such that a_{k} < a_{k-1}. This implies that a_{k-1} leq a_{k} - a_{k+1} + a_{k-2} < a_{k+2}.

We have a point (K) on the diagonal (BD) of the parallelogram. 3. The line (AK) intersects lines (BC) and (CD) at points (L) and (M) respectively. 4. We aim to prove that (AK^2 = LK cdot KM). To start with, let's recall some properties of the parallelogram and the relationships created by the intersections:  Step-by-Step Approach: 1. **Observe Similar Triangles**: In parallelograms, the diagonals bisect each other. Hence, the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) of the parallelogram intersect at ( O ), their midpoint. Therefore, ( AK ) intersects ( BC ) and ( CD ) at points ( L ) and ( M ) respectively.     2. **Proportional Relationships**:    By observing line segment intersections and the properties of similar triangles formed, we can take into account the intercept theorem (also known as Thales' theorem):    [    frac{AK}{KM} = frac{BK}{KD}    ]    This is due to the fact that ( AK ) is a straight line intersecting ( BC ) and ( CD ). 3. **Interchange and Equality**:        Reflecting the proportion from the similar triangles, we also have:        [    frac{LK}{AK} = frac{AK}{KM}    ] 4. **Solving for (AK)**:        Combining the two proportional relationships, we square the ratio to achieve the desired relationship:        [    left( frac{AK}{KM} right)^2 = left( frac{LK}{AK} right)^2    ]        By transitive property of equality,        [    AK^2 = LK cdot KM    ]     5. **Conclusion**:    Combining these steps and aligning with the properties of parallelogram diagonals and intercept theorem definitions, we arrive at the required proof.  Thus,  [ AK^2 = LK cdot KM ] Therefore, the given geometric proposition is indeed true by detailed examination and applications of the respective theorems.

The axis of symmetry of the parabola is the vertical line x = 1. Given the range -5 leqslant x leqslant 3, we need to determine the maximum value of y within this interval. Since the parabola opens upwards and the vertex is at (1, 0), the maximum value of y within the given range occurs at one of the endpoints of the interval, because the vertex represents the minimum value of y for this parabola.

Start with the base case: at x = 44 yuan, y = 300 books. 2. For each 1 yuan increase in x, y decreases by 10 books. This gives us the equation:  [y = 300 - 10(x - 44)] Simplifying this equation: [y = 300 - 10x + 440] [y = -10x + 740] The cost price of each book is 40 yuan, and the maximum profit margin allowed is 30%.

Now, we can solve for x: 70 * (4 + x) = 300 + 60x 280 + 70x = 300 + 60x 70x - 60x = 300 - 280 10x = 20 x = 2. So, the additional hours after the first 4 hours are 2 hours.

The circumcircles of ( triangle A B P ) and ( triangle C D P ) intersect at ( P ) and ( Q ). We need to prove that ( O, Q, A, ) and ( D ) are concyclic and that ( O Q ) is perpendicular to ( P Q ). We begin by analyzing the cyclic quadrilaterals ( triangle A B P ) and ( triangle C D P ). Since ( A, B, P, Q ) are concyclic, we know: [ widehat{A B P} = widehat{A Q P} ] Similarly, since ( C, D, P, Q ) are concyclic, [ widehat{D Q P} = widehat{D C P} ] Considering ( A, B, C, D ) are concyclic, we know: [ widehat{D C P} = widehat{D C A} = widehat{D B A} = widehat{A B P} ] This is because the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary, meaning the angles subtended by the same arc are equal. Therefore, we have: [ widehat{A O D} = 2 times widehat{A B P} = 2 times widehat{A Q P}  ] Thus we get: [ widehat{A Q P} + widehat{D Q P} = widehat{A O D} ] Consequently, we have: [ widehat{A O D} = widehat{A Q D} ] indicating that ( O, Q, A, D ) are concyclic. Next, to show that ( O Q ) is perpendicular to ( P Q ), consider the angles: [ widehat{O Q D} = widehat{O A D} ] And: [ widehat{O Q P} = widehat{O Q D} + widehat{D Q P} = widehat{O A D} + frac{1}{2} widehat{A O D} ] Since ( A, O, D ) form an isosceles triangle with ( widehat{A O D} ) as the vertex angle at ( O ), we have: [ widehat{A O D} + 2 times widehat{O A D} = 180^{circ} ] Thus: [ widehat{O A D} + frac{1}{2} widehat{A O D} = 90^{circ} ] Therefore: [ widehat{O Q P} = 90^{circ} ] This demonstrates that ( O Q ) is perpendicular to ( P Q ).

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that among the pairwise differences of these numbers, there are not four differences that are the same. 3. By defining the differences ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_{19} ) as ( d_i = a_{i+1} - a_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 19 ), we analyze these 19 differences. 4.

This means there are consecutive numbers from overline{xyzabc} to overline{xy(z+1)aaa}.         - Suppose abc leq xyz, then the ticket overline{xyzxyz} is in the purchased set, automatically making it a lucky ticket since xyzxyz trivially satisfies the condition xyz = xyz.         - If abc > xyz, the ticket overline{xy(z+1)xy(z+1)} will be included as there is one increment in z. This ticket will also satisfy xy(z+1) = xy(z+1) and thus is a lucky ticket.     - **Case 2: z = 9**         - Here, the smallest number would still be overline{xyzabc}, while the largest will cover up to overline{x(y+1)0abc}.         - Analogous to the previous case, considering abc leq xyz, the ticket overline{x99x99} will be within the 1001 tickets purchased.         - When we have abc > xyz in this scenario, overline{x(y+1)0x(y+1)0} will be a part of those 1001 tickets. 6.

Next, concerning the inequality 4^{x} > 8: begin{align*} 4^{x} &> 8  (2^{2})^{x} &> 2^{3}  2^{2x} &> 2^{3}  2x &> 3  x &> dfrac{3}{2} end{align*} Comparing the solutions of both inequalities, we find that every x that satisfies log_{2}(2x-3) < 1 (i.e., dfrac{3}{2} < x < dfrac{5}{2}) also satisfies 4^{x} > 8 (i.e., x > dfrac{3}{2}). However, the converse is not true; some values of x that satisfy 4^{x} > 8 do not satisfy log_{2}(2x-3) < 1.

By the definition of the limit of a sequence:          lim_{n to infty} z_n = a      2. **Stating a critical property of limits:** From the above limit, we know that:          lim_{n to infty} left| z_n - a right| = 0          This follows from the definition of the limit, which implies that the terms of the sequence z_n get arbitrarily close to the limit a as n tends to infinity. 3. **Using inequality for the magnitude:** For any two complex numbers z_n and a, we have the following inequality related to their magnitudes (this inequality is found on page 8 of a typical reference):          left| |z_n| - |a| right| leq left| z_n - a right|          This is derived from the properties of complex numbers and their magnitudes. 4. **Applying the limit to the inequality:** By taking the limit of both sides of the inequality as n to infty, we get:          lim_{n to infty} left| |z_n| - |a| right| leq lim_{n to infty} left| z_n - a right|          Since we already established that lim_{n to infty} left| z_n - a right| = 0, this simplifies to:          lim_{n to infty} left| |z_n| - |a| right| leq 0      5. **Interpreting the inequality:** The only non-negative number that is less than or equal to 0 is 0 itself.

First, let's examine if f(x) is an odd function. For any function to be odd, it must satisfy the condition f(-x) = -f(x). For our function, we have: [ f(-x) = sin(-xcos(-x)) = sin(-xcos x) = -sin(xcos x) = -f(x). ] This confirms that f(x) is indeed an odd function, which means conclusion ① is correct. Next, we consider the behavior of f(x) when x is in the interval (0,frac{pi}{2}). In this interval, cos x ranges from 0 to 1, making xcos x also in the interval (0,frac{pi}{2}). Since the sine function is positive in this interval, we have: [ 0 < xcos x < frac{pi}{2} implies sin(xcos x) > 0 implies f(x) > 0. ] Therefore, conclusion ② is correct. To determine if f(x) is a periodic function, we need to check if there exists a period T such that f(x+T) = f(x) for all x.

However, when we set x=frac{pi}{2}, we find that no such T satisfies both conditions for all x in mathbb{R}.

Since cos x = 0 at x = frac{pi}{2} + kpi, where k in mathbb{Z}, and these points make f(x) = 0, f(x) indeed has infinitely many zeros, confirming conclusion ④ is correct.

Using the sum-to-product identities, we have:    [    cos(2x) cos(2y) + sin(2x) sin(2y) = cos(2x - 2y)    ]    Thus, the inequality becomes:    [    cos(2x - 2y) > frac{1}{2} = cosleft(frac{pi}{3}right)    ] 7.

For instance:      [      B D_{BC} = D_{BC} D_{CB} = D_{CB} C = frac{a}{3}      ] 3. **Segment Calculation**:    - Each of the drawn segments through ( S ) is ( frac{2}{3} ) of the length of the side it is parallel to, and ( S ) bisects these segments. Segments connecting the points of trisection of two sides from the same vertex are parallel to the third side and are ( frac{1}{3} ) of its length.

By symmetry, if the coins were fair, the probabilities of more heads than tails and more tails than heads would be equal; however, the coins are biased towards heads, so we expect the probability of getting more heads than tails to be higher than getting more tails than heads. Let p = dfrac{3}{5} be the probability of flipping heads. We can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probabilities for different counts of heads. The probability of getting exactly k heads out of n flips is given by binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}, where, in this case, n = 10.

The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

To find the fraction of the floor that is not covered by the rug, we need to subtract the area of the rug from the area of the floor and then divide by the total area of the floor. Area not covered by rug = Area of floor - Area of rug Area not covered by rug = 64 square feet - 14 square feet Area not covered by rug = 50 square feet Now, to find the fraction of the floor that is not covered by the rug: Fraction not covered = Area not covered by rug / Area of floor Fraction not covered = 50 square feet / 64 square feet Fraction not covered = 50/64 To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: Fraction not covered = (50 ÷ 2) / (64 ÷ 2) Fraction not covered = 25/32 So, the fraction of the area of the floor that is not covered by the rug is boxed{25/32} ."},{"instruction":"The diagonals of the parallelogram (ABCD) intersect at point (M).

First Approach 1. **Initial Setup:**    Let (angle BAM = alpha). This is the inscribed angle corresponding to the chord (BM) in the circle passing through (A, M, B).      2. **Angle Relationships:**    Using the inscribed angle theorem, we know that the angle subtended by the same chord on the opposite side will also be (alpha). Hence, (angle MBC = alpha). 3. **Co-interior Angles:**    Now consider the angles formed when the diagonals of the parallelogram intersect. Since (ABCD) is a parallelogram, the opposite sides are parallel. Hence the alternate interior angles formed by (AD) and (BM) at (M) are equal. Thus (angle MCD) must also be (alpha). 4. **Tangency Condition:**    Draw the tangent at point (C) to the circumcircle of (triangle MB C). Since the inscribed angle (angle MBC = alpha), the angle between the tangent at (C) and the chord (MC) will also be (alpha). 5. **Conclusion:**    The only scenario where the line (CD) will have the same angle with chord (MC) at point (C) is when the line (CD) coincides with the tangent line at (C).

The Ramsey number ( R(3, t) ) is the smallest number such that any graph with ( R(3, t) ) vertices contains either a triangle or an independent set of size ( t ). 3. **Bounds on Ramsey Numbers:**    It is known that there exist constants ( c_1, c_2 in mathbb{R}^+ ) such that:    [    c_1 frac{t^2}{ln t} < R(3, t) < c_2 frac{t^2}{ln t}    ]    This implies that for sufficiently large ( t ), ( R(3, t) ) grows approximately as ( frac{t^2}{ln t} ). 4. **Choosing ( t ):**    For any ( n in mathbb{N} ), we can choose ( t ) such that:    [    R(3, t) > nt    ]    This means that there exists a graph ( G ) with ( |V| = nt ) vertices that does not contain a triangle and does not have an independent set of size ( t ). 5. **Constructing the Graph ( G ):**    Consider a graph ( G ) with ( |V| = nt ) vertices.

We start with the given set ( A = { x in mathbb{N} mid x = a^2 + 2b^2, a, b in mathbb{Z}, ab neq 0 } ) and the condition that ( p ) is a prime number such that ( p^2 in A ). This means there exist integers ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( p^2 = a^2 + 2b^2 ) and ( ab neq 0 ). 2. We rewrite the equation ( p^2 = a^2 + 2b^2 ) as:    [    2b^2 = p^2 - a^2 = (p + a)(p - a)    ]    This implies:    [    2b^2 = (p + a)(p - a)    ] 3. Next, we consider the greatest common divisor ( gcd(p + a, p - a) ). Since ( p ) is a prime number, ( gcd(p + a, p - a) ) must divide ( 2p ). The possible values for ( gcd(p + a, p - a) ) are ( 1, 2, p, ) or ( 2p ). 4. **Case 1: ( gcd(p + a, p - a) = p )**    - If ( gcd(p + a, p - a) = p ), then ( p ) divides both ( p + a ) and ( p - a ). This implies ( p ) divides ( 2a ), so ( p ) must divide ( a ). Let ( a = kp ) for some integer ( k ). Substituting ( a = kp ) into the original equation:      [      p^2 = (kp)^2 + 2b^2 implies p^2 = k^2p^2 + 2b^2 implies p^2(1 - k^2) = 2b^2      ]      Since ( p ) is a prime, ( 1 - k^2 ) must be divisible by ( 2 ). However, this leads to a contradiction because ( 1 - k^2 ) cannot be zero or a multiple of ( 2 ) without making ( b ) zero, which contradicts ( ab neq 0 ). 5. **Case 2: ( gcd(p + a, p - a) = 2p )**    - If ( gcd(p + a, p - a) = 2p ), then ( 2p ) divides both ( p + a ) and ( p - a ). This implies ( p ) divides ( a ), leading to the same contradiction as in Case 1. 6. **Case 3: ( gcd(p + a, p - a) = 1 )**    - If ( gcd(p + a, p - a) = 1 ), then ( p + a ) and ( p - a ) are coprime. Since ( 2b^2 = (p + a)(p - a) ), both ( p + a ) and ( p - a ) must be odd, making the product ( (p + a)(p - a) ) odd. However, ( 2b^2 ) is even, leading to a contradiction. 7. **Case 4: ( gcd(p + a, p - a) = 2 )**    - If ( gcd(p + a, p - a) = 2 ), then we can write ( p + a = 2m ) and ( p - a = 2n ) for some integers ( m ) and ( n ) such that ( gcd(m, n) = 1 ). Substituting these into the equation:      [      2b^2 = (2m)(2n) implies b^2 = 2mn      ]      Since ( b^2 ) is a perfect square, ( mn ) must be twice a perfect square.

This means that when an ant moves, it can only move parallel to the line segment formed by the other two ants. 3. **Conservation of Area:** We need to establish that each movement maintains the area of the triangle formed.

Let's say the ants are at ( left( frac{a}{2}, 0 right) ), ( left( a, frac{b}{2} right) ), and ( left( frac{a}{2}, b right) ).    - Calculate the area of the triangle formed by these points:      - The base length would be ( frac{a}{2} )      - The height of such a triangle would be ( frac{b}{2} )    Thus, the new area:    [    A_{text{new}} = frac{1}{2} times frac{a}{2} times frac{b}{2} = frac{1}{8} times ab    ]    Notice that this is the area formed from three midpoints, theoretically each being ( frac{1}{4}) of the entire rectangle area. 6. **Conclusion:**    Initially, the area of the triangle formed by three ants is ( frac{1}{2} ) of the rectangle's area. However, the configuration we are considering (ants at midpoints of the sides) yields an area of ( frac{1}{4} times text{area of rectangle} ).

To find the condition on m, we consider the minimum value of |x - 1| + |x + m| which occurs when x is exactly between 1 and -m. At this position, the distance from 1 to -m is a straight line, hence the minimum value is the distance between these two points. 1.

If 1 < -m (i.e., m < -1), then the point exactly between them is still frac{1 + (-m)}{2}, and similarly the sum of the distances is |(1-m)/2 - 1| + |(1-m)/2 + m| = |m + 1|. So in either case, we see that the minimum sum of the distances is |m + 1|.

Therefore, there are 0 ways for this case. **Case 2: Two of the three attributes are the same.** For two attributes to be the same across three cards, we first choose which two attributes will be the same. There are {3choose 2} = 3 ways to choose these attributes.

The third attribute, by the condition, must be different for each card, which naturally happens since we are choosing cards with all combinations represented. Thus, the number of ways for this case is calculated as: {3choose 2} cdot 3 cdot 3 = 3 cdot 3 cdot 3 = 27. **Case 3: One of the three attributes is the same.** Here, we choose which one of the three attributes will be the same across all three cards.

The hypotenuse of the triangle will then be a chord of the circle. 2. **Properties of Right Triangles in a Circle**:    According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, if a triangle is inscribed in a circle and one of its angles is a right angle, then the hypotenuse of the triangle is the diameter of the circle. This follows from the fact that the angle subtended by a semicircle is always a right angle.    Therefore, if ( angle ACB = 90^circ ), where ( C ) is the right angle vertex, point ( C ) must lie on the circumference of the circle. 3. **Constructing the Right Triangle**:    - Identify ( A ) and ( B ) as the points through which the legs of the triangle pass.    - Draw the diameter of the circle that passes through points ( A ) and ( B ). Let this diameter be the chord of the circle.    - Since ( angle ACB = 90^circ ), point ( C ) must lie on the circumference of the circle such that the triangle ( ACB ) has point ( C ) being perpendicular to the line segment ( AB ). 4. **Finding the Intersection Point**:    - Describe a circle ( S ) with ( A ) and ( B ) lying on its diameter.    - The point ( C ), where ( angle ACB = 90^circ ), must be located at either point of intersection of the circumference of the original circle and the circle ( S ) with diameter ( AB ).    - Thus, by identifying these intersection points, we can determine point ( C ). 5. **Final Construction**:    - With point ( C ) identified on the circumference of the initial circle, draw lines ( CA ) and ( CB ).    - These lines will form the legs of the right triangle passing through points ( A ) and ( B ). 6. **Conclusion**:    - The right triangle inscribed in the circle has its vertex at ( C ), satisfying the condition that the legs pass through points ( A ) and ( B ). Thus, by constructing the right angle at the appropriate circumference point, we can inscribe the desired right triangle in the circle.

Pages 10 through 99 each use 2 digits, so there are 90 pages using 180 digits in total (90 pages * 2 digits/page). 3. The remaining digits are used for pages with 3 digits (100 and above). We've used 9 + 180 = 189 digits so far for pages 1 through 99. The remaining number of digits to be used is 972 - 189 = 783 digits. Since pages 100 and above use 3 digits each, we divide the remaining number of digits by 3 to find the number of pages: 783 digits / 3 digits/page = 261 pages. These 261 pages are the ones from 100 to 360 (since we've already counted up to page 99). So, to find the total number of pages in the book, we add the pages we've already counted: 99 (from pages 1-99) + 261 (from pages 100-360) = 360 pages.

We need to show that ( a ) is a friend of ( gcd(a, b) ). This means we need to show that ( a cdot gcd(a, b) ) is a perfect square. 6.

For each ( i ), consider ( e_i + min(e_i, f_i) ):    - If ( e_i leq f_i ), then ( min(e_i, f_i) = e_i ), so ( e_i + min(e_i, f_i) = e_i + e_i = 2e_i ), which is even.    - If ( e_i > f_i ), then ( min(e_i, f_i) = f_i ), so ( e_i + min(e_i, f_i) = e_i + f_i ). Since ( e_i + f_i ) is even (from step 3), ( e_i + min(e_i, f_i) ) is also even. 9. Since all the exponents in the prime factorization of ( a cdot gcd(a, b) ) are even, ( a cdot gcd(a, b) ) is a perfect square. 10. Therefore, ( a ) is a friend of ( gcd(a, b) ).

Since the workforce was 60% female, the number of female employees was 0.60E. The company then hired 30 additional male workers, so the total number of employees became E + 30. After hiring the additional male workers, the percent of female workers dropped to 55%. This means that the number of female employees, which is still 0.60E, now constitutes 55% of the total workforce. So we can set up the equation: 0.60E = 0.55(E + 30) Now we can solve for E: 0.60E = 0.55E + 16.5 0.60E - 0.55E = 16.5 0.05E = 16.5 E = 16.5 / 0.05 E = 330 This means the original number of employees was 330.

Base cases ( m = 1, 2 ) follow from the previous equations. For ( n = 2m ), ( f(2m) = (2k - 2)f(m) ). For ( n = 2m + 1 ), use ( P((m+1)x, (-m)x, x) ).    - **Claim 7:** We may assume ( f(1) = 1 ).      *Proof:* By Claim 6, ( f(1) ) divides each ( f(n) ). Change ( f to frac{f}{f(1)} ).

Hence, in such cases, the inequality holds with (alpha = 1), but we need to identify the general case with a stricter bound. 3. **Identify Heights and Medians:**    Assume without loss of generality that (h) and (m) correspond to different vertices, say the longest height is from (A) to (D) (which we denote as (AD)) and the shortest median is from (B) to (E) (denoted as (BE)).

Hence,    [    |EF| = frac{h}{2}    ] 5. **Compare Median and Altitude:**    Now, since ( E ) is the midpoint of ( AC ) and by the properties of the medians, we have:    [    m = |EB| geq |EF| = frac{h}{2}    ] 6. **Establish the Inequality:**    From the above inequality, we have:    [    h leq 2m    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the smallest possible value of (alpha) that satisfies the given condition for any triangle (ABC) is:    [    alpha = 2    ] Hence, the smallest value of (alpha) such that the given inequality holds for any triangle is ( boxed{2} )."},{"instruction":"What digit ( B ) will make the number ( 517B ) divisible by 6?","output":"A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

Twin Primes and Prime Triples:    - **Twin Primes** are pairs of prime numbers that are only two units apart; for example, (3, 5) and (5, 7).    - A **trio** of primes (p, p+2, p+4) where all three numbers are prime.  2. Analyzing Modulo 3:    Prime numbers greater than 3 are either of the form (3k + 1) or (3k + 2) for some integer (k), because any integer (n) can be written as (3k), (3k+1), or (3k+2). However, if (n = 3k), then (n) is divisible by 3 and hence, not a prime unless (n = 3).  3. Considering the Forms:    - If we have a trio of primes (p, p+2, p+4), their possible forms mod 3 can be analyzed:      - Suppose ( p equiv 1 pmod{3} ):        - then ( p+2 equiv 1+2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ) which is not a prime unless it is 3 which cannot happen for ( p > 3 ).      - Suppose ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ):        - then ( p+2 equiv 2+2 equiv 1 pmod{3} )        -  and ( p+4 equiv 2+4 equiv 0 pmod{3} ) which is not a prime unless it is 3 which cannot happen for ( p > 3 ).  4.

We calculate the probability of Claudia getting at least 2 more heads than tails, which involves her getting 7 or more heads.

Given that ( f(x) = x^{3} + bx^{2} + cx + d ) is an increasing function on ((-infty, 0)) and a decreasing function on ([0,2]), we start by examining the first derivative:    [    f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2bx + c    ] 2. Since ( f(x) ) is increasing on ( (-infty, 0) ) and decreasing on ( [0, 2] ), ( f(x) ) must attain its maximum at ( x = 0 ).

Next, considering that ( f(2) = 0 ) and the roots of ( f(x) = 0 ) are ( alpha, 2, beta ), we can represent ( f(x) ) as:    [    f(x) = (x - 2)(x - alpha)(x - beta)    ] 4.

(Ⅱ) Finding the Value of x in the Perfect Set Given Set P = {1, x, 3, 4, 5, 6}: - Possibility 1: A = {1, 4}, B = {3, 5}, then C = {4 + 3, 5 + 1} = {7, 6}. - Possibility 2: A = {1, 5}, B = {3, 6}, then C = {4, 3 + 6} = {4, 9}. - Possibility 3: A = {1, 3}, B = {4, 6}, then C = {5, 1 + 4 + 6} = {5, 10}. Considering each possibility aligns with the condition for a perfect set, we find that x can be boxed{7, 9, text{or } 11}.  (Ⅲ) Necessary Condition for Set P to be a Perfect Set Given Set P = {x | 1 ≤ x ≤ 3n, n ∈ N*}: - The sum of all elements in P is frac{3n(3n+1)}{2}. - Since P is divided into three sets with equal sum, we find that 2(c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_n) = frac{3n(3n+1)}{2}. - Focusing on the sum of elements in C, we get frac{3n(3n+1)}{4} = c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_{n-1} + 3n. - Simplifying, c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_{n-1} = frac{9n(n-1)}{4} must be an integer. - For the right-hand side to be an integer, 9n(n-1) must be divisible by 4, implying n = 4k or n-1 = 4k for some k in mathbb{N}.

Recall that knights always tell the truth, and liars always lie. Hence, we must avoid a contradictory scenario where a knight would be truthfully stating that two liars are sitting next to him.

However, a scenario where multiple knights exist around the table and each claim both neighbors are liars becomes inherently contradictory.    Since a knight’s truthful claim would indicate both neighbors are universally liars, which contradicts the initial configuration (not all can be liars), we must have at least one knight telling this falsehood initially, leading into an impossibility. 4. **Scenario After One Person Leaves:**    When one person leaves, we need to analyze if the remaining 9 could claim, \\"Both my neighbors are knights.\\" 5. **Detailed Investigation Post One Person Departure:**    Suppose one person leaves.

But the departing person would have altered the set of individuals seated around the table, disturbing any prior consistent pattern of truth-lying (knights-liars scenario).  6. **Applying Logic Post Departure:**    Specifically, analyzing the remaining individuals, if let’s assume the one who left was pivotal in maintaining a balance (as knigh/lie gap), and each of the remaining inconsistency in reality of having at least one liar.     If everyone else were to say their neighbors are knights, another induced contradiction arises:    - A knigh would enforces non knight-neighbor traits which would be false.    **Conclusion:**    Hence, no feasible configuration permits every individual to consistently claim all neighbors are knights post departure without violating the knight’s truth/lyer’s lie adherence:     [ boxed{text{Not Possible}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=3xfrac{2}{x}.

This changes a to -a and c to -c, and then swaps -a with -c, resulting in:    [    M_1 = frac{{ac+bd+ae}}{-a}    ] 2. Next, we apply the (b,d) opposite transformation to M_1. This changes b to -b and d to -d, and then swaps -b with -d, leading to:    [    M_2 = frac{{ac+db+ae}}{-a}    ] 3.

The (a,b) opposite transformation on M results in:    [    M_1 = frac{{-bc-ad-ce}}{c}    ] 2. The (a,d) opposite transformation on M results in:    [    M_1 = frac{{-dc-ab-ce}}{c}    ] 3.

Thus, statement ② is incorrect. **For Statement ③:** 1. The first (a,e) opposite transformation on M gives:    [    M_1 = frac{{-ce+bd+ac}}{c}    ] 2. The second (c,d) opposite transformation results in:    [    M_2 = frac{{de-bc-ad}}{-d}    ] 3. The third (b,d) opposite transformation leads to:    [    M_3 = frac{{-be+dc+ab}}{b}    ] 4. The fourth (b,c) opposite transformation results in:    [    M_4 = frac{{ce-bd-ac}}{-c} = frac{{ac+bd-ce}}{c} = M    ]    Therefore, statement ③ is correct.

Since ( |sin x| leq 1 ), we have:    [    left| frac{x}{100} right| = left| sin x right| implies left| x right| = 100 left| sin x right| leq 100    ]    This indicates that the absolute value of (x) cannot be greater than (100), i.e., (|x| leq 100). 4. Next, we plot the graphs of (frac{x}{100}) and (sin x) within the interval ([-100, 100]). 5. We estimate the number of intersections of these graphs. The period of the (sin x) function is (2pi), and one full cycle of (sin x) within the interval from (0) to (100) is less than 16 (since one full cycle is approximately (6.2832)) but more than 15 cycles. 6. Specifically:    [    frac{100}{2pi} approx 15.915 implies 15 cdot 2pi < 100 < 16 cdot 2pi    ]    Therefore, there are 15 complete cycles from (sin x) over the interval (0) to (100). 7. We examine the intervals:    - Within each interval ([2kpi, (2k+2)pi]) where (k) is from (0) to (15), there can be two solutions since (frac{x}{100} = sin x) will intersect twice for each interval.    - Additionally, between ([0, pi]) there is one extra solution at (x=0). 8. Summarizing the number of solutions:    [    text{Number of positive solutions} = 1 + 2 times 15 = 31    ]    [    text{Number of negative solutions} = 1 times 31 = 31    ] 9.

The points are colored either red or blue. By the pigeonhole principle, since there are at least 5 points and two colors, there must be at least 3 points of the same color. 2. **Existence of a Same-Color Triangle:**    Since at least 3 points are of the same color, consider these points forming a set of same-colored points. Denote this set of points of the same color as ( R = { A, B, C, ldots } ). 3. **Non-Collinear Condition:**    The problem states that any three points of the same color do not lie on a single line. This implies that any three points of ( R ) (same color) can form a triangle. 4. **Selecting the Smallest Triangle:**    Among all the triangles formed by points in ( R ), pick the triangle with the smallest area. Denote this triangle by ( triangle ABC ). 5. **Considering Points on the Sides:**    Now, we analyze the sides of ( triangle ABC ):     - Assume each side of ( triangle ABC ) contains a point of the other color. Let ( X ), ( Y ), and ( Z ) be points such that:         - ( X ) lies on ( AB )         - ( Y ) lies on ( BC )         - ( Z ) lies on ( CA )     - These points ( X, Y, Z ) must exist by our assumption. 6. **Contradiction:**    If such points ( X, Y, Z ) exist on the sides of ( triangle ABC ), consider the triangles formed by these points and the vertices of ( triangle ABC ):     - Triangles ( triangle AXC ), ( triangle BYA ), and ( triangle CZB )        One of these smaller triangles must be of the same color as ( triangle ABC ), strictly forming a smaller triangle of the same color ( R ). This contradicts our earlier selection of ( triangle ABC ) as being the smallest area triangle with vertices of the same color. 7. **Conclusion:**    Due to the contradiction, it must be the case that not all sides of ( triangle ABC ) contain points of the other color. Hence, we have shown that there must exist a triangle among the set ( R ) that satisfies both conditions:    - The three vertices are of the same color.    - At least one side does not contain a point of the other color. Therefore, such a triangle indeed exists.

Assume ((x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n, y_1, ldots, y_n)) is the minimal case. Since it is minimal, any perturbation should not decrease (sum_{i=1}^n (x_i y_i - x_i y_{n+1-i})). 2. **Perturbation Analysis**:    Consider perturbing three values (x_a > x_b > x_c) while maintaining the conditions:    [    x_a + x_b + x_c = text{constant} quad text{and} quad x_a^2 + x_b^2 + x_c^2 = text{constant}.    ]    This is the intersection of a plane and a sphere, which forms a circle or a point. Since (x_a > x_b > x_c), the intersection is a circle. The endpoints of the arc on this circle are the points where (x_a) is maximal and (x_c) is minimal. 3. **Behavior on the Circle**:    On the circle, any permutation of ((x_a, x_b, x_c)) is also on the circle. For any non-zero coefficients (p, q, r, s), the expression (p x_a + q x_b + r x_c ge s) forms an arc of the circle. Let (z_i = y_i - y_{n+1-i}). Since (z_a ge z_b ge z_c), unless (z_a = z_b = z_c), we have:    [    z_a x_a + z_b x_b + z_c x_c > z_a x_c + z_b x_b + z_c x_a.    ]    Therefore, the minimum is obtained on the boundary of the arc of possible ((x_a, x_b, x_c)). 4. **Reduction to Two Values**:    Assume there are more than three distinct values for (x_i).

The boundary points are where (alpha = beta) and (beta = gamma). 5. **Minimization on the Boundary**:    To minimize (palpha + qbeta + rgamma) with (p/a ge q/b ge r/c), consider the tangent vector on the boundary. The tangent vector is perpendicular to ((a, b, c)) and ((aalpha, bbeta, cgamma)). The tangent vector is parallel to ((frac{beta - gamma}{a}, frac{gamma - alpha}{b}, frac{alpha - beta}{c})). At the boundary points, the tangent vector pointing outside the arc has a positive component, leading to a decrease in (palpha + qbeta + rgamma). 6. **Conclusion for Two Values**:    For the minimal case, (x_1 = ldots = x_i > x_{i+1} = ldots = x_n) and similarly for (y_i).

The LCM of 6, 9, 12, and 18 is the smallest number that is divisible by all of these numbers.  Let's find the LCM: - The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. - The prime factors of 9 are 3 and 3 (or 3^2). - The prime factors of 12 are 2, 2 (or 2^2), and 3. - The prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3^2.

So, the LCM is 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36. Now, we want the number to leave a remainder of 4 when divided by any of these divisors.

The order of 2 modulo 7 is 3, so ( q ) must be a multiple of 3.    - Let ( q = 3k ). Then ( 2^q - 1 = 2^{3k} - 1 = (2^3)^k - 1 = 8^k - 1 ).    - For ( k geq 1 ), ( 8^k - 1 ) is divisible by 7. For ( k geq 2 ), ( 8^k - 1 ) is also divisible by ( 7^2 = 49 ).    - Therefore, if ( n ) is an even perfect number greater than 28 and divisible by 7, it must also be divisible by 49. 2. **Odd Perfect Numbers:**    According to Theorem 2, if ( n ) is an odd perfect number, then it is of the form ( p^alpha m^2 ), where ( p equiv alpha equiv 1 pmod{4} ) and ( m, p ) are coprime.    - Suppose ( n ) is an odd perfect number greater than 28 and divisible by 7.    - Since ( n = p^alpha m^2 ) and ( n ) is divisible by 7, either ( p ) or ( m ) must be divisible by 7.    - If ( p = 7 ), then ( alpha ) must be odd and ( 7 equiv 3 pmod{4} ), which contradicts ( p equiv 1 pmod{4} ).    - Therefore, ( m ) must be divisible by 7. Let ( m = 7k ).    - Then ( n = p^alpha (7k)^2 = p^alpha 49k^2 ), which is divisible by 49.    - Therefore, if ( n ) is an odd perfect number greater than 28 and divisible by 7, it must also be divisible by 49.

The effective speed of the train (V_eff) is the train's speed minus the wind resistance: V_eff = Train speed - Wind resistance V_eff = 200 km/hr - 20 km/hr V_eff = 180 km/hr Now, we need to convert the effective speed from km/hr to m/s to match the length of the train, which is given in meters. To convert km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s. V_eff (m/s) = V_eff (km/hr) × (1000 m / 3600 s) V_eff (m/s) = 180 km/hr × (1000 m / 3600 s) V_eff (m/s) = 180 × (1000 / 3600) V_eff (m/s) = 180 × (5 / 18) V_eff (m/s) = 50 m/s Now that we have the effective speed in m/s, we can calculate the time (t) it takes for the train to cross the electric pole using the formula: t = Length of train / V_eff t = 150 m / 50 m/s t = 3 seconds Therefore, the train will take boxed{3}  seconds to cross the electric pole."},{"instruction":"Given the sets A={x|x^2=1} and B={x|ax=1}, if B subseteq A, then the set of real numbers a is ______.","output":"Since A={x|x^2=1}={-1,1} and B={x|ax=1}=left{frac{1}{a}right}, with B subseteq A,   it follows that B=emptyset, or B={-1}, or B={1}.

So each side within these triangles is a diagonal that skips one vertex of the hexagon, hence forming equilateral triangles.     3. **Defining Points of Intersection:**    Let's denote the points of intersection of these diagonals as B_{1}, B_{2}, dots, B_{6}, occurring in cyclic order around the center of the hexagon. 4. **Considering Pairwise Equilateral Triangles:**    We will now show that each intersection forms an equilateral triangle with its adjacent intersections: A_1B_1B_6, A_2B_2B_1, A_{3}B_{3}B_{2}, A_{4}B_{4}B_{3}, A_{5}B_{5}B_{4}, and A_{6}B_{6}B_{5}.

Each vertex ( v_i ) corresponds to row ( i ) of the square. An edge between vertices ( v_i ) and ( v_j ) represents a vertical domino that spans rows ( i ) and ( j ). 2. **Degree of Vertices:**    Note that each vertex ( v_i ) in this graph has an even degree because each row must be completely covered by dominoes, and each domino covers exactly two squares. Therefore, the number of vertical dominoes touching any row must be even. 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    Assume for contradiction that there is no line that divides the square into two parts, each of which is tiled by dominoes. This implies that the degrees of the vertices must satisfy certain conditions:    - (deg v_1 geq 2)    - By induction, (deg v_j geq 4) for (2 leq j leq 5)    - (deg v_6 geq 2) 4. **Counting Vertically Aligned Dominoes:**    Summing the degrees of all vertices, we get:    [    deg v_1 + deg v_2 + deg v_3 + deg v_4 + deg v_5 + deg v_6 geq 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 20    ]    Since each edge is counted twice (once for each vertex it connects), the total number of vertical dominoes is at least:    [    frac{20}{2} = 10    ] 5. **Counting Horizontally Aligned Dominoes:**    By symmetry, the same argument applies to the columns of the square.

This contradiction implies that our initial assumption (that there is no line dividing the square into two parts each tiled by dominoes) must be false. 7. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, there must exist a line that divides the 6×6 square into two parts, each of which is also tiled by dominoes.

We'll analyze the two possible cases for the angles of the isosceles triangle: ---  Case 1: (alpha = beta) 1. Since the triangle is isosceles with (alpha = beta), the remaining angle (gamma) is (180^circ - 2alpha):    [    gamma = 180^circ - 2alpha.    ]     2. Substitute these values into the given equation:    [    2 sin^2 alpha = sin gamma = sin(180^circ - 2 alpha).    ]     3. Using the trigonometric identity for sine of a supplementary angle ((sin(180^circ - x) = sin x)), we have:    [    sin(180^circ - 2alpha) = sin 2alpha.    ]     4. Therefore, the equation becomes:    [    2 sin^2 alpha = sin 2alpha.    ]     5. Using the double-angle identity for sine ((sin 2alpha = 2 sin alpha cos alpha)), we get:    [    2 sin^2 alpha = 2 sin alpha cos alpha.    ]     6. Dividing both sides by 2 and assuming (sin alpha neq 0), we find:    [    sin alpha = cos alpha.    ]     7. This equality holds if and only if (alpha = 45^circ) (since (sin 45^circ = cos 45^circ = frac{sqrt{2}}{2})). So we get:    [    alpha = beta = 45^circ.    ]     8. The remaining angle (gamma) will be:    [    gamma = 180^circ - 2 times 45^circ = 90^circ.    ]     Therefore, in this case, the angles of the triangle are: [ alpha = beta = 45^circ, quad gamma = 90^circ. ] ---  Case 2: (alpha = gamma) 1. In an isosceles triangle, if (alpha = gamma), then:    [    beta = 180^circ - 2alpha.    ]     2. Substituting these values into the given equation:    [    sin^2 alpha + sin^2 beta = sin alpha.    ]     3.

Using the double-angle identity (sin 2alpha = 2 sin alpha cos alpha), we get:    [    sin^2 alpha + (2 sin alpha cos alpha)^2 = sin alpha.    ]     5. Simplifying further:    [    sin^2 alpha + 4 sin^2 alpha cos^2 alpha = sin alpha.    ]     6. Use the Pythagorean identity (cos^2 alpha = 1 - sin^2 alpha):    [    sin^2 alpha + 4 sin^2 alpha (1 - sin^2 alpha) = sin alpha.    ]     7.

Let (u = sin alpha):    [    4u^4 - 5u^2 + u = 0.    ] 10. Factor out (u):     [     u(4u^3 - 5u + 1) = 0.     ] 11.

Let's define F(x) = f'(x) = a(e^{x}-1)-frac{1}{x+1}+1. Then, we find the second derivative of F(x):   F'(x) = ae^{x}+frac{1}{(x+1)^2}.   Given that a geqslant 0, we can see that F'(x) > 0 for all x > -1. This implies that F(x) = f'(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (-1, +infty).   Since f'(0) = a(1-1)-frac{1}{1}+1 = 0, we know that f'(x) < 0 for x in (-1,0) and f'(x) > 0 for x in (0, +infty). This means f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (-1,0) and monotonically increasing on (0, +infty).   Given that f(0) = a(1-0-1)-ln(1)+0 = 0, we conclude that f(x) has a unique zero at x=0.   **Part (2):**   From the given condition f(x_{1}) = g(x_{1}) - g(x_{2}), we have:   ln(x_{1}+1) + a(x_{1}+1) = ae^{x_{2}} + x_{2}.   If x_{1} satisfies the equation ln(x+1) + a(x+1) = b, then ln(x_{1}+1) satisfies the equation ae^{x} + x = b.   Since both m(x) = ln(x+1) + a(x+1) and n(x) = ae^{x} + x are monotonically increasing functions, it follows that x_{2} = ln(x_{1}+1). Thus, we have:   x_{1} - 2x_{2} = x_{1} - 2ln(x_{1}+1).

The standard form of a horizontal hyperbola is frac{{x}^{2}}{a^{2}}-frac{{y}^{2}}{b^{2}}=1, where 2a is the distance between the foci. For our hyperbola, a^2 = 4, so a = 2. 2. **Calculate the Coordinates of the Right Focus (F_1)**: The distance between the center of the hyperbola and each focus is a, and since our hyperbola is centered at the origin, the right focus F_1 is at (a, 0). Substituting a = 2 gives us the coordinates of the right focus as F_1(4, 0). 3. **Analyze the Distance Relationship**: For any point P on the right branch of the hyperbola, the sum of the distances from P to the left focus (F) and from P to point A(1, 4) is given by |PF| + |PA|. According to the properties of a hyperbola, the difference in distances from any point on the hyperbola to the foci is constant and equal to 2a. Therefore, we can express the sum of distances as |PF| + |PA| = 2a - |PF_1| + |PA|. 4. **Apply the Triangle Inequality**: The Triangle Inequality theorem states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side. Applying this to the distances |PF_1| and |PA|, we get |PF_1| + |PA| geqslant |AF_1|. Rearranging this inequality gives us -|PF_1| + |PA| leqslant |AF_1|. 5. **Calculate the Maximum Value**: Substituting 2a = 4 (since a = 2) into our expression and applying the inequality from step 4, we get |PF| + |PA| leqslant 4 + |AF_1|.

Therefore, |PF| + |PA| leqslant 4 + 5 = 9. 6. **Determine the Minimum Value**: The minimum value of |PF| + |PA| is achieved when A, P, and F are collinear, which corresponds to the maximum value we calculated as 9.

Given that A, B, and C together can finish the work in 4 days, their combined work rate is 1/4 of the work per day. So, A_work + B_work + C_work = 1/4. We are also given that B can finish the work in 24 days, so B's work rate is 1/24 of the work per day. B_work = 1/24. Similarly, C can finish the work in approximately 8 days (since 7.999999999999998 is very close to 8), so C's work rate is 1/8 of the work per day. C_work = 1/8. Now we can substitute B_work and C_work into the first equation to find A_work: A_work + (1/24) + (1/8) = 1/4. To solve for A_work, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4, 24, and 8 is 24. So we convert all fractions to have a denominator of 24: A_work + 1/24 + 3/24 = 6/24. Now combine the fractions: A_work + 4/24 = 6/24. Subtract 4/24 from both sides to isolate A_work: A_work = 6/24 - 4/24, A_work = 2/24. Simplify the fraction: A_work = 1/12. This means A can complete 1/12 of the work in one day. To find out how many days it takes for A to finish the work alone, we take the reciprocal of A_work: Days for A = 1 / A_work, Days for A = 1 / (1/12), Days for A = 12.

Note that this means:      [      angle B_1 F C_1 = angle B_1 Q C_1      ]    Therefore, ( F ) also lies on the circle circumscribing ( triangle Q B_1 C_1 ). 5. **Repeating for Different Triangles:**    Likewise, by swapping the roles of ( a ) and ( d ), ( b ) and ( c ), we can show that ( F ) lies on the circle circumscribing ( triangle Q B_2 C_2 ) as well.    Therefore, ( F ) is the common intersection point for the circles circumscribing all four triangles:    [    triangle P B_1 B_2, quad triangle P C_1 C_2, quad triangle Q B_1 C_1, quad triangle Q B_2 C_2    ] # Conclusion: Thus, the circles circumscribing the four triangles have a common intersection point ( F ). Hence, the problem statement is proven. [ blacksquare ]"},{"instruction":"Two solutions of [x^4  3x^3 + 5x^2  27x  36 = 0]are pure imaginary.

We need to compute the sum sum_{n = 1}^infty frac{1}{(n + 1) H_n H_{n + 1}}.

To place ( X ) precisely on line ( BC ), we write:    [    overrightarrow{X} = frac{1}{k} (kmathbf{b}) + left( 1-frac{1}{k} right) left(frac{k}{k-1}mathbf{c}right)    ]    This formulation correctly identifies ( X ) on ( BC ). 5. **Finding ( K ) with Vector Calculations**:    - With ( mathbf{b} ) and ( mathbf{c} ), we want:    [    overrightarrow{K} = frac{k}{k^2-k+1} ( mathbf{b} + (k-1)mathbf{c} )    ]    - We separate it into two parts to show it lies on ( BY ):    [    overrightarrow{K} = frac{k^2-k}{k^2-k+1}mathbf{c} + frac{1}{k^2-k+1} ( kmathbf{b} ) = ( k mathbf{b} - c ) quad text{and} quad frac{1}{k^2-k+1} (k mathbf{b})    ] 6. **Verification with Similar Triangles**:    - Recognizing ( BZX ) and ( XYC ) are similar:    [    frac{BZ}{ZX} = frac{XY}{YC}    ]    - Since ( triangle XYZ ) is equilateral:    [    frac{BZ}{ZY} = frac{ZY}{YC}    ] 7. **Comparing ( angle BZY ) and ( angle ZYC )**:    - Both are ( 120^circ ), so ( BZY ) and ( ZYC ) are similar.    - Therefore:    [    angle ZBY = angle YZC    ] 8. **Establish the Tangency Condition**:    - From the similarity and angles, ( YZ ) is tangent to the circle circumscribing ( triangle ZBK ), implying:    [    YZ^2 = YK cdot YB    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{YZ^2 = YK cdot YB} ]"},{"instruction":"Given nonzero vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} that satisfy |overrightarrow{a}| = |overrightarrow{b}| and (2overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}) cdot overrightarrow{b} = 0, find the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}.","output":"Let theta be the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}.

When the back of the train exits the tunnel 4 minutes after the front entered, the front has already moved 4 miles from its position at the tunnel's entrance. However, the train itself is 2 miles long. Therefore, for the back of the train to just exit the tunnel, the front of the train must be 2 miles beyond the tunnel’s end.

Therefore, the inequalities that hold true are: ③④. Hence, the answer is: B. By separately letting x_1 = frac{pi}{4}, x_2 = frac{pi}{3} to verify ①② does not hold true, and letting x_1 = frac{pi}{3}, x_2 = frac{pi}{6} to verify ③④ holds true, the answer can be obtained. This question examines the monotonicity of trigonometric functions and tests the reasoning and computational abilities, which is a moderately difficult question. Solution Enhancement: Let's analyze each inequality step-by-step: 1. For ①, we can utilize the trigonometric identity sin(x) + sin(y) = 2sinleft(frac{x + y}{2}right)cosleft(frac{x - y}{2}right). Since 0 < x_1, x_2 < frac{pi}{2}, we know that both sinleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right) and cosleft(frac{x_1 - x_2}{2}right) are positive. However, their product is not necessarily greater than sinleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right). For example, let x_1 = frac{pi}{4} and x_2 = frac{pi}{3}, then frac{1}{2}(sin x_1 + sin x_2) = frac{sqrt{2} + sqrt{3}}{4} < sinleft(frac{pi}{8}right) < sinleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. boxed{text{So, } ① text{ does not hold true.}} 2. For ②, we can utilize the trigonometric identity cos(x) + cos(y) = 2cosleft(frac{x + y}{2}right)cosleft(frac{x - y}{2}right). Since 0 < x_1, x_2 < frac{pi}{2}, we know that both cosleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right) and cosleft(frac{x_1 - x_2}{2}right) are positive. However, their product is not necessarily greater than cosleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right). For example, let x_1 = frac{pi}{4} and x_2 = frac{pi}{3}, then frac{1}{2}(cos x_1 + cos x_2) = frac{sqrt{2} + 1}{4} < cosleft(frac{7pi}{24}right) < cosleft(frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. boxed{text{So, } ② text{ does not hold true.}} 3. For ③, we can use the tangent addition formula, tan(x + y) = frac{tan x + tan y}{1 - tan x tan y}. Let x_1 = frac{pi}{3} and x_2 = frac{pi}{6}, then frac{1}{2}(tan x_1 + tan x_2) = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}. Now, tanleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right) = tanleft(frac{pi}{4}right) = 1. Since frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} > 1, we have frac{1}{2}(tan x_1 + tan x_2) > tanleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right). boxed{text{So, } ③ text{ holds true.}} 4. For ④, we can use the cotangent addition formula, cot(x + y) = frac{cot x cot y - 1}{cot x + cot y}. Let x_1 = frac{pi}{3} and x_2 = frac{pi}{6}, then frac{1}{2}left(cot x_1 + cot x_2right) = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}. Now, cotleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right) = cotleft(frac{pi}{4}right) = 1. Since frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} > 1, we have frac{1}{2}left(cot x_1 + cot x_2right) > cotleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right). Recall that cot x = frac{1}{tan x}, so we can rewrite the inequality as frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{tan x_1} + frac{1}{tan x_2}right) > frac{1}{tanleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right)}. boxed{text{So, } ④ text{ holds true.}}"},{"instruction":"Given the complex numbers Z_1 = 3  4i and Z_2 = 4 + bi (where b in mathbb{R} and i is the imaginary unit), if the product Z_1 cdot Z_2 is a pure imaginary number, then the value of b","output":"To find the value of b that makes Z_1 cdot Z_2 a pure imaginary number, we first calculate the product of Z_1 and Z_2.

Given these breaks and folding rates, how many shirts, pants, and shorts are remaining to be folded within the 2hour time constraint?","output":"Let's calculate the time Darcy spends folding each type of clothing: 1. Shirts: Darcy folds shirts at a rate of 12 per hour. He spends 45 minutes folding shirts before taking a break. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 45 minutes is 45/60 = 0.75 hours. In 0.75 hours, Darcy can fold 12 shirts/hour * 0.75 hours = 9 shirts. He started with 30 shirts, so after folding for 45 minutes, he has 30 - 9 = 21 shirts left to fold. 2. Pants: After a 15-minute break, Darcy starts folding pants. He folds pants at a rate of 8 per hour and spends 30 minutes folding pants before taking another break. Thirty minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours. In 0.5 hours, Darcy can fold 8 pants/hour * 0.5 hours = 4 pants. He started with 15 pants, so after folding for 30 minutes, he has 15 - 4 = 11 pants left to fold. 3. Shorts: Darcy takes a 10-minute break after folding pants. The total time spent on breaks so far is 15 minutes + 10 minutes = 25 minutes. The total time spent folding shirts and pants is 45 minutes + 30 minutes = 75 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent including breaks is 25 minutes + 75 minutes = 100 minutes. Darcy has a 2-hour time constraint, which is 120 minutes. The remaining time for folding is 120 minutes - 100 minutes = 20 minutes. Since Darcy folds shorts at a rate of 10 per hour, in 20 minutes (which is 20/60 = 1/3 hours), he can fold 10 shorts/hour * 1/3 hours = 10/3 = 3.33 shorts. Since he can't fold a fraction of a short, he folds 3 shorts in the remaining time. He started with 20 pairs of shorts, so after folding for 20 minutes, he has 20 - 3 = 17 shorts left to fold. In summary, within the 2-hour time constraint, Darcy has: - 21 shirts remaining to be folded - 11 pants remaining to be folded - boxed{17}  shorts remaining to be folded"},{"instruction":"A show debut and 200 people buy tickets.

This means that the remaining liquid in the 10-liter vessel was filled with water, making the total volume in the vessel 10 liters. The new concentration of the mixture is given as 30.000000000000004%, which is essentially 30% (since the extra decimal places are likely due to rounding errors in the calculation).

If one speaks the truth, the other lies. 2. Analyze the given statements:    - Let's assume the first brother's statement, \\"I am Tralyalya,\\" is true.      - Then, the first brother is indeed Tralyalya.      - Consequently, the second brother, saying \\"I am Trulyalya,\\" would also be telling the truth because Trulyalya never lies on the same day as Tralyalya.      - This creates a contradiction because both brothers cannot be telling the truth simultaneously.     3. Since the assumption that both statements are true leads to a contradiction, consider the opposite scenario that the first brother's statement is false:    - If the first brother's statement, \\"I am Tralyalya,\\" is false, he must be Trulyalya.    - Therefore, the first brother is Trulyalya (who is lying about being Tralyalya).    - The second brother, saying \\"I am Trulyalya,\\" would also be lying because he is indeed Tralyalya. 4. Check consistency:    - Now, we have the first brother (Trulyalya) and the second brother (Tralyalya).    - Trulyalya lies, and Tralyalya tells the truth.     5. Realize the logical implications:    - Both statements being false also creates inconsistency as explained previously. 6. Combining all insights together:    - Both statements cannot be false simultaneously.    - Both statements cannot be true simultaneously.    - Therefore, both statements must be independently true or false consistent with the description of brothers. 7. Final Conclusion:    - The only way this works logically is if it is a day when Tralyalya and Trulyalya tell the truth according to the arrangement; consequently, by assumption, this must be a day they both can legitimately claim alternate identities correctly. Therefore, it is concluded that: - The first brother is Tralyalya, and his previous statement is correct. - The second brother is Trulyalya and his previous statement is correct.

The derivative of f(x) at x=x_{0} is given by: [f'(x_{0}) = lim_{{Delta x}to 0}frac{f(x_{0}+Delta x)-f(x_{0})}{Delta x}.] 2. This expression involves taking the limit as Delta x approaches 0. This means we are interested in the behavior of the fraction as the change in x, denoted by Delta x, becomes infinitesimally small. 3. The fraction itself, frac{f(x_{0}+Delta x)-f(x_{0})}{Delta x}, calculates the average rate of change of f(x) over an interval of length Delta x starting at x_{0}. 4. As we take the limit Delta x to 0, we are essentially finding the instantaneous rate of change of f(x) at x=x_{0}. This process eliminates the dependence on Delta x because we are interested in the behavior as Delta x becomes infinitesimally small, not its specific value. 5. Therefore, the derivative f'(x_{0}) is a function of x_{0} because it describes the rate of change of f(x) at that specific point. The process of taking the limit as Delta x to 0 ensures that the derivative does not depend on the specific value of Delta x. 6. In conclusion, the derivative f'(x_{0}) depends only on the point x_{0} at which it is evaluated, and not on the value of Delta x.

To find such a sequence, we set: [ a_1 = 1 ] and for ( n geq 1 ), [ a_{n+1} = (3a_n)! + 1 ] 1. **Observation:**    Note that all elements of this sequence (a_n) are odd. This is because (a_1 = 1) is odd, and factorials of any number greater than 1 are even, which implies ((3a_n)! + 1) is always odd. 2. **Defining \\"Good\\" Pairs and Triples:**    Consider pairs and triples of sequence elements to be \\"good\\" if they satisfy the conditions described in the problem. Specifically, we say a pair ((a_i, a_j)) and a triple ((a_p, a_q, a_r)) are good if:    [ gcd(a_i + a_j, a_p + a_q + a_r) = 1 ] 3. **Lemma:**    Suppose ((a_i, a_j)) and ((a_p, a_q, a_r)) are good pairs and triples of elements from the defined sequence. We aim to show:    [ gcd(a_i + a_j, a_p + a_q + a_r) = gcd(a_i + a_j, a_p + a_q - a_r) = 1 ] 4. **Inductive Proof:**    We use induction on the largest index ( m ) among (i, j, p, q, r).    - **Base Case (m = 1):**      Clearly, for (a_1 = 1), both (a_i + a_j) and (a_p + a_q + a_r) would involve the smallest elements in the sequence, which directly satisfy the conditions since ( gcd(2, 3) = 1 ).    - **Inductive Step:**      Assume the statement holds for all indices up to ( m ). Consider ( m > 1 ) and we analyze different scenarios based on the presence of (a_m):      1. **Case 1: (a_m) in the pair only:**         Suppose ( a_m = a_i ). Consider the other element in the pair, say ( a_j ).         [ 0 < |a_p + a_q pm a_r| leq 3a_{i-1} ]         Since ( a_m - 1 = (3a_{m-1})! ), which divides the expression involving sums of smaller sequence elements, it holds by induction hypothesis that:         [ gcd(a_i + a_m, a_p + a_q pm a_r) = gcd( (a_i + 1) + (a_m - 1), a_p + a_q pm a_r) = gcd(a_i + 1, a_p + a_q pm a_r) = 1 ]      2. **Case 2: ( a_m ) in the triple only:**         Suppose ( a_m = a_q ). Similar to case 1, the inductive hypothesis ensures that any divisor properties hold, meaning:         [ gcd(a_i + a_j, a_p + a_m pm a_r) = gcd(a_i + a_j, a_p + 1 pm a_r) = 1 ]      3. **Case 3: ( a_m ) in both a pair and a triple:**         Suppose ( a_m = a_j = a_q ). Then similarly, as before:         [ gcd(a_i + a_m, a_p + a_m pm a_r) = gcd( (a_i + a_m), (a_p + a_m pm a_r)) - (a_i + a_m)) = gcd(a_i + 1, a_p - a_i pm a_r) = 1 ] Thus, the lemma holds by the principle of mathematical induction. Hence, we have shown that the defined sequence satisfies the required condition. # Conclusion: We have constructed an infinite increasing sequence of natural numbers (a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots) such that the sum of any two distinct members is coprime with the sum of any three distinct members.

In this sequence:      - (K_b) is bounded by ( P_r ) and ( P_b ), which are pyramids of different colors.      - (P_r ) is bounded by ( K_b ) and ( K_g ), which are cubes of different colors.        Thus, it is possible to create a necklace with 6 beads, complying with all the conditions. 7. **General Case:**    - To generalize, note that after achieving the minimal valid set of beads, each additional bead pair (one cube and one pyramid) must be different in type from the adjacent beads.    - Consider adding any even number of beads, each time ensuring it doesn’t invalidate the different shapes and colors adjacency rule.    - The sequence pattern ( P_r K_b P_b K_g ) or any rotation thereof can be extended while maintaining the rule. 8. Conclusion:    - The valid necklace lengths must be of the form (6 + 2k), for non-negative integers ( k ).       - (6 + 2(0) = 6)      - (6 + 2(1) = 8)      - (6 + 2(2) = 10)      - And so forth...    Therefore, among the provided options, the acceptable lengths can be derived:    - Calculation for 7 beads: ( 7 = 6 + 2 times 0.5 ) is not a valid integer.    - Calculation for 8 beads: ( 8 = 6 + 2 times 1 ) is valid.    - Calculation for 10 beads: ( 10 = 6 + 2 times 2 ) is valid.    - Calculation for 11 beads: ( 11 = 6 + 2 times 2.5 ) is not a valid integer.  9. Therefore, the only valid numbers of beads in the necklace that comply with the conditions given are 8 and 10.

(Provide your answer as a number)","output":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Identify the Streetlights That Can Be Turned Off**: Since the streetlights at both ends cannot be turned off, and there are 12 streetlights in total, we have 12 - 2 = 10 streetlights that are potential candidates for being turned off. 2. **Adjust for Non-Adjacent Requirement**: To ensure that no two turned-off streetlights are adjacent, turning off a streetlight effectively removes it and the adjacent streetlights from consideration. This means we are actually choosing streetlights to turn off from a smaller pool. However, the initial explanation might have been slightly confusing. To clarify, we consider the spaces between these streetlights as potential spots to \\"place\\" our turned-off status. With 10 streetlights, considering the non-adjacency requirement and the fact that we cannot turn off the first and last, we have 8 streetlights that can potentially be turned off. 3. **Calculate the Number of Ways**: We have 8 streetlights, and between them, there are 7 spaces. To turn off 4 streetlights in such a way that no two are adjacent, we can think of it as choosing 4 out of these 7 spaces (since choosing a space to turn off a streetlight ensures no two are adjacent). The number of ways to choose 4 spaces out of 7 is calculated using combinations, denoted as {C}_{7}^{4}. 4. **Perform the Calculation**: Using the formula for combinations, we find {C}_{7}^{4} = frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!}.

To solve this, we'll prove a more general result that the maximum number for an m times n rectangle is n if m = 1, and m + n - 2 if m, n > 1. We may assume m leq n.  We will begin by using induction on m. 1. **Base Case:**    - For m = 1, the problem simplifies to choosing squares from a single row of n squares. Clearly, the maximum number of squares we can select without having any redundant columns is all n squares.    Hence, for m = 1, the maximum number is:    [    n.    ] 2. **Base Case for m = 2:**    - For m = 2: Let's consider the 2 rows and n columns. If we pick two squares in the same row, we can't pick any more squares in that row or column since it would violate the condition.    - Therefore, the best strategy is to pick all the squares in one column, avoiding any other row-and-column intersections. This precisely allows us to pick:    [    n = 2 + n - 2.    ] 3. **Inductive Step:**    - Assume the result for k times n with k leq m-1 holds.

We use the conversion factor that 1 km/h is equal to 1000 meters/3600 seconds (or 5/18 m/s): Relative speed (in m/s) = 145 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed (in m/s) = 145 * (5/18) m/s Relative speed (in m/s) = 145 * 5 / 18 m/s Relative speed (in m/s) = 725 / 18 m/s Relative speed (in m/s) ≈ 40.28 m/s Now we can calculate the time it will take for the trains to be completely clear of each other: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 315 meters / 40.28 m/s Time ≈ 7.82 seconds So, it will take approximately boxed{7.82}  seconds for the two trains to be completely clear of each other from the moment they meet."},{"instruction":"There are some houses in a block.

If the maximum profit that can be obtained each day in the future is 960 dollars, find the value of a.","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Finding the Selling Price for a Profit of 800 Dollars Given the linear relationship between the selling price x and the sales quantity y, we can express y as a linear function of x: y = kx + b. From the table, we have two points that lie on this line: (55, 90) and (65, 70). We can set up a system of equations to find k and b: 1. 55k + b = 90 2. 65k + b = 70 Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us 10k = -20, so k = -2. Substituting k = -2 into the first equation gives us 55(-2) + b = 90, leading to b = 200. Therefore, the equation relating y and x is y = -2x + 200. Given that the profit from sales on a certain day is 800 dollars, we use the profit formula Profit = (Selling Price - Cost Price) times Sales Quantity. Substituting y = -2x + 200 and the given cost price of 50 dollars, we get: 800 = (x - 50)(-2x + 200) Expanding and simplifying, we find: -2x^2 + 300x - 10000 = 800 -2x^2 + 300x - 10800 = 0 Dividing the entire equation by -2, we get: x^2 - 150x + 5400 = 0 Factoring or using the quadratic formula, we find two possible values for x: x_1 = 60 and x_2 = 90. Therefore, the selling price on that day could be boxed{60 dollars} or boxed{90 dollars}.  Part 2: Functional Relationship Between W and x, and Maximizing Daily Profit The profit W can be expressed as a function of x using the formula W = (x - 50)(-2x + 200). Simplifying, we get: W = -2x^2 + 300x - 10000 Completing the square, we rewrite W as: W = -2(x^2 - 150x + 5625) + 1250 W = -2(x - 75)^2 + 1250 Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative, the graph of this function is a downward-opening parabola. Thus, the maximum value of W occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at x = 75.

This means subtracting 1 from the y-coordinate of D' and changing the equation of the line to y=x.    - After translation, the line becomes y=x, and the point D' becomes (4,-2).    - Reflecting a point across the line y=x involves swapping the x and y coordinates of the point. So, reflecting (4,-2) across y=x gives us (-2,4).    - Finally, we translate this point back up by 1 unit (adding 1 to the y-coordinate) to compensate for the initial translation down.

So we have: 15 (Electropop) + 5 (Rock) + O (Oldies) + D (DJ's Choice) + 2 (Rap) = 30 Now, we know that D = O / 2, so we can substitute D with O / 2 in the equation: 15 + 5 + O + (O / 2) + 2 = 30 Combine like terms: O + (O / 2) = 30 - 15 - 5 - 2 O + (O / 2) = 8 To solve for O, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2O + O = 16 3O = 16 Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for O: O = 16 / 3 O = 5.333...

We start by making an observation that ( n ) cannot be divisible by 4.  3. If ( n ) were divisible by 4, then ( n = 4k ) for some integer ( k ). Substituting into the equation would lead to:    [    4k ? = 2(4k) + 16 = 8k + 16,    ]    which does not match the left-hand side of the equation unless ( n ) is specifically structured, which introduces complexity. 4. Therefore, ( n ) must be an odd integer. 5. Next, consider the possibility that ( n > 9 ). In this case, the left-hand side of the equation can be analyzed further. If we rewrite the equation in terms of ( n ) as:    [    n ? - 32 = 2(n - 8),    ]    and recognizing that ( n ? < n times n ). 6. Let's assume ( n = 2p ) for some prime ( p ). Since ( n ? ) would have a prime factor ( p ), and since ( p mid n ?) but ( p nmid 32 ), p would not fit into the equation consistently. This generates a contradiction if ( n > 9 ). 7.

Remove a red point and switch the colors of its two neighbors. 2. **Analyzing Color Changes**:    - When a red point is added between two points, the number of red points increases by 1.    - When a red point is removed, the number of red points decreases by 1. 3. **Number of Blue Points as Even**:    - We start with 0 blue points, which is an even number.    - We need to show that after any number of operations, the number of blue points remains even.    - Any operation changes the number of blue points by 0 or 2:      - Adding a red point between two existing points switches their colors (an even number) maintaining the blue count.      - Removing a red point switches its two neighbors’ colors (an even number), also maintaining the blue count.    - Therefore, the number of blue points always remains even. 4. **Constructing the Circle and Counting**:    - Let's consider the number of blue points along the circle, and let's call this count (B).    - Initially, ( B = 0 ) (even). 5. **Tracking Changes with a Counting Method**:    - Suppose we traverse the circle starting from any point, keeping track of the colors as follows:      - Increase the count by 1 if we encounter a red point and an even number of blue points so far.      - Decrease the count by 1 if we encounter a red point and an odd number of blue points so far.    - Applying this count means we start with (0) sum from the initial configuration since ( B = 0 ). 6. **Impact of Operation on Count**:    - Let’s consider how the two operations impact this count:      - Each of the eight basic operations involves switching colors of either 1 or 2 points. This means each operation changes the count by +1 or -1 and since we apply these changes twice in a complete traversal, impact on count remains balanced, keeping it even, never reaching a sum of multiples of 3. 7. **Concluding Proof**:    - Given any starting point or arrangement defined, the total ( B ) will never become odd or attain desired (2 blue, 0 red points) states as the mathematical counting method established keeps us away from it.    - Thus, reaching an arrangement of \\"2 blue points and 0 red points\\" is not feasible with allowed operations.

Let ( R ), ( B ), and ( G ) represent the number of occupied red, blue, and green grid points, respectively. 2. **Modeling the Moves**:     - Each move consists of selecting a unit triangle with two occupied corners and moving these pieces to the unoccupied corner.     - Notice that the values ( R + B ), ( B + G ), and ( G + R ) modulo 2 remain invariant during the moves.     - This invariance follows because each move affects exactly one of the quantities by (-2) (which is congruent to 0 modulo 2), while the other two remain unchanged. 3. **Checking the Possibility of Ending with One Piece**:     - To end with exactly one piece, two of the three initial counts (( R + B ), ( B + G ), ( G + R )) must be odd.      4. **Equilateral Triangle of Side Length ( n )**:     - Consider a triangle of side length ( n ), divided into ( (n+1) ) points per side.     - Let’s analyze this setup with respect to the invariant values:         - Suppose one of the vertices of the triangle is red. The blue and green points are mirrored with respect to an angle bisector through this vertex.         - Consequently, the counts of blue and green grid points are the same. This symmetry gives an equal count in these mirrored halves.          5. **Divisibility by 3**:     - If we assume that one vertex is red and balance the arguments symmetrically for blue and green, with the same number of each across the triangle, the configuration leads to each side containing an equal total from combinations of these values.     - Thus, for the configuration and count arguments to hold, ( n ) must be divisible by 3. 6. **Verification by Induction for Larger ( n )**:     - For ( n = 0 ), trivially only one tile is present.     - For ( n = 3 ):          - Through specific moves (labeled as Move A, B, and C in provided diagrams), the triangle reduces stepwise.     - For ( n geq 6 ):         - Inductively, reduce larger triangles by taking subsequential steps involving moves A, B, and C.         - Reduce ( n longrightarrow (n - 6) ) continually as shown in the reduction diagram. Here is the core conclusion: since a process exists to reduce the problem as required when ( n ) is divisible by 3, we conclude that the necessary condition for the sequence of moves ending in a single piece is that ( n ) must be divisible by 3.

The difference between the ages of a and c is 16 years more than the difference between the ages of b and c: (A - C) = (B - C) + 16  (Equation 3) Now, let's solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify Equation 3: A - C = B - C + 16 A - B = 16  (Equation 4) Now we have three equations with three variables (Equation 1, Equation 2, and Equation 4). We can use substitution or elimination to solve for A, B, and C.

When segment (AB) is rotated around point (P), it sweeps out an annulus with area (t). Determine the set of points around which rotating (AB) results in an annulus of the same area (t).","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We have a line segment (AB) with unit length in the plane and a point (P) located outside this segment. When (AB) is rotated around (P), it sweeps out an annulus (circular ring) with an area denoted as (t). The task is to determine the set of points (X) such that rotating (AB) around (X) also results in an annulus of area (t). 2. **Analysis of (X) Point Rotation:**    Consider any point (X) around which (AB) can be rotated. The key observation is that if the reflection of (X) across the perpendicular bisector of (AB) is (X'), then due to symmetry, the annuli generated by rotating (AB) around (X) and (X') will have the same area. Therefore, we only need to focus on points (X) such that (XA leq XB). 3. **Geometric Relations:**    Let (T) be the perpendicular projection of (X) onto the line segment (AB), and denote the distance (TB) as (x). The critical observation here is to consider whether (T) lies on the line segment (AB) or not:    - If (T) is on (AB): (0 leq x leq 1)    - If (T) is not on (AB): (x > 1) 4. **Case 1: (T) on (AB):**    [    t(x) = X B^2 cdot pi - X T^2 cdot pi = T B^2 cdot pi = x^2 pi    ] 5. **Case 2: (T) not on (AB):**    [    t(x) = X B^2 cdot pi - X A^2 cdot pi = left( X T^2 + T B^2 right) pi - left( X T^2 + T A^2 right) pi = left(T B^2 - T A^2 right) pi    ]    - Here, we have:      [ T B^2 = x^2 ]      [ T A^2 = (x - 1)^2 ]    - Thus:      [      t(x) = left( x^2 - (x-1)^2 right) pi = left( x^2 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) right) pi = (2x - 1) pi      ] 6. **Dependency on (T):**    The area (t(x)) depends only on the projection (T) rather than the position of (X) itself. The function describing the annulus area is:    [    t =     begin{cases}     x^2 pi & text{if } 0 leq x leq 1     (2x - 1) pi & text{if } x > 1     end{cases}    ] 7. **Monotonicity and Uniqueness:**    Both functions (x^2 pi) and ((2x - 1) pi) are strictly monotonic. Therefore, for a fixed area (t), there is a unique (x) value corresponding to that area:    [    t = x^2 pi quad text{or} quad t = (2x - 1) pi    ] 8. **Conclusion:**    Utilizing symmetry and uniqueness, the locus of points (X) such that rotating (AB) around (X) produces an annulus of area (t) includes:    - The perpendicular dropped from (P) to (AB)    - The reflection of this perpendicular over the perpendicular bisector of (AB)    - Including the intersection points on (AB), if considering degenerate annuli, otherwise excluding these points.

It is a comprehensive problem. First, define the functions f(x) and frac{1}{g(x)} on [3,4]. Let h(x)=f(x)-frac{1}{g(x)}. Then, lvert f(x_1)-f(x_2)rvert=lvert frac{1}{g(x_1)}-frac{1}{g(x_2)}rvert is equivalent to h(x) being a decreasing function on [3,4], which can help us find the range of a. Solution steps: 1. Since a < 0, f'(x)=1-frac{a}{x} > 0 holds true on xin[3,4]. 2. frac{1}{g(x)}=frac{e^x}{ex}, so (frac{1}{g(x)})'=frac{e^{x-1}(x-1)}{x^2} > 0 holds true on xin[3,4]. 3. Thus, f(x) and frac{1}{g(x)} are increasing functions on xin[3,4]. 4. Let x_1 < x_2, then lvert f(x_1)-f(x_2)rvert=lvert frac{1}{g(x_1)}-frac{1}{g(x_2)}rvert implies f(x_2) - f(x_1) < frac{1}{g(x_2)}-frac{1}{g(x_1)}. 5.

Since f(x_2)-frac{1}{g(x_2)} < f(x_1)-frac{1}{g(x_1)}, h(x) is a decreasing function on [3,4]. 8. Therefore, h'(x)=1-frac{a}{x}-frac{e^{x-1}(x-1)}{x^2}leqslant 0 holds true. 9. This implies ageqslant x-e^{x-1}+frac{e^{x-1}}{x}. 10. Let p(x)=x-e^{x-1}+frac{e^{x-1}}{x}, then p'(x)=1-e^{x-1}+frac{e^{x-1}(x-1)}{x^2}=1-e^{x-1}[(frac{1}{x}-frac{1}{2})^2+frac{3}{4}] < 0. 11.

If Y's share is Rs. 18, we can find out how many times Y gets 45 paisa to make up Rs. 18. 18 / 0.45 = 40 times This means Y has received 45 paisa 40 times. Since Y gets 45 paisa for every rupee X gets, X must have received Rs. 1, 40 times as well. So, X's share = 40 * Rs. 1 = Rs. 40 Now, since Z gets 50 paisa for every rupee X gets, Z's share for 40 times would be: Z's share = 40 * Rs. 0.50 = Rs. 20 Now, we can find the total amount by adding the shares of X, Y, and Z: Total amount = X's share + Y's share + Z's share Total amount = Rs. 40 + Rs. 18 + Rs. 20 Total amount = Rs. 78 Therefore, the total amount is Rs. boxed{78} ."},{"instruction":"Given the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2}  frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0) with eccentricity e = frac{sqrt{5}}{2}, the equation of the asymptotes is ( ) A: y = pm frac{1}{4}x B: y = pm frac{1}{3}x C: y = pm frac{1}{2}x D: y = pm x","output":"**Analysis** According to the geometric properties of the hyperbola, we know that e= frac{c}{a}= sqrt{1+ frac{b^2}{a^2}}= frac{sqrt{5}}{2}, from which we can derive the equation of the asymptotes of the hyperbola. **Solution** Given e= frac{c}{a}= sqrt{1+ frac{b^2}{a^2}}= frac{sqrt{5}}{2}, we have frac{b^2}{a^2}= frac{1}{4}, thus frac{b}{a}= frac{1}{2}, therefore, the equation of the asymptotes of the hyperbola is y = pm frac{1}{2}x.
