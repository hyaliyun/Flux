The law applies to sticks using Bluetooth to remotely trigger a phone to take a picture. The agency said unregistered sticks might interfere with other devices using the same radio frequencies. Selfie sticks into which smartphones can be slotted to take snaps of their owners beyond arm's length have proved hugely popular and the most sophisticated versions use the Bluetooth short-range radio technology to trigger a handset's shutter. Because they use Bluetooth, the devices are considered to be a \\"telecommunication device\\" and must be tested and registered with the South Korean agency that oversees such gadgets, an official at the Central Radio Management Office told the AFP newswire. \\"The announcement last Friday was really just to let people know that they need to be careful about what they sell,\\" said the official. The regulations published by the Office can impose fines or jail terms on those making and selling unregistered sticks. \\"We've had a lot of calls from vendors who think they might have been unknowingly selling uncertified products,\\" added the radio management office's spokesman. So far, the new regulations are not being rigorously enforced and there are no reports of the sellers of selfie sticks at attractions in South Korea being targeted by police. Even the official at the radio frequency watchdog wondered if the new regulation was going to make a difference to the sale of the sticks - whether or not they are registered. \\"It's not going to affect anything in any meaningful way, but it is nonetheless a telecommunication device subject to regulation, and that means we are obligated to crack down on uncertified ones,\\" said the spokesman. A summary of the above article is?","output":"South Korea's radio management agency has recently issued guidelines prohibiting the sale of unregistered selfie sticks that use Bluetooth technology to remotely trigger a phone to take a picture. The reason for this action is that unregistered sticks may interfere with other devices that operate on the same radio frequencies.  Popularized by their utility in extending a phone's camera reach beyond arm's length, selfie sticks with Bluetooth capabilities are considered telecommunication devices. As a result, they must be tested and registered with the South Korean agency responsible for overseeing such gadgets. The Central Radio Management Office wants to ensure consumers and vendors alike are aware of the regulations to avoid legal penalties. Those found making and selling unregistered selfie sticks can face fines or even jail terms. Despite the new guidelines that have been published, there has not been strict enforcement or reports of vendors being targeted by the police so far. However, some vendors have expressed concern that they may have unintentionally sold uncertified products. While an official from the Central Radio Registration Office acknowledges the regulations may not immediately change the sale of selfie sticks, the office is still obligated to crack down on uncertified devices as part of their regulatory responsibility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Teacher:In this task you are given a sentence with one coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so). You must judge whether the order of two coordinated clausal conjoints have been inverted or not. Inversion would result in the sentence sounding unnatural. Label the instances as \\"Original\\" or \\"Inversion\\" based on your judgment. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: His whole dream had become a nightmare and he wanted to get his dream back . Student:","output":"Part #1: Identifying the coordinating conjunction in a given sentence. Usage: In the sample sentence \\"His whole dream had become a nightmare and he wanted to get his dream back\\", the coordinating conjunction is 'and'. We know this because 'and' is one of the seven coordinating conjunctions listed in the task description ('for', 'and', 'nor', 'but', 'or', 'yet', 'so'). Part #2: Identifying the two coordinated clausal conjoints before and after the conjunction. Usage: The two coordinated clausal conjoints in the sentence are: \\"His whole dream had become a nightmare\\" and \\"he wanted to get his dream back\\". I deduced this because these two parts of the sentence can stand alone as individual sentences, which is a key characteristic of clausal conjoints. Part #3: Judging whether the order of two coordinated clausal conjoints have been inverted. Usage: The order of the two clauses has not been inverted in the given sentence. That's because the natural, logical flow of actions or events is followed in the sentence, i.e., his dream became a nightmare first, followed by his desire to get his dream back. This makes the sentence sound normal and natural.  Part #4: Labeling the instances as \\"Original\\" or \\"Inversion\\" based on your judgment. Usage: Based on the judgment, the given sentence can be labeled as \\"Original\\". Here, \\"Original\\" indicates a normal, natural sentence where the order of actions makes logical sense and \\"Inversion\\" would mean that the order of the clauses makes the sentence sound unnatural."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Josie and the Pussycats (initially published as She's Josie and Josie) is a teen-humor comic book about a fictional rock band, created by Dan DeCarlo and published by Archie Comics. It was published from 1963 until 1982; since then, a number of one-shot issues have appeared without regularity. A second series, set in the New Riverdale universe, launched in September 2016. The series was adapted into a Saturday morning cartoon by Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1970 and a live-action motion picture by Universal Studios and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 2001. In March 2005, Archie Comics announced that a manga version of the title would be published, with art by Tania del Rio, who was also responsible for the manga makeover of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. The first such \\"Josie and the Pussycasts\\" story, \\"Opening Act\\" ran in Tales from Riverdale Digest #3 (August 2005) The band had previously appeared in manga form in issue Sabrina, The Teenage Witch #67 (August 2005).  In Archie & Friends #96 (January 2006) the origin of the Pussycats was retconned. The manga version implies that none of the characters previously knew each other. Josie Jones was cut from the school choir, but met Valerie Smith and the two founded the band. They recruited Melody, whose idea it was to wear cat outfits. The band was not doing well at first, but Alex liked the group, though Alexandra could tell he was more interested in Josie. Alex's father let him be the manager as long as he did not use his wealth to help make them stars. In Sabrina the Teenage Witch #72 (February 2006), a stranger named Alan helped carry their equipment. Josie, already attracted to Alan, jealously thought there was an attraction between Alan and Melody. Alex hired him as their stagehand.  The manga focused on the group's attempt to reach fame rather than on their career after they have already achieved it. It featured characters not seen in other comics, including Alan's younger sister Alison and the rival group the Vixens. The manga version was not popular among readers, who preferred the traditional style. Its final appearance was in Archie & Friends #104 (December 2006). A Katy Keene revival replaced it (both featured alongside each other in the latter part of the manga's run), though it, too, did not last. was the manga version different than the first version?","output":"Yes, the manga version of Josie and the Pussycats was different from the first version.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all.

Read this and answer the question Alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population. The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors. Why were alternative energy sources judged uneconomical in 2001?","output":"In 2001, alternative energy sources like wind and hydroelectric power were considered uneconomical in Alaska because of a few reasons. First, the fuel prices were low, at less than 50 cents per gallon. This made using diesel fuel cheaper than investing in alternative energy. Second, Alaska has long distances and low population, which means setting up new energy systems would be expensive compared to the low demand.

Choose your answer from:  * spray the top of the stick with oil to absorb some of the heat.;  * place a coozie over the top of the stick when driving the car.;","output":"To accomplish the goal of preventing your hand from getting burned when driving an automatic car on a hot day, I would recommend a slightly modified version of the second option: placing a protective cover over the top of the gear stick when the car is parked, rather than while driving. In addition, there are several other precautionary measures you can take. The first option, spraying the top of the stick with oil, is not advisable. Oil may indeed absorb some of the heat, but it can also make the gear stick slippery and difficult to hold, potentially compromising your control of the vehicle. Moreover, oil could damage the gear stick or the surrounding interior of the car. As for placing a coozie over the top of the stick, this can be a useful strategy, but I suggest you modify it slightly. Instead, place a protective cover (such as a coozie or a small towel) over the gear stick when the car is parked under the sun. This will prevent the gear stick from becoming too hot to handle once you get back in the car. Apart from the above, here are some additional tips to keep your gear stick cool and avoid burning your hand: 1. Park in the shade: Whenever possible, park your car in a shaded area to minimize direct sunlight exposure and to keep the interior cool. 2. Use a sunshade: Invest in a car sunshade for your windshield to reflect sunlight and reduce the temperature inside your vehicle. 3. Ventilate your car: Before getting into the car on a hot day, open the doors and windows for a minute or two to let the hot air escape. This will cool down the interior, including the gear stick. 4. Use a steering wheel cover: A steering wheel cover made of insulating material will not only keep the steering wheel cool but also the surrounding components, like the gear stick. 5. Air conditioning: Once you start the car, turn on the air conditioning and let it run for a few minutes before driving. This will cool the inside of the car, making it more comfortable to drive and protecting your hand from burns. 6. Avoid driving during peak heat hours: If possible, avoid driving during the hottest hours of the day to minimize the risk of burns. 7. Insulated gear stick cover: You can purchase an insulated gear stick cover specifically designed to keep it cool on hot days. In conclusion, the best way to prevent getting your hand burned when driving an automatic car on a hot day is by parking in the shade, using sunshades and protective covers, ventilating the car, and utilizing various techniques to keep the car's interior cool. Placing a coozie or a small towel over the gear stick when parked is also a practical approach, rather than while driving. By taking these steps, you can ensure a comfortable driving experience on hot days."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Summarize this article: Pope Francis waves at faithfuls upon his arrival at St.Peter’s square for the weekly general audience on March 5, 2014 AFP/Getty Images      Thursday is the one-year anniversary of Pope Francis’s election, and the 266th pope remains as popular as ever. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds 55% hold a positive view of the pope, compared to just 7% who hold a negative view. About a quarter of Americans didn’t have an opinion.      His popularity has held steady in recent months, but has skyrocketed since last July, when 35% said they viewed the pope positively.      Pope Francis has fared far better than his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who had a 30% approval rating when he left office in February.      The pope consistently ranks better among more educated Americans, with 66% of people who had received a postgraduate degree saying they viewed him positively, compared with 48% of those who had completed some or all of high school.      Democrats are also fonder of the pope than Republicans or independents are. Some 62% of Democrats said they viewed Pope Francis positively, compared with 53% of Republicans and 41% of independents.      Since his election, the pope has drawn significant media attention with his personal warmth and his efforts to set a new tone for the Catholic Church. Last week, a media firestorm ensued when, in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, the pope said the church must evaluate gay civil unions, though he maintained that marriage is between a man and a woman. Last September, he remarked that the church had grown “obsessed” with abortion, gay marriage and contraception and called for a “new balance” in the church.      A strong majority of Catholics have also responded positively to Pope Francis, with 60% saying they agreed with the statement, “Pope Francis has renewed and strengthened my religious faith and commitment to the Catholic Church”—compared to 31% who said they disagreed.      Women were far more likely than men to agree with that statement, with 70% reporting they did, compared with 50% of men. Older Catholics were also more likely to feel renewed faith than younger ones, with 61% of Catholics over the age of 61 saying they agreed with the statement, compared to 51% of Catholics aged 18 to 34.

His predecessor, Benedict XVI, had resigned the month before, citing a decline in his physical and mental strength, leading to an almost unprecedented handover of power. After the remote, intellectual German theologian came the church's first Jesuit leader, its first Latin American pontiff – and the first pope to take the name of Francis.      The pope was elected with a mandate to shake up the church in Rome and help turn the page on an increasingly fraught and scandal-bedevilled papacy. His many fans argue he has vigorously pursued a reformist agenda within the Vatican while radically improving the church's image outside it. But, as Rome marks his first anniversary, just how successful has this peculiarly popular pontiff been?      Good works            Image management      Pope Francis blesses Vinicio Riva in November. Photograph: Claudio Peri/EPA      Talk of the \\"Pope Francis effect\\" is ubiquitous for a reason: since stepping out on to the balcony of St Peter's on the evening of 13 March 2013 to joke that the cardinal-electors had been forced to cast their nets to \\"the end of the Earth\\" to find a successor to Benedict, Jorge Mario Bergoglio has scarcely put a humbly shod foot wrong PR-wise. Despite adhering to church teaching as closely as his predecessor, Francis has, through a mixture of charm, humour and openness, turned many preconceptions – and prejudices – on their heads. His decision to abjure the splendour of the apostolic palace in favour of the modest Casa Santa Marta guesthouse has offered proof of his personal commitment to a humbler church, while his tender embracing of Vinicio Riva, a man terribly disfigured by tumours, underlined his hands-on pastoral approach. Such actions saw him voted person of the year by both Time magazine and the US gay and lesbian magazine The Advocate, while his Twitter account - @pontifex – has almost 3.8 million followers.      Church governance      Francis's decision to appoint eight \\"outsider\\" cardinals to advise him on church reform was described by one observer as the \\"most important step in the history of the church for the past 10 centuries\\". The council, which includes cardinals from the US, Australia, India, Honduras and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has inevitably been dubbed the papal G8. \\"[They are] not courtiers but wise people who share my feelings,\\" said Francis, who has often been scathing about the \\"introspective and Vatican-centric\\" nature of the Holy See. \\"This is the start of a church with not just a vertical but horizontal organisation.\\" Jesuits, who have had to wait almost 500 years to see one of their number sit on the papal throne, proudly point out that consultation is one of the foundations of their order.      Overhaul of the Congregation for Bishops      Pope Francis meets bishops at the end of his weekly general audience, in St Peter's Square last month. Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP      As well as assembling his own G8, Francis has revamped the powerful Congregation for Bishops, the Vatican department responsible for selecting bishops. By appointing 12 new members and not confirming 14 existing members, he rebalanced the department to make it more moderate and progressive. Among those who were not confirmed was the highly influential conservative US cardinal Raymond Burke, who has been an outspoken critic of US presidential candidates who are in favour of abortion, embryonic stem-cell research, euthanasia, human cloning and same-sex marriage. New members include Vincent Nichols, the leader of Catholics in England and Wales praised for his pastoral and inclusive style, whom Francis made a cardinal last month. The papal historian Michael Walsh described the overhaul of the congregation as a \\"tectonic shift\\" in governance.      Inclusivity      On Maundy Thursday 2013, a fortnight after becoming pope, Francis exhorted his priests to abandon introspection and to get out \\"to the outskirts where there is suffering, bloodshed, blindness that longs for sight and prisoners in thrall to many evil masters\\". He washed and kissed the feet of two Muslims – one a woman – at a youth detention centre near Rome. It was the first time a pontiff had included women in the ceremony. For many, the greatest proof of the pope's commitment to inclusivity and his desire to appeal to those who have long felt ignored or criticised by the church came during an impromptu press conference on a flight back from Brazil in July. \\"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to judge?\\" he asked journalists.      Anglican relations      Francis's determination to \\"intensify dialogue among the various religions\\" has not been confined to reaching out to Jews and Muslims. Last June, he had lunch with the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the pair chatted for four hours. Despite frosty relations that have existed between the churches in recent years – caused mainly by the C of E's decision to ordain women and Pope Benedict's creation of an ordinariate to bring disaffected Anglicans into the embrace of Rome – Francis and Welby appear to have a genuine rapport. According to Sir David Moxon, the archbishop of Canterbury's representative to the Holy See and director of the Anglican centre in Rome, there was an \\"immediate chemistry\\" between the two leaders, whom Moxon describes as \\"men of action\\" equally committed to tackling poverty and social injustice. It has not hurt that Welby's personal spiritual director is a Benedictine monk; nor that the archbishop recently signalled a further rapprochement by inviting members of a Roman Catholic ecumenical community to take up residence in Lambeth Palace.      Political player      Pope Francis (kissing the feet of a young offender during a mass at the church of the Casal del Marmo youth prison on the outskirts of Rome in 2013. Photograph: AFP      It was no accident that Francis chose a career Vatican diplomat, Pietro Parolin, as his secretary of state, a position often likened to the papal prime minister. The pope has shown a desire to put the Vatican back on the international stage as a key player in external – not just messy, internal – affairs, and his stance on Syria has been the clearest sign that under him the Catholic church's voice will be loud and clear. With an open letter to the leaders of the G20, repeated exhortations for a non-violent, mediated solution, and a day-long fast and mass prayer vigil, he provided a moral counterweight to the Obama administration and its proposed air strikes. His powerful criticisms of capitalist excesses have seen the church regain relevance in the contemporary debate on social justice. And his decision to make Lampedusa the location of his first trip outside Rome, slamming a \\"globalisation of indifference\\" that allowed migrants to die in the Mediterranean, he focused the eyes of the world on an often-overlooked problem.\\"      The jury's out      Curia reform      The \\"outsider\\" pope was elected with a mandate to come to Rome and bang heads together. In the fading light of Benedict's papacy, infighting and corruption within the Curia – the Vatican's central bureaucracy – had dominated amid the so-called Vatileaks affair. Francis has announced measures to engender reform, most notably the creation of a secretariat of the economy – a kind of finance ministry – to centralise the handling of business and administrative affairs. That will be led by the outspoken Australian Cardinal George Pell. The other key staffing decision was to replace the widely discredited Tarcisio Bertone as secretary of state –a symbolic and practical move Francis must hope will draw a line under an era of scandal and incompetence.      Core teachings      The pope appearing in a selfie taken by young pilgrims in St Peter's, Rome. Photograph: AP      Liberals who would like to see significant doctrinal shifts from Francis should alter their expectations. The pope has made clear his commitment to core church teachings on issues such as abortion and women's ordination. But that doesn't mean there will be no change at all. For one thing, Francis has said the church needs a \\"new balance\\" and a less condemnatory attitude to sexual morality. For another, he has shown himself to be a pragmatic conservative, committed to doctrine but concerned with how the church responds to pastoral realities. In concrete terms, speculation centres on whether he will see fit to announce a shift on the treatment of remarried divorcees, now banned from receiving holy communion. Walter Kasper, the cardinal Francis chose to speak on the subject at a consistory earlier this year, told La Repubblica newspaper this week that the church should try to find a \\"realistic application of doctrine\\", adding: \\"The church must never judge as though it had a guillotine in its hands.\\"      Vatican Bank      All too often the cause of embarrassment for the papacy, the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR) is at the heart of Francis's reform – and ethical finance – agenda. He has set up a commission of lay experts and clerics to investigate the bank's running, and has replaced four of five cardinals appointed under Benedict on an oversight body. Under German president Ernst von Freyberg, the bank is trying to improve transparency and has hired an outside firm of accountants to help it meet international standards. But an Italian investigation into allegations of money laundering – which the bank denies – continues and a report by a Council of Europe body, Moneyval, in December said the IOR still had some way to go. Francis has made it clear that, if the bank cannot be adequately reformed, he would have no compunction about closing it for good.      Must try harder            Clerical sex abuse      There are growing suspicions that this, more than any other issue, is emerging as Francis's blind spot. Critics say he has done little to ramp up the church's response to the scandal. Though he has said officials must \\"act decisively\\" on the problem – and in December announced a new commission to examine ways of better protecting children and helping victims – most advocates for abuse victims say another commission is not what is needed and criticise him for not making the deep changes they, and the UN, say are necessary. They have been left despondent by Francis's occasional comments on the issue, in which he has generally defended the church while condemning the abuse. An interview published this month in which he claimed that no other institution had acted with the same \\"transparency and responsibility\\" elicited particular anger. \\"His comments about clerical sex abuse [in the interview] make it clear that he is using the same tired and irrelevant playbook the bishops have worn out over the past few years,\\" wrote priest and victims' supporter Tom Doyle in the National Catholic Reporter. ||||| Pope Francis is celebrating his first year in office.      The Argentinean-born pontiff is currently on a week-long spiritual retreat with cardinals and bishops in the Alban Hills near Rome.      Italian opinion polls give Pope Francis the highest popularity rating of any recent pontiff.      However, the BBC's David Willey in Rome says that Francis's papacy so far has shown a change of style rather than of substance.      Pope Francis is the first Latin American - and the first Jesuit - to lead the Roman Catholic Church.      Pope Francis eschews the superstar status he has been accorded by the world's media Pope marks one year at Vatican      Since taking office, pilgrims have been arriving in Rome in unprecedented numbers.      He is also riding high on social media, with 11 million following him in nine languages on Twitter.      Our correspondent says Francis's approval rating has remained high despite a recent UN report accusing the Catholic Church of systematically covering up for tens of thousands of child-abusing priests reported to the Vatican.      The Pope himself has denounced any cult of personality.      He recently told Corriere della Sera: \\"Portraying the pope as a kind of superman, a type of star, it seems offensive.\\"      Pope Francis's reforms are not popular with some conservative Catholics      Pope Francis travelled by bus to spend the first anniversary of his election in a spiritual retreat      In Argentina artefacts to mark the anniversary are widely on display      Italian opinion polls give Pope Francis the highest popularity rating of any recent pontiff      Francis, 77, has appointed new advisers to help him run the Church and is planning major reforms of Vatican finances and of the scandal-hit Vatican bank.      But our correspondent adds that for the moment there is no sign of a change in official Catholic teaching on artificial contraception or on the celibacy rule for priests.      However the Pope's compassionate attitude - especially his outreach to believers who have abandoned going to Mass and to divorced Catholics banned from receiving communion - is not universally admired by traditionalist cardinals.      Likewise his attitude towards gay people - he says that he is not going to judge them - contrasts strongly with that of his predecessor Pope Benedict, who called homosexuality \\"intrinsically evil\\".      Thursday's anniversary is not being marked in any official way, a move that Vatican-watchers say is in keeping with the Pope's tendency to eschew pomp and ceremony.      The decision to celebrate the anniversary quietly is a sound alternative to what almost certainly would have been a media frenzy if Pope Francis had decided to mark the anniversary in public, correspondents say. ||||| Religion makes a lot of mistakes.

Or they are so captive to the here-and-now that it becomes hard to distinguish between a congregation and a party headquarters.

Yes, his choice of the name Francis was a promising sign that he would emulate a saint devoted to the poor and to simplicity. Yes, he was already on record with searing criticisms of the injustices of global capitalism. From the beginning, he stressed his more humble role as the “Bishop of Rome,” suggesting an anti-imperial papacy.      And then it continued. He disdained the trappings of piety and might, including the ornate regalia that appeal to so many prelates. The Roman joke was that as priests got with his program, one could find many lacy surplices on sale at steep discounts on eBay. On his first Holy Thursday, Francis washed the feet not of the usual group of priests but rather of a dozen young people being held at a juvenile detention center, including two women and two Muslims.      He has not altered church doctrine, but his shift in emphasis has been breathtaking. “We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods,” he has said. “This is not possible.” He thus declared that the church’s main mission would no longer be as a lead combatant in the culture wars. It would stand primarily with and for the neediest.      The most important aspect of a Pew survey released this month was not its finding that 68 percent of U.S. Catholics thought Francis was changing the church for the better, or that 76 percent said he was doing a good or excellent job of addressing the needs and concerns of the poor. No, the truly revealing fact about this study is that it did not even occur to Pew’s pollsters to ask in their benchmark poll a year ago whether poverty should be a priority of the new pope. This is no knock on Pew; the fact that its researchers had to include a new question about poverty this year shows how much Francis has transformed the church.      The pope said recently that he was uncomfortable with being seen as a “superman,” and indeed, he is not. Francis expressed his unease in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera during which he made the most troubling misstep of the year.      Speaking of the pedophilia scandal that has shaken the faith of so many Catholics, particularly in the United States and in Ireland, Francis was uncharacteristically defensive and aggressive, insisting that the Catholic Church “is perhaps the only public institution that has moved with transparency and responsibility.”      “No one has done more,” he added, “and yet the church is the only one that has been attacked.”      Pope Francis had a noteworthy first year as head of the Catholic church. PostTV reviews a few of the pope's memorable photo ops that seem to parallel with common Bible passages. We used The New American Bible. (Jonathan Elker, Gillian Brockell and Kate M. Tobey/The Washington Post)      In fact, the church is not “the only one that has been attacked.” Even if it were, a pope who has emphasized the urgency of seeing the world from the perspective of the vulnerable and the wounded should have been the first to hear how his words might sound to the victims of abuse. A leader who has criticized a “psychology of princes” and the “spirit of careerism” should have known better.      But the keen disappointment felt over this is a mark of how high Francis has lifted expectations. He has shown that the spiritual life is also a life of social commitment. He demands a lot while preaching about a God of mercy, confounding scolds and religious therapists alike. By engaging joyfully with nonbelievers and those who believe differently, he speaks to those skeptical that Christianity has anything left to say.      He called for a church that is “bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets” and has proved that such a church is hard to ignore.      Read more from E.J. Dionne’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. ||||| Summary:","output":"Pope Francis celebrates the one-year anniversary of his election, maintaining high popularity and approval ratings. Respected in both religious and secular circles, the pontiff has made efforts to set a new tone for the Catholic Church and create a more inclusive and compassionate attitude. He has appointed new advisers to help him run the Church and is planning significant reforms of Vatican finances and the Vatican bank. Despite making no major changes to official Church teachings or rules, his shift in emphasis and commitment to engaging with nonbelievers and people of different faiths have garnered widespread admiration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I found the following answer on Google: In special relativity , needed for accuracy when large energy transfers between systems is involved, the difference between thermodynamically closed and isolated systems becomes important, since conservation of mass is strictly and perfectly upheld only for so-called isolated systems , i.e. those completely isolated from all exchanges with the environment. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct in the context of special relativity and the distinction between closed and isolated systems. However, it does not directly address the implications of the law of conservation of matter for humans. The law of conservation of matter states that matter cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. This has implications for humans in areas such as resource management, recycling, and understanding natural cycles like the carbon and nitrogen cycles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Petr Cech wants assurances over his Chelsea future as Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco manoeuvre themselves into position to strike for the goalkeeper. The Czech Republic’s future at Stamford Bridge has been called into question following Jose Mourinho’s decision to start with Thibaut Courtois against Burnley on Monday night. Cech feels he has been left in the dark over his first-team prospects following the return of Courtois from Atletico Madrid earlier this summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho say he wants Petr Cech to stay at Chelsea Not happy with the bench life: Petr Cech wants assurances over his Chelsea future this summer A loan move with away from Stamford Bridge with a recall option could suit both Chelsea and","output":"Cech perfectly, allowing the talented goalkeeper to continue playing regularly while maintaining the possibility of bringing him back to the club if needed. This would provide the Blues with the security of having a world-class option on standby while ensuring Cech does not grow frustrated with a lack of playing time. Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco have both expressed an interest in securing Cech's services, with the Ligue 1 giants keen to strengthen their squads as they challenge for domestic and European honors. A move to either French side would give the Czech star an opportunity to play in the Champions League, compete for prestigious titles, and maintain his excellent form ahead of international competitions. It is believed that Jose Mourinho wants to keep Cech at Chelsea, recognizing the valuable experience and leadership the veteran goalkeeper brings both on and off the field. The Portuguese manager has been offering Cech the role of \\"mentor\\" for the young Thibaut Courtois, hoping that this might encourage the 38-year-old to stay at the club and help Courtois develop into one of the world's best goalkeepers. Moreover, Chelsea's board is acutely aware of Cech's legendary status at the club, where he has won four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Champions League, and one Europa League during his 16-year-long illustrious career. There may also be fears that selling Cech could lead to dressing-room discontent, particularly among the club's senior players, who may see it as an indication that loyalty is not valued at Stamford Bridge. However, Cech's desire for regular first-team football is understandable, given his age and continued high-quality performances. In recent years, he has demonstrated his reliability, professionalism, and elite shot-stopping skills, leading many to consider him one of the best goalkeepers in the world, despite being surpassed in the pecking order by Courtois at Chelsea. As such, Chelsea faces a difficult decision with regards to keeping or selling Petr Cech. A loan move could prove to be an ideal compromise, but it may also hurt the club's relationship with the goalkeeper in the long run. Amid this uncertainty, Cech will want to know precisely where he stands, keen to avoid wasting any time in securing his future at a club that values his talents and can offer him the first-team opportunities he craves. In conclusion, Petr Cech's Chelsea future remains in the balance as Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco circle, eager to add the experienced shot-stopper to their ranks. While Chelsea would prefer to keep their legendary goalkeeper, Cech's desire for guaranteed playing time may force the club's hand in making a decision. A loan move with a recall option could benefit both parties, but only time will tell if such a compromise can be reached and satisfy all those involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to hook up an atari to a modern television set  Plug in the atari to an outlet.  It's obviously not going to work unless it has some power.  If you have the original tv/game switchbox that came with the atari console, you can try to hook this up.","output":"After plugging the Atari into an outlet and gathering the original TV/Game switchbox that came with the Atari console, the next step is to connect the Atari to your modern television set by following these steps: 1. Locate the RF Cable: The process primarily begins by finding the RF cable that usually comes with the Atari console. This cable is responsible for transmitting the audio and video signal from the console to the television. 2. Connect the Switchbox: Attach the RF cable's RCA plug (the plug with a single pin) to the designated RCA port on the TV/Game switchbox. This switchbox has two main functions: one is to facilitate the connection between the Atari console and the television, and the other acts as a toggle switch between regular TV and the gaming console. 3. Modification for Modern TVs: Many modern TVs no longer possess an RF input, so you will need to use an RF to Coaxial adapter. You can easily find these adapters online or at local electronics stores. If using an adapter, connect the RF cable to the adapter's input and the adapter to the coaxial port (also known as the antenna or cable port) on the back of your television. 4. TV Settings: Once everything is connected, switch on the television and the Atari console. Set your TV to either channel 3 or 4 (some Atari models may have a switch specifying which channel should be used). If you have difficulties with receiving the signal, navigate to the television's settings menu and set it to analog or antenna mode to receive the RF signal. 5. Adjusting the TV/Game Switchbox: Toggle the switch on the switchbox to enable the Atari console connection. If you still don't see the game, try adjusting the antennas or fine-tuning the TV to improve reception. 6. Calibration: Once the signal is received properly, you can calibrate the gameplay to ensure smooth and efficient functioning. Precautions, like repositioning the Atari console at a comfortable distance from the player, may be taken to avoid any accidents due to entangled cords. 7. Enjoy the Game: After completing the setup process, you can now enjoy playing your favorite Atari games on a modern television set. 8. Troubleshooting: If you continue to face issues with the Atari's connectivity to your television, try double-checking the connections, removing and reinserting the game cartridge, cleaning the connectors on both the console and cartridge with a gentle cleaner, or referring to online forums for guidance. Remember that the Atari system is a vintage gaming console, and as such, there may sometimes be compatibility issues or limitations with modern television sets. You might need to experiment with different settings or connections to find what works best for your specific Atari model and TV. However, once everything is properly connected and calibrated, you can enjoy the nostalgic experience of playing Atari games on your modern television."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Which New York Stadium was home to the New York Mets from 1964-2008, and was demolished in 2009? Answer:","output":"The New York stadium that was home to the New York Mets from 1964-2008 is Shea Stadium, located in the Flushing neighborhood of the Queens borough in New York City. It was officially opened on April 17, 1964, as part of the Flushing Meadow Park project, which also included the construction of nearby facilities for the 1964-1965 World's Fair. Named after attorney William A. Shea, who was instrumental in the efforts to bring National League baseball back to New York City after the Dodgers and Giants left for California, Shea Stadium served as a vital part of the city's sports history for more than four decades. During its tenure as the home of the New York Mets, Shea Stadium witnessed many memorable moments in the franchise's history. One of the most notable events was the Mets' World Series championship win in the 1969 season, which saw the team dubbed the \\"Miracle Mets\\" because of their unexpected success. The stadium also hosted the All-Star Game in 1964 and witnessed additional Mets playoff runs, including another World Series win in 1986 and National League Championship Series appearances in 1999 and 2000. Aside from its primary role as a baseball stadium, Shea Stadium served many other purposes throughout its existence. As a multi-purpose venue, it hosted NFL games for the New York Jets from 1964-1983, numerous concerts, including appearances from legendary musicians such as The Beatles, and various other sporting and non-sporting events. The Beatles' performance at Shea Stadium on August 15, 1965, is regarded as a pivotal moment in rock history and helped to cement the band's international fame. The stadium's versatility was a testament to its design, which allowed for easy conversion between different event configurations. As the years went on, Shea Stadium began to show its age and lag behind newer, more modern stadiums in terms of amenities and facilities. In response to this, plans were developed for a new ballpark to replace the aging stadium. In 2006, construction began on Citi Field, located in the adjacent parking lot. The New York Mets played their final season at Shea Stadium in 2008, with the final game taking place on September 28, 2008, against the Florida Marlins. Demolition work began on Shea Stadium in October 2008, shortly after the conclusion of the 2008 baseball season. The demolition process took several months to complete, with the majority of the stadium structure being dismantled by March 2009. A formal ceremony to mark the demolition's end was held on May 13, 2009. Today, Citi Field stands proudly as the home of the New York Mets, continuing the team's storied history in a state-of-the-art facility that offers fans an unparalleled baseball experience. Shea Stadium, while no longer standing, remains a cherished memory for many Mets fans and an essential part of New York City's sports history. The site where Shea Stadium once stood is now used as a parking lot for Citi Field, serving as a reminder of the past while looking forward to the future of the franchise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Instead, it criticizes or targets groups in general: children of illegal immigrants and American children. Therefore, the harassed target in this post would be categorized as 'generic' because the user’s language targets groups (children of illegal immigrants and American children), not a specific individual.

Grammatical correctness: The sentence follows the basic structure of a declarative sentence in the English language, which consists of a subject, a verb, and sometimes an object or complement. In this case, \\"this car\\" is the subject, \\"stinks\\" is the verb, and there is no object or complement. The subject and the verb agree in terms of number, which is another important aspect of grammatical correctness. 2. Word choice: The words used in the sentence are appropriate and convey meaning effectively. \\"This car\\" is a specific reference to a particular car, while \\"stinks\\" is an informal but commonly used verb that indicates something has an unpleasant smell, is of poor quality, or is disagreeable. Although \\"stinks\\" can be considered informal or colloquial, it does not affect the grammatical correctness of the sentence. 3. Clarity: The sentence is clear and easily understood by the reader. It communicates a message effectively, expressing that the speaker or writer has a negative opinion about the car, most likely regarding its smell or overall quality. 4. Idiomatic usage: The phrase \\"stinks\\" is idiomatic and widely recognized in the English language. It is a metaphorical way of expressing dissatisfaction with something or someone, and is commonly used in a variety of contexts. In this sentence, the usage of \\"stinks\\" clearly conveys the speaker's negative opinion about the car.

Lawrence was born Victoria Ann Axelrad in Inglewood, California, the daughter of Anne Alene (nee Loyd) and Howard Axelrad, a certified public accountant for Max Factor. The family surname was legally changed to \\"Lawrence\\" when Vicki was young. She is a graduate of Morningside High School in Inglewood, class of 1967. Lawrence had originally planned on being a dental hygienist. As a comedian and actress, Lawrence is known for her work on The Carol Burnett Show, of which she was a part from 1967 to 1978. She was the only cast member, except for Burnett herself, who stayed on the show for the entire 11 seasons. After The Carol Burnett Show ended in 1978, Lawrence and her husband Al Schultz moved with their children to Maui, Hawaii, but after a few years, returned to Los Angeles, where they have remained.  Her portrayal of the Mama character on The Carol Burnett Show's \\"The Family\\" sketches was so popular that NBC subsequently created the sitcom Mama's Family, elaborating on the Mama character. (Burnett reprised the Eunice Higgins character for the sitcom from time to time.) The series ran from 1983 to 1985 on NBC; after its cancellation from NBC, it was renewed from 1986 to 1990 in first-run syndication. The show was more successful in the renewed version. She also reprised the Mama character on stage for Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show.  Lawrence has made appearances on other programs, such as the sitcoms Laverne & Shirley, Major Dad, Roseanne, Hannah Montana, and Yes, Dear. Between the NBC and syndication runs of Mama's Family, Lawrence starred in the 1985 comedy pilot Anything for Love, which aired as a special on CBS that summer and co-starred Lauren Tewes and Rebeca Arthur. Lawrence has also appeared with Burnett, Korman, and Tim Conway in the Burnett show retrospectives that were broadcast in 1993, 2001, and 2004. Lawrence played Sister Mary Paul (Sister Amnesia) in the TV special based on Nunsense Jamboree that originally aired on TNN in 1998.

Benjamin Wasik was digging a tunnel in the snow at a home on Aiken Road in Pendleton when snow collapsed on him around 3:40 p.m., the Niagara County Sherriff's Office said.      “It was a snow day, and he was doing what kids do,” Benjamin’s aunt, Diane Wasik Reed, 50, of Pendleton, told the Daily News Thursday. “He was the most gentle, most quietest and beautiful boy you would ever come across.”      Benjamin, who loved \\"Star Wars\\" and the outdoors, was outside with his father, David Wasik, at his grandparent’s upstate farm where he was playing in the snow, and his dad was trying to clean the residence’s driveway, she said.      Man found dead in Brooklyn snow bank wanted to marry girlfriend      “Five minutes later, he turns around, and didn’t see Ben,” Wasik Reed said.      The father started calling for his son and even searched the home, but there was still no sign of Benjamin.      David and his wife Melissa Wasik eventually found their son 10 minutes later and they performed CPR to try to revive him. Wasik Reed said about 2 feet of snow had fallen on the boy.      Benjamin Wasik, 10, was found dead after snow collapsed on him while he was digging a tunnel in a pile of snow in Pendleton, N.Y. (Family Handout)      Benjamin was taken to Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital where he was pronounced dead. His death has been ruled accidental and caused by asphyxiation, officials said.      10 injured in explosion on Sicily's Mount Etna volcano      Wasik Reed and her husband arrived at the hospital after Benjamin’s parents received the devastating news. Doctors “tried and tried, above and beyond,” to save her nephew, she said.      The incident is being investigated by the sheriff's office Criminal Investigation Bureau.      The Starpoint School District — where Benjamin was a fourth-grader at Regan Intermediate School — released a statement offering its condolences to the Wasik family and that crisis counseling was set up for students and faculty members.      Funeral services for Benjamin will be held this Sunday in Lockport, his aunt said. ||||| It was a snow day Wednesday, and 10-year-old Benjamin Wasik was doing what every kid in the Buffalo area was doing that day: playing in the snow.      \\"He was there one minute,\\" said his aunt, Diane Wasik Reed. \\"And he was gone. 'Where's Ben?'\\"      The fourth-grader was trapped under a pile of snow for about 20 minutes at his grandparents' farm on Aiken Road in Pendleton.      Family members pulled Ben out of the snow and performed CPR. The boy was raced to the hospital, but he was gone.      \\"It was just a little boy playing,\\" Wasik Reed said. \\"He will be forever missed. I don't know how we'll go on but we have to.\\"      Niagara County was in mourning for Ben on Thursday as news of his death spread.      The Starpoint School District, where Ben attended Regan Intermediate, sent a message to parents of students to alert them to the heartbreaking news. Crisis counseling was set up for his classmates and stress debriefings were scheduled for the first responders who tried to save the boy, some of whom knew him and his large extended family. The boy's uncle retired from the Lockport Police Department.      \\"They're hurting, but they're not hurting anything like the Wasiks are,\\" said Sheriff James Voutour.      Related: Benjamin Wasik obituary      The boy's aunt and law enforcement described what happened:      Ben was at his grandparents' farm on Aiken Road in Pendleton, where a foot and a half to two feet of snow had fallen by afternoon.      His father told him not to climb on the piles of snow, Voutour said.      No one knows for certain what happened next.      But suddenly, Ben's family realized he was missing.      Family members searched frantically for about 20 minutes, Voutour said.      \\"They found him shortly,\\" Wasik Reed said. \\"But it wasn't soon enough.\\"      They found him in a 15-foot high snow bank next to a barn where a plow had pushed up snow from the parking area.      Someone called 911 and the dispatchers instructed the family to start CPR.      Niagara County sheriff's deputies and an ambulance crew were there within minutes. They used a defibrillator to try to restart his heart.      \\"Everything was done at the scene to try to revive him,\\" Voutour said.      A Twin City Ambulance crew continued lifesaving efforts on Ben and raced him to Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital in Amherst with a sheriff's deputy escorting them. Amherst police also shut down roads so the ambulance could get to the hospital as soon as possible.      Doctors unsuccessfully tried to save Ben. The death was ruled accidental, caused by asphyxiation by entrapment.      Investigators said Ben Wasik was just doing something all kids want to do: play. They said he may have been trying to dig a tunnel into the snowpile but they weren't certain.      They urged parents to always keep an eye on their children, but at the same time described what happened as a freak accident, one that there was no way to predict.      \\"The parents did everything they could to keep an eye on him and as soon as they didn't see him they started to look for him,\\" said Voutour, who on the car ride from the Pendleton farm to the hospital in Amherst saw kids playing on three different snow banks.      A similar incident happened about 15 years ago on Errick Road in Wheatfield, sheriff's officials said.      Voutour also praised the the rescue crews, saying they did everything they could to save him. \\"Unfortunately, in this business,\\" he said, \\"we don't save everybody.\\"      Ben's family is devastated.      \\"He was a sweet, gentle soul,\\" his aunt said.      Ben loved to play outdoors, she said, and enjoyed spending time at his grandparents' farm. He loved to go fishing with his grandfather when the family would go to their cottage in the summer. Like so many other kids, he liked baseball, Star Wars and Legos.      Ben's death in the snow struck many in Buffalo hard. The snow storm meant two snow days in a row for kids. Many children and their parents spent them reveling in the snow.      \\"How many times as children did we all do this....go out and play...very sad and sorry,\\" one woman commented on a Buffalo News story about the terrible accident.      \\"That's so sad and so scary,\\" wrote another parent. \\"My 10 yr old was outside playing with his other 10 yr old friends today. Just hits close to home, you never know.\\"      A man posted to a friend about a memory from his childhood. \\"Remember ours collapsed and you pulled me out?\\"      Another mother shared a moment of panic she experienced Wednesday. \\"I was just shoveling outside with my 4 year old (he likes to \\"help\\" with his little shovel), and suddenly I didn't see him... I immediately panicked thinking this happened. But he was only standing behind a tall pile.\\"      Wasik Reed knows her family will forever second-guess the events of the day.      \\"The what ifs are endless... if there was no snow day,\\" she said.      She hopes that the terrible accident that took her nephew's life may somehow prevent other similar tragedies.      \\"If this can prevent anything, I know that the family would want that,\\" she said.      She asked for prayers and support for Ben's parents and brother and sister.      \\"Pray. Hug your kids tighter. Be thankful for your children and never take them for granted,\\" she said. \\"It's a senseless tragedy. But if someone could learn from it.

Write a text based on this summary: victims of northern ireland 's bloodiest bomb sue alleged real ira chieftains Text:","output":"Title: Victims of Northern Ireland's Bloodiest Bomb Attack Seek Justice as They Sue Alleged Real IRA Chieftains In a relentless pursuit to attain justice for the lives lost and the devastation caused by the 1998 Omagh bombing, victims and their families have taken legal action against the alleged leaders of the dissident Republican group - the Real Irish Republican Army (Real IRA). The Omagh bombing is known as the deadliest single incident of \\"the Troubles,\\" a three-decade-long period of conflict, violence, and political unrest in Northern Ireland. On August 15, 1998, a powerful car bomb with an estimated 500lb of explosives went off in Omagh, a small town in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. The catastrophic explosion resulted in the gruesome killing of 29 innocent people, including a woman pregnant with twins, and injuring over 200 others. The Real IRA, a dissident Republican group opposed to the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement of the same year, claimed responsibility for the blood-curdling attack. In the aftermath of the tragedy, the victims' families began their fight for justice, seeking to hold the individuals responsible for the attack accountable. The case eventually led to a landmark civil legal action in 2009, where four men were found liable for the bombing and ordered to pay £1.6m in damages. However, only one of the defendants faced a criminal conviction – a former Real IRA leader identified as Seamus Daly was tried in 2016 and ultimately acquitted of all charges. Despite the legal setbacks, the victims' resolve has only grown, and their fight for justice continues. The civil case recently took a significant turn as the victims and their families have now sued two suspected Real IRA chieftains, aiming to make them accountable for the destruction, pain, and loss they allegedly orchestrated. The two individuals are believed to have been prominent figures in planning and executing the Omagh bombing, and their prosecution could potentially bring a measure of justice and closure to the families and the entire Omagh community. With the legal battle ongoing, the victims and their families remain hopeful that they can finally secure justice for all those who were heartlessly slain and forever altered by the tragedy that unfolded more than two decades ago. The Omagh bombing's painful memories serve as a haunting reminder of the brutality of \\"the Troubles\\" and a plea to prevent any such acts of violence and terrorism from happening again. In their legal pursuit for truth and justice, the victims and their families demonstrate unwavering resilience, sending a strong message to those who would perpetrate violence that they will be held accountable for their actions. As Northern Ireland has come a long way since the dark days of \\"the Troubles,\\" the unity, strength, and perseverance shown by the victims of the Omagh bombing offer hope that the wounds of the past can heal, and lasting peace can be achieved. While no legal action can fully restore the lives lost or repair the damage caused by the Omagh attack, the persistent quest for justice serves as a testament to the human spirit's indomitability, paving the way for a brighter future based on truth, accountability, and reconciliation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: While applying to college may seem easy, getting in can be tough! When you apply for college, you will have to be honest with yourself and do a bit of research to find the right fit. Here are three steps to take when applying to colleges for the best chances at getting into the best college for you. Step l: Making A List Of Colleges To Apply To With over 6,000 colleges in the United States, the first step in applying to college is to do some research and make a college list . This process will be different for everyone. The number of colleges you apply to can vary, from applying to 1 school (not recommended) to 30 schools (not recommended),each applicant can choose how many colleges they apply to. Many limit the number because applications are accompanied by a fee.          . Step2: Splitting The List Into Target, Reach and Safety Schools In general, students will want to apply to three types of schools: Target, Reach and Safety schools. It is up to you how many applications you send, but a good mix would be more target than reach, and at least one safety. You will need to take your list, and now decide which are your top picks, which are attainable for you academically, which are affordable for you only with aid, and refine your broad list into a group of schools that gives you the best chance for success. Talk to an admissions counselor at your high school if you have questions about this. Step 3: Completing and Sending Applications to Colleges Once your list is complete you are ready to apply to college by completing and sending in applications! College applications take time to complete --you have to write essays, ask for recommendations and get test scores sent to schools--so stay organized! All colleges will require these types of application materials, so start thinking about these items well before October or December. Once you complete and send them, then you have successfully applied to college.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—\\"Radio Free Europe\\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors.

Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor.

It's so, so sad that she will never see young Thomas and Bridget grow up.' Close family: A holiday photo of Angela Sharkey with her eight-year old daughter Bridget and 21-year-old son Thomas. Police have launched a triple murder investigation with a 55-strong team of officers working on the case. The fire broke out in the living room of the flat at around 5.10am on July 24 and quickly spread. Strathclyde Police said the building had just one door and the family became trapped by the flames. The heat of the blaze caused a downstairs window to explode and left an area of severe scorching around the front door of the property in Scott Court. Mr Sharkey Senior was seen hanging out of the window and shouting for help. His son was found dead at the scene. The rest of the family were taken by ambulance to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley where Bridget died a short time later. Mr Sharkey and his wife both suffered serious burns and were moved to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where he died on July 30. Ms McKechnie added: 'On behalf of my sister Angela I would like to ask anyone please, please if you have any information, don't be afraid to come forward to the police to help us solve this horrible crime.' Thomas junior, an extremely talented golfer, was in the country after returning home from the U.S. where he had a Golfing Scholarship at Georgia Southern University. In his biography on the Georgia Southern Eagles website, he described himself as 'ambitious and competitive', adding that his grandfather and father were the biggest influence on his athletics career for teaching him golf. His sister Bridget is believed to have died after coming home from a planned sleepover because she missed her parents. Police said they are keen to speak to people who were at two parties which took place near Scott Court on the night of the blaze. The parties went on into the early hours of the morning. They are also keen to speak to two men seen in the vicinity at around 5am. A man in a grey hooded top was seen crossing West Princes Street near James Street at about 5am and another man was seen going on to John Street between 4am and 5am. Police are examining CCTV collected from around the Argyll and Bute town and are visiting more than 500 houses and business premises. Detective Superintendent Peter McPike. said: \\"There are no suspects at the moment. Clearly we are really. desperate to find out why this has taken place. 'Perhaps once we can establish that we will be closer to finding a suspect.' Family members (left to right) Margaret McKechnie, Gemma McFadyen and Val McFayden appeal to to the public for information during a police press conference. He added: 'I don't think people in Helensburgh are holding back. I do think that perhaps there might be a small number of people who might well be in receipt of information that could be crucial to the investigation and I would appeal to the consciences of those people to come forward and to contact us.' He said that police will wait until medical staff give approval before they speak to Mrs Sharkey, whose condition is still critical. Valerie McFadyen, 51, Thomas Sharkey Senior's sister, said: 'These murders have torn our family apart and it is something that no family should ever have to go through. It is very hard to come to terms with this. 'Someone knows who carried out this appalling act, and we do not understand how anyone could protect this killer who has murdered three members of our family. We would urge people to please look at your conscience and make that vital call to police to help us. 'We would like to thank people for their messages of condolence and help. But please keep doing all that you can to help police and help find those responsible.'

Context: The author and their friends are having an end-of-summer party, and they decided to get sake, a Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice. It's likely that they're not very familiar with it, given the phrasing of \\"went and got sake last night.\\" 2. Reaction: The author describes sake as \\"beastly,\\" which is an informal term that generally denotes something being exceptionally powerful, strong, or significant. In this context, it seems that the author is referring to how potent sake is as an alcoholic beverage. 3. Tony's experience: The author mentions that their friend Tony was noticeably affected by the sake after consuming only a small amount (1/2 an inch of it). This anecdote further demonstrates the author's perception of sake's strength. Based on these factors, it seems that the author thinks that sake is \\"beastly\\" due to its high potency and the strong effect it had on their friend Tony after consuming just a small amount of it.

Tip A involves weight lifting, but tip B does not involve weight lifting. Tip C involves running, but tip D does not involve running. Finally, tip E does not involve any exercise at all. David has to find out which tips are most useful for him.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would tip C make the cardiac muscle more efficient or not more efficient than tip D?  Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","output":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, tip C would make the cardiac muscle more efficient than tip D. This statement can be reasoned out with the help of the given hint. In the context of weight lifting (Tip A), it is highlighted that using skeletal muscle against a resisting force leads to an increase in its size and strength. This indicates that weight lifting gives a boost to the strength and size of the skeletal muscle. On the other hand, introducing the idea of running (Tip C), it is indicated that the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood during this type of exercise. Consequently, the usage of the cardiac muscle increases, thereby enhancing its strength and efficiency.  Let's compare this with Tip D, which does not involve running; thus, it can be assumed that Tip D may not place the same emphasis on heart activity as running does. There's no specific information given about the nature of Tip D's exercise, but the hint suggests that certain exercises improve the efficiency of specific muscles, in this case, running (cardio exercise) improves the efficiency of the cardiac muscle. Given this understanding, it can be concluded that Tip C (involving running) would potentially make the cardiac muscle more efficient, as it directly engages and promotes cardiac activity compared to Tip D, which does not involve running. Moreover, the 'use it or lose it' principle also supports this evaluation, since running (Tip C) evidently puts the cardiac muscle to use more vigorously than a non-running exercise (Tip D), making it stronger and more efficient over time.  However, for a thorough and personalized assessment, David should consider his personal training goals, current health status, and preferences, as these factors can significantly impact which exercise tips will be most beneficial for him. For the most accurate advice, it would be best to consult with his personal trainer or a physical health specialist."},{"instruction":"Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Figure below shows the role of the atmosphere in the water cycle.

Article: Drunken driving--sometimes called America's socially accepted form of murder--has become a national epidemic . Every hour of every day about three Americans on average are killed by drunken drivers, adding up to an incredible 250,000 over the past ten years. A drunken driver is usually defined as one with a 0.10 blood alcohol content or roughly three beers, glasses of wine or several glasses of whisky drunk within two hours. Heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the American manly image and judges were serious in most courts, but the drunken slaughter  has recently caused so many well-publicized tragedies, especially involving young children, that public opinion is no longer so tolerant. Twenty states have raised the legal drinking age to 21, reversing  a trend in the 1960s to reduce it to 18. After New Jersey lowered it to 18, the number of people killed by 18-20-year-old drivers more than doubled, so the state recently upped it back to 21. Reformers, however, fear raising the drinking age will have little effect unless accompanied by educational programs to help young people to develop \\"responsible attitudes\\" about drinking and teach them to resist peer pressure to drink. Though new laws have led to increased arrests and tests and, in many areas already, to a marked decline in accidents, some states are also punishing bars for serving customers too many drinks. A bar in Massachusetts was fined for serving six or more double brandies to a customer who \\"obviously drunk\\" and later drove off the road, killing a nine-year-old boy. As the accidents continue to occur daily in every state, some Americans are even beginning to speak well of the 13 years of national prohibition  of alcohol that began in 1919, what President Hoover called the \\"noble experiment\\". They forgot that legal prohibition didn't stop drinking, but encouraged political corruption and organized crime. As with the booming drug trade generally, there is no easy solution. Question: What can be inferred from the fact of the traffic accidents in New Jersey? Answer: Available options: (a). The legal drinking age should be raised. (b). Young drivers were usually bad. (c). Most drivers hoped to raise the legal drinking age. (d). Drivers should not be allowed to drink. Answer:","output":"(a).

He has been sent to spend time with his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy), who owns the ship, allegedly to straighten him out. Quentin introduces Carl to the rest of the crew: The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an American DJ who is the star of the station; Simon, a slightly awkward guy who dreams of finding romance; John, who does news and weather; Dave, who is extremely popular with the ladies; Angus, whom no one really likes but who runs a \\"crazy\\" comedy show; and Felicity, a lesbian who cooks for the boys.

A man - This indicates that there is an individual who is presumably human and male. 2. Lays in the sand - This suggests that the man is in a reclined position on a sandy surface, which could be a beach or a desert. 3.

It doesn't imply any specific action or interaction between the two entities, just their existence in the scenario. Given that the premise establishes the presence of a man who lays next to a cow in the sand, we can conclude that the hypothesis is accurate in stating there is a man and a cow. Their close proximity to each other indicates that they exist together within this context. However, it is worth noting that the hypothesis is rather simplistic and does not provide details about their actions or relationships.

He lives with his long-time housemaid, Hanna, who loyally cares for him but disapproves of his homosexuality. Whale has suffered a series of strokes that have left him fragile and tormented by memories: growing up as a poor outcast, his tragic World War I service, and the filming of The Bride of Frankenstein. Whale slips into his past, and indulges in his fantasies, reminiscing about gay pool parties and also sexually teasing an embarrassed, starstruck fan who comes to interview him. Whale battles depression, at times contemplating suicide, as he realizes his life, his attractiveness, and his health are slipping away. Whale befriends his young, handsome gardener and former Marine, Clayton Boone and the two begin a sometimes uneasy friendship as Boone poses for Whale's sketches. The two men bond while discussing their lives and dealing with Whale's spells of disorientation and weakness from the strokes. Boone, impressed with Whale's fame, watches The Bride of Frankenstein on TV as his friends mock the movie, his friendship with Whale, and Whale's intentions. Boone assures Whale that he is straight and receives assurance from Whale that there is no sexual interest, but Boone storms out when Whale graphically discusses his sexual history. Boone later returns with the agreement that no such \\"locker room\\" discussions occur again. Boone is invited to escort Whale to a party hosted by George Cukor for Princess Margaret.

A paper to be developed at the international congress of cognitive psychotherapy  in Gothenburg suggests a link between the attitudes of women abused  by their parents and early exposure to the wrong sort of fairy tales. It says girls who identified with Cinderella, Rapunzel  and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast were more likely to stay in destructive relationships as adults. The theory was developed by Susan Darker Smith, a psychotherapist at the University of Derby. She interviewed 67 female abuse survivors and found that 61 put up with severe abuse because they believed they could change their partners with patience, composition and love. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. Hardly any of the women in a control group, who had not experienced abuse, thought they could change their partners in this way.     The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. These women and men said they would leave a relationship rather than put up with abuse from a partner. Ms Darker Smith found the abused women were much more likely to identify with Cinderella and other _ female characters in fairytales, who were later rescued by a stranger prince or hero. Although most girls heard the stories, damage appeared to be done to those who adopted the characters as role models. \\"They believe if their love is strong enough they can change their parents' behaviors,\\" she said.\\" Overexposure in children to stories that emphasize the transformational qualities of love may make women believe they can change their partners.\\" For example, they might never have understood the obvious flaw in the story of Rapunzel, who remained locked in a high tower until rescued by a knight on a white horse, who broke the door down. \\"The question,\\" said Ms Darker Smith, \\"is why she did not break the door down herself.\\" The passage is especially intended for   _  .

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What archipelago has the highest sea cliffs in the United Kingdom. , can you please find it?   St Kilda (Scottish Gaelic: Hiort) is an isolated archipelago situated 64 kilometres (40 mi) west-northwest of North Uist, in the North Atlantic Ocean. It contains the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The largest island is Hirta, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom.  Three other islands (Dùn, Soay and Boreray) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting. The islands are administratively a part of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar local authority area.The origin of the name St Kilda is a matter of conjecture. The islands' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the First World War contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell's film The Edge of the World and an opera.Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There are known to be 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.The entire archipelago is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. It became one of Scotland's six World Heritage Sites in 1986, and is one of the few in the world to hold mixed status for both its natural and cultural qualities....

R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—\\"Radio Free Europe\\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors.

Here is a news article: NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A warrant has been issued for the arrest of the alleged serial bride from the Bronx, after she was a no-show in court Monday.      As CBS2’s Dick Brennan reported, Liana Barrientos’ attorney was in court Monday. But there was no sign of the accused serial polyandrist.      The woman who has allegedly skipped out on 10 marriages in an immigration scam also skipped Monday’s proceeding, and now is a runaway bride, Brennan reported. The warrant was issued in a result.      Barrientos, 39, was charged last month with filing with a false instrument, claiming she was married 10 times since 1999 without divorcing some of her previous husbands.      Prosecutors said at her arraignment last month that she has a record of marrying foreign nationals.      Barrientos married Mohamed Gerbil in November 1999, Ahmed Allam in November 2001, Habibur Rahman also in November 2001, Davit Koridze in February 2002, Duran Goktepe in March 2002, Aliaksandr Paharelau also in March 2002, Vakhtang Dzneladze in May 2002, Rashid Rajput in July 2002, Kakhaber Khorbaladze in August 2002, and Salle Keita in March 2010, prosecutors alleged.      “Seven of the men used the marriage to file for legal assistant resident status with immigration, and we found out when some of them were denied, they filed for divorce immediately and refiled for their immigration status with other marriages,” said Bronx Assistant District Attorney Jessica Lupo.      Prosecutors said Barrientos and the husbands filed for marriage licenses all over the New York metro area, including Westchester and Rockland counties and Long Island.      Prosecutors said Barrientos would make subtle changes to her name on the applications, and local authorities said towns take applicants at their word.      Court papers said Barrientos is currently married to four men, and some of the 10 were from so-called “red-flagged countries.” One of them has been kicked out after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.      “One of the men was put into removal by the Joint Terrorism Task Force investigation regarding making threatening statements towards the U.S. and was deported,” Lupo said.      That man was groom No. 8, Rashid Rajput, who was deported to Pakistan, prosecutors alleged.      After appearing in court last month on the charges stemming from the alleged multiple marriages, Barrientos was arrested for allegedly jumping the turnstile at a Bronx subway station.      Police alleged Barrientos and her 19-year-old niece, Tracy Barrientos, walked through the emergency gate at the subway station at East 149th Street and Grand Concourse, sources told CBS2.      Liana Barrientos was arraigned a second time on April 10 on a new charge of theft of service, and was released without any bail being set, CBS2 reported. Her niece’s case was dismissed.      Barrientos covered her face as she walked out of court in the Bronx that night for the second time in one day – alongside her niece. They said nothing except for a few obscenities.      Liana Barrientos swung at CBS2’s cameras as they walked, and both she and her niece spat at the camera, CBS2’s Sonia Rincon reported at the time. ||||| Julio Cortez/AP Liana Barrientos failed to show up on Monday to a Bronx Supreme Court hearing on felony charges related to her 10 marriages and zero divorces.      An accused serial bride has now left a judge hanging at the bench.      A bench warrant was issued for Liana Barrientos, 39, on Monday after she apparently got cold feet and blew off a hearing in Bronx Supreme Court.      An annoyed Judge Steven Barrett issued the warrant when Barrientos failed to show for the hearing to review felony charges against her for her repeated “I do” shenanigans, said a spokesman for the Bronx District Attorney’s Office.      Barrientos was busted in April on felony charges of marrying 10 men over an 11-year span without getting a single divorce.      Facebook Barrientos claimed in 2010 her marriage to Bronx man Salle Keita was her first and only marriage.      The now on-the-run bride is charged with filing a fradulent marriage license application and a bogus marriage license. Each count carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison.      The native of the Dominican Republic was exposed as a serial spouse after a probe of her most recent nuptials in March 2010, a complaint charges.      She swore the union to a Bronx man named Salle Keita was her first trip down the aisle, but authorities said Barrientos’ lies were as transparent as a wedding veil.      A detective found nine previous marriage licenses for Barrientos, including six that were from a six-month span.      “The defendant ... stated in sum and substance that she did marry Mr. Keita and that was her first and only marriage,” according to the complaint.      A Bronx detective uncovered nine previous marriage licenses for Barrientos, including a half-dozen issued in just six months, the court documents filed last November charged.      The first license was dated Nov. 5, 1999, to husband Mohamed Gerbril, and the last on Aug. 3, 2002, to groom Kakhaber Khorbaladze — her sixth marriage that year alone.      Anthony DelMundo/New York Daily News The judge issued a bench warrant for Barrientos, who lives in this Bronx building and failed to show in court.      The prior licenses were all filed in Long Island or Westchester County.      Authorities have yet to explain the motive for the multiple marriages. ||||| Liana Barrientos appears in Judge Steven Barrett's courtroom at the Bronx Supreme Court during an arraignment, Friday, April 10, 2015, in New York. Barrientos is accused of marrying 10 times over an 11-year period without ever getting a divorce. The Bronx district attorney's office says she faces two counts of felony fraud charges. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)      A woman accused of marrying 10 times in an immigration scam has reported to a Bronx court a day late after a warrant was issued for her arrest.      Liana Barrientos pleaded not guilty in April to lying on forms. She was scheduled for a court appearance Monday, but didn't show up. Prosecutors say she appeared Tuesday on her own. Bail was set at 10,000 and her next court date is June 8.      According to a criminal complaint, the 39-year-old woman obtained two of the marriage licenses in the Bronx. The others were obtained in Westchester County and on Long Island.      The complaint says she was arrested following a probe of her most recent marriage in 2010.

Against the Polish line the Red Army gathered its Northwest Front led by the young General Mikhail Tukhachevsky.

The Soviets at some crucial places outnumbered the Poles four-to-one.Tukhachevsky launched his offensive on 4 July, along the Smolensk-Brest-Litovsk axis, crossing the Auta and Berezina rivers.

For three days the outcome of the battle hung in the balance, but Soviet numerical superiority proved decisive and by 7 July Polish forces were in full retreat along the entire front.

Luckily, not knowing anything about this movie I was curious enough to tape it from TV. And then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending! But I'm glad I managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots, but also very chilling and even daring moments. Considering the production year 1969, the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows. Of course now it doesn't surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done. And it's not just because of the two George's actresses. The gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly, no wonder, And it certainly did hit me. Very effective. Also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action.

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The filter has small pores to catch pollutants - The filter will catch chlorine, heavy metals, and other chemicals - The filter allows water and mineral ions like fluoride to pass through - The water on the other side of the filter is much cleaner - The answer to this question is:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is:  - The water source, such as tap water, river water, or well water, is directed towards the filtration system.  To provide a detailed explanation of the entire process, including the missing first step: 1. The water source is directed towards the filtration system: The water to be purified comes from various sources such as tap water, river water, well water, or even sometimes collected rainwater. This water may contain impurities such as dirt, bacteria, chemicals, and heavy metals, making it unsuitable for drinking and other uses. So, the first step is to direct this water towards a filtration system designed to remove these contaminants. 2. The filter has small pores to catch pollutants: The filtration process typically uses a filter with small pores, which are designed to catch pollutants while allowing clean water to pass through. These filters can be made from various materials such as activated carbon, ceramic, sand, or other specialty materials depending on the type of contaminants that need to be removed from the water. 3. The filter will catch chlorine, heavy metals, and other chemicals: The water filtration systems are designed to remove a wide range of contaminants. Activated carbon filters, for example, are highly effective in trapping chlorine, chloramines, and other harmful chemicals that may have been added during the water treatment process or that leached into the water from the surrounding environment. Similarly, other types of filters, like reverse osmosis and ion exchange, are efficient in removing heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic, which can be harmful to human health. 4. The filter allows water and mineral ions like fluoride to pass through: A well-designed water filter will not only remove harmful substances but also allow essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, and fluoride to pass through. These minerals are crucial for maintaining good health, particularly for maintaining strong bones and teeth. It is important to note that some filtration systems may remove these beneficial minerals, requiring the addition of a remineralization stage to the filtration process. 5. The water on the other side of the filter is much cleaner: After passing through the filter, the water is significantly cleaner than when it first entered the system. The contaminants have been trapped in the filter media, resulting in cleaner, safer water suitable for drinking, cooking, and bathing. It should be noted that regular maintenance, including periodic replacement of filters, is necessary to ensure optimal performance and to prevent the build-up of contaminants that could eventually be released back into the water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick from: *The narrator is very laid back .. *The narrator is very dirty .. *The narrator does n't care .. *The narrator is a clean - freak .. Answer the following question: How would one describe the narrator looking at spots ?","output":"I am choosing \\"The narrator is a clean-freak.\\" Step-by-step justification on how one would describe the narrator looking at spots: 1. Initial impression: The narrator appears to be obsessive about cleanliness and order. The use of the words \\"disgusting\\" and \\"ew\\" highlight their distaste for any form of uncleanliness.  2. Assessing the repetition of spots: The narrator notices that every time they look at a different spot, the unclean areas are still there. This conveys the narrator's attention to detail and their frustration with the presence of imperfections in their environment. 3. Interpreting the narrator's thoughts: Since the narrator is a clean-freak, they would likely feel disgust, annoyance, and a strong urge to fix the problem immediately. They might be thinking about how to remove the spots or prevent their occurrence in the future to maintain a clean and spotless environment. 4. The narrator's determination to fix the problem: The narrator's assertive statement \\"Well, we will fix that\\" suggests that they are not only bothered by the spots but also proactive in addressing the issue. This supports the notion that the narrator is very particular about cleanliness and prefers to take action to maintain a high standard of hygiene. Based on these observations, one would describe the narrator looking at spots as someone who is highly attentive to their surroundings, experiences discomfort and displeasure at the sight of uncleanliness, and is proactive in addressing such issues to maintain a spotless environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In China, urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such as Nanjing and Beijing, also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. Despite the xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neo-Confucianism, China under the early Ming dynasty was not isolated. Foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world, particularly Japan, increased considerably. Chinese merchants explored all of the Indian Ocean, reaching East Africa with the treasure voyages of Zheng He. What caused urbanization to increase in China?","output":"Urbanization increased in China due to several factors, including population growth, the development of more complex divisions of labor, and the establishment of large urban centers that promoted private industry.  Population growth boosted the need for more urban areas to accommodate the increasing number of people. As the population expanded, it also led to a greater demand for resources, services, and economic opportunities, which were more readily available in urban centers. The division of labor grew more complex as well, which further contributed to urbanization. With increased specialization in various fields, such as agriculture, crafts, and trade, people began to rely more on each other for goods and services. This interdependence encouraged the establishment of urban centers, where people could exchange goods and services more efficiently. Additionally, the growth of large urban centers, such as Nanjing and Beijing, contributed to the development of private industries. Small-scale industries, specializing in goods like paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain, emerged as a result of the increasing demand for these products and facilitated the growth of urban centers. The proliferation of smaller urban centers with marketplaces also played a role in urbanization. These town markets mainly traded food and necessary manufactures, allowing people in the surrounding rural areas to access goods more easily. It is important to note that urbanization in China during this period was not driven solely by internal factors. The increase in foreign trade and contacts with the outside world, particularly Japan and the exploration of the Indian Ocean, contributed to the expansion of the urban centers. The treasure voyages of Zheng He to East Africa, for example, facilitated increased trade and the exchange of new ideas and technologies, which in turn stimulated urban growth. In summary, urbanization in China increased due to a combination of population growth, the development of more complex divisions of labor, the emergence of large urban centers with private industries, and the expansion of trade and exploration with foreign nations. These factors together created an environment that encouraged the growth of urban centers and their economic activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I laughed and told him, 'I never said so.' He asked me if I could play jazz and I said yes. He asked me if I could take solos and I said yes again.\\" That's how Tony Allen details his first ever encounter with Fela Kuti back in the mid-1960s, a meeting that was destined to trigger an explosive sonic collaboration that a few years later gave birth to the blistering Afrobeat sound -- arguably the most exciting period in the history of popular West African music. In the end, Allen says it was not the ongoing pay disputes but the increasingly volatile situation around Fela's political activism that led to","output":"his departure from the band in 1979. As Fela continued to use his music as a platform to challenge military dictatorship and government corruption in Nigeria, tensions between the band and the authorities escalated, culminating in a series of violent police raids, arrests, and a tragic attack on Fela's commune, known as the Kalakuta Republic. During this turbulent period, the atmosphere surrounding the band became increasingly hostile and dangerous. In addition to the police harassment, there were internal conflicts within the band, as some members struggled to cope with the escalating violence and constant scrutiny. Despite their phenomenal success and the groundbreaking nature of their music, it became clear that the band's future was in jeopardy. It was around this time that Tony Allen decided it was time to move on and forge his own career. He relocated to London, where he formed a new band called the Tony Allen Organization and began to collaborate with other artists, exploring different musical styles and genres. This marked a major turning point in his career, as he stepped out of Fela's shadow and began to establish himself as an acclaimed musician in his own right. In the years that followed, Allen continued to perform and record with various artists from around the world, further expanding his musical range and influence. He developed a unique fusion of Afrobeat, jazz, and electronic music, making him a sought-after contributor to numerous projects, and enabling him to work with notable musicians like Damon Albarn, Grace Jones, and Jeff Mills, among others. Simultaneously, Fela Kuti's political activism continued to intensify, as he became an increasingly prominent and outspoken figure in Nigeria's struggle for democracy. Despite serving multiple jail terms and facing ongoing persecution from the authorities, Fela remained a vital and influential voice for change in his country, inspiring a new generation of musicians and activists. Sadly, Fela passed away in 1997, leaving a profound musical and socio-political legacy that continues to resonate today. As for Tony Allen, his groundbreaking work in Afrobeat and his innovative collaborations with other artists ensured that his impact extended well beyond his time with Fela Kuti. He released a series of successful solo albums, and in 2006, he was invited to join the influential band The Good, the Bad & the Queen, with Damon Albarn, Paul Simonon, and Simon Tong – further testament to his enduring musical prowess. Allen's perseverance and immense talent enabled him to navigate the challenges and setbacks of his career, ultimately carving out a remarkable and enduring artistic legacy. His death in April 2020 was met with an outpouring of tributes from musicians and fans alike, highlighting the lasting influence of both his work with Fela Kuti and his rich, innovative contributions to the world of music. In conclusion, the most logical completion of the news story would be that Tony Allen's departure from Fela Kuti's band was primarily due to the volatile political situation and his desire to explore new musical horizons. His subsequent collaborations with numerous acclaimed musicians and his success as a solo artist attest to the lasting impact of his talent and creativity in the world of Afrobeat and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Bedazzled Movie plot: Stanley Moon (Moore) works in a Wimpy's restaurant and is infatuated with the waitress Margaret (Eleanor Bron). In despair he attempts suicide but is interrupted by the Devil, incarnated as George Spiggott (Cook). Spiggott is in a game with God, trying to be the first to gather 100 billion souls. If he achieves this first, he will be readmitted to Heaven. He is also busy with minor acts of vandalism and spite, helped by his staff of the seven deadly sins, notably Lust (Raquel Welch) and Envy (Barry Humphries). In return for his soul, Spiggott offers Stanley seven wishes. Stanley uses these trying to satisfy his love for Margaret, but Spiggott twists his words to frustrate him.  Stanley wishes to be more \\"articulate\\". George turns him into a talkative and pretentious intellectual with a strong Welsh accent. Margaret becomes an equally pretentious character, who enthusiastically agrees with all of Stanley's beliefs. Stanley stresses the importance of breaking free from one's social and moral constraints. When Stanley makes his move, however, she is horrified and starts screaming \\"rape\\". In this wish, Stanley is a \\"multi-millionaire\\" and Margaret is his \\"very physical\\" wife, but it turns out she is \\"very physical\\" with anyone except himÂ ... including George. In the third wish, Stanley is a rock star. However, his fame is short lived, and is usurped by a new band whose lead singer (George) sings flatly about his disinterest in anyone except himself. Margaret is a vapid and excitable groupie, as happy to admire one as the other. Stanley comments that he wishes he was \\"a fly on the wall\\" and George seizes on the opportunity to use up one of Stanley's wishes. They become flies on the wall in a morgue, where the inspector is showing Margaret various dead bodies, hoping that she will identify one as Stanley. George promises Stanley a wish where he has a quiet life in the countryside, with children, and Margaret making the anniversary dinner. It soon becomes apparent, however, that Margaret is actually George's wife....

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Some story lines just never get old -- star-crossed lovers, mistaken identity, lizard men from outer space.It's impossible to tiptoe around the main plot device of ABC’s “V” -- those aliens may be smart and purty but they're up to no good -- because it is, of course, a remake of the 1983 miniseries . And even if it weren't, writers Kenneth Johnson and Scott Peters have infused the pilot with as many sly sci-fi references as CG special effects.'V': The review of the television series \\"V\\" in Tuesday's Calendar section said the pilot was written by Kenneth Johnson and Scott Peters. As the writer of the original miniseries, Johnson was given a \\"story by\\" credit. Peters wrote the pilot. Also, the review referred to a character delivering a message in English, French and Egyptian. The language of Egypt is Arabic. —Which are pretty terrific, as is the pilot in general. Although fans of the first \\"V\\" may find themselves longing for Richard Herd's Supreme Commander in his jaunty jumpsuit and funky glasses, this \\"V\\" is not only sleeker, faster and more visually gripping, it promises to be thematically more compelling.Its opening sequence is a masterpiece of back-story compression. What appears to be a temblor startles a series of characters (and an almost flawless cast gathered from various sci-fi hits): Erica Evans (\\"Lost's\\" Elizabeth Mitchell) is an anti-terrorism agent with the FBI and divorced mother of Tyler (Logan Huffman), a basically decent but rebellious teen. Chad Decker (Scott Wolf from \\"Party of Five\\") is a newscaster who aspires to do more than \\"read the news\\"; Father Jack Landry (Joel Gretsch of \\"The 4400\\") is a young priest working among the homeless; and Ryan Nichols (Morris Chestnut) has just purchased the engagement ring he hopes to offer Valerie (Lourdes Benedicto).All of their plans are put on hold, however, when the quake turns out to be the arrival of an enormous spaceship, one of a matched set now hovering over all the major cities of the world. But even as the throngs prepare for the requisite scream-flee-and-die scene of mass hysteria, the underbelly of the craft becomes a screen and the lovely Anna (\\"Firefly's\\" Morena Baccarin) assures everyone in flawless English (and French and Egyptian) that \\"the Visitors\\" are here to offer technology in exchange for a few undisclosed but very renewable resources, and they come in peace.Undone by relief, Anna's Audrey Hepburn haircut and the promise that the Visitors can cure 65 of our diseases, humans, or at least New Yorkers, neglect to consider that they are a renewable resource themselves. Like the gullible little oysters in \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter,\\" they quickly embrace the \\"V's,\\" signing up for theme-park-like tours of the ship and, of course, merchandising like crazy.Fortunately, not everyone is convinced. Father Jack preaches caution only to be assured by his pastor that the pope is on board with the V's. Erica worries that \\"terrorist chatter,\\" though down among many groups, shows one major spike -- one cell seems to be arming itself pretty heavily, planning an attack, she assumes, when everyone is distracted by the aliens.A mysterious old friend is harassing Ryan to man up now that \\"they're here,\\" but it's Chad who gets the clue to the real nature of the V's. Anna asks him to be her first interviewer only to insist that he not ask anything that might cast her in a bad light. Being a good-looking, ambitious newscaster in a television show, Chad, of course, agrees.The original \\"V\\" drew obvious connections between the Visitors and the Nazis, and much has been made over the possible anti-Obama sentiment of this \\"V.\\" The instant adoration, the attractiveness and rhetorical skills of Anna, the idea that the Visitors will woo us with universal healthcare and then destroy us all seem a right-wingish take on the president's ascendancy.Perhaps that is the creators' intent, but most successful science fiction contains an element of, if not outright humor, then the absurd. That the human race will be enslaved not through brainwashing or firepower but adequate healthcare is pretty hilarious in a dark and almost possible way. And Anna and her crew seem to embody more of a Wall Street deregulated/Bernie Madoff mentality -- big returns for minimum investment. And we all know how that turns out.Just like we all know how these \\"we come in peace\\" alien invader tales turn out -- a resistance forms to slowly but surely reveal the Visitors for who and what they are. (Kids, lock up your guinea pigs!) Along the way, they find a sympathetic alien or two, which leads inevitably to interspecies breeding (lizard babies rock!) and the deconstruction of the essence of humanity.But just because something's a chestnut doesn't mean it isn't worth watching. There is a reason we tell the same story over and over again. Our collective longing for an effortless happy ending provided, whether by a political administration, a religious leader or a bunch of dulcet-toned aliens, is humanity's Achilles' heel.As the plot of \\"V\\" progresses, no doubt we will see the subtle strangulation of democracy by fascism -- already the press has been corrupted -- and that is a story that cannot be told often enough. Especially when it comes, like the V's, in such a fine, fun and attractive package. ||||| In fact, their planet is actually a lot nicer and cleaner than ours, because they spent all their time making scientific and technological advances instead of poisoning their delicate ecosystem with carbon emissions and spray tans and \\"Two and a Half Men\\" reruns.      Besides, how rude is it to show up at someone's galactic doorstep without inviting them to your solar system first? Of course they say they're in desperate need of our valuable resources, because it sounds a lot better than admitting that once they mastered quantum physics and nanotechnology and the like, they got bored and decided to tool around the universe, looking for fun ways to fuck shit up.      Aliens are so alienating. They're from planets in galaxies far, far away, for one thing. Most of us don't even like people from Nevada. And they're so smug about having figured out light-speed travel faster than we did. Who wants friends who make you feel bad about yourself all the time? I think poor, lonely George Clooney knows the answer to that one.      But don't confront them -- if decades of sci-fi movies have taught us anything, it's that aliens respond to direct confrontation by sucking our brains out of our ears. Just smile and say, \\"It was so nice of you to drop by! Please, take a few dozen silos of partially hydrogenated soybean oil when you go – we'll never finish them by ourselves.\\"      We are of peace      With all of that preening and posturing and spreading terror throughout the universe that aliens do, it's incredible that they come from a world of serious scholars and scientists. Did they do all the hard work centuries ago, only to devolve into a land of idle troublemakers and slithering intergalactic playboys? This is why I'm all worked up over ABC's \\"V\\" (premieres 8 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 3). Its aliens not only swoop down and hover over our major metropolises, scaring the living daylights out of us with their dulcet newscaster tones and their big, honest brown eyes, but they claim they can share the cure to some of our deadliest diseases, clean up our polluted planet, make our corn dogs taste better and keep outdoor malls from installing those hideous statues of ugly, badly dressed children frolicking happily in water fountains or taking up valuable bench space.      Hold on a minute. These aliens can cure cancer, but they can't hide their lizardy faces better than that? I've seen Nixon masks more convincing than the one that alien is wearing in the trailer. These visitors (as they call themselves) have been here for years, but we didn't even know about them? What have they been waiting for? Why didn't they just take over Oprah and control our minds through her a long time ago?      \\"They've been printing fake docs -- passports, IDs -- best fakes I've ever seen,\\" says Erica Evans (Elizabeth Mitchell from \\"Lost\\") in a scene from the pilot (and featured in the trailer above). So the aliens want to cause \\"worldwide instability\\" in a secret plot aimed at the \\"extermination of every man, woman and child on the face of this Earth\\"… by printing fake IDs? Why don't they just suck all of our brains out of our ears right now and call it a day? Then tomorrow they can wake up, snort up several tons of crystal meth, and spend the afternoon at Disneyland without waiting in any lines.      But does anyone care if \\"V\\" is believable or not? No way. We just want these aliens to be a little bit different than the last imaginary aliens we met. We want that moment in the first episode where Anna (Morena Baccarin), the TV spokesmodel of the alien invaders, instructs news pretty boy Chad Decker (Scott Wolf) before an interview, \\"Just be sure not to ask anything that would paint us in a negative light.\\" We want to relive that moment, which is creepy and suspenseful, over and over again.      What we don't want, and what we get, is talk of \\"building a resistance.\\" Building a resistance is tiresome and pointless, it's ground that's been thoroughly trampled by \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" and \\"Terminator\\" and \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" and \\"Star Wars,\\" and, hell, \\"Reds.\\" Ragtag bands of grass-roots rebels gathering in secret warehouses to plan how to take down a much larger and more powerful foe? If Han Solo isn't getting called a scruffy-looking nerf herder, I want no part of it.      You've heard by now about \\"V's\\" unnerving tendency to borrow phrases from the Obama campaign to hint at the skin-deep emptiness of the aliens' catchphrases. And yes, like Obama, the \\"visitors\\" are fine-looking and poised and friendly and just too good to be true. They talk about the \\"V Ambassador Program\\" and other populist tricks to lure the masses into drinking their poisonous alien Kool-Aid. The show even premieres on the anniversary of President Obama's election, and ABC previously planned to skywrite big red Vs over the nation's major landmarks as a publicity stunt, all of which might lead to paranoid suspicions that ABC itself is run by sneaky but well-groomed aliens.      The original 1984 TV miniseries \\"V\\" concerned fascism, and we might just be willing to encounter these big, obvious parallels as some form of cultural commentary, if they were more intelligently laced into the series. Sure, it's a nice touch, having Erica's teenage son, Tyler (Logan Huffman), all starry-eyed over the hot alien babes with their unconditional positive regard and their promises that Tyler can finally be a part of something bigger and more exciting than the latest version of \\"Grand Theft Auto.\\" Yes, they are frightfully fake and shiny, with their flashy ships and their relentlessly optimistic Scientology-speak. It's not hard to understand why Tyler or any teenager might find the Vs appealing, even if his scenes have all of the subtlety of a poorly scripted teen slasher flick. \\"Damn, she's hot!\\" Tyler gushes when Anna appears on TV. \\"I know, right?\\" replies his even-less-interesting friend.      Later, when the two kids board one of the aliens' transports for a tour of the mothership hovering above New York City, they gush to each other, \\"Dude, this is incredible, man! It's like an amusement park!\\" And who greets them at the door? A super-hot mega-babe alien with blond flat-ironed hair and a big lip-glossy mouth named Lisa. Hokey? Hokier than a chimpanzee dressed up as Wayne Newton.      Then Chad, the Matt Lauer of \\"V,\\" asks Anna, \\"Is there such a thing as an ugly visitor?\\" Bwahaha! We get it. This whole three ring circus is supposed to be just like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, only with oozing lizard people where the giant smiling Elmo float should be.      But as transfixing as it might be to witness how easily we yield our planetary panties to an alien suitor, as awful as it might be to grapple with a nefarious force that pretends it just dropped by to bring us vaccines and borrow a little uranium before it's on its merry way, \\"V\\" doesn't linger for very long in this provocative territory. By the end of the pilot, we're already flipping through the best fake IDs Evans has ever seen and attending secret resistance meetings where surprise-guest reptilian-faced demons are getting their Old Man McGregor masks ripped off, \\"Scooby Doo\\"-style. Suddenly this might as well be \\"Fringe\\" or \\"Warehouse 13\\" or \\"The X-Files\\" or \\"Eureka\\" or any one of hundreds of shows that involve FBI agents and international espionage and terrorist thugs and secret plots to take over the universe.      Come on, now. Isn't there a new way to handle the alien invasion story? Isn't there something a little more subtle and hauntingly evil out there than sneaky reptiles with really good publicists?      Curb sitters      OK, there is Larry David of \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" (10 p.m. Sundays on HBO). The writers' room of \\"Curb\\" may be the one place in Hollywood where they're determined to tackle the alien invasion plot in a brand new way.      You have to admire their patience, too. Instead of having Larry rip off his Larry David mask in the first few episodes of the show's seventh season, revealing a hideous, oozing lizard-faced alien underneath, they're making Larry act just like a nasty alien would, shaking and pointing and wrestling Rosie O'Donnell to the floor in the middle of a crowded restaurant.      When Larry calls his new girlfriend \\"Denise Handicapped\\" or asks if a couple's adopted Chinese daughter is better at using chopsticks than most toddlers, it's not funny because it's not supposed to be funny. It's supposed to be creepy and disturbing. It's supposed to be alienating. Like an alien. Get it?      If the writers of \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" wanted the show to be funny, of course, they'd have gotten Jason Alexander into the mix from the start, because George Costanza was much funnier and more believable as Larry David than Larry David has ever been. George can ask rude questions and treat selfishness as a matter of principle and exalt his personal preferences to the status of widely held standards shared only by sane, thoughtful, right-thinking individuals, and it works, because Jason Alexander whispers and mumbles and states things matter-of-factly and, well, he's a great comedic actor.      Larry David, as oddly lovable as he is, is terrible at playing Larry David. He always looks nervous, like he's being watched. He shouts his way through every scene, and it's only gotten worse lately. Did you see last week's episode, where he pretended to be splashing himself every time he peed? He looked like he was wrestling an alligator.      And we're supposed to think it's hysterical and daring when Larry David rolls a handicapped woman into a closet and shuts the door? We're supposed to laugh uproariously as two women in wheelchairs chase Larry around a big house at a fancy party? We're supposed to chuckle when Larry confronts Christian Slater for hogging all the caviar at a party, a lame rehash of the classic \\"Seinfeld\\" episode where George is caught double-dipping his chip? We're expected to care that Larry doesn't like the sight of men in shorts? Obviously this isn't a comedy, not even close. Don't be so naive!      Clearly the lack of laughs doesn't come from the fact that \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" is offensive. Far from it. If this show were a comedy -- which it's not -- it would be un-p.c. humor for very, very out of touch people who haven't noticed that all humor is un-p.c. now. Merely being un-p.c. by rolling out a steady flow of Katrina survivors and flabby-gutted assistants for Larry to insult is like building an entire show around a goofy dad, a meddling mother-in-law and a mom who always burns the pot roast. You could do it in 1985, but you can't do it now. It's like creating a drama series about building a secret resistance to fight off the invading aliens.      But if Larry David is an alien whose plan to exterminate every man, woman and child on the face of the earth involves insulting Chinese adoptees and handicapped women? Well, that's just brilliant.      I just can't wait until he rips off his mask! That is going to be so cool. What do you think he'll do first, eat Jerry Seinfeld's face off, or suck Julia Louis-Dreyfus' brains out of her ears? ||||| TV Marks Obama Anniversary with Documentaries, Aliens      It's Election Day in America. One election day ago, Barack Obama was elected President of the United States, and TV is marking the anniversary with two earnest documentaries—and an alien invasion.      I exaggerate, but only a little. ABC's V, which debuts tonight, may not be intended as an Obama allegory, but it has enough parallels with the issues, concerns and paranoid fantasies of today's politics that they were either included to pique interest, or created accidentally by the typing of a million monkeys who had never seen cable news.      First the earnest documentaries. Showtime's Poliwood, directed by Barry Levinson, which aired last night, possibly deserves credit for passionately trying to make the thankless argument that Hollywood celebrities do so have the right to inject themselves into politics. The film, which largely tracked celebrity efforts in the 2008 election, had a reasonable enough premise: that celebs interested in politics are no more or less automatically vapid than plenty of others who get to stick their oars in (donors, other politicians, many pundits), but ultimately a film defending the fairly privileged from the oppressive experience of people saying snarky things about them has to be exceptional to be compelling, and Poliwood wasn't.      HBO's By the People: The Election of Barack Obama, airing tonight, is better made and more engrossing, mainly because it had extensive access to an actual political campaign. Filmmakers Amy Rice and Alicia Sams started shooting film in 2006 with an Illinois Senator who had made a popular speech at a convention. As it progresses into the primaries, the filmmakers got a probably unmatched amount of time with Obama's family—particularly daughters Sasha and Malia, who have since been in the press only sparingly—and with his campaign operation, which provides the film's real meat and emotional impact. Spending late nights with exhausted volunteers who gave themselves to the campaign—and watching them as they gradually discover they actually have a chance to win—the film puts a human face on an often-maligned job.      I watched By the People at a screening over the summer, and while I was impressed with the access and sometimes moved, I was also—and I say this as somebody who voted for Obama—a little unnerved by the general feeling of self-congratulation in the film. (The title is one hint.) As the film moves into the general election, the candidate and the mechanics of his campaign move into the distance (a result, probably, of the access drying up in the national stage of the campaign), and the film starts to take a hagiographic tone, as if honoring its viewers one last time for electing Obama President.      In one sense I get it: the movie was made in the spirit of Nov. 5, 2008, the generalized, post=election good feeling and best wishes for the Obamas, plus happiness that—politics aside—a country with a history of race troubles had elected an African American president. But you can't really put \\"politics aside\\" when discussing the election of a President. And seeing the film this summer—after the realities of governing a country full of contention had settled in—the film already seemed anachronistic.      Which brings us to V. ABC's miniseries / maybe-an-actual-series (it airs four episodes in the fall, then returns in winter) is a remake of the NBC mini from the 1980s, about a race of lizard-like aliens who arrive on Earth preaching friendship, their real faces, and intentions, masked. The original was an allegory of Nazi Germany and the rise of Hitler, but one that was pretty hard to take seriously that way; I suspect most fans remember it more for the alien unmaskings and the creepy human-alien baby and we're probably all better off for that.      The new V, like the original, is first and foremost a big sci-fi entertainment, and as that it's promising, though not great out of the box. Like ABCs FlashForward, it's a kind of attempt at making Lost's lightning strike twice; like FlashForward, it's a conspiracy story starting with a Day When Everything Changes.      In this case, the aliens, led by hot lizard lady Morena Baccarin (Firefly), appear over Earth's cities, Independence Day style (the show makes note of the similarity), saying they're using Earth as a refueling stop: they need to borrow a cup of abundant minerals, and they'll be on their way, leaving some nifty technology as a thank-you gift. Humanity immediately cheers, because evidently this V takes place on an alternate Earth where no one has ever seen an alien-invasion movie. It's the old To Serve Man ploy again, and the question becomes whether humanity will figure out what the aliens are up to or be seduced by their good looks and goodies.      Unlike FlashForward, V benefits from some stronger performances (like Elizabeth Mitchell in the de rigeur FBI-agent role, and Scott Wolf, reprising his empathetic-weasel type from The Nine, playing a TV journalist the aliens recruit as a useful idiot). It also has flashes of humor and an emotional grounding that FlashForward could have used at the start. Even if you never saw the original, you'll probably guess the twists ABC asked me not to reveal before they occur, but the show's intriguing enough that I'll at least commit to the first four episodes before the break.      It's with the parallels to contemporary politics that things start to get interesting, and/or weird. The aliens are attractive and seductive: OK, we've seen that plenty of times before. They inspire worldwide acclaim on little evidence, while only a few characters wonder if everyone else is being taken in by their charisma; overtones of the McCain Celebrity ad, but you could apply that to a lot of situations. There's an aspect about disguised aliens living among us: well, that's been a staple of many series since 9/11, notably Battlestar Galactica.      Then there's the talk of the aliens bringing humanity \\"hope.\\" OK, starting to sound a little more specific. They consolidate their appeal by reaching out to the youth. The alien leader tells humanity: \\"Embracing change is never easy. But the reward for doing so can be far greater than everything you can imagine.\\" The reward: among other technologies, the aliens begin setting up clinics to offer miracle cures, for free. Remarks Wolf's journalist: \\"You're talking about universal health care!\\"      In summary: attractive newcomers + adulation + hidden identity + hope & change + manipulation of the media + brainwashing your kids + universal health care = the destruction of humanity by alien fascists. I checked the production notes to make sure Glenn Beck was not credited as the screenwriter, and that the aliens are not secretly from Kenya.      I'm not sure if V intends these parallels to be a running theme of the series, or if they were just played up in the pilot to get attention from writeups like this one. (Also, some of them may ring familiar because certain of Obama's critics have been throwing around the same kind of fascism comparisons that were in the original V.) Either way—again, speaking as an Obama voter—I have a hard time getting particularly worked up over the B-movie politics of V. They're not always entirely coherent, either. More than once V makes a point which is delivered thus by one of the lead characters, a Catholic priest: \\"Gratitude can morph into worship. Or worse: devotion.\\" Um, isn't worship of aliens actually worse than devotion? Especially to a priest?      Like the ticking-bomb ultraviolence of 24, the paranoia of V is probably, more than anything, a convention of the genre: in this case, the aliens-among-us thriller. And if I'm going to get wild-ass conspiracies in the form of entertainment, better I get them from a primetime show about hot aliens than from cable news. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"\\"V\\" is a television series about aliens arriving on Earth, pretending to be friendly but secretly having other plans.

A Predator watches a shootout between the police and Colombians, observing as Lieutenant Michael R. Harrigan charges into the firefight to rescue two wounded officers and drive the Colombians back into their hideout. While the police wait for a federal task force, the Predator crashes through a skylight and assaults the Colombians. Against orders, Harrigan and his police detectives Leona Cantrell and Danny Archuleta enter the hideout. They find the Colombians have been slaughtered. Harrigan pursues the crazed gang leader onto the roof and shoots him. He catches a glimpse of the camouflaged Predator but dismisses it as an effect of the heat and his acrophobia. At the station, Harrigan is reprimanded by his superiors for his disobedience. He is introduced to Special Agent Peter Keyes, leader of the task force investigating the cartels, and Detective Jerry Lambert, the newest member of Harrigan's team.

News article: 'After a kill, some pray, some smoke': the man who shot the trophy hunters In 1909, in British east Africa, now known as Kenya, the colonial government found a way of making a lot of money from poachers. Tourist hunters had to pay a licensing fee in return for killing (and claiming as their own) the animals that plentifully roamed there. At the time, £50 would legally entitle you to kill two buffalo, two hippos, 22 zebras, one eland, six oryxes, four waterbucks, one greater kudu, four lesser kudus, 10 topis, 26 hartebeests, 229 other antelope and, if one wanted more, 84 colobus monkeys. Under the licensing laws, trophy hunters could also kill as many leopards and lions as they could manage. The cats encroached on farms and killed livestock. As a consequence, they were classified as ‘vermin’. Related: Finger on the trigger: trophy-hunters in Africa – in pictures Hunters back then would have been aristocrats, the landed gentry. “Today’s hunters,” says the British photographer David Chancellor, “are hedge fund managers, doctors, attorneys, their wives and children.” Over the last seven years, Chancellor has photographed modern trophy hunters, infiltrating the industry that caters for people like Walter Palmer, the dentist from Minnesota who, on 1 July 2015, wounded Cecil the lion with an arrow from a crossbow, tracked him for 40 hours then killed him with a rifle. “I expected to take 21st-century portraits of people who would seem like 19th-century figures,” Chancellor says. “But they’re not. They’re the kind of normal people you hear on the news now.” The series, he admits, has been profoundly disturbing. “I’ve photographed people who have hunted animals in the most callous way who are heart surgeons,” says Chancellor. “I photographed one man, an extraordinarily prolific hunter, who ran a pet cemetery business back home.” What drives them, I ask, to exert such power over something so free? “It’s impossible to say,” says Chancellor. “It’s such a divergent cross-section: Some are meek-mouthed, some are forthright. Some will cry when they’ve shot an animal, some will pray. Some will drink beer or smoke a cigar. The only thing they have in common is the complete focus on what they’re doing. They don’t doubt it at all.” Chancellor, who divides his time between Cape Town and London, took long journeys across South Africa for an earlier project on HIV. He became intrigued by the levels of privacy around the reserves beyond the cities. “You would just see miles and miles of high fences – I wanted to know what was going on in there,” he says. He remembers flying across the country, looking down from the window and seeing men walking across the plains dressed in head-to-toe camouflage. “I wanted to discover best practice – the people who do this legally. As soon as I started looking into it, I was knocked over by the huge amount of revenue this industry makes.” If the hunting industry began in the British colony of Kenya, it spread quickly, to Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia and, to a lesser extent, Zambia, Mozambique and Swaziland. Trophy hunting now occurs in 23 Sub-Saharan African countries. Where once landowners would make their money from farming livestock, many now act as wardens for the ‘big game’ that roam their land. Foreign hunters are invited to kill such animals in exchange for a cut of the revenue. And there are hordes of willing clients. In America, prospective hunters can attend ‘safari’ training schools, says Chancellor, where they practice shooting on remote-controlled elephants, leopards and lions. “Many of the people who come to hunt have a place ready for their trophies in their homes, long before they even arrive in Africa,” he says. “They have expectations, and they must be met by the local industry.” Chancellor recalls standing with an American huntress as she berated a local landowner. “You promised on your website that we’d see all the big five in a day, and we haven’t seen a lion. I want my money back,” she said. In general, though, he says “the huntresses were different to the male hunters. They would often spend a lot more time with the animals, both before and after the kill”. Chancellor was also struck by how caring many of the professional wardens were about the animals whose lives they bartered for cash. “I think some difficult clients put them in very difficult positions, but I didn’t find a group of guys slaughtering animals left and right,” he says. “Many of them had a very powerful relationship with their environment.” Chancellor has already gained notable success with the series, including the 2010 Taylor Wessing photographic portrait prize for the photograph Huntress with Buck. The portrait, which remains one of the most striking in the series, shows a 14-year-old girl from Alabama – her name is Josie Slaughter – on her first hunting trip to South Africa. With the bush behind her and the sky turning from day to dusk, Josie holds the deer’s antler as his body hangs limply over her horse’s neck. “There was a contrast between the tranquillity of the location and Josie’s beauty and the dead buck – that was what I wanted to explore,” Chancellor says. “This intricate and complex relationship between man and animals, and how both struggle to adapt to their changing environment.” It is, he says, an ongoing project, for the issue is only becoming more pressing.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Ascension Island is an isolated volcanic island in the equatorial waters of the South Atlantic Ocean, around from the coast of Africa and from the coast of Brazil, which is roughly midway between the horn of South America and Africa. It is governed as part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, of which the main island, Saint Helena, is around to the southeast. The territory also includes the sparsely populated Tristan da Cunha archipelago, some to the south, about halfway to the Antarctic Circle.  - Tristan da Cunha, colloquially Tristan, is the name of both a remote group of volcanic islands in the south Atlantic Ocean and the main island of that group. It is the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, lying from the nearest inhabited land, Saint Helena, and from the nearest continental land, South Africa. It is from South America. The territory consists of the main island, named Tristan da Cunha, which has a northsouth length of and an area of , along with the smaller, uninhabited Nightingale Islands and the wildlife reserves of Inaccessible and Gough islands. As of January 2017, the main island has 262 permanent inhabitants. Meanwhile, the other islands are uninhabited, except for the personnel of a weather station on Gough Island.  - Queen Mary 's Peak is the summit of the island of Tristan da Cunha , in the South Atlantic Ocean . It has an elevation of 2,062 metres ( 6,765 ft ) above sea level . It is named after Mary of Teck , the Queen consort of King George V. It is the highest point of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena , Ascension and Tristan da Cunha . The mountain is the peak of the massive shield volcano which forms the island . A 300 m ( 1,000 ft ) wide summit crater caps the peak , and it contains a heart - shaped crater lake . This lake is normally frozen during the winter , and the upper slopes of the volcano are covered in snow . The only recorded historical eruption occurred in 1961 from a vent on the north shore of the island . The island community had to be evacuated . Queen Mary 's Peak was used by sailors on the route from Europe to the Indian Ocean and beyond as a navigational aid . In the 17th century the East India Company instructed captains to sail via Tristan . In 2004 , Ellen MacArthur sighted the Peak on her record - breaking circumnavigation of the world .  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Mary of Teck (Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes; 26 May 1867  24 March 1953) was Queen of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions and Empress of India as the wife of King-Emperor George V.  - Saint Helena is a volcanic tropical island in the South Atlantic Ocean, east of Rio de Janeiro and west of the Cunene River, which marks the border between Namibia and Angola in southwestern Africa. It is part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. Saint Helena measures about and has a population of 4,534 (2016 census). It was named after Saint Helena of Constantinople.  - A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch.  - Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha is a British Overseas Territory located in the South Atlantic and consisting of the island of Saint Helena, Ascension Island and the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha.   - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\".  - Bulgaria (tr. '), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (tr. '), is a country in southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. With a territory of , Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Brunei, officially the Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace (Jawi: ), is a sovereign state located on the north coast of the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. Apart from its coastline with the South China Sea, the country is completely surrounded by the state of Sarawak, Malaysia. It is separated into two parts by the Sarawak district of Limbang. Brunei is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo; the remainder of the island's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and Indonesia. Brunei's population was 408,786 in July 2012.  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho.

The increased volcanic activity and cooling of magma under the oceans can also lead to the formation of new underwater landforms and affect the overall composition and distribution of minerals in the Earth's crust."},{"instruction":"Question: Ben studied allergies ever since he experienced an allergic reaction to pollen.

His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.The Dominicans established themselves in Xocolo on the shore of Lake Izabal in the mid-16th century. Xocolo became infamous among the Dominican missionaries for the practice of witchcraft by its inhabitants. By 1574 it was the most important staging post for European expeditions into the interior, and it remained important in that role until as late as 1630, although it was abandoned in 1631.In 1598 Alfonso Criado de Castilla became governor of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Owing to the poor state of Puerto de Caballos on the Honduran coast and its exposure to repeated pirate raids he sent a pilot to scout Lake Izabal.

A: earn more money  B: find a new job  C: get a promotion at work Answer:","output":"According to the context provided, Jan quit their job because it was both underpaid and tedious. This implies that the reason behind their decision was dissatisfaction with the salary they were receiving, as well as the monotonous nature of the tasks involved in their job. The context doesn't specifically mention that Jan wants to earn more money, find a new job, or get a promotion at work. However, we can infer their intentions and possibilities from the situation. Option A: Earn more money - This option is partially true since Jan quit their job due to being underpaid, which means they might be seeking a better-paying job to resolve this issue. However, this option doesn't address the aspect of their job being tedious. Option B: Find a new job - This option can be considered the best answer to the question according to the context. Since Jan quit their job due to it being both underpaid and tedious, it implies that they are possibly looking for a new job which offers a better salary and is also more engaging and less monotonous.

Write a summary based on this article: Melissa Gilbert (Photo: Courtesy of Melissa Gilbert)      WASHINGTON — Actress Melissa Gilbert, best known for her portrayal of Laura Ingalls Wilder on NBC’s “Little House on the Prairie” in the 1970s and ‘80s, said Monday she will run for Congress in Michigan’s 8th District -- though her campaign will have to tamp down questions about a tax bill.      Gilbert, who lives in Livingston County with her husband, actor Timothy Busfield, is running as a Democrat in a district that has been a Republican stronghold in recent elections: U.S. Rep. Mike Bishop, R-Rochester, won the race to replace former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Howell, last year, beating Democrat Eric Schertzing, 54%-42%.      But someone with Gilbert's celebrity could make a splash, especially when it comes to raising funds for her campaign. Bishop was recently added to the Republican's Patriot Program, an effort to help potentially vulnerable incumbents maintain their seats in Congress, though it's unclear why he was marked for such aid.      “I'm running for Congress to make life a little easier for all the families who feel they have fallen through the cracks in today's economy,” Gilbert said in a statement released on her website, www.gilbertformichigan.com. “I believe building a new economy is a team effort, and we need to bring fresh voices to the table to get the job done.”      Her hopes could also be helped in a presidential year when Democratic turnout tends to be higher. President Barack Obama won the district 52%-46% in 2008, though Republican nominee Mitt Romney outperformed the incumbent Democrat 51%-48% in 2012.      Gilbert, 51, has not held political office before but was president of the Screen Actors Guild from 2001 to 2005, serving two terms. An actress and director, she is a native of California and moved to Howell in 2013 after marrying Busfield, who is a native of East Lansing.      There are questions she will have to address, however. In June, the Daily Press & Argus in Livingston County reported that the IRS filed a lien against Gilbert, alleging she owes more than 360,000 in back taxes, a point that Michigan Republicans were quick to point out as she announced her campaign.      Bishop's campaign spokesman Stu Sandler sent out a statement saying Gilbert \\"can afford to have a stylist for her dog, but cannot pay her taxes. Her values are out of whack with the district.”      “The truth is I got caught in a perfect storm of financial difficulty, which is why I initiated a conversation with the IRS, told them I was having trouble and together we set up a payment plan,\\" Gilbert said in a statement to the Free Press. Asked for additional details about the tax bill, a campaign spokesman declined, saying, \\"The statement is the statement.\\"      Michigan's 8th Congressional District stretches east of Lansing through Ingham and Livingston counties and into northern Oakland County.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Burke was born in Dublin, Ireland. His mother Mary nee Nagle (c. 1702-1770) was a Roman Catholic who hailed from a declasse County Cork family (and a cousin of Nano Nagle), whereas his father, a successful solicitor, Richard (died 1761), was a member of the Church of Ireland; it remains unclear whether this is the same Richard Burke who converted from Catholicism. The Burke dynasty descends from an Anglo-Norman knight surnamed de Burgh (Latinised as de Burgo) who arrived in Ireland in 1185 following Henry II of England's 1171 invasion of Ireland and is among the chief \\"Gall\\" families that assimilated into Gaelic society, becoming \\"more Irish than the Irish themselves\\". Burke adhered to his father's faith and remained a practising Anglican throughout his life, unlike his sister Juliana who was brought up as and remained a Roman Catholic. In 1774, Burke's Speech to the Electors at Bristol at the Conclusion of the Poll was noted for its defence of the principles of representative government against the notion that elected officials should merely be delegates:  ... it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.  Political scientist Hanna Pitkin points out that Burke linked the interest of the district with the proper behaviour of its elected official, explaining, \\"Burke conceives of broad, relatively fixed interest, few in number and clearly defined, of which any group or locality has just one. These interests are largely economic or associated with particular localities whose livelihood they characterize, in his over-all prosperity they involve.\\"  Burke was a leading sceptic with respect to democracy. While admitting that theoretically, in some cases it might be desirable, he insisted a democratic government in Britain in his day would not only be inept, but also oppressive. He opposed democracy for three basic reasons. First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people. Second, he thought that if they had the vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property. Third, Burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over unpopular minorities, who needed the protection of the upper classes. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, there are other interesting aspects in the article. One of them is about Burke's views on representative government: \\"It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living.\\" This quote shows how Burke believed that elected officials should balance the interests and opinions of their constituents with their own judgment and principles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened.  But I can use this background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

It is the city in the U.S. and the in Texas. It is the fastest growing city in the United States and the second most populated capital city after Phoenix, Arizona. As of the U.S. Census Bureau's July 1, 2015 estimate, Austin has a population of 931,830. Located in in the foothills of Texas Hill Country, the city is home to numerous lakes, rivers, and waterways including Lady Bird Lake, Barton Springs, McKinney Falls, the Colorado River, Lake Travis, and Lake Walter E. Long. It is the cultural and economic center of the metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 2,064,149 as of June 1, 2016.  - The Texas Hill Country is a 25-county region of Central Texas and South Texas featuring karst topography and tall rugged hills consisting of thin layers of soil atop limestone or granite. It also includes the Llano Uplift and the second largest granite dome in the United States, Enchanted Rock. The Hill Country reaches into portions of the two major metropolitan areas, especially in San Antonio's northern suburbs and the western half of Travis County, ending southwest of Downtown Austin. The region is the eastern portion of the Edwards Plateau and is bound by the Balcones Fault on the east and the Llano Uplift to the west and north. The terrain is punctuated by a large number of limestone or granite rocks and boulders and a thin layer of topsoil, which makes the region very dry and prone to flash flooding. The Texas Hill Country is also home to several native types of vegetation, such as various yucca, prickly pear cactus, cedar scrub, and the dry Southwestern tree known as the Texas live oak.  - Breaking Benjamin is an American rock band from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, founded in 1999 by lead singer and guitarist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel.

He assumed the role of John Laurens/Philip Hamilton in the Broadway production of \\"Hamilton\\" on November 22, 2016.  - Lady Bird Lake (formerly Town Lake) is a reservoir on the Colorado River in Downtown Austin, Texas, in the United States. It was created in 1960 by the construction of Longhorn Dam and is owned and operated by the City of Austin in cooperation with the Lower Colorado River Authority. The surface area of the lake is , and it is used primarily for flood control and recreation. Located on the lake's shoreline are various hotels and apartments, as well as the Auditorium Shores park and the Austin Hike and Bike Trail. It is named, after former First and Second Lady of the United States Lady Bird Johnson, wife of President Lyndon B. Johnson.   - Hollywood Records, Inc. is an American record label of the Disney Music Group. The label focuses in pop, rock, alternative, hip hop, and country genres, as well as specializing in mature recordings not suitable for the flagship Walt Disney Records label. Founded in 1989, its current roster includes artists such as Jordan Fisher, Zella Day, Demi Lovato, Queen, Zendaya, Ocean Park Standoff, Dreamers, Bea Miller, Martina Stoessel, Breaking Benjamin, Jorge Blanco, Sabrina Carpenter, R5, The Young Wild, Olivia Holt, Sofia Carson, Forever in Your Mind, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Boy Epic, and Joywave. The label also releases Marvel Studios's soundtrack and compilation albums in conjunction with Marvel Music.  - \\"Built specifically to contain floodwaters\\" in a flash-flood prone region, Lake Travis is a reservoir on the Colorado River in central Texas in the United States. The reservoir was formed in 1942 by the construction of Mansfield Dam on the western edge of Austin, Texas by the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA). Highlighting its purpose, even during its construction -- after a severe flood in July 1938 -- the height of the dam was raised to add storage capacity for floodwaters.

You can also clone the project with Git by running:       git clone git://github.com/petewarden/iPhoneTracker      FAQ      Is there a Windows version?      How does the application work?      How can I examine the data without running the application?      Does this application share the information with anyone?      What can I do to remove this data?      Why is Apple collecting this information?      Is Apple storing this information elsewhere?      What’s so bad about this?      Why did you open-source this code, won’t that make the problem worse?      Why are some points in places I’ve never visited?      How was it discovered?      What’s your relationship with Apple?      You say no data is shared, but why do I see the web accessed when I run the app?      How can I choose which device's location data will be shown?      What does the size and color of the circles represent?      Is there a Windows version?      The file exists on PCs too, but we haven't written a version of the application that runs on Windows ourselves. If you do a web search, you'll now find versions that other people have created, but while we have no reason to believe they contain any malicious code, we haven't inspected and verified any of them ourselves. Since we can't vouch for them we don't feel capable of recommending one in particular.      How does the application work?      If you run it on an OS X machine that you’ve been syncing with an iPhone or an iPad with cellular plan, it will scan through the backup files that are automatically made, looking for the hidden file containing your location. If it finds this file, it will then display the location history on the map.      How can I examine the data without running the application?      It will be stored in a folder inside /Users/<your user name>/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/. Each time you sync up an iOS device (iPad, iPhone, etc) files will be copied into a new folder here. The names of the folders and the files within them are mostly random strings, but there are some index files like Info.plist and Manifest.mbdb. Find the folder that has the most recent backup by looking at the modified dates of the files. Then, load Info.plist into a text editor to see what device it's for. You should see a 'Device Name' value in the XML, make sure that it matches your iPhone.      The Manifest.mbdb and Manifest.mbdx files contain a listing of the real names of the files represented by random strings in that folder. Luckily, Alasdair found a Python script here that can convert those:      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3085153/how-to-parse-the-manifest-mbdb-file-in-an-ios-4-0-itunes-backup      If you cd into the folder in the terminal, and run iphonels.py you'll see a listing of all the files with their real names. Now, pipe it through grep to find the file we want, eg:      ~/Downloads/iphonels.py | grep \\"consolidated\\"      You should see something like this:      -rw-r--r-- 00000000 00000000 28082176 1297319654 1297319654 1282888290 (4096c9ec676f2847dc283405900e284a7c815836)RootDomain::Library/Caches/locationd/consolidated.db      That text in brackets just before 'RootDomain::' is the name of the actual file on disk that holds the location data. Since it's an SQLite database file, you can use any standard SQLite browser, I'm using this Firefox plugin:      https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/      Update - Matt Hall suggested an easier way of locating the file, by running \`grep CellLocation *\` from the Backup folder      Open up the file, choose the 'CellLocation' table, and you can browse the tens of thousands of points that it has collected. The most interesting data is the latitude, longitude location and the timestamp. The timestamp shows the time in seconds since January 1st 2001.      Update - Here's a guide to manually loading the file on Windows - http://andykn.blogspot.com/2011/04/iphone-tracker.html      Does this application share the information with anyone?      No. All the data stays on your machine. The code behind it has been open-sourced so you can inspect the code and compile it yourself if you’re a developer.      What can I do to remove this data?      This database of your locations is stored on your iPhone as well as in any of the automatic backups that are made when you sync it with iTunes. One thing that will help is choosing encrypted backups, since that will prevent other users or programs on your machine from viewing the data, but there will still be a copy on your device.      Why is Apple collecting this information?      It’s unclear. One guess might be that they have new features in mind that require a history of your location, but that’s pure speculation. The fact that it's transferred across devices when you restore or migrate is evidence the data-gathering isn't accidental.      Is Apple storing this information elsewhere?      There’s no evidence that it’s being transmitted beyond your device and any machines you sync it with.      What’s so bad about this?      The most immediate problem is that this data is stored in an easily-readable form on your machine. Any other program you run or user with access to your machine can look through it.      The more fundamental problem is that Apple are collecting this information at all. Cell-phone providers collect similar data almost inevitably as part of their operations, but it’s kept behind their firewall. It normally requires a court order to gain access to it, whereas this is available to anyone who can get their hands on your phone or computer.      By passively logging your location without your permission, Apple have made it possible for anyone from a jealous spouse to a private investigator to get a detailed picture of your movements.      Why did you open-source this code, won’t that make the problem worse?      We did hesitate over the right thing to do in this case, but when it became clear that \\"Individuals familiar with iPhone forensic analysis will be quite familiar\\" with it, as Ryan Neal puts it and that at least one other person had tried to alert the public but apparently failed to make it clear what was going on, a demonstration application seemed the lesser evil.      To make it less useful for snoops, the spatial and temporal accuracy of the data has been artificially reduced. You can only animate week-by-week even though the data is timed to the second, and if you zoom in you’ll see the points are constrained to a grid, so your exact location is not revealed. The underlying database has no such constraints, unfortunately.      Why are some points in places I’ve never visited?      As far as we can tell, the location is determined by triangulating against the nearest cell-phone towers. This isn’t as accurate as GPS, but presumably takes less power. In some cases it can get very confused and temporarily think you’re several miles from your actual location, but these tend to be intermittent glitches.      How was it discovered?      We’ve been collaborating on several location data visualization projects, for example this map of radiation levels in Japan: http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2011/mar/24/fukushima-radiation-levels      We’d been discussing doing a visualization of mobile data, and while he was researching into what was available, Alasdair discovered this file. At first we weren’t sure how much data was there, but after we dug further and visualized the extracted data, it became clear that there was a scary amount of detail on our movements. It also became obvious that at least some other people knew about it, but it wasn't being publicized.      What’s your relationship with Apple?      Pete worked for Apple for five years, and left three years ago on good terms. He had no contact with anything iPhone related, (he worked on desktop visualization software) and received no help or information from inside the company while researching this problem. We’re both big fans of Apple’s products, and take no pleasure in uncovering this issue.      You say no data is shared, but why do I see the web accessed when I run the app?      The visualization is implemented as a view onto a local web page using the OpenHeatMap jQuery plugin. This means that the following resources are pulled from the web:      OpenStreetMap background tiles      The jQuery main script file hosted on Google      The OpenHeatMap script and CSS files      All of these are just static files that are downloaded from the web, and none of your data ever leaves your machine. We do still recommend inspecting the source code if you're a developer, or even just relying on the directions that allow you to inspect the data using standard database tools.      How can I choose which device's location data will be shown?      There's no user interface to choose different devices, it just picks the most recently synced iPad or iPhone with valid data. This means you can usually view a particular device's information by syncing it, so that it's files are the newest, and then re-running the application.      What does the size and color of the circles represent?      Basically the smallest orange circles represent one or two points near a location, and the large dark-blue circles are for dozens of points near the same place. We're counting how many points fall within a 1/100th of a degree square. ||||| Update, 4/27/11 — Apple has posted a response to questions raised in this report and others.      By Alasdair Allan and Pete Warden      Today at Where 2.0 Pete Warden and I will announce the discovery that your iPhone, and your 3G iPad, is regularly recording the position of your device into a hidden file. Ever since iOS 4 arrived, your device has been storing a long list of locations and time stamps. We’re not sure why Apple is gathering this data, but it’s clearly intentional, as the database is being restored across backups, and even device migrations.            A visualization of iPhone location data. Click to enlarge.      The presence of this data on your iPhone, your iPad, and your backups has security and privacy implications. We’ve contacted Apple’s Product Security team, but we haven’t heard back.      What makes this issue worse is that the file is unencrypted and unprotected, and it’s on any machine you’ve synched with your iOS device. It can also be easily accessed on the device itself if it falls into the wrong hands. Anybody with access to this file knows where you’ve been over the last year, since iOS 4 was released.      In the following video, we discuss how the file was discovered and take a look at the data contained in the file. Further details are posted below.      What information is being recorded?      All iPhones appear to log your location to a file called “consolidated.db.” This contains latitude-longitude coordinates along with a timestamp. The coordinates aren’t always exact, but they are pretty detailed. There can be tens of thousands of data points in this file, and it appears the collection started with iOS 4, so there’s typically around a year’s worth of information at this point. Our best guess is that the location is determined by cell-tower triangulation, and the timing of the recording is erratic, with a widely varying frequency of updates that may be triggered by traveling between cells or activity on the phone itself.      Who has access to this data?      Don’t panic. As we discuss in the video, there’s no immediate harm that would seem to come from the availability of this data. Nor is there evidence to suggest this data is leaving your custody. But why this data is stored and how Apple intends to use it — or not — are important questions that need to be explored.      Related books by Alasdair Allan and Pete Warden            What are the implications of this location data?      The cell phone companies have always had this data, but it takes a court order to access it. Now this information is sitting in plain view, unprotected from the world. Beyond this, there is even more data that we have yet to look at in depth.      For example, in my own case I (Alasdair) discovered a list of hundreds of thousands of wireless access points that my iPhone has been in range of during the last year.      How can you look at your own data?      We have built an application that helps you look at your own data. It’s available at petewarden.github.com/iPhoneTracker along with the source code and deeper technical information.      What can you do about this?      An immediate step you can take is to encrypt your backups through iTunes (click on your device within iTunes and then check “Encrypt iPhone Backup” under the “Options” area).      Related: ||||| Is Apple tracking your every move via the iPhone and iPad? A Wednesday blog post published on O'Reilly Radar claims that devices running iOS 4 are gathering location and storing it in an unencrypted manner.      \\"What makes this issue worse is that the file is unencrypted and unprotected, and it's on any machine you've synched with your iOS device. It can also be easily accessed on the device itself if it falls into the wrong hands. Anybody with access to this file knows where you've been over the last year, since iOS 4 was released,\\" wrote Pete Warden, founder of the Data Science Toolkit, and Alasdair Allan, a senior research fellow at the University of Exeter.      The data is being stored to a file known as \\"consolidated.db,\\" which includes latitude-longitude coordinates and a timestamp.      \\"The coordinates aren't always exact, but they are pretty detailed. There can be tens of thousands of data points in this file, and it appears the collection started with iOS 4, so there's typically around a year's worth of information at this point,\\" Warden and Allan wrote.      The duo speculated that the data collection is erratic. Update times vary and might be triggered by traveling between cells or activity on the phone itself.      But while this data is being stored on your phones and iOS devices, Warden and Allan acknowledge that there is no \\"evidence to suggest this data is leaving your custody\\"aka, being sent to Apple. There is also \\"no immediate harm that would seem to come from the availability of this data.\\"      \\"But why this data is stored and how Apple intends to use itor notare important questions that need to be explored,\\" they wrote. \\"The cell phone companies have always had this data, but it takes a court order to access it. Now this information is sitting in plain view, unprotected from the world. Beyond this, there is even more data that we have yet to look at in depth.\\"      As one commenter on the blog post pointed out, this data collection was first discussed last year. Digital forensic specialist Christopher Vance wrote on his blog that the location data is used as part of iAds, in addition to apps that require location-based data. In a later blog post, however, Vance said \\"these points are being used not in direct connection with iAds but on your device itself.\\"      Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but another commenter pointed to a July 2010 letter that Apple penned to House lawmakers about its location-based services.      Apple insisted that its location-based services exist only to enhance the user experience and that the company does not activate these services until it has received express consent from users. It collects data \\"anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services,\\" Bruce Sewell, general counsel and senior vice president of legal and government affairs at Apple, wrote in a letter to Reps. Edward Markey and Joe Barton.      \\"Apple is committed to giving our customers clear notice and control over their information, and we believe our products do this in a simple and elegant way,\\" he said.      The inquiry occured after Apple updated its privacy policy to say that it could \\"collect, use, and share precise location data, including real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device.\\"      In the letter, Apple said four Apple devices collected geographic location data: the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3GS, the iPhone 4, and the iPad Wi-Fi + 3G. To a lesser extent, older iPhone models, the iPad Wi-Fi, the iPod touch, Mac computers with Snow Leopard, and Safari 5 also collect similar information.      Apple started collecting location-based data and Wi-Fi information in January 2008.      \\"Apple has always provided its customers with the ability to control the location-based service capabilities of their devices,\\" Sewell said. \\"In fact, Apple now provides customers even greater control over such capabilities for devices running the current version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 4.\\"      With iOS 4, customers can pick and choose the apps with which they do not want to share location information, even if the global, location-based capabilities on their device are turned on, Apple said. An arrow icon, meanwhile, alerts iOS 4 users if an app is using or has recently used location-based information.      Warden and Allan seemed to take issue with the fact that the data collected was easily accessible. They built an app that helps you look at your own data, and suggested that concerned users encrypt their backups via iTunes. To do so, click on your device within iTunes and then check \\"Encrypt iPhone Backup\\" under the \\"Options\\" area.      A more detailed look at Warden and Allan's investigation is in the video below.      The news is also interesting in light of a case out of Michigan where police officers have been accused of secretly extracting data from peoples' cell phones during routine stops. The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan has urged the Michigan State Police (MSP) to release information about the alleged practice.

One year later, the automated Skynet system is activated, becomes self-aware, begins to perceive humans as a threat, and eradicates much of humanity with nuclear weapons in the event known as \\"Judgment Day\\". In 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) leads an attack on a Skynet base, where he discovers human prisoners and schematics for a new type of Terminator, incorporating living tissue (The T-800). He is the only survivor of the assault after the base is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. Following Connor's departure, Marcus emerges from the base's wreckage and begins walking towards Los Angeles, after taking the clothing from a Resistance soldier, who died in the explosion. John returns to Resistance headquarters, located aboard a nuclear submarine, and tells General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) of his findings. Meanwhile, the Resistance has discovered a radio signal believed to have been an order to shut down Skynet's machines. Working on this intelligence, the human militia plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days; in response to an intercepted \\"kill list\\" created by Skynet with a plan to terminate the Resistance's command staff. John Connor learns he is second on this list, following Kyle Reese. The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance, but John knows Kyle will eventually go back in time and become his father.

Some are severe, while some less so, but it is important to know what risks you are taking, for bigger boobs:  Nerve damage in the breast may cause numbness in the nipples or breast tissue; an inability to feel anything. These effects can be permanent. Complications with future mammography. Breast implants make breast-cancer screening more difficult and demand an x-ray technician experienced in working with implants. Your doctor may also require additional tests with each checkup including an ultrasound and an MRI. Do not forget, these procedures are the result of cosmetic surgery, unlikely to be covered by insurance.  Your scars will be firm and pink for at least six weeks. They may remain the same size for several months, or even appear to widen. After several months, your scars will begin to fade, though they will never disappear completely. Capsular contracture refers to a painful complication in which scar tissue hardens around the implant and squeezes, which can result in shape changes in the breasts, breasts that are hard to the touch, and pain. Additional surgery is required to deal with capsular contracture. Some women suffer severe infections one to two weeks after surgery. In rare cases, the implant will have to be surgically removed. You may experience excessive bleeding following the surgery, along with swelling and pain. Again, additional operations will be needed if this happens. Implants can break or leak. Beyond factory defects, many things can cause the implants to break and leak inside your body. These activities include exercise, injury and even normal day-to-day movement. Ruptured implants are a controversial topic and more can be written about the subject. In general, what happens when an implant breaks depends on the kind of implant:  If a saline-filled implant breaks, the implant will deflate in a few hours and the salt water will be absorbed and naturally expelled by the body. If a silicone-gel filled implant leak or break, the elastic silicone gel may remain within the implant shell, or may escape into the breast. A leaking silicone gel implant may not be noticeable except through expensive tests like an MRI. Thus women with silicone breast implants are advised to visit with their plastic surgeon every year, to make sure they are still functioning properly.   Your new breasts may be slightly different from one another, potentially in both size and shape. Engage in your regular day to day activities. Routine activity or injury can cause damage, resulting in the implants leaking or breaking. Additional surgery will be necessary to remove the implant or replace it. There is no evidence that implants change your ability to nurse an infant, or change anything about your pregnancy. It is possible, however, that the pregnancy will alter your body enough that the implants will have to be replaced for aesthetic reasons.","output":"Breast augmentation is a surgery for bigger boobs, but it has some risks.

Children lack schooling in Syria crisis, UNICEF says BEIRUT — Syria’s civil conflict has battered the nation’s education system, depriving hundreds of thousands of children of schooling, UNICEF said Tuesday. One in 5 Syrian schools have suffered damage or have been converted into shelters, UNICEF said in a new overview of the parlous state of education in Syria, where an armed rebellion has been raging for almost two years. In some cases, UNICEF said, armed groups have commandeered schools. At least 2,400 schools have been damaged or destroyed, the U.N. children's agency said. More than 110 teachers and staff members have been killed, UNICEF said, and others are no longer reporting to their schools. Many parents are reluctant to send their children to classes, fearing for their safety. In the embattled northern city of Aleppo, the site of daily clashes, the school attendance rate has dropped as low as 6%, UNICEF said. “Syria once prided itself on the quality of its schools,” said Youssouf Abdel-Jelil, UNICEF’s Syria representative. “Now it’s seeing the gains it made over the years rapidly reversed.” The U.N. agency says its efforts in Syria include providing teaching and learning supplies, assisting in remedial education and repairing damaged facilities. UNICEF says its education initiatives in Syria will cost about 20 million during the first six months of 2013, but the agency, which relies on private and public donations, has received no more than 3 million.

SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

The 35-year-old Collins made the announcement in a first-person story for Sports Illustrated magazine.

Jason Collins become the first openly gay man in any of the four major North American professional leagues. Collins made both announcements in first-person articles for Sports Illustrated magazine. He joined the Brooklyn Nets in February and played 22 games for the team, but was not on the roster this season. 'It feels wonderful to have been part of these milestones for sports and for gay rights, and to have been embraced by the public, the coaches, the players, the league and history,' Collins wrote. Collins started his career with the New Jersey Nets in 2001 and rejoined the franchise in Brooklyn. Nets spokesman Aaron Harris said Collins was expected to make an official announcement at the Barclays Center  before the Nets game with the Milwaukee Bucks. Bucks coach Jason Kidd was Brooklyn's coach last year, and Collins singled him out for the 'courage' he showed in bringing him on board. 'It had been argued that no team would want to take on a player who was likely to attract a media circus from the outset and whose sexuality would be a distraction,' he wrote. 'I'm happy to have helped put those canards to rest.' Collins wore No 98 during his final seasons in the league - 1998 was year that Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming - was killed. Collins said his most poignant moment came during his third game back last season, when he met Shepard's family in Denver. Following Collins revelation, Missouri defensive end Michael Sam came out in February and was drafted by the St Louis Rams in the NFL. He was later cut by the Rams and was released from the Dallas Cowboys practice squad last month. In April, University of Massachusetts guard Derrick Gordon became the first openly gay player in Division I men's basketball. But Collins stressed that there are still no openly gay players in the NFL, NHL or major league baseball. He said: 'When we get to the point where he's not compelled to hide his true self and is able to live an authentic life,' being a gay athlete won't be a big deal. 'But we're not there yet.'

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores, but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.  I am facing a new situation today: Bess and Dee were two entomologists. they were studying ants. Dee liked to learn more about leaf cutter ants, while Bess learned all she could about all other ants.

He had a younger brother, James Peale (1749-1831). Charles became an apprentice to a saddle maker when he was thirteen years old. Upon reaching maturity, he opened his own saddle shop; however, when his Loyalist creditors discovered he had joined the Sons of Liberty, they conspired to bankrupt his business. In 1762, Peale married Rachel Brewer (1744-1790), who bore him ten children, most named for Peale's favorite artists, male and female. The sons included Raphaelle Peale (1774-1825), Rembrandt Peale (1778-1860), who was another famous portrait painter and museum owner/operator in Baltimore, and scientific inventor and businessman, Titian Peale I (1780-1798), and Rubens Peale (1784-1865). Among the daughters: Angelica Kauffman Peale (named for Angelica Kauffman, Peale's favorite female painter) married Alexander Robinson, her daughter Priscilla Peale wed Dr. Henry Boteler, and Sophonisba Angusciola Peale (named for Sofonisba Anguissola) married Coleman Sellers.  After Rachel's death in 1790, Peale married Elizabeth de Peyster (d. 1804) the next year. With his second wife, he had six additional children. One son, Franklin Peale, born on October 15, 1795, became the Chief Coiner at the Philadelphia Mint. Their youngest son, Titian Ramsay Peale (1799-1885), became an important naturalist and pioneer in photography. Their daughter, Elizabeth De Peyster Peale (1802-57), married William Augustus Patterson (1792-1833) in 1820.  Hannah More, a Quaker from Philadelphia, married Peale in 1804, becoming his third wife. She helped raise the younger children from his previous two marriages.  Peale's slave, Moses Williams, was also trained in the arts while growing up in the Peale household and later became a professional silhouette artist.  In 1810, Peale purchased a farm in Germantown where he intended to retire. He named this estate 'Belfield', and cultivated extensive gardens there. After Hannah's death in 1821, Peale lived with his son Rubens and sold Belfield in 1826. Peale died on February 22, 1827, and was buried at the Saint Peter's Episcopal Church in Philadelphia.

Trivia question: George Washington Gale Ferris, Jr. invented what engineering marvel for the 1893 exposition in Chicago in the hopes of creating something as impressive as the Eiffel Tower? And the answer is?","output":"The answer is the Ferris Wheel. George Washington Gale Ferris, Jr., an American civil engineer, invented the Ferris Wheel for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago, Illinois. The exposition commemorated the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World in 1492, and America wanted to showcase something that would rival the Eiffel Tower, which had been the centerpiece of the 1889 Paris Exposition. Ferris was inspired by the idea of creating a unique and impressive attraction that could captivate people's imagination and demonstrate America's engineering prowess. He decided to design a gigantic observation wheel that not only would symbolize the technological advancement of the country but also generate the same level of excitement and awe that the Eiffel Tower had created during the Paris Exposition. Ferris' wheel, named the \\"Ferris Wheel,\\" stood 264 feet tall and had a capacity to carry more than 2,000 passengers at once. The wheel featured 36 fully enclosed passenger gondolas, each with an approximate seating capacity of 60 people. The observation wheel allowed passengers to experience panoramic views of the exposition and the surrounding areas from a height and perspective never before seen. Despite facing skepticism and doubts from fellow engineers and critics about the safety and feasibility of such a colossal structure, Ferris successfully demonstrated his engineering marvel to the world. The Ferris Wheel became the star attraction of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition and an enduring symbol of human ingenuity and innovation. Since then, the Ferris Wheel has become a staple among amusement parks and various global events across the world. It has evolved in terms of technology, size, and design, with newer and larger versions being constructed as a testament to mankind's fascination with these rotating wonders. Notable examples include the London Eye in the United Kingdom and the Singapore Flyer in Singapore. In summary, George Washington Gale Ferris, Jr. invented the Ferris Wheel as an engineering marvel for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, in hopes of showcasing an attraction as impressive as the Eiffel Tower. The Ferris Wheel has since become a beloved and enduring symbol of entertainment and engineering achievement across the globe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choose from: + Michael did not remember how to.; + Robert did not remember how to.; Complete the following sentence. Michael asked Robert how to draw the perfect hexagon because","output":"Michael asked Robert how to draw the perfect hexagon because, although both of them had learned about it in the past, neither could recall the exact steps or techniques required to do so. As close friends who had a shared interest in art, design, and geometry, they often engaged in collaborative projects, challenging each other to enhance their skills or learn new techniques. This time, they had decided to recreate a beautiful, intricate geometric pattern that they had seen in a book on Islamic art, which prominently featured a perfect hexagon. Robert, being the more skilled drafter of the two, was known for his ability to create precise and intricate drawings. Michael thought that even if he didn't remember how to draw a perfect hexagon, Robert might be able to provide some guidance on the process or point them in the right direction to figure it out. In the back of their minds, they recalled certain aspects of drawing a hexagon, such as knowing that it has six equal sides and angles, and it can be inscribed within a circle. Despite this basic understanding, they knew that creating the perfect hexagon would require more detailed knowledge of the drawing process and, perhaps, some mathematical understanding of the hexagon's dimensions and relationships between its elements. As they began their project, Michael and Robert first spent some time researching how to draw the perfect hexagon. They came across different methods, such as using a compass and straightedge, applying mathematical formulas like the Pythagorean theorem, or leveraging grid paper for accurate measurement and alignment. They knew that selecting the most appropriate technique would be essential for achieving the precision and symmetry necessary for their pattern. The more they investigated, the more they narrowed down their approach. They decided to use a compass and straightedge, as it was a classical technique that had been employed by mathematicians and artists alike for centuries. It would also provide them with the accuracy they sought, and the satisfaction of mastering an age-old skill. Following the steps they found in their research, Michael and Robert began the process of drawing the perfect hexagon: 1. First, Michael drew a circle with a compass, ensuring that it was centered and of the desired diameter. 2. Keeping the compass at the same width, Robert gently marked six equally spaced points along the circle's edge without drawing a complete circle. 3. With a straightedge, Michael connected each adjacent pair of points to create the six equal sides. 4. As Robert connected the points, Michael carefully checked the angles to ensure they were all at 120 degrees, making any minor adjustments if necessary. 5. Finally, they both scrutinized their resulting hexagon, confirming that it was visually symmetrical and of the desired precision. With the perfect hexagon now complete, Michael and Robert could proceed with developing the elaborate geometric pattern they had envisioned. Additionally, they were both content that, through their collaborative efforts, they had re-learned the technique for drawing a flawless hexagon and deepened their understanding of the finer points of geometric design. In the end, the journey of rediscovering how to draw the perfect hexagon was as rewarding as the result itself. Michael and Robert not only deepened their appreciation for the art of geometry but also strengthened their bond as friends by sharing a common challenge and working together to overcome it."},{"instruction":"Addison tried hard in class and got a very good grade on their math exam.

Morgan is inside the article: James Longacre died suddenly at his home in Philadelphia on January 1, 1869.  A memorial meeting was held at the Philadelphia Mint on January 5, attended by the facility's employees. The Director of the Mint, Henry Linderman, delivered a speech in praise of Longacre prior to the formal eulogy, which was given by Longacre's assistant, William Barber, who would be appointed as Longacre's successor.  Like each of his predecessors, Longacre died in office.Longacre was recognized in an exhibit of 100 notable American engravers sponsored by the New York Public Library in 1928.  In 1970, art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on U.S. coins, viewed Longacre and his works less favorably, \\"uniform in their dullness, lack of inspiration, and even quaintness, Longacre's contributions to patterns and regular coinage were a decided step backwards from the art of [Thomas] Sully, [Titian] Peale, [Robert] Hughes, and Gobrecht\\" and \\"whatever his previous qualities as an engraver of portraits, he seems not to have brought much imagination to his important post at the Philadelphia Mint.\\"  However, Vermeule considered the Flying Eagle cent more of a work of art, far above the mundane.In his 1991 article, McKenzie notes Vermeule's concerns, but considers Longacre's work important for its use of American symbols, including the representations of Native Americans.  He believes Longacre's use of such symbols influenced later coin designers, such as George T. Morgan, Victor D. Brenner, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.  He particularly praises the ornate scroll on the reverse of the double eagle, calling it \\"unique in American numismatic art and enhances the elegance of a design befitting the highest-denomination U.S. coin\\", and applauds \\"the exciting innovation in symbolism and expression of national sentiment that he brought to U.S. numismatic art\\".According to Bowers, \\"Today, Longacre is widely admired by numismatists.\\"  Lange notes that Longacre's \\"artistic vision graced 60 years of American coins\\".

Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse. Having now observed Honey's many qualities beyond his minor eccentricities, and after becoming very close to Elspeth, she decides to make the arrangement permanent by marrying the engineer.

George Clooney, the man long considered one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors, followed up his private wedding to British human rights attorney Amal Alamuddin with a civil ceremony in Venice, Italy, on Monday. Clooney, 53, and Alamuddin, 36, arrived at Venice's city hall -- the Ca' Farsetti palazzo -- in a water taxi appropriately named \\"Amore,\\" or \\"Love.\\" Venetian authorities stopped pedestrian and boat traffic in the area for the ceremony. Clooney wore a gray suit and dark tie, while Alamuddin was dressed in flowing cream trousers, a cream top with a blue border and a wide-brimmed matching hat. The couple spent about 10 minutes inside the venue before boating to their hotel, with well-wishers lining the canal. Rai, Italian state television, later reported that they had left Venice on a private jet, heading for London -- leaving \\"Amore\\" free for other visitors to the city. Private ceremony. Celebrities, paparazzi and the world's media congregated in Venice for Clooney and Alamuddin's widely anticipated nuptials. Their private ceremony on Saturday was marked with a star-studded bash at the Aman Canal Grande Venice resort, housed in the 16th-century Palazzo Papadopoli. Clooney also arrived by motorboat to that ceremony, waving to the sound of \\"George, auguri!\\" as Venetians offered their best wishes. Plenty of paparazzi, cameramen and photographers were on the docks facing the Aman Canal Grande. Others were going up and down the Grand Canal on taxi boats. The first celebrity guests to arrive were also caught on camera in the city famed for romance, notably actor Matt Damon, American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and supermodel Cindy Crawford. \\"I guess this is, as Dean Martin put it, 'That's Amore,' the land of love,\\" said a tourist visiting Venice from Canada, referring to the late crooner's signature song. \\"Yes, my heart is broken but I'm excited,\\" his partner said with a smile. The actor and his then-fiancee were also photographed Friday cruising the sun-dappled canals of Venice ahead of their big day. Why Venice? Clooney revealed earlier this month at a celebrity charity event in Tuscany, Italy, that he and Alamuddin would be tying the knot in Venice. According to People magazine, Clooney was receiving a humanitarian award at the black-tie gala, and said during his acceptance speech, \\"I met my lovely bride-to-be here in Italy, whom I will be marrying, in a couple of weeks, in Venice, of all places.\\" Since they became engaged in the spring, Clooney and Alamuddin have been largely protective of their relationship. When a Daily Mail report claimed that Clooney and his Lebanese future mother-in-law, Baria Alamuddin, were at odds, Clooney blasted the publication with a first-person piece in USA Today, and then refused to accept the Daily Mail's subsequent apology.

Laura's parents believed that it was great for her to learn two languages, like English and Spanish, because they wanted her to be able to talk with her grandparents in a different country, and make new friends, or even play with the characters in her favorite TV shows. On the other hand, Tanya's parents thought it would be better for her to learn just one language, so she can concentrate on it and become really good at it. They wanted her to have an easy time understanding stories, watching movies, and speaking with her friends and teachers at school. One sunny day, Laura and Tanya decided to go to the park to play. They brought their toys along with them. Laura brought a red ball and Tanya brought a blue one. While they were playing with their balls, a little girl named Maria came along. Maria could only speak Spanish. Laura quickly became friends with Maria because they both understood and could speak Spanish. They laughed, played, and shared stories using their second language. Tanya felt a bit left out because she didn't understand what Laura and Maria were saying. She felt sad and couldn't join in their fun conversations. Although Laura tried her best to include Tanya, Tanya still felt a little confused about all the new words she was hearing. So, the next day, Tanya decided to ask her parents if she could learn a second language like Laura. Her parents thought about it and agreed that it would be a good idea for her to learn a new language. They wanted Tanya to be able to make even more friends, just like Laura. Tanya was so excited and happy to learn a new language. She knew it would take some time and practice, but she was ready to try. With the help of her friend Laura and her parents, Tanya started learning Spanish, too. In the end, Laura, Tanya, and Maria became the best of friends, and they enjoyed playing and talking together in the park.

Write the answer: Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulphur/sulfur hexafluoride are widely referred to by what collective metaphorical term?","output":"Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulfur hexafluoride are widely referred to by the collective metaphorical term \\"Greenhouse Gases.\\" This term is used because these gases' behavior in the Earth's atmosphere is akin to the effect of a greenhouse in regulating temperature.  Greenhouse gases have a significant impact on the planet's climate and have been the primary driving force behind global warming and climate change. To understand why they are called greenhouse gases, we need to first understand how a greenhouse works. A greenhouse is a structure made of glass or transparent plastic, which allows sunlight to enter and warm the interior. The glass or plastic traps heat, preventing it from easily escaping and maintaining a warmer temperature inside. This controlled environment is beneficial for growing plants, especially in cold climates.  Similarly, greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere allow sunlight to pass through and warm the surface of the planet. Once the sunlight is absorbed by the Earth, it is re-emitted as infrared radiation, which is a form of heat. Instead of allowing this heat to escape back into space, greenhouse gases absorb and trap it, thereby warming the planet further. This phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect. Each of the greenhouse gases mentioned plays a different role in the atmosphere, and they vary in their potency, sources, and atmospheric lifetime: 1. Carbon Dioxide (CO2): CO2 is the most prevalent greenhouse gas, accounting for about 76% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It is primarily released through the combustion of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as through deforestation and certain industrial processes. Carbon dioxide can remain in the atmosphere for centuries, making it a long-lasting contributor to global warming. 2. Methane (CH4): Methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas, contributing to approximately 16% of global emissions. It is about 25 times more effective at trapping heat compared to carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. Methane is primarily released from agriculture (like enteric fermentation in livestock and rice paddies), fossil fuel extraction, and decomposing organic matter in landfills. 3. Nitrous Oxide (N2O): This greenhouse gas makes up around 6% of total emissions and is approximately 298 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. Nitrous oxide is mainly released through agricultural activities like the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers, as well as industrial processes and the burning of fossil fuels. It can stay in the atmosphere for over a century. 4. Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6): Although this gas only contributes to less than 0.1% of global emissions, it is exceptionally potent. Sulfur hexafluoride is 22,800 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. It is utilized in a variety of applications, including electrical switchgear, magnesium production, and semiconductor manufacturing. SF6 has an atmospheric lifetime of over 3,000 years. In summary, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulfur hexafluoride are collectively referred to as greenhouse gases due to their heat-trapping properties in the atmosphere, which contribute to the warming of the planet and the subsequent consequences of climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do hurricanes do to the amount of water contained in bodies in water?\\" is \\"fissures of hot, acidic water\\", given that  hurricanes cause bodies of water to increase amount of water they contain? The answer is:","output":"No, the statement \\"fissures of hot, acidic water\\" is not the right answer to the question \\"what do hurricanes do to the amount of water contained in bodies of water?\\", given that hurricanes cause bodies of water to increase the amount of water they contain.  Hurricanes, also known as tropical cyclones, are large and powerful storms that form over warm ocean waters and can bring heavy rainfall, strong winds, storm surges, and flooding. When a hurricane makes landfall, it often leads to an increase in the amount of water contained in bodies of water like rivers, lakes, and coastal areas due to the massive influx of rainwater that it brings with it. As hurricanes generate intense rainfall, they can cause bodies of water to swell significantly, leading to an increase in the overall volume of water in the affected water bodies. This increase in water volume can result in localized flooding, coastal inundation, and even a rise in groundwater levels in some cases., particularly when a hurricane takes days to pass over a specific region or when the area experiences back-to-back storm events. As a result, local ecosystems could be significantly impacted, with aquatic habitats, as well as water quality, being affected by the sudden surge in water levels. Furthermore, hurricanes bring with them strong winds and storm surges. Storm surges can lead to significant coastal flooding, as powerful onshore winds push ocean water towards the coast and cause water levels to rise well above normal tide levels. In some cases, storm surges can inundate large areas of land and cause bodies of water along the coast to merge or expand across land. This inundation, combined with the heavy rainfall, can drastically increase the total amount of water contained within bodies of water in affected regions. The answer \\"fissures of hot, acidic water\\" seems to be unrelated, as it refers to a geological phenomenon wherein hot, acidic water emerges from cracks in the Earth's surface, typically in the vicinity of volcanic or geothermal activity. While it is possible that hurricanes and other severe weather events could modulate the behavior of geothermal systems, including the emergence of hot, acidic water through fissures, the primary mechanism by which hurricanes affect the amount of water contained in bodies of water is through increased precipitation and storm surges. In summary, the right answer to the question \\"what do hurricanes do to the amount of water contained in bodies of water?\\" should focus on the impacts of heavy rainfall and coastal flooding due to storm surges, rather than a seemingly unrelated geological phenomenon like fissures of hot, acidic water. Hurricanes, through their intense precipitation and associated storm surges, can significantly increase the amount of water contained in various bodies of water, leading to events such as flooding, coastal inundation, and potential shifts in local ecosystems and water quality."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Combine the like terms on the right side of the equation. 2. Add or subtract the constant term from both sides to isolate the variable-term. 3. Subtract or add the variable term to get the variable by itself. 4. Divide by the coefficient of the variable to find the value of the variable. Step 1: Combine the like terms on the right side of the equation. 243*l + 223*l = (243 + 223)*l = 466*l So now the equation becomes: -124*l = 466*l - 12980 Step 2: Add or subtract the constant term to isolate the variable-term. In this case, we don't need to do anything in this step as there is no constant term combined with the variable. Step 3: Subtract or add the variable term to get the variable by itself. To cancel out the 466*l term on the right side, we will add 124*l to both sides of the equation. -124*l + 124*l = 466*l - 12980 + 124*l This simplifies to: 0 = 590*l - 12980 Step 4: Divide by the coefficient of the variable to find the value of the variable. To isolate l, we'll first add 12980 to both sides: 590*l = 12980 Next, we'll divide both sides by 590: l = 12980 / 590 Now, we can perform the division to find the value of l: l = 22 So, the solution for the equation is l=22."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: people on boats going down a river .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise states that there are people on boats going down a thick tree-lined river. The hypothesis simplifies this statement to people on boats going down a river. Since the premise includes people riding boats along a river, and the only addition in the premise is the description of the river as \\"thick tree-lined,\\" it does not contradict the hypothesis. Therefore, if the premise is accurate, the hypothesis must also be true. Let's analyze the two statements in detail: 1. Premise: People on boats going down a thick tree-lined river. In this statement, we have three main pieces of information:    a. The presence of people: There are individuals involved in the scenario.    b. The mode of transport: These people are traveling on boats.    c. The location: They are navigating through a river that is surrounded by dense trees. 2. Hypothesis: People on boats going down a river. In the hypothesis, we also have three main elements:    a. The presence of people: Similar to the premise, the hypothesis mentions individuals involved in the scenario.    b. The mode of transport: The people are again described as traveling on boats.    c. The location: They are going down a river, which is the only aspect that does not include the detailed description found in the premise. The primary difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the level of detail provided in each statement. The premise is more descriptive and specific, mentioning that the river is thick and tree-lined, while the hypothesis is more general, simply stating that people are on boats going down a river. To conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, we can consider the key elements present in both statements: people, boats, and a river. Since the inclusion of the thick tree-lined description in the premise does not directly contradict or negate the hypothesis, we can safely deduce that the hypothesis is valid when the premise is true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English","output":"Proposing that the future security policy should be based on nuclear deterrence in 1996 is not only outdated, but also extremely dangerous. The idea of relying on nuclear deterrence for security policy in 1996, many years after the end of the Cold War, presents several issues and risks. While nuclear deterrence may have played a considerable role during the Cold War era, it is important to understand the evolving global security landscape. Firstly, such a proposal is outdated as it does not consider the changes in the strategic environment that have occurred since the end of the Cold War. In the post-Cold War era, the primary threats to international security have diversified and evolved significantly. Issues such as terrorism, cyber warfare, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, have become new and crucial areas for security policy focus. Secondly, maintaining a security policy that is based on nuclear deterrence can be extremely dangerous, as it encourages the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This may lead to a world with a multilateral nuclear arms race, which, in turn, increases the risk of accidental launches, nuclear escalation, and the potential use of nuclear weapons by terrorists or other non-state actors. Thirdly, relying on nuclear deterrence can also fuel geopolitical tensions and contribute to destabilizing relationships between nuclear-armed states. As nations seek to counter perceived threats with their nuclear capabilities, a dangerous cycle of arms racing, mistrust, and brinkmanship can emerge – a situation that can lead to conflicts and even wars. Fourth, a security policy based on nuclear deterrence goes against the global trend towards disarmament and the principles of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which seeks to curb the spread of nuclear weapons, promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and move towards global nuclear disarmament. Furthermore, using nuclear deterrence as the basis for security policy implies that the safety of civilians is predicated upon the threat of mutually assured destruction. This has been widely criticized as immoral and unethical, given the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental consequences that would follow any nuclear exchange. In conclusion, proposing that the future security policy should be based on nuclear deterrence in 1996 is not only outdated but also extremely dangerous. Rather than perpetuating a reliance on nuclear weapons, governments should focus on addressing the evolving threats in the global security landscape and promoting diplomatic solutions to conflicts. Reducing nuclear arsenals, engaging in arms control and disarmament initiatives, and adopting a more comprehensive approach to security would be a more responsible course of action."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who S.T. Crawford starts eyeing up?  Pretty and shy young Georgia farmgirl Claudelle Inglish, the daughter of a poor sharecropper Clyde Inglish and his wife Jessie, starts dating the poor neighbor, handsome farmboy Linn Varner during the spring of their senior year in high school. Claudelle and Linn instantly hit it off together, and soon they fall in love. Her mother objects to the relationship, fearing Claudelle will end up in the same rut she is, being married to a poor farmer, resulting in a stormy marriage. Claudelle is forced to endure her parents' many arguments stemming from Jessie's unhappiness having to be married to Clyde, a poor but hard-working farmer. At the same time, rich middle-aged portly landowner S.T. Crawford, who owns the farm where the Inglish family live, begins to secretly eye up Claudelle. Despite her mother's protests, Linn wins her dad's approval by helping him on the farm. Shortly before graduation, Linn takes Claudelle to a neighborhood carnival where he wins her a musical dancing doll. That same night, Linn asks Claudelle to marry him and she happily says yes. Linn gets drafted into the army, and he and Claudelle are spending their last night together before Linn's departure at the senior prom. The two leave the dance to go for a walk, where Claudelle tells Linn her fears about him being away in the army for two years and how she is afraid they will never be together again. Linn calms her fears by promising her he will marry her the day he comes home from the service. Claudelle, still fearing Linn leaving her, has him make love to her that night in the woods.","output":"The last name of the person who S.T. Crawford starts eyeing up is Inglish.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Jeff and Jeremy were neighbors and best friends since kindergarten. They always enjoyed the same hobbies and did everything together. When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which boy hit puberty later than the other, Jeff or Jeremy?  Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. The answer is:","output":"Jeremy hit puberty later than Jeff. This is evident from the fact that Jeff experienced a growth spurt, growing much taller than Jeremy when puberty hit, which is a common sign of puberty driven by testosterone. Meanwhile, Jeremy was not growing at the same rate and remained the shortest boy in their class, which indicates that his puberty onset was delayed compared to Jeff's."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: The dismal results caused Gephardt to drop out and later endorse Kerry. Carol Moseley Braun also dropped out, endorsing Howard Dean. Besides the impact of coming in third, Dean was further hurt by a speech he gave at a post-caucus rally. Dean was shouting over the cheers of his enthusiastic audience, but the crowd noise was being filtered out by his unidirectional microphone, leaving only his full-throated exhortations audible to the television viewers. To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice out of sheer emotion.

Is \\"With support from the British abolitionist movement, Parliament enacted the Slave Trade Act in 1807, which abolished the slave trade in the empire.\\" a good answer to the question \\"How long of an 'apprenticeship' did slaves need to have before being fully freed?\\"","output":"No, the statement provided does not answer the question about the length of an 'apprenticeship' that slaves were required to have before being fully freed. To answer the question, we can discuss the developments in British law that occurred in the 19th century concerning the abolition of slavery and the initiation of apprenticeship for emancipated slaves. During the early 19th century, the British government took gradual steps toward the abolition of slavery. The statement provided regarding the 1807 Slave Trade Act is an example of this gradual approach. While that act indeed abolished the slave trade in the British empire, it did not abolish slavery itself. It was not until the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 that the British government began to address the end of slavery directly. The Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 formally abolished slavery throughout the British Empire and laid out steps to free slaves. Upon its implementation on August 1, 1834, the act did not grant immediate freedom to all slaves; instead, it introduced a mandatory apprenticeship system. This apprenticeship system required slaves over the age of six to serve their former owners or \\"masters\\" for a period of time before they would be officially emancipated. The apprenticeship period was divided into two categories: 1. For the enslaved working in Agriculture, the Penal Apprenticeship Term was established, which was between four to six years long, ending on August 1, 1838. 2. For the enslaved working in the service industry or performing domestic duties, the Non-Penal Apprenticeship Term was established, which was two to four years long, ending on August 1, 1836. During this apprenticeship period, the former slaves were supposed to receive wages for their labor, although many continued to be exploited under harsh conditions. The apprenticeship system was intended to help facilitate a smoother transition from slavery to a more equitable form of labor and free society. However, the apprenticeship system was widely criticized for being a continuation of slavery in all but name, and several instances of abuse and unrest led to increasing pressure on the British government. Due to these factors, along with continuous abolitionist campaigns and influence, the British Colonial Office decided to end the apprenticeship system early, resulting in all remaining apprentices being fully emancipated on August 1, 1838. In conclusion, the length of the apprenticeship for slaves before they were fully freed varied between two to six years, depending on the type of work they were engaged in, although the majority were set free after four years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You've gotten not quite a 'yes' and not quite a 'no.' You have deadlines to meet for responding to the other schools that did accept you. Should you send in that deposit to your second or third choice, or remain on your top school's list? Before you panic, there are some things you can do to strengthen your chance of getting in. In Pictures: How to Get Off The B-School Wait List Every school has a different policy about whether you should be in touch with them. Some say outright don't call us, we'll call you. If yours is one of them, follow those instructions. Disobeying will most likely do more harm than good. Some permit contact but in very specific ways. Columbia Business School changed its policy this year. \\"We no longer encourage people to set up an appointment with their wait list manager or reach out voluntarily to us,\\" says Linda B. Meehan, assistant dean and executive director of M.B.A. admissions there. \\"We've decided it makes better use of our resources if we reach out when we have questions, rather than having candidates flood us with information we may or may not be looking for.\\" Still, Meehan says, if you get an e-mail from Columbia asking if you'd like to remain on the wait list, \\"That's the time to tell us about something to enhance your application.\\" The Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, prefers to hear from wait-listed students by e-mail only; the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and the Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College are both more open. There are several reasons candidates get relegated to the wait list. If you can find out which reason applies to you, you can try to address the problem. Among the most common: a low score on the Graduate Management Admission Test; insufficient community service or leadership experience; low grades in college math classes; unclear career goals. However, \\"They won't wait list anybody unless they're willing to admit them,\\" says Scott Shrum, director of M.B.A. admissions research at Veritas Prep, an M.B.A. application consulting firm in Los Angeles. Shrumsuggests that you show your application to someone who knows about the process and together figure out what your weaknesses are. At some schools, including Northwestern, they say it's acceptable to reach out to the admissions office and ask if there's anything about your candidacy they found wanting. Beth Flye, assistant dean and director of admissions and financial aid at Northwestern's Kellogg School, recently spoke to someone she considered a strong applicant but who had taken the GMAT only once and gotten a relatively low score. Flye encouraged the candidate to take it again, since applicants can do so every 30 days, and scores tend to go up. If you got low math grades in college, take a calculus class locally and earn an A, admissions officers say. And let the school know. If there's not enough time to finish such a course, at least begin it and tell your intended school you're taking the class and are off to a strong start. Your stated career goal could also be the issue. Linda Meehan gives the example of applicants who have seemed to insist on getting into private equity after school. \\"The marketplace has changed. We want to know a little more because that may not be an option when they finish,\\" she says. As for enthusiasm, that will only get you so far. \\"Some people believe that convincing us they're really, really interested will get them off the wait list. That's just not true,\\" says Peter Johnson, executive director of admissions for the full-time M.B.A. program at the Haas School. \\"What gets them off the wait list is strengthening one of these weaknesses.\\" But it's a balance. Flye says it doesn't hurt to let the admissions staff know Kellogg is your first choice. Scott Shrum suggests that when you're asked whether you'd like to remain on the list you send an e-mail saying something like: \\"Your school is my No. 1 choice, and I can say without hesitation that if accepted I'd send in my deposit today.\\" Of course, you only want to say that if it's true. What does not work--and will land you on the rejected list--is pestering the admissions office. \\"There have been people on the wait list in past years whose interest level was inappropriate,\\" says Meehan. \\"Finding anyone under any rock who is associated with Columbia and having them send us e-mails is not helpful. If every time I turn around someone's name is coming across my screen or a wait list manager's screen, that's not in their best interest.\\" When you do get in touch, explain why that particular school is the right fit. Personalize your letter by describing the experience you had while visiting the school. Shrum suggests saying something like, \\"In the fall I had the chance to visit Wharton and sit in on Professor Siegel's finance class. After listening to the depth of discussion, I knew this was where I wanted to be.\\" There are no figures for how many applicants successfully get off waiting lists. It varies since it depends on the strength of the application pool and whether the fully accepted students decide to attend or go elsewhere. Late last year, when layoffs were at their highest, the thought was M.B.A. applications this year would skyrocket. Applications were indeed up at the beginning of many schools' application seasons, but they've since evened out. That could be good news for wait-listed students. \\"One of the big determinants in getting off the wait list has nothing to do with you,\\" says Peter Johnson. \\"We can't predict what all the admitted students will do. Our goal is to minimize the stress as much as we can. We try to communicate frequently--and not give anyone unrealistic hopes.\\" In Pictures: How to Get Off The B-School Wait List What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is about how to increase your chances of getting off the waiting list for your top choice business school. Here are the most important parts: 1. Follow the specific instructions given by each school about staying in touch. Some schools do not want to be contacted, while others have specific ways they want to be contacted. 2. Discover the reason you are on the waiting list and try to address that issue. Common reasons include low test scores, not enough community service or leadership experience, low college math grades, or unclear career goals. 3. Show your application to someone knowledgeable and work together to identify and improve your weaknesses. 4. If needed, retake exams like the GMAT, since scores tend to improve after multiple attempts. 5.

Taking advantage of gaming laws that allow him to work in a casino while his gaming licence is pending, Sam doubles the casino's profits, which are skimmed by the mafia before they are reported to income tax agencies. Impressed with his work, mafia boss Remo Gaggi (Pasquale Cajano), sends Sam's childhood friend and mob enforcer Nicholas \\"Nicky\\" Santoro (Joe Pesci) and his associate Frank \\"Frankie\\" Marino (Frank Vincent) to protect Sam and the whole operation.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town – the first planned industrial estate in the world – had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared. Tangerine Dream was the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on 19 October 1975. In more recent years, Lancashire...  Guess a valid title for it!

Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing happened at 9:02 am and killed at least 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed one-third of the building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated 652 million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies in the wake of the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. Until the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States, and remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in the country's history. Within 90 minutes of the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, a veteran of the Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives parked in front of the building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and unhappy about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound..., can you guess it ?

Sewerage floods the alleyway; on either side of the narrow passage are aging buildings. The stench of urine fills the air. As we make our way into the night, I begin to make out shadows lining the side of the street. \\"Odijo, odijo,\\" they shout. Odijo is sheng (Kenyan slang) for teacher - it's an affectionate name they use for the man who has become something of a \\"messiah\\" for Nairobi's forgotten children. Clifford Oluoch is a primary school teacher in Nairobi by day but has been spending his evenings for the last three months feeding street children. \\"I was walking home one night and came across boys haggling for a cob of corn. I offered to buy them a cob each, more came, then more. By the end of the night, I had bought corn for 25 people,\\" he says. \\"They asked if I could come back tomorrow and do the same and I said I would. I've been keeping that promise.\\" The latest figures are difficult to come by but a 2012 Unicef report estimated that there were 250-300,000 homeless children in Kenya, most of them in the big cities. According to Nairobi-based charity Kenya Children of Hope, 63% of the cities' homeless children have been on the streets on a part- or full-time basis for up to five years. In the city centre, the vile smell of human waste, flowing near where we stand, mixes with a thick cloud of industrial glue - a drug of choice here. There is a group of about 20 youngsters waiting crouching on the concrete. Many of them are carrying small plastic containers - a few sniffs of glue can last for several hours. It smells strong and potent. I gesture to it and ask one boy why he uses it. \\"It makes me warm and makes it easier to sleep at night out here,\\" he says, before drawing three quick pulls from the plastic bottle. I sense he doesn't want to continue with the topic. His name is Thomas, he's 14 and has been living out here for the past four years. Thomas says he has seen many people trying to help but says he thinks \\"Odijo\\" is different. Some of the children here are from abusive homes, others left alcoholic parents behind. But the streets are no picnic either. \\"Life here is hard. Bad things happen, young boys get beaten up by the older homeless people and we fight for food,\\" says one of the boys huddled around me, he too is sniffing glue and his eyes are blood-shot. But they are mostly orderly and welcome me as Odijo's guest. They tell me he is like their \\"messiah\\". Earlier that evening, the teacher, his wife Benedette and their 13-year old daughter had buttered 30 loaves of bread. This type of meal costs about 2,000 Kenyan shillings (22; Â£14) a day. For months he has been splitting his salary between his wife and two children and 60 street children and says he was beginning to feel the pinch. Thankfully word is slowly started to spread in his community - this month he got a donor for bread. He says he can now use that money to see to other needs such as transporting someone to hospital, or helping some of the homeless women set up fruit stalls. Still, this is an expensive project to maintain on a teacher's salary, not to mention the time away from his family - up to three hours every evening. So why does he do it? \\"My wife and I feel strongly about helping other people,\\" he says. \\"We know what is it to grow up having nothing. We know how difficult life is when you have no-one. This is making a difference, that makes all of it worth it,\\"  Benedette told me earlier. It's dark now and he hands out the parcels quickly, desperate to get to the next location - for some this is the first and only meal of the day. What took him and his family an hour to prepare is gobbled down in 10 minutes. Some nights the feeding is followed by a counselling session - this is the most difficult part. \\"A lot of these children have been disappointed so many times and that's made some of them hard. I've learned that they are just hungry for love - for someone who will care about them,\\" he says, as if drowning under the weight of this task. The children have a lot of faith in him - he tells me they make him feel superhuman, like he can solve all their problems. He, of course, knows he can't. He has big plans to help get them off the streets - but with no-one else to help, that's a long way off. We take a short drive. A group of mothers is huddled under a flickering streetlight near a shopping centre in the affluent Westlands district. It's a busy area with fast-food restaurants. It smells of roasted garlic and warm curry - torture, even for me. As Clifford makes his way to them, a crowd of children no more than three years old runs to him, tugging at the plastic bags in his hands. Another feeding frenzy. \\"This is no place for children. I'm hoping to get the youngsters out while they still have a chance,\\" he says. One of the women tells me says she's been homeless for seven years and has no skills to speak of. Her son, Wesley, just a year old, has a cold, so we walk to a nearby pharmacy where Clifford buys him medication. The contrast of the woman and baby in their grubby clothes and the health worker in his crisp white coats is stark. \\"They know I don't give them money. I don't encourage people to give them money either but if I can help with things like buying medicine then I do,\\" explains Clifford as we walk out. By this point the woman and her boy have disappeared back into the night. Clifford has learned that the streets are addictive and that some people cannot leave - some do not even want to. This is all they know. Being a Good Samaritan can be a thankless task as some sell the clothes he collects for them to buy drugs or alcohol.

It is the first theatrical release in the Pokémon franchise.It was released in Japan on July 18, 1998. The English-language adaptation, produced by 4Kids Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures (under its Kids' WB banner), was released in North America on November 12, 1999.The film primarily consists of three segments: Pikachu's Vacation, a 21-minute feature focusing on the series mascot Pikachu; Origin of Mewtwo, a 10-minute featurette that functions as a prologue to the main feature; and Mewtwo Strikes Back, the main 75 minute film feature. The North American version omitted Origin of Mewtwo from the package before its U.S. theatrical run due to its dark nature, as the target MPAA rating was G; the first two minutes were restored in the film's release on VHS and DVD as The Story of Mewtwo's Origin. The featurette was eventually dubbed and restored as a special feature in the U.S. release of the direct-to-video follow-up film sequel Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns as The Uncut Story of Mewtwo's Origin.As Pokémon was extremely popular when the film was released, it was a box office success worldwide.

By Sophie Jane Evans PUBLISHED: 15:00 EST, 18 November 2013 | UPDATED: 18:01 EST, 18 November 2013 Europe's most active volcano Mount Etna has erupted - spewing molten lava thousand of feet above the Sicilian countryside. The two-day explosion last weekend was the third major burst of activity in under a month, after eruptions on October 26 and again on November 10-11, with the latter burying a seismic station and the access road. The latest outburst sent thick plumes of smoke and ash over the Italian island last night. It was at its height between midnight and 5am on Sunday morning.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Some adhesives, such as \\"cut-back\\" adhesives and \\"mastic,\\" were often mixed with asbestos up until the late 1980s, and are still occasionally used today. These adhesives were most commonly used to bond the floor to tiles or to heating and air ducts, not to carpets, and are often black in color. If you suspect your adhesive contains asbestos, do not use this method, as sanding or scraping the dry adhesive can release dangerous asbestos fibers into the air. Refer to the solvent section instead, or hire a professional to remove the asbestos. Chipping and scraping off the old adhesive can be tedious, although not much more so than using a solvent. The main benefit is a lower risk of discoloring the wood or clogging its pores. After using this method, it should be easy to bond a new stain or finish to the wood. However, if there is an existing finish you plan to leave on, or if you plan to cover the floor with a new carpet, the solvent method may save you some time.  Note: renting a wet/dry vacuum from a tool rental service is highly recommended for quick, safe cleanup after the adhesive is removed. If you're lucky, the adhesive will chip right off when you apply pressure with a putty knife. Some areas may take more pressure than others. Only use a plastic putty knife, not metal, to avoid scratching the floor. If the adhesive only comes off in tiny chips, try making it easier to remove with dry ice as described below, or use solvents instead. Pick the widest putty knife you can find to make the task less tedious. If you plan to apply a new stain or finish to the floor, this is your best option for making adhesive removal easier without affecting the wood pores. Place pieces of dry ice in a cookie tray and slide the tray over each section of adhesive before you chip, to make the glue brittle and easier to remove. Always follow these safety precautions before you buy dry ice:  Wear thick gloves while handling dry ice, as the extreme cold can instantly cause painful skin damage. Always store and work with dry ice in a well-ventilated room, and leave immediately if you have trouble breathing. Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide, and can fill a small space with unbreathable gas. Do not store in an airtight container, which may explode as the dry ice expands into gas. Clean up the chips of adhesive using a wet/dry vacuum if possible, or a broom. Your local government may require you to dispose of them at a waste collection center, rather than adding it to your ordinary trash, since some adhesives contain toxic materials. However, since you did not use any solvents, you may be able to dispose of adhesives normally; contact local waste collection services to find out about local regulations. The floor may need to be sanded to clear up any scuff marks caused by the carpet installation or the glue removal. Use 16 or 24 grit sandpaper, but go slowly to avoid scraping into the wood. Optionally, sand away the old finish in preparation for adding a new stain and/or finish. Sanding away the adhesive itself is not recommended, as the sandpaper will quickly get clogged and need replacing. Heat from the friction may also melt the adhesive, which can be messy.

The white sands, imported from the far west mountains of limestone, sucked up the fire of the huge red sun. It was always hot in the south desert. Even in the deep of night the stones of Gazu Kadem kept the city warm. Now, at mid-day, it was at its hottest. A quarter of a million people at the arena didn't make it any cooler. The merchants, nobles, and the slaves lucky enough to attend had waited outside Dan Trex's arena for days. They knew the value of entertainment in such a dark world. They wore cowls to protect themselves from the sun as they waited. Entire businesses thrived on the forced mercantile of the captive audience. Food went for thrice its cost to those waiting near the entrance. Water went for five times as much. The arena was as old as the city, built in the days of the old empire for a king now long forgotten. The octagonal arena was a machine, an engine that built warriors out of the raw material of flesh, blood, and steel. Now, thousands of years later, it still served that purpose. The machine had built Dan Trex's army, half a million of the most ruthless and well trained soldiers to ever walk the planet. While one hundred and fifty thousand civilians and slaves got drunk, gambled, shat, fucked, and slept on the stone steps; one hundred thousand of his men sat in silence wearing black and bronze and watching him as Trex walked out into the arena alone and unhelmed. His soldiers watched the games in silence. They made not a sound when twelve of the most beautiful girls to walk on small bare feet were raped and flayed apart by dark priests in a ritual to Gazu Kadem's god-king, Danken Ovelde. They studied the three-horned desert bull as it gored five slaves. They watched the spear technique of four slave armies as they warred in a single great battle. They watched blades of silver spray fans of red blood into the air. They watched vital organs spill onto the white sands. They heard men and women scream as life left them. They...

A three-horned desert bull goring five slaves. 3. Four slave armies partaking in a single great battle. Keeping in mind the time it would take for each of these events to unfold, along with additional time for preparations, transitions, and potential smaller events not mentioned in the context, one could estimate that the event would likely last for several hours, possibly spanning an entire day or even longer.

Question: Who is the plaintiff in Hill v. McDonough? Context: Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.

Which team had fewer athletes with increased blood flow to the muscles before the race?  Two teams were competing in a 5 km race. White team warmed up before the race, but Blue team arrived with a bus late and didn't have time to warm up properly before the race.  Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the Blue team had fewer athletes with increased blood flow to the muscles before the race, as they arrived late and didn't have time to warm up properly.

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it’s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.

Q:Jimmy is currently shopping at his local grocery store during his weekly trip to get food and other necessities. He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk.  Which brand of milk has lower eutrophication potential per hectare of farmland?  Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). A:","output":"Based on the hint provided, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland compared to conventional milk production. This is mainly due to potentially reduced leaching of nitrates (NO3-) and phosphates (PO4-) as a result of lower fertilizer application rates.

They had many mutual interests, including geology and earthquakes.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person lived farther from Kauai island? The answer is:","output":"Pete lived farther from Kauai Island.  To provide a detailed explanation, let's first discuss the locations of Alaska and Hawaii. Alaska is the northwest-most state in the United States, which is a non-contiguous state as it is geographically separated from the contiguous 48 states. Alaska is the largest state and is situated adjacent to the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the south, Canada's British Columbia, and the Yukon Territory to the east.  On the other hand, Hawaii is also a non-contiguous state in the United States. It is located in the North Pacific Ocean and is the southernmost state with the closest continents being North America, Asia, and Australia. Hawaii is an archipelago consisting of eight major islands, one of which is Kauai Island. Kauai Island is the oldest and most northwestern of the major Hawaiian Islands.  Now, considering the distances, Alaska is considerably farther away from Kauai Island compared to Hawaii. The distance from Alaska to Kauai Island is approximately 2,640 miles (4,250 kilometers), depending on the specific location in Alaska, which is much farther compared to the distance between Kauai Island and the other major islands of Hawaii. For example, the distance between Kauai Island and the island of Oahu, where Hawaii's capital, Honolulu, is located, is about 102 miles (164 kilometers). Since Pete lived in Alaska and visited his friend Julia in Hawaii, who is geographically closer to Kauai Island, we can safely say that Pete lived farther from Kauai Island compared to Julia. Their shared interests in geology and earthquakes are relevant to both their locations given that both Hawaii and Alaska are known for their volcanic and seismic activities. Nonetheless, when considering the geographic distance between the two, Pete undoubtedly lived farther from Kauai Island than Julia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This research aims to assess and understand changes in both species’ populations and their interactions within the region while also identifying potential threats to their survival and to the overall health of the water habitat. Project Overview and Objectives In response to increasing concerns about fluctuations in species abundance, experts from various marine science institutions have joined forces to conduct an in-depth analysis of the marine ecosystem in Jersey waters. This collaborative effort intends to monitor, document, and investigate the possible causes behind the changes observed in the marine life inhabiting the area.  The primary objectives of the study include: - Assessing the current state of biodiversity in Jersey waters - Documenting the shifting patterns of species distribution and abundance - Investigating the impacts of climate change, pollution, and human activities on the local marine life - Identifying measures to mitigate potential threats to the ecosystem - Increasing public awareness and collaborative efforts to protect Jersey's marine environment Methodology and Data Collection A holistic approach will be employed to collect data and analyze the dynamics of Jersey's marine ecosystem. The methods of data collection will involve tracking and monitoring of various marine species, documenting habitat shifts, oceanographic measurements, water quality assessments, and a review of historical data. Specifically, the methods will include: 1. Conducting underwater surveys to monitor species composition, abundance, and distribution. 2. Utilizing GPS-tagged devices to track the movement and migration of larger marine species such as sharks and whales. 3. Employing remote sensing technology to study oceanographic variables such as sea-surface temperatures, ocean currents, and chlorophyll concentrations. 4. Conducting water quality tests to assess the levels of pollution and the impact of nutrient availability on species distributions. 5. Comparing the current state of the ecosystem with historical data to identify trends in species population fluctuations and habitat changes. Expected Outcomes and Significance of the Study The results of this extensive research will provide invaluable insights into the complex dynamics of the Jersey marine ecosystem. Documenting fluctuations in species diversity, abundance, and distribution will contribute to identifying the potential factors responsible for these changes, such as climate change, pollution, and human activities. Understanding the direct and indirect influences of these factors on the marine environment will help inform the development of adaptive management strategies to mitigate the identified threats. Furthermore, the findings are expected to foster public interest and support to protect the region's invaluable marine resources and bolster the role of marine conservation efforts. Conclusion Jersey waters are rich in biodiversity, and their health is essential not only for the island's flora and fauna but also for its economy and ecology. With an ever-growing global population's need for resource utilization and climate change accelerating the decline of marine ecosystems worldwide, the importance of analyzing and understanding the processes that impact our seas is paramount. The collaboration of sea life experts in studying the Jersey waters' marine life is a critical step in unravelling the mysteries of species interactions and reactions to environmental changes. As we move towards deciphering the intertwined challenges our ocean faces, we must raise public awareness and encourage responsible stewardship of the marine world to address these threats and ensure a sustainable future for all life on earth, on land and at sea."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"The Royal Navy's second new aircraft carrier, the Prince of Wales, is to be brought into service rather than sold off or mothballed, Prime Minister David Cameron has announced.\\" Article:","output":"\\"The Second Jewel in the Crown: Prince of Wales Aircraft Carrier to be Commissioned\\" In a significant development for the Royal Navy, United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron has announced that the Queen's second new aircraft carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, will enter into active service. This move avoids the speculated fate of the ship being mothballed or sold off, which was largely anticipated amidst budgetary pressures and operational requirements. Designed and built in the UK, the HMS Prince of Wales stands as a shining emblem of British maritime prowess and a testament to the nation's resilience. With a displacement of around 65,000 tonnes and a length exceeding 280 metres, this supercarrier is second in a series of two, her sister ship being the HMS Queen Elizabeth. The decision to commission the Prince of Wales into active service has been influenced by various strategic and defensive considerations. Firstly, the ongoing global unrest and the ever-evolving nature of security threats necessitated the need for bolstering the nation's naval power. Secondly, it assures the Royal Navy of an enhanced capability of projecting air power anywhere in the world. Despite concerns related to cost, maintenance, and operation, the decision highlights the government's commitment to upholding Britain's long-standing naval tradition and sustaining its global influence. It reinforces the continued relevance and indispensability of sea power in global politics and armed conflict. The introduction of HMS Prince of Wales has been met with distinct approval from the Navy. Senior figures within the institution have long argued for the significance of a two-carrier fleet. The announcement strengthens Britain's strategic maritime capabilities, enabling it to maintain a permanent carrier strike presence, and offer a greater degree of flexibility in managing global commitments and contingencies. Interestingly, the decision will also impact the domestic front, especially on the employment sector. The maintenance and servicing of the Prince of Wales are likely to create jobs, boost local economies, and supply chains, in addition to enhancing the country's engineering and defense manufacturing skills base. While many pundits were skeptical over HMS Prince of Wales's future, fearing it would follow the path of several Royal Navy vessels that have been decommissioned, sold, or mothballed due to budget constraints, Prime Minister Cameron's announcement has put those concerns to rest. It asserts that maintaining and enhancing national security continues to be a number one priority for his administration. The coming years will indeed be historic ones for Britain's naval defense, with the Prince of Wales embarking on various missions around the globe. Its operational readiness is set to escalate the Royal Navy's deterrence capabilities, significantly contributing to the safeguarding of British interests at home and overseas. To conclude, the planned commissioning of the HMS Prince of Wales signals a momentous milestone in Britain’s naval history, reinforcing the fact that the country's maritime strength remains a cornerstone of its national defense and global standing. It represents the government's dedicated commitment to ensuring the Royal Navy retains its reputation as a world-leading maritime force, capable of responding effectively and powerfully to any threat."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

The men were working as part of a third-shift underground production crew.      WHAT HAPPENED? What caused the Cargill elevator to stop?      HELP: Families waited for Cargill miners' safe return      NY RESPONSE: Gov. Cuomo issues statement on Cargill mine rescue      e-NEWSPAPER: See coverage in The Ithaca Journal      Cargill spokesman Mark Klein said Thursday afternoon that a steel guide beam that keeps the elevator centered is the most likely cause of the mechanical failure. The beam might have come out of line, he said, and that could have caused the elevator to stop in the shaft.      An outgoing shift had used the same two-level elevator about five minutes before the 17 men descended down the shaft, Wilczynski said, and there had been no indications of a possible problem.      Cargill Mine Manager Shawn Wilczynski talks at an early morning press conference at the Lansing Fire Department after 17 mine staff were stuck in an elevator at 900 feet below the ground. SIMON WHEELER / Staff Video      Cargill intends to perform a full safety check of the elevator once it can be removed from the shaft, according to Wilczynski, who described that process as a \\"slow and purposeful approach,\\" without a timetable as of Thursday.      He said Cargill will work with the federal Mine Health and Safety Administration, or MSHA, regarding safety plans in light of the accident, in addition to performing an inspection of the malfunctioned elevator. If necessary, he said, the elevator could be replaced.      “We will not go back to work until all our infrastructure is back in 100 percent safe operating conditions. We will take whatever time is necessary.” Shawn Wilczynski, Cargill Mine Manager      \\"We will not go back to work until all our infrastructure is back in 100 percent safe operating conditions,\\" Wilczynski said. \\"We will take whatever time is necessary.\\"      Cargill also has a stockpile of salt in its inventory, he added, so there is no concern about the company's inability to serve customers with work temporarily suspended.      The rescue      The crane rescue effort at Cargill Salt Mine in Lansing recovered the first group of workers at about 7 a.m. The last workers were pulled up at about 8:10 a.m.      A crane from Auburn Crane & Rigging was used to lower a rescue basket and bring the men up four at a time.      Throughout the endeavor, company officials and emergency responders kept in radio contact with the miners, said Joe Mareane, Tompkins County administrator.

(Photo: Simon Wheeler / Staff photo)      Emergency management officials said the miners did whatever they could to keep in good spirits during the rescue efforts. Wilczynski said officials got them blankets, heat packs and other supplies, but the miners managed to keep themselves in fair condition while waiting for their rescue.      \\"All 17 miners carry with them at all times their personal equipment, and that includes their own cap-lamp for illumination,\\" Wilczynski said. \\"They also had their full complement of food they'd bring down for their dinners; there's one individual ... he brings a lunch bucket full of food every time.\\"      Apart from being cold due to their prolonged exposure to low temperatures, the miners were all in good physical health at the time of their rescue, officials said.      The mine shaft descends 2,300 feet to the deepest salt mine in North America.      The mine produces road de-icing salt from deposits deep beneath Cayuga Lake. According to the company's website, it has been in operation since 1921 as the Rock Salt Corp. Cargill has operated it since 1970.      911 call      An emergency call was placed to the Tompkins County 911 Center at 11:40 p.m. Wednesday, according to a Tompkins County news release. Firefighters from Lansing, Ithaca, Cayuga Heights, along with Tompkins County Sheriff's deputies and the Tompkins County Department of Emergency Management answered the call.      \\"Our first job was to make sure the elevator was secure and the miners were safe,\\" said Assistant Lansing Fire Chief Dennis Griffin. \\"We might've changed our game plans five or six times.\\"      Firefighters were prepared to rappel down the shaft and pull out the stranded miners one at at time, he said, but the crane rescue became the best available option.      The elevator has two levels for passengers and, according to Wilczynski, there were passengers on both levels of the device.      Safety issues      Cargill has reported 21 problems with hoists at the Cayuga Lake salt mine since the start of 2013, according to data compiled and made available online by the MSHA. Most of them involved electrical problems that interrupted power to the hoist.      “Hoist” is the term used for elevators and other vertical conveyances at mines. Any time a hoist is out of service for 30 minutes or more, it must be reported as an accident, according to Ellen Smith, owner and managing editor of Mine Safety and Health News, an independent news publication based in Pittsford, Monroe County.

(Photo: SIMON WHEELER / Staff Photo)      The other active salt mine in New York, American Rock Salt’s facility in Livingston County, has reported only four hoist-related accidents in that time period, the MSHA data show.      The most recent incident at Cargill occurred just five days ago, when a hoist known as No. 3 lost power when an electrical breaker tripped and would not reset. It took 45 minutes to repair. No one was working underground in the mine at the time.      Elevators have failed numerous times while miners were at work, however. Workers were forced to evacuate the mine five times in 2014 and five times in 2013 after one of the elevators failed.      By law, underground miners must have two separate means of egress, Smith said. If one is out of service, the mine must be evacuated.      Cargill officials confirmed Thursday afternoon that hoist No. 3 was involved in the incident.      The MSHA data noted past problems with hoists 1, 2 and 3, although No. 3 had by far the most reported problems.      No injuries have been associated with the incidents, according to accident summaries on the MSHA data website. There is no mention of workers being stranded on a stalled elevator in the past three years.      In March 2010, a contract truck driver was killed at the Lansing mine when a 150-ton salt bin collapsed.      According to the MSHA, the piece of a 150-ton salt bin that corroded and caused the collapse that killed contract truck driver Rolland F. Clark on March 24 was not visible from the ground, and MSHA inspectors are not \\"trained or expected\\" to carefully examine such structures.      New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a statement Thursday praising the rescue and calling for an investigation into the incident.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  used to work in the factory  for the following movie plot:  Michael Moore is an eccentric, self-taught documentary film director who begins by introducing himself and his family through 8 mm archival home movies; in a voice-over, he describes himself as \\"kind of a strange child,\\" the Irish American Catholic middle-class son of a General Motors employee assembling AC Spark Plugs. Moore chronicles how GM had previously defined his childhood while growing up in Flint, Michigan, and how the company was the primary economic and social hub of the town. He points out that Flint is the place where the 1937 Flint Sit-Down Strike occurred, resulting in the birth of the United Auto Workers. He reveals that his heroes were the Flint natives who had escaped the life in GM's factories, including the members of Grand Funk Railroad, Casey Kasem, the spouses of Zubin Mehta (Nancy Kovack) and Don Knotts, and \\"Flint's most famous native son,\\" game show host Bob Eubanks.Initially, he achieves his dream of avoiding the dreary tradition of blue-collared factory life that lays for the majority of the population of Flint; by moving to California and working for a magazine in San Francisco, but this venture fails for him and he ultimately travels back to Flint. As he returns (in 1985), General Motors announces the layoffs of thousands of Flint auto workers, the jobs of whom will go to cheaper labor when the plant relocates to Mexico. GM makes this announcement even though the company is (according to Moore) experiencing record profits.Disguised as a TV journalist from Toledo, Ohio, Moore interviews some auto workers in Flint and discovers their strong antipathy to General Motors chairman Roger B. Smith. Moore begins seeking out Smith himself to confront him with an \\"up-close-and-personal\\" interview about the closing of the Flint auto factories.

While determining where to place spaces, I'll be guided by the rules of the English language, as well as presumptions about the format of addresses, company names, dates, and technical/legal notes. 1. Breaking down company details: First, I'm going to separate individual words and details related to the company and address.  - \\"ifmelectronicgmbh\\": This appears to be a company name, which should be \\"ifm electronic gmbh\\". - \\"•Friedrichstraße1•45128Essen\\": This seems to be a street address in Germany (Friedrichstraße 1, 45128 Essen). - The bullet character (•) can be considered as a separator.

Handling reservation clause: Next, I notice the segment of text starting with \\"Wereservetherighttomaketechnicalalterationswithoutpriornotice.\\" This appears to be a standard non-liability clause. Let's break it down: - \\"Wereservetherighttomaketechnicalalterationswithoutpriornotice\\": This can be separated into \\"We reserve the right to make technical alterations without prior notice.\\" After adding these modifications, the sentence so far becomes \\"ifm electronic gmbh • Friedrichstraße 1 • 45128 Essen - We reserve the right to make technical alterations without prior notice.\\" 3. Identifying product details and date: To wrap up, I'll divide the final details which seem to be related to a product model number and the date: - \\"—GB—SV5200—03.06.2015\\": Here, I can establish that \\"GB\\" and \\"SV5200\\" are likely separate entities (looks like product identifiers or codes), and \\"03.06.2015\\" is probably a date. Therefore, this segment becomes: \\"- GB - SV5200 - 03.06.2015.\\" So, the final version of the separated text is: \\"ifm electronic gmbh • Friedrichstraße 1 • 45128 Essen - We reserve the right to make technical alterations without prior notice. - GB - SV5200 - 03.06.2015.\\" This step-wise breakdown splits the original text into more readable sentences and phrases while maintaining their meanings and serving the reader's clarity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.  Paragraph: Italy and Greece attended the World Ecological Conference. they were looking for solutions to improve their environment.

Input: Question: How long has the Scottish Football Association been in existence when they delayed processing Cadete's registration? Passage:On 24 February 1996, Cadete was introduced at Celtic Park, Glasgow to supporters before Celtic's league match against Partick Thistle. However, due to lengthy negotiations between Celtic and Sporting and issues with registering the player, his transfer was not finalised until April, and turned out to be controversial: despite being signed prior to the transfer deadline, the Scottish Football Association delayed processing his registration in time for the Scottish Cup semi-finals against Rangers at Hampden Park, and following a complaint from Celtic chairman Fergus McCann, SFA chief Jim Farry was eventually relieved of his duties after being found guilty of deliberately holding back the player's registration. His eventual debut came at home against Aberdeen as he came off the bench to score his team's fifth goal in a 5–0 win, thus becoming an instant hit; the loud roar generated by the fans celebrating his goal blew out BBC Radio 5's microphones, who had been covering the game UK wide on radio, and they went off air for a short time until it was repaired.

In December 2007 Viz began releasing the series under the name \\"Wild Ones\\" and under the Shojo Beat label in America. A preview of the manga series was seen in the November 2007 issue of \\"Shojo Beat\\". Hypothesis: Wild ones is a Japanese manga that only released in Japan.","output":"Based on the given context, we cannot draw the hypothesis that Wild Ones is a Japanese manga that only released in Japan. The context provides several important insights that specifically mention the release of the manga in America. 1. The context states that Viz, an American manga publisher and distributor, began releasing the series under the name \\"Wild Ones\\" in December 2007. This clearly indicates that Wild Ones was not exclusive to Japan and was indeed available outside of Japan, specifically, in America. 2. Another point to consider is the mention of the Shojo Beat label. Shojo Beat is a North American manga anthology, which also suggests that Wild Ones has been released in regions beyond Japan. 3. Furthermore, the context highlights that a preview of the manga series was featured in the November 2007 issue of \\"Shojo Beat,\\" which further confirms its presence and availability in the American market. In conclusion, taking into account the information provided in the context, we cannot infer that Wild Ones is a Japanese manga that only released in Japan.

On Christmas Eve, the submarine USS Copperfin, under the command of Captain Cassidy, departs San Francisco on a secret mission. At sea, Cassidy opens his sealed orders, which direct him to proceed first to the Aleutian Islands to pick up meteorologist Lt. Raymond, then to Tokyo Bay to obtain vital weather intelligence for the upcoming Doolittle Raid. On the way, two Japanese planes attack; both are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. When Mike goes to pick him up, he is stabbed to death. New recruit Tommy Adams shoots the pilot, but because he was slow to react, Tommy blames himself for Mike's death and volunteers to defuse an unexploded bomb stuck under the deck. When Mike is buried at sea, Greek-American \\"Tin Can\\" (Dane Clark) does not attend the service, which angers the other men until he explains that every Allied death causes him great pain.  Meanwhile, Raymond, who lived in Japan, discusses how the Japanese people were led into the war by the military faction. As the submarine nears Tokyo Bay, the Copperfin has to negotiate its way through protective minefields and anti-torpedo nets. When a Japanese ship enters the bay, Cassidy follows in its wake.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which country was more regulated in regards to foreign currency exchange?  Hint: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Pakistan was more regulated in regards to foreign currency exchange because they created the foreign exchange control department to attempt control over the market and prevent devaluation of their currency.

Bowe Bergdahl scribbled the letters “SF?” on a paper plate, seeking confirmation that he was with Special Operations forces.      “Yes!” one of the troops hollered back above the din of the aircraft’s blades, according to a defense official who described Bergdahl’s first moments of freedom. “We’ve been looking for you for a long time.”      Bergdahl, 28, who had been held captive nearly five years, broke down in tears.      His release was secured after the Obama administration, working through Qatari government intermediaries, agreed to free five high-profile Afghan inmates held by the U.S. military in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The influential commanders, including the former head of the Taliban’s army, were loaded onto a U.S. military aircraft bound for Qatar after U.S. officials got confirmation that Bergdahl had been freed.      Bergdahl’s “safety and health were both in jeopardy,” and officials had to act quickly to obtain his release, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Sunday, according to the Associated Press.      1 of 33 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Caption U.S. Army Sgt.

U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is seen in this undated photo. Courtesy of Kim Harrison Buy Photo      President Obama hailed Bergdahl’s recovery as a triumph of years of high-wire diplomatic efforts that reached a breakthrough in the waning months of the U.S. combat mission there.      “He wasn’t forgotten by his country,” Obama said Saturday evening in the Rose Garden, standing alongside Bergdahl’s parents, Robert and Jani. “The United States of America does not ever leave our men and women in uniform behind.”      His father, who grew a long beard in a gesture of solidarity with his son, said a few words to him in Pashto, the language spoken in southern Afghanistan, saying that he understood his son is having trouble speaking English.      “I am your father, Bowe,” Robert Bergdahl said. “I look forward to continuing the recovery of our son which will be a considerable task for our family.”      While leaders across the political spectrum expressed relief at the news, prominent Republican lawmakers chided the White House for skirting a legal requirement to notify them about the planned release of Guantanamo inmates. Some criticized the president for breaking with longtime U.S. policy against negotiating with militant groups.      “This fundamental shift in U.S. policy signals to terrorists around the world a greater incentive to take US hostages,” Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.      The AP reported Hagel, who was traveling to Afghanistan to meet with U.S. troops, as saying that the action was not relayed to Congress because of its urgency. He said intelligence indicated that Bergdahl’s “health was deteriorating.”      Peaceful exchange      Bergdahl’s release at 10:30 a.m. in Khost province, which borders Pakistan, capped a week of intense, secret negotiations conducted through the Qataris. A team of dozens of Special Operations forces took custody of Bergdahl from a group of 18 Taliban fighters. The rare encounter on the battlefield between warriors who have spent years killing one another lasted just a few minutes and was peaceful, U.S. officials said.      Bergdahl walked onto the aircraft, U.S. officials said, suggesting he is in relatively stable health. Officials said it was too early to know anything definitive about the mental state of a soldier who bewildered his comrades after he walked off base in volatile Paktika province on June 30, 2009.      Officials at the Pentagon, who had grown concerned that the end of the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of the year would dim the prospect of getting Bergdahl back alive, rejoiced.      “It is our ethos that we never leave a fallen comrade,” Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a statement. “Today we have back in our ranks the only remaining captured soldier from our conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Welcome home Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.”      There was no indication that the soldier would face any reprimand for the circumstances under which he was taken, which led some of his comrades to call him a deserter. While it is unclear whether he will remain on active duty, a senior U.S. military official said the Army plans to promote Bergdahl to staff sergeant next month.      “I can’t imagine there would be repercussions,” said the official, who was among several who would speak about the case only on the condition of anonymity.      Defense officials said they were working to get Bergdahl to the United States as soon as possible. After passing through Bagram air base in Afghanistan, Bergdahl was en route to the U.S military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, according to Pentagon officials traveling with Hagel.      They said his first U.S. stop would likely be the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, where after a thorough medical screening he will likely be debriefed by intelligence officials.      Year-long stay in Qatar      The released inmates include Mullah Mohammad Fazl, a former Taliban deputy defense minister. U.S. officials said that under a memorandum of understanding signed by Washington and Doha, the men will be subject to a year-long travel ban in Qatar. They declined to offer more details about any restrictions the men would face but expressed confidence that their release would not put Americans in harm’s way.      “The United States has coordinated closely with Qatar to ensure that security measures are in place and the national security of the United States will not be compromised,” Hagel said in a statement from Singapore, where he was attending a security conference. “Sgt. Bergdahl’s return is a powerful reminder of the enduring, sacred commitment our nation makes to all those who serve in uniform.”      Hagel informed members of Congress on Saturday about the prisoner swap deal. The administration is required by law to notify Congress about its intention to release Guantanamo detainees 30 days in advance.      “Due to a near-term opportunity to save Sergeant Bergdahl’s life, we moved as quickly as possible,” a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to explain the timing of the congressional notification. “The administration determined that given these unique and exigent circumstances, such a transfer should go forward notwithstanding the notice requirement” in the law.      Talks falter, then revive      The Obama administration began seriously exploring the possibility of negotiating Bergdahl’s release in late 2011, when secret talks between U.S. diplomats and members of the Taliban appeared to be gaining traction. The talks, part of a broader effort to explore a negotiated end of a conflict that had only become deadlier as the White House approved a surge of 30,000 troops in 2009, collapsed in March 2012 when the Taliban suspended them, arguing that the United States was not acting in good faith.      Last summer, when the Taliban was allowed to open a political office in the Qatari capital, American officials grew hopeful that prisoner swap negotiations could resume. The effort foundered just hours after the office formally opened after the Afghan government protested that the Taliban had been given de-facto diplomatic status.      Unexpectedly, representatives of the Taliban conveyed to U.S. officials last fall that they were once again amenable to discussing the release of Bergdahl, but set as a condition that they would only deal with Washington through intermediaries, American officials said.      U.S. officials received a video of Bergdahl last fall after they had demanded proof that he remained alive. Unlike past videos of the captive, the one released last year was delivered privately, rather than through the Taliban’s media operatives. It showed the soldier looking “very gaunt, haggard,” a U.S. military official who has seen clips said.      In a departure of its former negotiating stance, the administration sought to enhance the American offer of a prisoner exchange by proposing to release the five men simultaneously. Taliban representatives had objected to the previous proposed plan, under which the inmates would be turned over in stages in an effort to test whether the Taliban and the Qatari intermediaries could guarantee that the men would not return to militancy.      A statement issued Saturday by the Taliban said the men would be residing with their families in Qatar, a tiny, wealthy Gulf emirate.      U.S. officials said they had no indication that the Taliban was open to more substantive talks but expressed hope that the swap would build trust.      “We continue to hope there will be a decision by the Taliban to move forward to initiate a political dialogue with the Afghan government, and it is our hope that the events leading to Sergeant Bergdahl’s return could potentially open the door for broader discussions with the Taliban by building confidence that the two sides can negotiate honestly with each other,” a senior administration official said.      A celebration in Idaho      The Obama administration has sought to keep Bergdahl’s profile relatively low over the years, fearing that widespread publicity of his plight would boost his value in the eyes of the Taliban and strengthen the group’s negotiating hand. For a period, White House officials asked that several U.S. newspapers refrain from publishing his name in the context of peace talks.      As his hopes dimmed, Bergdahl’s father sought to personally secure his son’s release by learning Pashto and attempting to contact the Taliban online.      Bergdahl’s parents had traveled to Washington for a Memorial Day event and stayed in town for a few days to attend meetings with senior U.S. officials. They were in Washington when Obama called them Saturday morning to deliver the news, U.S. officials said.      “We were so joyful and relieved when President Obama called us today to give us the news that Bowe is finally coming home!” Bergdahl’s parents said in a statement. “We cannot wait to wrap our arms around our only son. Today, we are ecstatic!”      In Bergdahl’s home town of Hailey, Idaho, there was jubilation Saturday. Residents had been planning a June 28 concert to call attention to his plight. They were expecting up to 7,000 people to attend, and singer Carole King was going to perform for free.      The concert will go on, said organizer Stefanie O’Neill, but it is now going to be “the biggest welcome-home party the country has ever seen.”      Kim Harrison, who said she was listed as Bergdahl’s godmother in his military records, said, “I’m excited, I’m kind of numb, and I hope that they take it easy on him when he gets back.”      She said she knows Bergdahl as the precocious teenager who took ballet with her daughter and came to spend hours at the Harrison house in Ketchum, Idaho, reading poetry and studying philosophy. She described Bergdahl as a sensitive young man who “questioned everything” and who went to Afghanistan because he wanted to help people.      “Now the only thing I can think of worth talking about is protecting him from people criticizing him and trying to find a negative source of why he left in the first place,” she said.      Karen DeYoung, traveling in Asia with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and Anne Gearan, Julie Tate and Stephanie McCrummen in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| WASHINGTON — The lone American prisoner of war from the Afghan conflict, captured by insurgents nearly five years ago, has been released to American forces in exchange for five Taliban detainees held at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, Obama administration officials said Saturday.      The soldier, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, 28, was handed over to American Special Operations troops inside Afghanistan near the Pakistan border about 10:30 a.m. Saturday in a tense but uneventful exchange with 18 Taliban officials, American officials said. Moments later, Sergeant Bergdahl was whisked away by the helicopter-borne commandos, American officials said. He was described in good physical condition.      The five Taliban detainees at Guantánamo, including two senior militant commanders said to be linked to operations that killed American and allied troops as well as implicated in murdering thousands of Shiites in Afghanistan, were flown from Cuba in the custody of officials from Qatar, who will accompany them back to that Persian Gulf state. They will be subject to security restrictions there, including a one-year travel ban.      Photo      Senior administration officials cautioned that the discussions over the prisoner swap, which were secretly restarted last fall after collapsing several months earlier, did not necessarily presage the resumption of the broader, on-again-off-again peace talks to end the 13-year war.      “This is the only issue we’ve discussed with the Taliban in recent months,” said one senior Obama administration official involved in the talks. “We do hope that having succeeded in this narrow but important step, it will create the possibility of expanding the dialogue to other issues. But we don’t have any promises to that effect.”      But word of renewed, secret negotiations with the Taliban brought immediate criticism from some lawmakers, including Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. “I have little confidence in the security assurances regarding the movement and activities of the now-released Taliban leaders, and I have even less confidence in this administration’s willingness to ensure they are enforced,” he said. “I believe this decision will threaten the lives of American soldiers for years to come.”      A Western official in Kabul said the Afghan government was not told ahead of time that the Taliban were going to hand over Sergeant Bergdahl or that the release of prisoners from Guantánamo Bay was proceeding, though the Afghans were broadly aware that the talks had been rekindled. American officials feared leaks could scuttle the deal.      President Obama personally called the soldier’s parents on Saturday, shortly after Sergeant Bergdahl was transferred to the American military; the Bergdahl family was in Washington after a visit here for Memorial Day, officials said.      Later on Saturday in the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Obama, flanked by Robert and Jani Bergdahl, the sergeant’s parents, said, “Right now, our top priority is making sure that Bowe gets the care and support that he needs, and that he can be reunited with his family as soon as possible.”      The Bergdahls, who have waged a tireless campaign for their son’s release, have sometimes criticized the Obama administration for lack of action. But at the impromptu Rose Garden appearance and in a statement released earlier in the day, they praised the American and Qatari governments for their help. “We cannot wait to wrap our arms around our only son,” they said in the statement. “Today, we are ecstatic!”      Family and friends in the Bergdahl family’s hometown, Hailey, Idaho, said they were planning a celebration on Sunday. A Pentagon official said Saturday evening that Sergeant Bergdahl was en route to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. He would then be transferred to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio when doctors felt he was fit to travel.      Continue reading the main story Video      Negotiations and internal deliberations over the potential for a swap have waxed and waned for years, but they intensified in the past several weeks as an agreement appeared within reach, according to an official familiar with the matter.      Among other complications, there was a potential legal obstacle: Congress has imposed statutory restrictions on the transfer of detainees from Guantánamo Bay. The statutes say the secretary of defense must determine that a transfer is in the interest of national security, that steps have been taken to substantially mitigate a future threat by a released detainee, and that the secretary notify Congress 30 days before any transfer of his determination.      In this case, the secretary, Chuck Hagel, acknowledged in a statement that he did not notify Congress ahead of time. When Mr. Obama signed a bill containing the latest version of the transfer restrictions into law, he issued a signing statement claiming that he could lawfully override them under his executive powers.      “The executive branch must have the flexibility, among other things, to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers,” he wrote in the signing statement, adding that if the restrictions “operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles, my administration will implement them in a manner that avoids the constitutional conflict.”      An administration official said the circumstances of a fast-moving exchange deal made it appropriate to act outside the statutory framework for transfers.      The top Republicans on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, Representative Howard McKeon of California and Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, said the release of the Taliban prisoners “clearly violated laws” governing the transfer of detainees from Guantánamo Bay. One senior administration official defended the decision, saying that “due to a near-term opportunity to save Sergeant Bergdahl’s life, we moved as quickly as possible,” requiring action outside the notice requirement of the statute.      In his comments Saturday afternoon, Mr. Obama said, “The Qatari government has given us assurances that it will put in place measures to protect our national security.”      Prisoner swaps have been more common in conventional wars between two nation-state armies than in the sort of insurgency conflict that characterized Afghanistan and Iraq, and American officials could not cite another instance in which an American soldier had been freed in these conflicts in a swap.      Photo      The transfer reduces the detainee population at Guantánamo to 149. They include 12 Afghan citizens — each of whom was deemed far less important and dangerous than the five who were included in the swap.      Sergeant Bergdahl was believed to have been held by the militant Haqqani network in the tribal area of Pakistan’s northwest frontier, on the Afghan border. He was captured in Paktika Province in Afghanistan on June 30, 2009. The circumstances of how he was separated from his unit and captured have remained a mystery.      Continue reading the main story Advertisement      Hopes for Sergeant Bergdahl’s release were lifted last November when the Taliban signaled it was prepared to engage the United States on the limited issue of a prisoner swap, but not on wider issues including reconciliation with the government of Afghanistan, a senior administration official said Saturday.      The discussions resumed with the Qatari government acting as an intermediary for messages between the two sides, the official said. Previous talks faltered over issues including restrictions on any released detainees; it was unclear whether the one-year travel prohibition was a breakthrough compromise. While it was described by American officials, it was not mentioned in a Taliban statement on the swap.      The latest evidence indicating that Sergeant Bergdahl, who was promoted twice while being held as a prisoner, was still alive came in January, when the American military obtained a video showing him alert but also apparently in declining health.      In the past week, detailed negotiations culminated in an agreement for a Taliban delegation to bring Sergeant Bergdahl to Afghanistan, where he would be retrieved by American Special Operations troops.      Mr. Obama called the emir of Qatar on Tuesday, and they gave each other assurances about the proposed transfers, an administration official said Saturday.      Sergeant Bergdahl was handed over about 7 p.m. local time without incident with the several dozen Special Operations troops spending only a few minutes on the ground, said American officials, who did not disclose the swap’s location in Afghanistan. Taliban officials, though, said the exchange was carried out in Khost Province.      Photo      The Taliban statement said that the swap was “a result of nonstraightforward negotiations” with the United States, with mediation by Qatar, and that the released detainees “will reside in Qatar with their families.”      The details of what the government believes it knows about the five former Taliban leaders were made public in classified military files given to WikiLeaks by Pfc. Bradley Manning, now Chelsea Manning.      Mohammad Nabi Omari is described in the files as “one of the most significant former Taliban leaders detained” at Guantánamo. He is said to have strong operational ties to anticoalition militia groups, including Al Qaeda, the Taliban and the Haqqani network.      A former Taliban provincial governor, Mullah Norullah Noori, is also “considered one of the most significant former Taliban officials” at the prison, according to the documents.      Both Mr. Noori and a third detainee being exchanged, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, a former Taliban deputy defense minister, are accused of having commanded forces that killed thousands of Shiite Muslims, a minority in Afghanistan, before the Taliban were toppled in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.      The fourth detainee is Abdul Haq Wasiq, a former top Taliban intelligence official. The fifth, Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa, is a former minister of the interior and provincial governor.      The Western official in Kabul said the Afghan government was not told about the deal beforehand because there had been a number of false starts since the exchange negotiations had picked up in the past few weeks.      One of the Americans’ chief concerns was that word of the plan would leak, and the Taliban would get cold feet or face pressure from harder line elements not to release Sergeant Bergdahl.      The Americans also feared the possibility of the exchange being upended by an outburst from the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, who might see the prisoner swap as an attempt to open peace talks with the Taliban behind his back.      He has previously claimed that the United States aimed to weaken the Afghan government by cutting a separate peace agreement with the Taliban and its backers in Pakistan, and “no one wanted to deal with that kind of stuff right now,” the Western official said. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Sgt.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Houthis ousted President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi last month, who fled to the southern port city of Aden where he established a rival power base. At the weekend, the Houthis seized Taiz, Yemen's third largest city, bringing them closer to Aden. The UN has warned that Yemen is on the edge of civil war. Mr Hadi's Foreign Minister Riad Yassin told the Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat newspaper he asked the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to intervene, without elaborating what that would mean. He also said he had asked the UN and GCC to impose a no-fly zone, after warplanes hit the presidential palace in Aden over the weekend. The Houthis' rise has alarmed the GCC, and in particular Sunni-controlled Saudi Arabia, which accuses the Houthis of being a proxy for their key regional rival, Shia-majority Iran. Both of them have denied the Saudi claims. Yemen - who is fighting whom? The Houthis: A minority Shia from the north, the group seized control of Sanaa last year and have since been expanding their control. President Hadi: Backed by military and police loyalists, and by militia known as Popular Resistance Committees, he is trying to fight back against the rebels from his stronghold in the south. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula: Seen by the US as the most dangerous branch of Al-Qaeda, AQAP opposes both the Houthis and forces loyal to President Hadi. Islamic State: A Yemeni affiliate of IS has recently emerged, which seeks to eclipse AQAP. Also on Monday, the Saudi foreign minister warned the Gulf states could take action to shore-up Mr Hadi. \\"If this issue is not solved peacefully, we will take the necessary measures to protect the region from their aggression,\\" said Saud al-Faisal. The UN envoy to Yemen, Jamal Benomar told the BBC the Saudis had \\"good reasons\\" to be concerned about the situation. But he added: \\"I don't think any side could win a civil war. No side can win a civil war - the only way forward is negotiation, which implies concession from all sides, which implies also, a compromise.\\" Britain has meanwhile joined the US in withdrawing special military forces from Yemen because of the deteriorating situation there. Further deepening the crisis, Islamic State (IS) militants appear to have emerged as a presence in Yemen. A purported local IS affiliate says it was behind an attack that left 29 dead in Lahj, north of Aden, after another branch claimed the suicide attacks last week in Sanaa that left more than 100 people dead. What is a summary of this text?","output":"The ongoing crisis in Yemen has significantly escalated in recent weeks, with the Houthi rebel group seizing control of additional cities, including Taiz, Yemen's third largest city. The ousted President, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, fled to the southern port city of Aden and established a rival power base. The United Nations has warned that Yemen is on the brink of civil war.  Foreign Minister Riad Yassin has asked the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to intervene in the situation, though it is unclear what form this intervention might take. Yassin has also requested the UN and GCC impose a no-fly zone after warplanes targeted the presidential palace in Aden. The growing influence of the Houthis has alarmed the GCC, especially Sunni-controlled Saudi Arabia, which accuses the Houthis of being a proxy for their regional rival, Shia-majority Iran. Both the Houthis and Iran deny these claims. Several factions are currently engaged in the conflict in Yemen: 1. The Houthis: A minority Shia group from the north that took control of the capital, Sanaa, last year and have been expanding their influence since. 2. President Hadi: Supported by military and police loyalists, as well as the Popular Resistance Committees militia, Hadi is attempting to fight back against the rebels from his stronghold in the south. 3. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP): Considered the most dangerous branch of Al-Qaeda by the United States, AQAP opposes both the Houthis and forces loyal to President Hadi. 4. Islamic State (IS): A Yemeni affiliate of IS has recently emerged, with local IS affiliate claiming responsibility for several attacks in the country. As the situation continues to deteriorate, other countries are withdrawing their military presence from Yemen, including the United States and Britain. The UN envoy to Yemen, Jamal Benomar, has stated that negotiation and compromise are the only ways forward, as no side can win a civil war. In summary, the ongoing crisis in Yemen has escalated significantly, with various factions fighting for control of the country, and both regional and international actors expressing concern over the situation. The UN has warned that Yemen is on the edge of civil war, and urged all parties to engage in negotiation and compromise in order to find a solution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who supported themselves before late 1999?\\" is \\"KSM\\"? OPTIONS: [A]. no; [B]. yes;","output":"[A]. no; The correct answer is \\"no\\".

Question 1: Why was the Indian Ocean named after India? Question 2: Why Indian Ocean named under India? pick from the following.  1). no  2). yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"2). yes Both questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing, which is the reasoning behind the naming of the Indian Ocean after India. Let me provide you with a detailed explanation for this. The Indian Ocean is the third-largest of the five oceans in the world, spanning approximately 20% of the world's water surface. It is bounded by Asia to the north, Africa to the west, Australia to the east, and the Southern Ocean to the south. Due to its vast expanse and strategic importance, the Indian Ocean has been a prominent feature in world history, particularly in trade, navigation, and cultural exchange. Historically, the origin of the name \\"Indian Ocean\\" can be traced back to the ancient classical texts, when the regions surrounding the ocean were collectively referred to as 'India' or 'Indies.' The term 'India' originally comes from the Greek word 'Indos,' which was adopted and used frequently by Europeans during the age of exploration, commencing in the late 15th century. This term was used to describe not only the Indian subcontinent, but also the lands stretching as far as present-day Malaysia and Indonesia. Throughout history, the Indian subcontinent has played a central role in the development of maritime trade and cultural exchange within the Indian Ocean region. It served as a critical bridge for trade between various ancient civilizations, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Persia, and China. One of the most significant trade routes of the ancient world, the Silk Road, connected Asia, Africa, and Europe and had a significant influence on the history and culture of those regions. Due to India's strategic location, it has long been at the heart of cultural interactions and exchanges on an international scale. Indian merchants and seafarers navigated the waters of the Indian Ocean to trade with various nations and spread Indian culture and religion beyond its borders. In particular, the spread of Hinduism and Buddhism to Southeast Asia was facilitated by the interactions within the Indian Ocean region. The importance of the Indian subcontinent, its significant position geographically, and its rich history in the development of trade and cultural exchange within the Indian Ocean region are the reasons why the ocean is named after India. Moreover, it serves to highlight the long-standing impact of India on the shaping of the ocean's history and its broader global influence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What increases teh odds of a male bird obtaining a mate?\\" is in \\"Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"What increases the odds of a male bird obtaining a mate?\\" can be found in the provided text, which discusses various aspects of bird behavior and plumage. The primary factors that increase the odds of a male bird obtaining a mate are: 1. Plumage: Birds use plumage to display social dominance, display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays. Attractive or elaborate plumage can help catch the attention of a potential mate and show that the male is healthy and has good genes. 2. Visual communication and ritualized displays: These displays can signal aggression, submission, or contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. By engaging in such visual communication, a male bird can demonstrate to potential mates that it is a suitable partner. 3. Complex courtship displays: In many bird species, courtship displays involve elaborate \\"dances\\" formed from combinations of various movements. These displays allow the male bird to showcase its physical prowess, coordination, and stamina. A high-quality display can greatly increase a male bird's chances of successfully obtaining a mate, as it may signify overall fitness and the ability to care for young. In summary, the odds of a male bird obtaining a mate can be increased through the presence of impressive plumage, engaging in visual communication and ritualized displays, and performing complex courtship displays. These factors indicate a male bird's fitness, strength, and suitability as a partner, thus making it more attractive to potential mates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was worried that his sons would use up his money and starve to death. One day, the old man came up with a plan. He called his sons and said to them, \\"Look, my dear sons: in the land we have at the farmyard, there is lots of hidden gold. If you should work together, you may find it\\" In a wish to find out the gold, his sons worked hard from the morning to the evening digging and digging all through the land.

Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

During the open season, we invite bids from interested shippers with details, such as their desired contract term, quantities, and rate they are willing to pay. 2. Bidding Process: Shippers must submit a complete bid during the open season, adhering to the guidelines and timelines. Each bid will be evaluated based on the rate offered, term, and other factors, including creditworthiness and past performance. 3. Awarding Capacity: After evaluating the bids, we will award the unsubscribed capacity to the shipper(s) based on the highest net present value derived from their proposal. Successful bidders will be informed and required to enter into service agreements with us. 4. Rates and Charges: The tariff provides details on the rates, charges, surcharges, and other fees associated with the unsubscribed capacity. These will be in compliance with FERC regulations and may be negotiated based on the market situation and competition. 5. Availability of Information: Transwestern makes sure that all the relevant details and information related to the unsubscribed capacity and the open season are available on our website for shippers to access.

Marty is a high-powered single literary agent in Manhattan. Marie (also Moore) is a widow in Provence with two daughters and a peaceful life. Marty has been seeing a therapist to deal with her vivid dreams of Marie's life; when Marie falls asleep she dreams Marty's life, but is much less disturbed by it. Each woman is convinced that the other is a figment of her imagination. When Marty meets Aaron they become friends and eventually lovers; terrified that her vivid other life means that she's losing her mind, Marty does not want to tell Aaron about it but finally does. Marie, meanwhile, has met William; she too is reluctant to tell William about her dreams, particularly since she (as Marty) is falling in love with Aaron, but realizes that she cannot keep such an important part of her life a secret. The two men react very differently: William is jealous, while Aaron is skeptical but not at all threatened, and wants only for Marty to be happy. Dreams and real life begin to merge when Marie goes on holiday with William to Paris, and Marty wakes up with an ashtray from the hotel on her night stand. Eventually Marty/Marie must come to terms with reality and choose which life is real and which is illusion.

Title: Good Idea- But Way Too Detailed Review: I began to read this book thinking that with all the praise I had heard it received it would be great, filled with action and adventure. However, the book is so detailed that it gets boring very fast. The extensive descriptions of the places that are being traveled through become work to read.

The US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the move \\"counter-productive\\" to peace talks while the EU said the plan should be \\"reversed\\". The announcement comes days after Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas called for full UN membership for a Palestinian state. The new houses are to be constructed at Gilo, in East Jerusalem. Almost 500,000 Jews live in settlements on occupied territory. The settlements are illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. 'Provocative' US-brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians are deadlocked over the issue of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Mrs Clinton said Israel's move would damage attempts to resume direct negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. \\"We have long urged both sides to avoid any kind of action which could undermine trust, including, and perhaps most particularly, in Jerusalem, any action that could be viewed as provocative by either side,\\" she said. The European Union's Foreign Policy Chief Catherine Ashton told the EU parliament that she heard \\"with deep regret\\" that Israeli settlement plans were continuing. \\"This plan should be reversed. Settlement activity threatens the viability of an agreed two-state solution and runs contrary to the Israeli-stated commitment to resume negotiations.\\" She said she would raise the issue with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when she next met him. \\"He should stop announcing them and, more importantly, stop building them,\\" she said, adding that it was wrong to get people to live in a place from which they may have to move from after any negotiated settlement is achieved. British Foreign Secretary William Hague too urged Israel to revoke its decision. \\"Settlement expansion is illegal under international law, corrodes trust and undermines the basic principle of land for peace,\\" he said in a statement. The plan for construction in Gilo includes the construction of small housing units, public buildings, a school and an industrial zone, according to the Ynet news website. \\"It's a nice gift for Rosh Hashanah [Jewish New Year],\\" Yair Gabay, a member of the Jerusalem planning committee, told Ynet. The authorities have now approved the building of almost 3,000 homes in Gilo over the past two years. The chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the decision represented a rejection of a proposal by the Quartet of Mid East negotiators - the US, the EU, Russia and the UN - for new talks between the Palestinians and Israelis, expected to be made officially on Friday. \\"With this, Israel is responding to the Quartet's statement with 1,100 'NOs',\\" he said. On Monday, a divided UN Security Council met behind closed doors for its first discussion of last week's Palestinian application for full state membership of the UN. The request needs the support of nine of the 15 members of the council, but the US has said it will veto the bid. Israel built the settlement at Gilo on land it captured in 1967. It later annexed the area to the Jerusalem municipality in a move not recognised by the international community. Israel says it does not consider areas within the Jerusalem municipality to be settlements. Gilo lies across a narrow valley from the Palestinian village of Beit Jala. It became a target for militants during the second Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in 2000. Meanwhile, the UN rapporteurs on housing, water, sanitation and food rights said there had been a \\"dramatic increase\\" in the demolitions this year. \\"The impact and discriminatory nature of these demolitions and evictions is completely unacceptable,\\" they said in a statement. \\"These actions by the Israeli authorities violate human rights and humanitarian law and must end immediately.\\" This article was about:","output":"This article discusses the international response to Israel's plan to build 1,100 new homes in the contested territory of East Jerusalem.

Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere. Her hair, cut short and spiky, was dyed a magenta so bright it nearly glowed. She wore a tight black t-shirt, baggy olive drab shorts that hung on shapely hips, and heavy black boots with two inch thick soles. She had a faded black messenger bag slung across her chest, the strap pressing between her breasts. If Paul had to guess, she wasn't wearing a bra. She definitely wasn't your average Silicon Valley techie on an early lunch break, and certainly not a restaurant employee. Question: How long Paul worked at the company?

Rangersâ Streak Ends With Loss to Canadiens The Canadiens' Carey Price blocking one of only 17 shots taken by the Rangers on Saturday. MONTREAL — All good things must come to an end, but, for the Rangers, this good thing came to an end pretty badly. The Rangers’ bid to win an eighth straight game and put together their longest winning streak since 1974-75 ended Saturday night with an emphatic 4-0 loss to the Canadiens. “We were chasing the game — never caught up to it,” said John Tortorella, the Rangers’ coach, after a flat performance from most of his players. “It just wasn’t happening tonight.” The Rangers were not overwhelming during their winning streak, but they played well enough through it to beat a series of weak and middling teams, including the Canadiens on Nov. 5 at Madison Square Garden. But at the Bell Centre, their forwards underperformed. So did their defense, and so did their goalie. The Rangers could not get on track against a patchwork Montreal defense. Four of the six Canadiens defensemen had fewer than 69 games of N.H.L. experience. Against this green blue-line corps, the Rangers managed just 17 shots, only 2 more than their season low. The Canadiens took 31 shots. The Ranger forwards, including the top line of Marian Gaborik, Derek Stepan and Artem Anisimov, kept the puck in the Montreal end for long stretches in the first 25 minutes, but could not get square to shoot on Canadiens goalie Carey Price. After that, the attack generated almost nothing. At the other end, Rangers goalie Martin Biron lost for the first time in his fourth start of the season. He made several good saves, but he allowed a soft goal at 8 minutes 12 seconds of the second period that made the score 2-0. Brian Gionta scored the goal on an innocent shot from the boards that Biron simply missed, letting it go between his legs. Replays showed that a strap on his right pad had come loose, and after the goal he went to the bench to get it fixed. But Biron did not blame his equipment. “I was overthinking the short side on a bad-angle shot,” he said. “It changes the game.” Tortorella said Biron was not the goat. “Don’t look at our goalie, I’ll tell you that,” Tortorella said. He attributed the loss to “our full crew.” The Rangers trailed for only 42 seconds during their seven-game winning streak, but on Saturday they fell behind early after defenseman Ryan McDonagh was sent off for hooking at 3:14. On the ensuing power play, another defenseman, Michael Del Zotto, was caught too high in the neutral zone to stop a pass to Erik Cole at the Rangers’ blue line. Cole wheeled in and struck a perfect shot to the top corner at 3:45, giving the Canadiens a 1-0 lead. “Michael struggled with Cole,” Tortorella said, explaining that he moved Del Zotto to a different defense pairing in the second period so he wouldn’t have to face Cole. “Michael really struggled with his speed.” But Tortorella added, “Let’s face it, none of our D played well.” Tomas Plekanec made the score 3-0 at 7:05 of the third period with the Canadiens’ second power-play goal. The Rangers allowed six power plays in all, the most since their fourth game of the season, at a time when they were losing often. Gionta struck for his second goal less than seven minutes later to close out the scoring. Late in the second period, when it was still 2-0, it looked as if the Rangers might get a two-man advantage, as Del Zotto fell spinning to the ice on a power play after being tripped by Frederic St-Denis. But the referees ruled that Del Zotto embellished the fall with the spin, and sent him off as well as St.-Denis. That was the Rangers’ last hurrah in a poor performance. Andre Deveaux of the Rangers drove Petteri Nokelainen into the boards with a blindside hit in the third period, which may bring a call from Brendan Shanahan, the N.H.L.’s chief disciplinarian. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The New York Rangers' seven-game winning streak came to an end with a 4-0 loss to the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday night.

Read this and answer the question Demand in Europe for Chinese goods such as silk, tea, and ceramics could only be met if European companies funneled their limited supplies of silver into China. In the late 1700s, the governments of Britain and France were deeply concerned about the imbalance of trade and the drain of silver. To meet the growing Chinese demand for opium, the British East India Company greatly expanded its production in Bengal. Since China's economy was essentially self-sufficient, the country had little need to import goods or raw materials from the Europeans, so the usual way of payment was through silver. The Daoguang Emperor, concerned both over the outflow of silver and the damage that opium smoking was causing to his subjects, ordered Lin Zexu to end the opium trade. Lin confiscated the stocks of opium without compensation in 1839, leading Britain to send a military expedition the following year. What products from China did Europeans want?","output":"Europeans desired a variety of Chinese goods, with the most sought-after products being silk, tea, and ceramics. These items were highly valued in Europe due to their exceptional quality, unique designs, and the exotic appeal associated with them, originating from a distant and culturally rich land.

Spectre (2015 film) Filming temporarily returned to England to shoot scenes at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, which stood in for a location in Rome, before moving on to the city itself for a five-week shoot across the city, with locations including the Ponte Sisto bridge and the Roman Forum. The production faced opposition from a variety of special interest groups and city authorities, who were concerned about the potential for damage to historical sites around the city, and problems with graffiti and rubbish appearing in the film. A car chase scene set along the banks of the Tiber River and through the streets of Rome featured an Aston Martin DB10 and a Jaguar C-X75. The C-X75 was originally developed as a hybrid electric vehicle with four independent electric engines powered by two jet turbines, before the project was cancelled. The version used for filming was converted to use a conventional internal combustion engine, to minimise the potential for disruption from mechanical problems with the complex hybrid system.

The number of centenarians in Japan is expected to hit a record 58,820 on Respect-for-the-Aged Day on Sept. 15, an increase of 4,423 from a year earlier, according to the welfare ministry.      It will be the 44th consecutive yearly record since 1971, when 339 people were 100 years old or older, according to ministry statistics released on Sept. 12.      Women account for about 87 percent of the centenarians.      At 116 years old, Osaka’s Misao Okawa is not only the oldest person in Japan but also the oldest person on the planet, according to Guinness World Records.      Okawa, who lives in a nursing home, is known for her strong appetite, with one of her favorite dishes being sashimi. She uses her wheelchair several times a month.      Sakari Momoi, 111, a resident of Saitama, is the oldest man in Japan. He was recognized as the world’s oldest man in August by Guinness World Records.      He currently resides in a hospital but eats regular food and takes part in hospital events. Momoi communicates with others, sometimes through written messages.      The welfare ministry compiled the number of people expected to be 100 or older as of Sept. 15 based on resident registries. ||||| The government is finding it costly furnishing Japan’s growing number of centenarians with a token of congratulation in the form of an expensive sake dish.      Since fiscal 1963, the prime minister has traditionally presented new centenarians with a commemorative silver sakazuki, a flat saucer-like cup.      As their numbers have increased, the costs have soared, tarnishing the government’s goodwill. It now plans to cease distributing the ¥8,000 silver cups and will instead select something cheaper.      The presentations are made every year on Seniors’ Day, Sept. 15. The gesture is one few could quibble with: It praises the centenarians’ contributions to society.      Officials admit that the program has become a significant budgetary burden. It cost ¥260 million in 2014.      Japanese people have one of world’s greatest life expectancies. Last fiscal year, 29,357 people — 25,000 of whom were women — were inducted into the ranks of centenarians, compared with only 153 when the silver cup program began half a century ago, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.      The government knows it needs to act fast, as the ministry predicts the number of newcomers will reach 39,000 in 2018.      The ministry is looking at options for cutting costs, such as fabricating the cup from a cheaper material, adopting a different gift entirely or just sending a letter of congratulations, the officials said.      Average longevity in 2014 was 86.83 years for women and 80.50 for men, both a record high. Women had the longest life expectancy in the world for the third consecutive year, with men ranking third, up from fourth the previous year. ||||| Image caption Japan's elderly population continues to grow, with more than a quarter of the population now of retirement age      Japan's government plans to end the tradition of giving centenarians a silver commemorative gift, because the growing elderly population has made it too expensive, it's reported.      Since 1963, a silver sake cup - or sakazuki - has been presented to everyone who reaches 100 years old. The cups, worth 8,000 yen (65; £40) each, are a thank you for centenarians' contribution to society. But as Japan's elderly population has expanded, so too has the gift bill, Kyodo news agency reports. Last year, the government shelled out 260 million yen (2.1m; £1.3m) on the items, a figure officials say isn't sustainable.      As a result, they want to replace the gift with something less pricey. Options being considered include using cheaper materials or choosing something completely different to mark the occasion - possibly just a letter of congratulations, officials tell Kyodo.      There were more than 29,000 new centenarians in Japan last year, compared to 153 when the scheme began, the report says. Life expectancy in Japan is among the highest in the world, and the number of people seeing their 100th birthday has grown every year since 1971.

The average life expectancy for Japanese men is 80.5 years of age, while for women, life expectancy was calculated at 86.83 years of age, Fuji TV reported Friday. Both groups increased by 0.29 and 0.22 years respectively over 2013.      For male life expectancy, Japan ranked third after Hong Kong and Iceland, but remained No. 1 for female life expectancy for the third year in a row, ahead of Hong Kong and Spain.      As reasons for the extended life expectancy in Japan, the ministry cited lower numbers of deaths from cancer and heart disease due to advances in medical treatment, Fuji reported.      Japan Today ||||| Every year for more than 50 years, Japan’s new centenarians have been honoured with a silver sake cup and a congratulatory letter from the prime minister.      But as the country prepares to mark Respect for the Aged Day next month, the latest crop of citizens who turned 100 in the past 12 months face disappointment, as the soaring number of centenarians puts a new strain on the government’s coffers.            The saucer-like sakazuki, a gift from the government since 1963, could be replaced by a cheaper version or be scrapped altogether this year after the health and welfare ministry complained it could not afford to keep up with the number of new recipients.      In 1963 Japan had just 153 centenarians, and as recently as 1998 the number stood at just 10,000. At the last count Japan’s 100-plus age group numbered almost 59,000, and that figure is expected to rise when the government releases new population data before Seniors’ Day on 15 September.      Last year the ministry spent 260 million yen (£1.3m) on giving the cups – each worth about 8,000 yen – to almost 30,000 people, including 25,000 women. Local media pointed out that some people die before the gifts can be distributed, forcing them to be scrapped.            Several years ago the cup’s diameter was slightly reduced amid concern over rising production costs, but the strain on the ministry’s finances could see the sakazuki replaced with a cup made from a cheaper metal, according to Japanese media reports.      Other options being mulled are a different – and cheaper – commemorative gift, or restricting the official offering to the prime minister’s letter. “We are reviewing it, but we have not made any firm decisions,” a health ministry official told AFP.      Demographers predict that Japan’s centenarian population will continue to grow as the general population ages – the result of regular medical examinations, universal healthcare and, among Japanese over a certain age, a fastidious attachment to the traditional low-fat diet of fish, tofu, vegetables and rice.      Japanese women live an average of 86.3 years, putting them at the top of the global longevity table last year, while Japanese men were in fourth place with an average lifespan of 80.5 years.      Just over a quarter of Japan’s 126 million people are 65 or over, according to the most recent census, and the proportion is expected to grow to about 40% by the middle of the century.      It remains to be seen how most Japanese senior citizens will react to any decision to scale back official recognition of their accomplishment.      Until recently the titles of world’s oldest man and woman were held by Japanese. Sakari Momoi, who cited healthy eating and a good night’s sleep as the secrets to his very long life, died in July aged 112.      Misao Okawa, formerly the world’s oldest person, died in April this year, weeks after her 117th birthday.      Last year the number of Japanese centenarians reached a record 58,820 on Respect for the Aged Day, an increase of 4,423 from the previous year.      Japan’s oldest citizens were at the centre of a scandal in 2010 when it emerged that at least 200 centenarians had gone missing from local government records. In some cases, people who had died were still listed as alive, including a woman mistakenly recorded as having reached 125, whose registered home had been turned into a park in 1981.       ||||| The third Monday of September is Respect for the Aged Day, a national holiday in Japan. The Japanese call national holidays “red days” because they appear in red print on the calendar. As this will make September 12–14 a long weekend, be prepared for heavier than usual traffic and crowded trains if you are traveling.      Japanese people traditionally wear red on their 60th birthday because 60 years is one cycle on the Chinese calendar and after 60, it is said that you become a baby again. Babies in Japan are called “aka-chan” or “red one.”      Respect for the Aged Day, called keiro no hi, is not quite like “Grandparent’s Day” in the U.S. It is far more serious. Neighborhoods will have volunteers distribute free “obento” boxed lunches to elderly people in the neighborhood and smaller villages will hold keirokai shows where the younger people and school children prepare dances and songs for a special keirokai ceremony. The elderly attendees are also treated to lunch, tea, and sweets after the performance.      As Japan’s nation grays and people get older and older, some of these traditions may change, however. On the small island of 700 people where I live, the keirokai ceremony used to be held for those 60 years old and over. But with so many people over the age of 60 now, the qualifying age to attend the keirokai has steadily increased, and is now 65. As Japan’s society ages and nursing homes become more popular, being old may not be so special anymore—but rather the norm.      Respect for the Aged Day is also a way to honor longevity, and Japanese people have always been some of the longest living in the world. But this is also changing as more and more Japanese people add meat and other western foods to their diets. In addition, city living is seen to cut lifespan due to pollution and stress.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Lack of economic development decreases poverty.","output":"The given sentence \\"Lack of economic development decreases poverty\\" is not an accurate representation of the relationship between economic development and poverty, based on the preceding text provided. In fact, the statement contradicts the information previously mentioned. The proper sentence should be \\"Economic development contributes to the decrease in poverty.\\" The preceding text emphasizes the contributions of Western farmers in feeding not only the United States but also a significant portion of the world. The implication is that a well-developed agricultural industry can offer a stable food supply, promote trade, and create job opportunities, ultimately fostering economic growth. Economic development, in turn, supports poverty reduction through better access to resources, income generation, and overall improved living conditions. The text also mentions India's irrigation systems that have allowed the country to be self-sufficient in food production since 1974. Access to consistent food sources means that the country can focus on other aspects of economic growth and reduce dependence on imports, which contributes to poverty alleviation. These irrigation systems are an example of infrastructural improvement, a key aspect of overall economic development. The construction of dams is another point mentioned in the text. Dams play an essential role in many aspects of economic development, such as providing hydroelectric power, allaying the severity of floods and droughts, and making potable water for consumption and sanitation more readily available. Improved infrastructure, through the use of dams and other developments, allows societies to better confront various challenges, including poverty, famine, and disease. Thus, it is important to recognize that economic development is instrumental in reducing poverty levels by fostering increased access to resources, creating more job opportunities, and improving the quality of life in various parts of the world.

To provide a detailed explanation, we must first understand the relationship between mass, weight, and gravity. Weight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity, and it depends on both the mass of the object and the strength of the gravitational force. The formula for weight is: Weight = Mass × Gravity Since Planet X has 10% more mass than Planet Z, it means that Planet X will have a stronger gravitational force. Assuming the boulder has the same mass on both planets, the difference in gravitational force will determine the difference in weight. If the boulder weighs 800 pounds on Planet X, it will weigh less on Planet Z because the gravitational force on Planet Z will be weaker due to its smaller mass.

Pastor Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using the church as a place of worship. Pomeroy, who lost his own 14-year-old daughter in the massacre, proposed turning the site into a memorial and building another church on a different site. The final decision on the fate of the building will be made by the denomination's top leaders, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support. But a national Southern Baptist spokesman said the pastor's wishes will be taken into consideration. Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012.

Is \\"The collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from collector to emitter.\\" the correct answer?","output":"While the statement \\"The collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from collector to emitter\\" provides a rudimentary understanding of the phenomenon, a more detailed and accurate answer requires delving into the principles of transistor operation. In grounded-emitter transistor circuits, the collector voltage drops because of the relationship between the base-emitter current and the collector-emitter current, as controlled by the transistor's current gain. To better understand this concept, let's first discuss the basic structure and operation of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). BJTs have three layers of doped semiconductors - the emitter, base, and collector. For an NPN transistor, the layers are ordered as N-P-N, while for a PNP transistor, they are organized as P-N-P. In a grounded-emitter configuration, the emitter is connected to a common ground while the base and collector terminals are both controlled by external voltages. When a small current flows into the base terminal in an NPN transistor (or out of the base terminal in a PNP transistor), it modulates the conductivity of the collector-emitter junction, allowing a larger current to flow between the collector and emitter. This current gain from the base to the collector current is called the transistor's \\"beta\\" (β) or \\"current gain.\\" In grounded-emitter transistor circuits, the input current (at the base-emitter junction) controls the output current (at the collector-emitter junction). When the input current increases, the output current also increases according to the transistor's current gain. As a result, more current flows through the collector resistor connected in series with the collector-emitter junction. This increased current causes a larger voltage drop across the collector resistor according to Ohm's law (V = I * R). As the voltage drop across the collector resistor increases, the potential difference between the supply voltage (Vcc) and the voltage drop diminishes, leading to a reduced collector voltage. The collector voltage, therefore, depends on the input current, the transistor's current gain, and the collector resistor. So, while the original statement captures a basic idea of why the collector voltage drops, a more precise explanation is that the collector voltage drops in grounded-emitter transistor circuits because of the dependence of the collector-emitter current on the base-emitter current, as controlled by the transistor's current gain and the voltage drop across the collector resistor due to Ohm's law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Ocean waves hit land - Ocean water pulls sand off of beaches - Ocean water breaks rocks off of cliffs - Ocean water carries sand and rocks into the ocean - Sand and rocks go to other land or the bottom of the ocean.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose cooler temperatures in oceans happens, how will it affect LESS erosion by the ocean.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you present suggests that cooler ocean temperatures might lead to less erosion by the ocean. To analyze the potential effect of this perturbation on the erosion process, we should examine each part of the process and consider any direct or indirect effects that could be influenced by cooler ocean temperatures. 1. Ocean waves hit land: Cooler ocean temperatures could potentially affect wave characteristics, such as wave height, frequency, or energy content. Waves generated by cooler ocean temperatures might be less powerful; thus, there could be a direct impact on the force with which waves hit the land and contribute to erosion. 2. Ocean water pulls sand off beaches: Cooler ocean water is denser than warmer water, which could potentially make it more difficult for the water to pull sand off beaches. If cooler water temperature reduces wave energy, the ability of ocean water to pull sand off beaches would likely be further diminished. In this case, the perturbation would have a direct effect on this stage of the erosion process. 3. Ocean water breaks rocks off cliffs: Cooler ocean temperatures could lead to less powerful waves that may be less effective in breaking rocks off cliffs. Moreover, if cooler water is denser, it could theoretically exert a stronger force on the rocks, making them more resistant to erosion. As such, cooler ocean temperatures may have both direct and indirect effects on this part of the erosion process. 4. Ocean water carries sand and rocks into the ocean: If cooler water temperature results in less powerful waves, it may also affect the ability of ocean water to carry sand and rocks into the ocean. Moreover, since cooler and denser water might make it more difficult for sand and rocks to be moved and transported, this perturbation could have a direct impact on this part of the erosion process. 5. Sand and rocks go to other land or the bottom of the ocean: Cooler ocean temperatures may have an indirect impact on this part of the erosion process. Less powerful waves and the reduced ability of cooler, denser water to transport sand and rocks could ultimately result in less erosion material being deposited onto other land or settling at the bottom of the ocean. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that cooler ocean temperatures could have a direct impact on multiple stages of the erosion process, likely resulting in less erosion by the ocean. The influence of cooler ocean temperatures could be seen in the alteration of wave characteristics, the reduced effectiveness of ocean water in pulling sand off beaches and breaking rocks off cliffs, and the decreased ability of ocean water to transport and deposit sand and rocks."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","output":"A task that would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning could be to build a simple tower using objects of different shapes and sizes, such as wooden blocks or LEGO bricks. This task would require the individual to reason about the physical properties of the objects, their stability, and their interaction with other objects to make a stable structure. Step 1: Assess the available objects The first step would be to examine the objects available for building the tower. This includes evaluating their shapes, sizes, and considering their physical properties, such as weight distribution and ability to support other objects. Step 2: Plan the base of the tower Choose objects that have the largest surface area and can provide the most stability for the bottom layer. A stable base is essential for a tall and sturdy structure, so it is important to consider the physical properties of the chosen objects to ensure that they will not easily topple. Step 3: Stack objects with stability in mind Continue stacking objects on top of the base, keeping in mind that objects closer to the ground level should be stronger and able to support the weight of the objects above it. As you stack, continue to consider how the objects can be arranged to maximize stability. This may involve using interlocking shapes, balancing weights, or creating additional support points. Step 4: Find the center of gravity Throughout the building process, consider the tower's center of gravity. A balanced tower is more likely to stay upright. The center of gravity should ideally be close to the middle of the structure, vertically and horizontally. Step 5: Test the stability of the tower Gently nudge the tower to test its stability. If the tower wobbles or starts to collapse, adjust the placement of objects or reconsider the choice of objects used to improve stability. Step 6: Iterate as needed After each test, make any necessary adjustments to the tower's structure based on your physical reasoning and the tower's response to your tests. This may involve adding, removing, or rearranging objects to maximize stability. In conclusion, this type of task tests an individual's physical reasoning by requiring them to plan, build, and adjust a structure based on their understanding of the physical properties and interactions of the objects involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is an important lake because it is one of the sources  for the longest river in the world, the Nile River.Lake Victoria provides a source of water, food, and power for several African countries.Lake Victoria is a big part of African life. Unfortunately, Lake Victoria has a problem. _ .There are several power stations at Lake Victoria in Uganda. These are on the Nile River, and besides producing power, they keep the water of the lake at a certain level.For the past forty years, that level has been 11.9 meters.Over the last several years, the water level has dropped by about 2.5 meters.There seem to be several reasons for this drop. One possible reason is drought .Drought has been very bad in the area since 2000.Lake Victoria gets all of its water from rain, so the drought means less water in the lake. However, some environmentalists believe that the real problem is the power plants(factories) on Lake Victoria. Uganda depends on those power plants for most of its power, and they made the power plants larger in 2000.Many people believe the power plants have been taking too much water off Lake Victoria. As a result, they have been asked to use less water until Lake Victoria goes back to its old level. Whether the low water level is caused by drought or power plants, the result is the same.This is already a poor area of Africa, where many people live a really hard life.People, animals and plants around Lake Victoria will suffer even more from low water levels on the lake.Many people need Lake Victoria for fishing or growing food. Fish need the water to live, and animals need it for water.Plants around the lake will die without the water, and then more animals and people will suffer.Unless the lake fills soon, many people will suffer and die. Answer:","output":"Question: What factors have contributed to the drop in Lake Victoria's water level, and what are the potential consequences of this issue?

Here is a goal: To bend strips of metal that are too strong to bend by hand, you can Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish this goal of bending strips of metal that are too strong to bend by hand, several methods can be employed. The effectiveness of each method depends on various factors, such as the type of metal, the desired bend angle, and the tools available. Below, I will detail a few methods and analyze their sensibility when it comes to bending strong metal strips. 1. Using a Bench Vise and a Metal Pipe: One of the simplest and most affordable methods is to use a bench vise and a metal pipe (also known as a cheater bar). Bench vises provide a stable clamping surface to hold the metal strip in place while the metal pipe serves as a lever to amplify the force applied. First, secure the metal strip in the vise with the desired bend location positioned at the edge of the vise jaws. Then, slide the metal pipe over the free end of the strip. Apply downward pressure on the pipe to create a controlled bend in the strip using leverage. This method is sensible for occasional bending tasks, where precise angles are not required. 2. Hydraulic Press Brake: A hydraulic press brake is an industrial-grade machine used specifically for bending metal. It operates using a hydraulic cylinder that applies pressure onto a die, which then bends the metal strip. The amount of pressure exerted can be adjusted based on the thickness and strength of the metal. Press brakes can also accommodate various die shapes to create specific bends. This method provides greater control and precision but comes with a much higher cost. It is more sensible for facilities that require frequent metal bending with a high degree of accuracy. 3. Induction Bending: Induction bending is a process in which heat is applied to the area of the metal strip where bending is desired. This is typically done using an induction coil that generates an electromagnetic field to heat the strip, making it more pliable. Once the desired temperature is reached, bending pressure is applied, allowing for smooth bends without leaving marks or damaging the metal strip. Induction bending is a sensible method for projects that require high-quality bends with minimal stress or deformation on the metal. However, it necessitates specialized equipment and trained personnel, making it less practical for smaller projects or occasional bending tasks. 4. Sheet Metal Brake: A sheet metal brake is a hand-operated tool designed to bend metal sheets or strips. It consists of a clamping bar that holds the metal in place and a bending plate that shapes the metal when pressure is applied. Sheet metal brakes are available in various sizes and capacities, with some models capable of handling thick, strong metal strips. This method is sensible for projects that require numerous bends or specific bend angles, as it offers precise control and repeatability. Additionally, it is more affordable than hydraulic presses or induction bending equipment. In conclusion, selecting the most sensible method to accomplish the goal of bending strong metal strips depends on several factors. For occasional or small-scale projects, using a bench vise and a metal pipe or a sheet metal brake may be the most appropriate choice. For larger projects or specialized bend requirements, a hydraulic press brake or induction bending may be more suitable. Ultimately, the method chosen should balance factors such as cost, precision, frequency of use, and the specific properties of the metal strips being bent."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the last names of the people who discover Elspeth is lonely?, using the article: Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press.

Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.  Bubba and Dean are two farmers which realized the benefits of having AM fungi in their soil. Dean, however, took active steps in helping the growth of AM fungi so he grew cover crops on his lands.

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Antigonus Gonatas belonged to the Antigonid dynasty, as he was the son of Demetrius I Poliorcetes and grandson of Antigonus I Monophthalmus. Both his father and grandfather were prominent figures in the Hellenistic period, and Antigonus Gonatas himself became a powerful ruler, eventually becoming king of Macedon after successfully defending the region against a Gaul invasion in 277 BCE."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United... Answer:","output":"Ferrier"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the context: Why did Tracy do this?  Possible answers: cure her boredom, drive to the store, find the perfect outfit Answer:","output":"Tracy purchased clothes at the store because she finally found the perfect outfit to wear after going through what could have been a long process of searching and trying on different clothing options. In this context, it is clear that her main motivation for making the purchase was to acquire the perfect outfit that she had been searching for. To fully understand Tracy's actions, it is important to analyze the possible reasons mentioned in the question: 1. Cure her boredom: Although shopping can be a fun and exciting activity that could potentially help cure someone's boredom, it is not the primary reason behind Tracy's decision to purchase clothes. The statement \\"Tracy finally found the perfect outfit to wear\\" indicates that her main objective was to find the right outfit rather than just passing time or alleviating boredom. 2. Drive to the store: Driving to the store is more of an essential step taken to find the perfect outfit rather than the reason why she made the purchase. The process of going to the store would have allowed Tracy to browse through various options and try on multiple outfits, eventually leading her to find the one that met her needs and preferences. Hence, driving to the store was a necessary action in achieving her goal but not the primary reason for her purchase decision. 3. Find the perfect outfit: This appears to be the most accurate reason behind Tracy's decision to purchase clothes at the store. The context given clearly states that she finally found the perfect outfit to wear. This indicates that Tracy had been searching for a specific outfit or style that met her criteria, and upon finding it, she decided to make the purchase. Her satisfaction with the chosen outfit justified her decision to buy it and accomplished the goal she set out to achieve when shopping. In conclusion, Tracy's primary reason for purchasing clothes at the store was to find the perfect outfit that fit her needs, taste, and preferences. The process of going to the store and trying on different options allowed her to achieve this goal. While shopping could have helped to cure boredom or provide entertainment, these were not the main driving factors behind her decision to make the purchase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Remember, we have to keep it simple like we're explaining it to a five-year-old. 1. First, you need a toothbrush and some toothpaste. Choose a toothbrush that's small and soft, so it's gentle on your teeth and gums. Squeeze just a pea-sized amount of toothpaste onto the toothbrush. 2. Now, wet the toothbrush and toothpaste a little bit under some water. This will help it work better when you start brushing. 3. Open your mouth and place the toothbrush bristles on your teeth. Hold the toothbrush like a pencil so you can reach all the corners of your mouth. Make sure you angle the toothbrush so the bristles are pointing towards your gums. 4. Gently brush your teeth using small, circular motions. Take your time, and make sure you brush all the sides of your teeth - the front, the back, and the top. 5. You need to brush for about two minutes to make sure your teeth are clean. It's like singing the ABCs song four times. You can ask a grown-up to count for you if you find it difficult. 6. When you're done brushing, spit out all the toothpaste foam in the sink. Remember not to swallow it. 7. Rinse your mouth with a little bit of water just to make sure you've got all the toothpaste out. 8. Finally, rinse your toothbrush off under the water, and put it away in a cup or toothbrush holder to let it dry. So, that's how you properly brush your teeth, little buddy!

Hewn ruthlessly from the earth by water over 270million years, these stone structures are a testament to the power of the natural world. The pillars, arches and columns rise hundred of feet into the air over a vast region of southern China, striking awe into observers who have flocked to the area for thousands of years. Known as karsts, the limestone structures - captured in these images for National Geographic Magazine - are created when water forces fissures, sinkholes, cracks and caverns into the soft rock, leaving only a series of monoliths above ground. Vast: Jaw-dropping limestone 'karsts' formed by erosion over 270million years soar hundreds of feet into the air across a huge region of southern China. Pictured, climber Emily Harrington takes the hard way up Moon Hill, an arch which was formed from the remains of a collapsed cave. Sightseers can take an easier dirt track. Awe: The enormity of the structures is clear compared to the size of the cavers ascending them, from a limestone spire in the Enshi canyon (left) to the Great Arch in Ziyun Getu He Chuandong National Park (right). Seeing these sights can be much easier, as a new glass elevator delivers less intrepid tourists to the foot of the arch. China's Stone Forest is one of the. largest, with huge arches which once belonged to cave systems but now. protrude awkwardly above the lush green hills around. Covering an estimated half a million square kilometres, south China's is one of the largest and most significant in the world. While. limestone structures are common, only in a humid, tropical environment. can there be enough movement of water to create such dramatic change,. and form structures which have earned the South China Karst recognition. as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. But. just as with an iceberg, what can be seen in these photographs is only. the tip. The flowing water has not only carved up the landscape above. the ground, but has also transformed it below. South. China is home to some of the largest caves in the world, which even now. are still being mapped and explored by researchers from around the. world. Heading the charge. is a team led by Andy Eavis, the chairman of the British Caving. Association who has been traveling to China for more than 30 years. Otherworldly: The landscape was formed by water in the humid region seeping in through cracks in porous rock and gradually opening up sinkholes, fissures and caves. All work and no play...: Those pictured have devoted their careers to exploring and mapping the hostile cave landscape down below - but do come up for air occasionally. Map: Beneath southern China's landscape researchers have discovered some of the largest underground chambers in the world. In 2013 a British-led expedition used a laser scanner to map the Miao Room of Gebihe, pictured, whose maximum height is 627 feet. A passenger jet is shown for scale. The images are from the July issue of National Geographic magazine. He and his explorers have used. pioneering laser scanners to map the complex, unstable systems in. unprecedented detail, including the Miao Room of the Gebihe cave system -. since confirmed as the second-largest known cavern in the world. Despite. its entrance from the outer world comprising just a narrow, unobtrusive. gap in stone in the forest, it has a maximum height of 627 feet. The. cavern must be explored in hostile conditions - including high humidity. and a lack of any natural light - using a mixture of computer. technology and old-fashioned caving bravery. With. fissures and sharp points of rock, a wrong step could mean injury or. death, and the cavern is so large it could fit a fleet of jumbo jets. with plenty of room to spare. Other. caves are less formidable. In one part of the region, an entire village. of 21 homes - with no need for rooves - is situated inside a cavern. together with a primary school, a basketball court, and an increasing. stream of tourists. More still have been made safe for people to explore without the risk of losing their hats. It. is not all work and no play for the explorers. Some feature in these. photos, where they take time off from their caving work to ascend the. other side of China's fantasy landscape. That. is despite there being far more tourist-friendly ways to ascend the. limestone structures, which are mainly in China's Yunnan, Guizhou and. Guangxi provinces. One, the. Great Arch in Ziyun Getu He Chuandong National Park, includes a glass. elevator which delivers the less intrepid to the foot of the arch so. they do not have to climb. It is a vision of the future - and it's predicted the caves will be next. With. China becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,. tourists from other parts of the vast nation are already streaming. underground - though how long it will take to install a glass lift there. remains to be seen.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  Now, I have a new situation: Students working on their thesis for graduate school decide that they will write about the differences between two identical plants, but they will infect one of the plants with a fungus. This fungus will create a mycorrhizal association between one of the plants and the fungus. After caring for the plants, the students have grown fond of them and given them names. They have named one of them Audrey and the other Baudrey. They flip a coin to decide which plant will be infected with the fungus, and fate has decided that Audrey will have the fungus grow on it. Baudrey will be left to grow naturally.  Answer this question please: Which plant's roots will have more surface area? Answer:","output":"Audrey, the plant with the mycorrhizal association due to the fungus, will have more surface area in its roots. This is because the mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant's root system, allowing for improved water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

A few dates quickly lead to a sexual relationship despite an obvious difference in political thinking between the two. Sarah asks why Fielding wants to be a senator and his very serious reply is that he doesn't- he wants to be president. Sarah is later quoted as saying \\"Ambition is the ice in the lake of emotion.\\" And when Fielding tries to comfort Sarah's fear of his Coast Guard duty leading to a Vietnam tour, she replies \\"but if you go over there, you'll be shooting at the guys that I want to win.\\" Their intense love outweighs their differences, though, and their relationship quickly becomes serious.Meanwhile Fielding is a young politician being groomed to be congressman by the current govenor because of a scandal involving Jerry Carmichael 's (Ed Harris in a cameo role) resignation due to his homosexuality.

Input: Entomologist James Atherton (Julian Sands) searches the Amazon rainforest with the hope of discovering new species of insects and arachnids. Descending into an enormous sinkhole, his team sets up collectors on the ground below a large tree, then blow smoke up into the canopy of the tree. A large number of bugs fall into the collector, including a very aggressive new species of spider. The spider is captured and chloroformed for research; and is later revealed to be lacking sex organs, thus making it a drone, or soldier, highly unusual in an arachnid species. A nature photographer, Jerry Manley (Mark L. Taylor), who has been suffering a fever while traveling with the team, unknowingly has a fertile (non-drone) male spider of the same species jump into his backpack, that night sneaking into his sleeping bag and biting him. Manley has a massive seizure from the venom and dies. The remaining scientists takes his body back to the United States, blaming Manley's death on the preexisting fever. The spider follows the crew, jumps into the stretcher carrying Manley's body, and is sealed into a box with the corpse.Manley's body arrives at the funeral home in his small town of Canaima, California, and mortician Irv Kendall (Roy Brocksmith), stunned at the body's greenish color (from the spider's digestive fluids) does not notice the spider inside the coffin when he opens it. The spider sneaks outside and is picked up by a raven, but before the raven gets back to its nest, the raven is bitten by the spider and it falls dead to the ground in front of the barn of the Jennings family. Ross Jennings (Jeff Daniels) is a family physician who had moved to the town from San Francisco and who faces a lack of patients due to elderly rival Sam Metcalf (Henry Jones), who was supposed to retire and shift his patients to Ross, but decided to maintain his practice.The Amazonian spider mates with a female domestic house spider and makes a nest in Jennings' barn, producing hundreds of infertile drone offspring, all of which have their father's lethal bite. Ross, along with his son Tommy, has arachnophobia, making them targets of ridicule to wife Molly (Harley Jane Kozak) and daughter Shelly (Marlene Katz).Ross' first patient, Margaret Hollins (Mary Carver), dies after being bitten. The town's residents believe that she died from a heart attack, despite Ross' suspicions that something else was at work since her body appeared to have had a seizure instead. After a spider also kills a football player, a death that is attributed to a football injury, Ross is known to the town as \\"Dr. Death\\", having all his patients dying after having seen him. When Doc Metcalf is bitten and dies, Ross suspects that deadly arachnids could be infesting the town.Ross and county coroner Milton Briggs (James Handy) perform an autopsy on the victims and confirm Ross' suspicion that the deaths were caused by spider bites. Atherton arrives in town with his assistant Chris Collins (Brian McNamara), joining Briggs, Sheriff Lloyd Parsons (Stuart Pankin) and exterminator Delbert McClintock (John Goodman) in the spider investigation. They discover that the killer spiders have a short life expectancy due to being a mixed breed. Atherton tells them that the spiders are soldiers, sent out to eliminate potential threats for the general male spider. He also learns that the general spider produced a queen, which it likely mated with to produce a second nest someplace, guarded by the queen, which could produce fertile offspring. Atherton elaborates that, unlike the sinkhole of the spider's original habitat, which limited its territory, the transplanted spiders can progressively expand their territory, possibly culminating in their worldwide dispersal. The group sets out to destroy both nests and kill the queen and general, but Atherton plans to capture the general alive for his agenda after discovering where the first nest is located. Atherton plucks at the web to lure the general out, but gets caught by surprise as the general leaps from his hiding place and fatally bites Atherton.Ross, Chris, and Delbert eventually discover that the nest is in Ross's barn, and Ross sends Delbert to destroy it, where the exterminator finds Atherton dead before destroying the nest. Chris gets the Jennings family out of their infested house, but Ross falls through the floor into his wine cellar, which turns out to be the spiders' second nest, containing fertile offspring. After electrocuting the queen, Ross battles the general while also attempting to burn the second egg sac. He becomes trapped underneath fallen debris, with the general about to deliver the killing strike when Ross flings the general into the fire.As the egg sac hatches, the general jumps out of the fire. Ross shoots him with a nail gun and the projectile sends the burning spider into the egg sac, destroying the nest with fire and ending the plague.Having enough of the countryside along with the near-death experience, the Jennings family immediately moves back to San Francisco, appreciating city life once more, despite minor earthquakes disrupting them., Question: WHo jumped out of the fire?

A former cheerleading captain at a suburban Minneapolis high school was sentenced today to three years in prison for prostituting a younger squad member and keeping the money for herself. Montia Parker, 18, of Minnesota, previously pleaded guilty to three prostitution-related counts. She was immediately ordered into custody, and must spend at least two years behind bars before she's eligible for release. She must also register as a sex offender. Female pimp: 18-year-old Montia Parker, left and right, will serve at least two years in prison before being eligible for release. 'You were the leader of an attempted. high school prostitution ring,' Hennepin County District Court Judge. William Koch said at the sentencing hearing. 'And you did it all for a. pair of sneakers.' Parker. admitted that last March she told a 16-year-old fellow cheerleader at. Hopkins High School that the girl could earn money through prostitution. After the younger. girl agreed, Parker placed an ad for her online, then took her to an. apartment where the girl was paid to perform oral sex. The girl gave 60. to Parker, who kept the money. The. next day, Parker drove the girl to another apartment, but the girl. didn't do what the man asked her to do - vaginal sex - and offered oral. sex instead. The client declined and no money was exchanged. The. victim's sister told Koch that Parker manipulated a girl with a. learning disability, and that she had trusted Parker whom she considered. a friend. Skipping classes: The crime was reported when the victim's mother was notified about unexcused absences and read the text message conversations between the two girls. She asked the judge to make an example of Parker, saying her sister's life had been destroyed. Her sister has since isolated herself, switched schools, and quit cheerleading, she said. Prosecutor. Joshua Larson asked that Parker be sentenced to up to five years in. prison, saying Parker was the'\\"instigator, designer, manager and CEO of. pimping this child.' Parker's. attorney, Leon Trawick, argued for time in the workhouse and probation,. saying his client was an honor student with no criminal history and a. bright future ahead of her. Parker apologized in a letter to the judge, which was not read in court. But Koch said the crimes demanded time in prison, calling her actions peer pressure of the worst kind. 'This took planning. It took preparation. It took follow through,' Koch said. It. was revealed in court that Parker had become familiar with online sex. ads after a former boyfriend tried to pressure her into selling herself. for sex. Koch said that because of that, Parker should have known better and should have protected the victim instead of exploiting her. The victim's family left the courtroom without saying anything. Parker's family declined comment. According to the criminal complaint, Parker posed as the girl's mother and took her out of school. The. girl's mother called police after she noticed changes in her daughter's. behavior and checked the girl's cellphone, finding messages between. Parker and the girl. Hopkins. High School has said it took immediate action when it heard of the. charges and followed its disciplinary policy, which includes permanently. removing a student from campus.","output":"An 18-year-old girl named Montia Parker, who was a cheerleading captain at a school near Minneapolis, was sent to prison for three years. She did a very bad thing by making a younger cheerleader become involved in something called prostitution and took the money the younger girl was given. The judge was very upset with Montia because she was supposed to be a friend and leader to the younger girl but she made her do things for a pair of sneakers. Montia will have to stay in prison for at least two years before she can leave, and she has to register as a sex offender, which means people will know she did something wrong. The younger girl felt very sad, stopped cheerleading, and switched schools because of what happened. Montia's family and the younger girl's family did not want to talk about it when they left the courtroom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In Triplicane the next morning, Rajan (Sivaji Ganesan), a radio engineer and communications researcher, is found murdered with his own hand gun. His neighbor Chinnaiah Pillai (P. D. Sambandam) hears the gunshot and complains to the police. A local Police Inspector named Purushothaman Naidu arrives and investigates the scene. He is joined by C.I.D. officer Sivanandam (Javar Seetharaman)there. He concludes that the killer is some petty thief who must have shot Rajan for the lump of money found in the same room of the crime scene. However, Sivanandam states that to be of a bad solution, as the amount of money matches exactly with the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room, without a single rupee's difference. Nonetheless, it was clear Rajan was making plans to leave Chennai, in anticipation of the bombings. Rajan's wife Usha (Pandari Bai) is almost dumbstruck and unable to speak during any inquiries. Sivanandam and Naidu feel reluctant and embarrassed to do any questioning to her.The two decide to investigate the case by questioning the people in and around the house, who are the family members or friends of Rajan. They first do their inquiry with Chinnaiah Pillai, the neighbour as he is the first to inform them. He tells that the killer could probably be Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother (T. K. Balachandran). He recounts an incident (as flashback), in which Pattabi confronts Rajan at the house's garage to ask for his share of the family property to be apportioned and given to him. Rajan, in good faith, denies to give Pattabi his share, feeling that he and his wife might squander it. Chinnaiah concludes that this would have kindled Pattabi to kill Rajan.Sivanandam and Naidu decide to inquire Pattabi.

These ceramics date the offering to the end of the Late Preclassic. No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts. The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring 1 by 2 metres (3.3 by 6.6 ft), which was probably made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece jade necklace, two earspools coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from iron pyrite, one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved greenstone fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD 100–200.In October 2012, a tomb carbon-dated between 700 BC and 400 BC was reported to have been found in Takalik Abaj of a ruler nicknamed K'utz Chman (\\"Grandfather Vulture\\" in Mam) by archaeologists, a sacred king or \\"big chief\\" who \\"bridged the gap between the Olmec and Mayan cultures in Central America,\\" according to Miguel Orrego. The tomb is suggested to be the oldest Maya royal burial to have been discovered so far. Answer:","output":"The litter measuring 1 by 2 meters (3.3 by 6.6 ft) in the Late Preclassic tomb (Burial 1) was made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is this text about?","output":"This text provides a brief summary of a preseason basketball game between the Washington Wizards and the Charlotte Bobcats. The game took place at MCI Center, which was the home venue for the Washington Wizards and took place before the official start of the basketball season, hence the term \\"preseason game.\\"  In this match-up, the Wizards successfully beat the Bobcats with a score of 97-85. When the text mentions \\"a balanced attack,\\" it suggests that the Wizards' victory was a team effort, indicating that contributions were made from a number of different players rather than one or two individuals dominating the game. This style of play often leads to a more versatile offence and there are several key components, including ball movement, player movement, spacing, and skilled shooting. The crowd of 11,024 refers to the total number of spectators present at the stadium to witness the game. \\"Last night\\" indicates that the game was recently held, specifically, the night prior to when the text was written.

We ordered off the prix fixe menu.  Good value, good choices.  1st course.  Shrimp cocktail.  Good, albeit small shrimp.  Avocados in it was a good addition.  Wife had the wedge salad.  Again avocados was a good addition.  Blue cheese was a bit sharp though.  2nd Course.  Filet with horseradish mash potatoes.  Very good.  Potatoes were really good.  Wife had the pork lion with cream corn.  Very good again.  Cream corn was good but a bit sweet (sweeter than normal for me).  3rd course.  Peanut butter whatever the heck they call it.  Very good again, but honestly they could give you half as much and it would still be plenty for one person.  Wife had  pineapple bread pudding.  Very good again.

Summarize this article: Obama calls Boehner, urges him to allow vote on Senate payroll tax cut bill      By Amie Parnes -      President Obama called Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on Wednesday and urged him to allow a vote on the two-month payroll tax extension, calling it \\"the only option\\" to ensure taxes don't go up.      In a phone call made late Wednesday morning, Obama urged Boehner to take up the Senate's bill, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.      In the call, Obama told the Speaker he was committed to working with Congress on extending the payroll tax for the entire year. He also reminded Boehner that \\"the short-term bipartisan compromise passed by almost the entire Senate is the only option to ensure that middle-class families aren't hit with a tax hike in 10 days and gives both sides the time needed to work out a full-year solution,\\" according to a White House readout.      Boehner, however, urged Obama to call on Senate Democrats to appoint negotiators to a conference committee and said Republicans remain in Washington and are “ready to work,\\" according to a readout provided by an aide to the Speaker.      “Let’s get this done today,” the Speaker told the president, the aide said.      Boehner reminded Obama that the House was the only body “that had done what he asked for by providing a full year of payroll tax relief and extended unemployment benefits.”      “He urged the President to call on Senator Reid to appoint negotiators so that we can produce a full-year bill by the end of the year that provides a tax cut of 1,000 rather than only 166,” the aide said. “The Speaker told the president that his conference was elected to change the way Washington does business and that we should not waste the next ten days simply because it is an inconvenient time of year.”      The differences between the House GOP and the Senate, Boehner told the president, “are not so great that we cannot pass a full-year bill by December 31st,” the aide said.            Responding to Boehner's remarks on the call, which became public in the middle of the daily press briefing, Carney stood his ground and restated the administration's position saying the \\"opportunity\\" to pass the Senate legislation \\"is there.\\"      \\"Just take it,\\" Carney said. The spokesman added that the \\"sudden insistence\\" by the Speaker to pass a one-year extension \\"doesn't ring true.\\"      Asked if there was a stalemate happening, Carney replied, \\"There is a stalemate in that the speaker will not act.\\"      Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) chimed in late in the day, rifling off a letter to Boehner urging him and the GOP conference “not to walk away from the American people again.”      “There is still time to call the House back and pass the short-term extension bill that received 89 bipartisan votes in the U.S. Senate,” Pelosi wrote. “I am hopeful that reason will prevail in your conference and that we can secure a bipartisan, long-term bill after the first of the year.”            Obama also called Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) earlier Wednesday and \\"applauded\\" him for reaching the bipartisan compromise with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Carney said.      In that conversation, Reid \\"reaffirmed his commitment to secure a bipartisan yearlong tax cut after the House passes the two-month extension,\\" according to the White House readout.      \\"The ball is in the House's court,\\" Carney said, adding that they should \\"do the right thing and pass the bipartisan compromise.\\"      \\"They should just get it done,\\" Carney said.      Asked about Obama's plans to join his family in Hawaii, Carney said, \\"I don't have any scheduling updates to give you.\\"      Obama left the White House Wednesday afternoon for a shopping trip in Northern Virginia.      At the same time, Carney said that there would not be any more negotiating done. Obama \\"made clear\\" to Boehner that the House needs to take up the Senate bill.      \\"The negotiating has happened already,\\" Carney said. \\"It is not at all the case that the president is saying, 'Here's what I want, and do it.' \\"      — Russell Berman contributed.      — This story was last updated at 3:58 p.m.       ||||| “I have an 11- and 13-year-old at home, and I would love to be at home with them for the holidays and with my wife,” said Rep. Thomas Reed (R-N.Y.), one of the conference committee members. “But the American people deserve that we do our work and this Senate bill, 60 days, it’s just bad, reckless policy.”      Boehner appeared to shake off the scathing editorial from The Wall Street Journal, which declared that the Republicans “thoroughly botched the politics” of the payroll tax cut debate and put President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats in a better position to win reelection in 2012.      Text Size -      +      reset      “We are the party of lower taxes for the American people,” Boehner said when asked about the editorial. “We have fought for lower taxes for the 21 years that I have been in this Congress, and we will continue to be the party of lower taxes. The fact is that we can resolve the differences between the two parties and give the American people a real Christmas present.”      The Ohio Republican later added that it would be “helpful” if senators — both Republicans and Democrats — were in the Capitol to help negotiate a deal.      But there were no signs — at least publicly, that the Senate is going to help.      Several moderate Senate Republicans who are up for reelection next year have criticized House Republicans for not passing the Senate’s two-month extension. And on Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) joined in, declaring that the tax cut fight was “harming the Republican Party.”      “It is harming the view, if it’s possible anymore, of the American people about Congress,” McCain told CNN. “And we’ve got to get this thing resolved.”      McCain also tweeted Wednesday morning that the Journal’s editorial page was “right on the mark.” And Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) — who earlier this week said Reid should call the Senate back to Washington to work out a deal with House Republicans — said in a Wednesday morning television interview that the Journal editorial was “right.”      “One more public policy blunder, but just get it over with and move on because now it’s been framed as a tax increase, which it’s not,” Corker said on CNBC. “Probably at this point, the best thing to do is to figure out a way to get this behind us and move on and hopefully at some point, figure out a way to begin dealing with the real issues that our country needs to deal with.”      Clearly sensing a political advantage on the payroll tax debate, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters on a conference call that Boehner’s decision to block a vote on the Senate bill was “backfiring.”      “When the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal has turned on the top elected Republican in the United States, that tells you something,” said Schumer, who heads the Senate Democrats’ messaging operation. “It shows how quickly the politics and the substance of this issue have turned against the speaker.”      Asked whether Democrats were engaging in partisan gamesmanship of their own, Hoyer — who earlier had called the GOP conference committee a “gimmick” and a “political charade” — pushed back.      “This is democracy,” Hoyer said. “We’re not playing a game.”      Scott Wong contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"Once upon a time, President Obama called Speaker John Boehner. He asked him to let people vote on a bill about payroll tax cuts. This bill was important because it would stop taxes from going up for some people. But John Boehner wanted President Obama to talk to some other people in the government to make a different plan. He said they could still try to finish this problem before the end of the year. In the end, they were trying to find a way to agree on the best way to help people with their taxes. Some other people, like Nancy Pelosi, also shared their opinions and asked them to work together."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Alice Paul was born on January 11, 1885, at Paulsdale in Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey. She was the eldest of four children of William Mickle Paul I (1850-1902) and Tacie Paul (nee Parry), and a descendant of William Penn, the Quaker founder of Pennsylvania. Her siblings were Willam, Helen, and Parry. She grew up in the Quaker tradition of public service; her ancestors included participants in the New Jersey Committee of Correspondence in the Revolutionary era and a state legislative leader in the 19th century. Paul attended Moorestown Friends School, where she graduated at the top of her class. In 1901, Paul went to Swarthmore College, an institution co-founded by her grandfather. While attending Swarthmore, Paul served as a member on the Executive Board of Student Government, one experience which may have sparked her eventual excitement for political activism. Alice graduated from Swarthmore College with a bachelor's degree in biology in 1905.  Partly in order to avoid going into teaching work, Paul completed a fellowship year at a settlement house in New York City after her graduation, living on the Lower East Side at the College Settlement House. While working on settlement activities taught her about the need to right injustice in America, Alice soon decided that social work was not the way she was to achieve this goal: \\"I knew in a very short time I was never going to be a social worker, because I could see that social workers were not doing much good in the world... you couldn't change the situation by social work.\\"  Paul then earned a master of arts from the University of Pennsylvania in 1907, after completing coursework in political science, sociology and economics. She continued her studies at the Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre in Birmingham, England, and took economics classes from the University of Birmingham, while continuing to earn money doing social work. She first heard Christabel Pankhurst speak at Birmingham. When she later moved to London to work, she joined the militant suffrage group the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) led by Christabel and her mother, Emmeline Pankhurst. She was arrested repeatedly during suffrage demonstrations and served three jail terms. After returning from England in 1910, Paul continued her studies at the University of Pennsylvania, earning a Ph.D. in sociology. Her dissertation was entitled \\"The Legal Position of Women in Pennsylvania\\"; it discussed the history of the women's movement in Pennsylvania and the rest of the U.S., and urged woman suffrage as the key issue of the day.  Paul later received her law degree (LL.B) from the Washington College of Law at American University in 1922, after the suffrage fight was over. In 1927, she earned a master of laws degree, and in 1928, a doctorate in civil law from American University. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article. One interesting aspect is Alice Paul's transition from social work to political activism, as she believed that social work was not the best way for her to achieve change and fight injustice.

The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

Osman's son, Orhan, captured the northwestern Anatolian city of Bursa in 1324, and made it the new capital of the Ottoman state. This Ottoman conquest meant the loss of Byzantine control over northwestern Anatolia. The important city of Thessaloniki was captured from the Venetians in 1387. The Ottoman victory at Kosovo in 1389 effectively marked the end of Serbian power in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into Europe. The Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, widely regarded as the last large-scale crusade of the Middle Ages, failed to stop the advance of the victorious Ottoman Turks.

We want to find the value of 'i' (imagine 'i' as an ice cream) in this equation: -15*i + 13*i - 10 = 0 1. First, let's combine the ice creams: -15 ice creams (negative because someone took them away) and 13 ice creams (positive because you have them now). So: -15 ice creams + 13 ice creams = -2 ice creams Now the equation looks like this: -2*i - 10 = 0. 2. Let's add 10 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -10: -2*i - 10 + 10 = 0 + 10 -2*i = 10 3.  Now, we just have -2 times the ice creams equal 10: -2*i = 10. We want to know how many ice creams 'i' is, so we need to divide both sides of the equation by -2: (-2*i) / -2 = 10 / -2 When we divide, we get: i = -5 So, the solution is that 'i', which represents the number of ice creams, equals -5.

Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \\"Cougars\\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday, as well as expelling players due to honor code violations. Beginning in the 2011 season, BYU football competes in college football as an independent. In addition, most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference. Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men's volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. For outdoor track and field, the Cougars became an Independent. Softball returned to the Western Athletic Conference, but spent only one season in the WAC; the team moved to the Pacific Coast Softball Conference after the 2012 season.

U.S. expels Venezuelan diplomat in Miami By the CNN Wire Staff updated 12:33 PM EST, Sun January 8, 2012 Washington (CNN) -- Venezuela's consul general in Miami has been declared to be persona non grata and must leave the United States, a State Department spokesman said Sunday. Spokesman William Ostick declined to comment on specific details behind the decision to expel Livia Acosta Noguera, who has headed Venezuela's consulate in Miami since March 2011. The Venezuelan Embassy in Washington was informed of the decision Friday, the spokesman said in a written statement, and the State Department said Acosta must depart the United States by Tuesday. It was unclear Sunday whether she remained in the United States. Last month, a group of American lawmakers said they had \\"grave concerns\\" about Acosta and called for an investigation after the Spanish-language TV channel Univision aired a documentary alleging that she was among a group of Venezuelan and Iranian diplomats who expressed interest in an offer from a group of Mexican hackers to infiltrate the websites of the White House, the FBI, the Pentagon and U.S. nuclear plants. The evidence that the plot was real, according to Univision, are secret recordings with diplomats who ask questions about what the hackers can do and promise to send information to their governments. Univision interviewed a purported Mexican whistle-blower -- a student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico named Juan Carlos Munoz Ledo. The student told Univision he was recruited by a leftist professor who wanted to wage cyberattacks on the United States and its allies. Munoz told Univision he secretly recorded a meeting in 2008 with Acosta, who was then the cultural attache of the Venezuelan Embassy in Mexico. According to a recording Univision aired as part of its report, Acosta is heard saying that she can send the information gathered by the hackers straight to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Chavez has called the report \\"lies.\\" One of the Iranian diplomats told Univision that although he, indeed, was presented with a hacking plot by the Mexican group, he turned it down, in part because he thought they were CIA agents. In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last month, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Rep. David Rivera, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart and Rep. Albio Sires asked the State Department to require Acosta's \\"immediate departure\\" from the United States if the Univision report proved true. Last month a State Department spokesman said the United States did not know about the alleged plot, but that it found the Univision allegations \\"very disturbing.\\" However, \\"we don't have any information, at this point, to corroborate it,\\" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said.

Museum's for me tend to be something a tourist visits when discovering a new city.    We had a work function here and it was quite delightful to visit this neat little museum tucked into the corner right adjacent to Old Montreal.  We started off the day with a light breakfast in the upstairs cafeteria which consisted of eggs, fruit and some french toast.  After you could go out on their balcony and get some views of the old port.  On our day there was a cruise ship within eye's view!      They have done an admirable job in keeping some of the history and original rock and brick of the past.  Artifacts behind glass are nice to gaze at to think of how time was many hundreds of years ago!  Next was a Pirate ship and tour and explanation for the kids which was done in interesting and curious fashion.     Finishing off the trip was a visit to their 2-D theatre in which you get an 18 minute history lesson of Montreal (available in French, English and Spanish)!  It's a nice finishing touch to make you leaving with a positive impression of Montreal.    I'd recommend this as a tourist attraction but some may be disappointed as it's a small museum.  I'd recommend not coming in here with huge expectations and you may be surprised or disappointed depending on your mood and temperament! Is this review positive or negative? Choose from:  (1). negative;  (2). positive; Answer:","output":"(2). positive This review is positive because the person describes their delightful visit, admires the job the museum has done with the history and artifacts, enjoyed the Pirate ship tour and 2-D theatre, and recommends it as a tourist attraction. The only caution they mention is the museum's size but overall, they have a positive impression of the place. Other choices like negative are not correct because the review clearly shows enjoyment and appreciation for the museum."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tommy returns with his friend Allen Hawes, hoping to cremate Jason's body and stop his hallucinations. At the cemetery, they dig up Jason's corpse, but seeing it causes Tommy to snap, and he stabs Jason's body with a metal fence post. As he turns his back on Jason, two lightning bolts strike the post and revive the now-undead killer. Tommy tries to light the gasoline in which he has soaked Jason, but a sudden downpour prevents it. When Hawes tries to attack Jason with a shovel, the shovel breaks on impact and his heart is punched out. Tommy makes his way to the sheriff's office, when he panics and attempts to grab weapons, it gets him put into a jail cell. His warning that Jason has returned goes unheeded by Sheriff Garris, who is aware of Tommy's mental problems and thinks he is imagining Jason. On the road, camp counselors Darren and Lizbeth get lost looking for the camp and run into Jason. After they fail trying to frighten Jason off the road, he impales them both with the metal rod that resurrected him. The next morning, Garris' daughter Megan and her friends Sissy, Cort and Lizbeth's sister Paula ask him to search for Darren and Lizbeth. Tommy warns them about Jason, but as he is now considered an urban legend they ignore the warnings, though Megan finds herself attracted to him. In the woods, Jason happens upon a corporate paintball game. He kills four of the players for their equipment and chases the fifth off into the woods. At Camp Forest Green, the kids arrive, and the teens do their best to run the camp without Darren and Lizbeth. Meanwhile, Garris decides to escort Tommy out of his jurisdiction due to his influence on his daughter.

Tommy, along with Megan, head to the camp and find that Jason has already killed Paula, Sissy, and Cort. Realizing the danger the children at the camp are in, Tommy and Megan rush to protect them. As they do this, Jason suddenly appears and bursts through a window, but Tommy successfully lures him away from the children. Tommy plans to trap Jason in the lake, where he originally drowned, by tying a chain attached to a rock around his neck, effectively weighing him down to the bottom of the lake. Jason and Tommy face off on the lake's surface, engaging in a fierce battle with one another. Sheriff Garris also gets involved, trying to protect his daughter and the campers, but Jason kills him in the process. While Tommy struggles with the seemingly unstoppable killer, Megan comes to his assistance, managing to retrieve the chain and attach it to Jason's neck. With the heavy rock and chain weighing him down, Jason slowly sinks to the bottom of the lake, unable to escape. Tommy, injured by their battle, begins to drown as well, but Megan dives in to save him, slashing Jason's neck in the process. The distraction allows Megan to pull Tommy out of the water and bring him to safety. The two survivors watch as Jason writhes and struggles underwater, ultimately unable to break free from his watery prison. Despite the horrors they have experienced and the lives they have lost, Tommy and Megan now believe that Jason Voorhees is truly and finally defeated.

Please answer this question: Deviating from standard practice, the US patent office has a policy of refusing to grant a patent without a working model for what type of device?","output":"The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) deviates from standard practice and enforces a policy of refusing to grant patents without a working model for a specific type of device, known as a perpetual motion machine or a \\"free energy\\" device. This policy has been adopted as a means to prevent the grant of patents for unfeasible inventions that violate the fundamental laws of physics and perpetrate scientific fraud. Perpetual motion machines are hypothetical devices that operate indefinitely without an energy source or violate the laws of thermodynamics. Specifically, they defy the first law of thermodynamics, which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed; it can only change forms, and the second law of thermodynamics, which states that in any energy transfer or transformation, the total entropy of a closed system will always increase over time. As a result, these machines are considered impossible as they imply the creation of energy from nothing or the existence of a perpetual energy cycle that has zero energy loss, contrary to accepted scientific principles. Understanding that many inventors have made unsubstantiated claims regarding the invention of perpetual motion machines, the USPTO has implemented strict requirements when examining patent applications related to such devices. Inventors are required to submit a working model along with their patent application for review. This working model must be replicable and demonstrate that the proposed device operates as claimed, proving that it satisfies its perpetual motion claims. Providing a working model allows the USPTO to thoroughly review and analyze the device's functionality according to established scientific principles. By examining the model, patent examiners can verify if the invention merits a patent grant or if it simply defies accepted scientific theories. This policy serves to uphold the integrity of the patent system by ensuring that patents are only granted to inventions that demonstrate scientific plausibility and practical utility, conforming to the United States Code, Title 35, Section 101, which outlines criteria for patentable subject matter. Requiring a working model to accompany patent applications for perpetual motion machines ensures that the USPTO does not endorse the patenting of unproven, scientifically implausible, or fraudulent inventions that could undermine public trust in the institution and the broader scientific community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","output":"The given sentence in German states: \\"Neue Neuronen folgen dem Fluss der Cerebrospinalflüssigkeit im erwachsenen Gehirn.\\"  In English, this translates to: \\"New neurons follow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the adult brain.\\" To provide a detailed explanation of the translated sentence: New neurons, also known as nerve cells, are the primary components of the nervous system that include the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. The process of new neuron generation is called neurogenesis, which predominantly occurs during embryonic development. However, in recent years, studies have shown that neurogenesis can also continue, to some extent, in specific regions of the adult brain. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless fluid that circulates within the ventricles (cavities) of the brain, the central canal of the spinal cord, and the subarachnoid space, which is a space between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It acts as a \\"cushion\\" for the brain and spinal cord, providing mechanical support, and plays a crucial role in maintaining the physiological homeostasis of the central nervous system. The statement that new neurons follow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the adult brain highlights the potential guidance and influence of this fluid on the migration and distribution of newly generated neurons. The flow of CSF may create a pathway for these cells to navigate or provide essential nutrients and signaling molecules that help regulate neuronal development and integration into existing neural networks. This migration of new neurons is a vital process for maintaining the proper functioning of specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation and learning. Furthermore, research exploring the relationship between neurogenesis and cerebrospinal fluid may provide valuable insights into the potential for enhancing cognitive function and developing new treatment strategies for neurological disorders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.  What is an answer for this question: Which person studied more about the ways female fish release very high numbers of eggs? Answer:","output":"Tim studied more about the ways female fish release very high numbers of eggs, as he focused on fish reproduction in college."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.  Mike is studying the population growth rate of countries around the world. He noticed that countries like Japan and Russia are having a demographic shift. They have a growing population of late adulthood. He recorded the late adulthood population as population A. On the other hand, many developing countries have growing population of younger people. He recorded younger population as population B.  Which population would less likley develop cardiovascular diseases, population A or population B?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   There are many choices you can make to keep your nervous system healthy. One obvious choice is to avoid using alcohol or other drugs. Not only will you avoid the injury that drugs themselves can cause, but you will also be less likely to get involved in other risky behaviors that could harm your nervous system. Another way to keep the nervous system healthy is to eat a variety of healthy foods. The minerals sodium, calcium, and potassium, and vitamins B 1 and B 12 are important for a healthy nervous system. Some foods that are good sources for these minerals and vitamins include milk, whole grains, beef steak, and kidney beans (shown in Figure below ). Your brain also needs healthy fats like those in nuts and fish. Recall that fats insulate the axons of neurons. These fats help build new connections between nerves and brain cells. These fats may improve memory and increase learning and intelligence. Water is also important for the nervous system, so drink plenty of water and other fluids. This helps prevent dehydration, which can cause confusion and memory problems. And get plenty of rest. Your brain requires plenty of rest so it can strengthen circuits that help with memory. A good night’s sleep will help keep your brain functioning at its best.   Q: Why is water important for the nervous system?   Choices:  - to carry nutrients  - to carry information  - to prevent disease  - to prevent dehydration  A: Answer:","output":"Water is important for the nervous system to prevent dehydration.

I always have stayed away from hospitals. People died or were born. But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs. It absolutely reeked of hush and hidden feeling. It was worse than a church. It was worse than a highschool hallway. It was more universal, more basic, something even the children could comprehend.

Question: Does Stacie wish to keep the home after Laurel's death, or sell it? Movie plot title: Freeheld Movie plot: The film opens at a meeting of the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Ocean County, New Jersey in 2005. Ocean County resident and New Jersey police officer Lieutenant Laurel Hester, a 23-year veteran of the police force, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and expected to live only one year, she wishes to pass on her pension to her domestic partner of five years, Stacie Andree. Although New Jersey counties have the option to extend pension benefits to domestic partners, Ocean County Freeholders will not do this. In protest, the state's LGBT civil rights organization, Garden State Equality, organizes hundreds of people to speak out at each of the Freeholders' meetings. The crowds Garden State Equality organizes get bigger and more vociferous at each meeting.Among those speaking out are Laurel's police colleagues and Ocean County residents, describing Laurel's 25 years of exemplary work for the police department, and petitioning the Freeholders to allow her to pass on her pension to Stacie. Laurel's first police partner, Dane Wells, speaks about her and compares the situation to separate drinking fountains and seats at the back of the bus. Freeholder Joseph Vicari says that although they are \\"anguished\\" by Laurel's case, they are unable to change things because of state legislature and moves for an adjournment. The members of the public present are unhappy with this decision and some begin to chant \\"It's in your power\\".Outside the administration building, news reporter Ida Siegal explains the background to the case. In 2004 New Jersey passed the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act which allows all gay and lesbian state employees to pass on their benefits, including the pension, to their domestic live-in lovers/partners. According to Siegal, all New Jersey counties can choose whether or not to allow their employees to pass on benefits to their partners.

While Western states have allowed it for more than 50 years; eastern states amended their traffic laws to allow it in the 1970s as a fuel-saving measure in response to motor fuel shortages in 1973. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 required in §362(c)(5) that in order for a state to receive federal assistance in developing mandated conservation programs, they must permit right turns on red lights. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have allowed right turns on red since 1980, except where prohibited by a sign or where right turns are controlled by dedicated traffic lights. (On January 1, 1980, Massachusetts became the last US state to allow right turns on red.) The few exceptions include New York City, where right turns on red are prohibited, unless a sign indicates otherwise. What's the best answer to this question: is it legal to turn right on red in california?","output":"Yes, it is legal to turn right on red in California, as it follows the general rule in the United States permitting right turns on red lights. However, there are certain exceptions and rules to keep in mind while executing a right turn on red in California. 1. No Sign Prohibiting the Turn: Ensure there is no sign explicitly prohibiting a right turn on red at the traffic signal. If a sign marked \\"No Turn on Red\\" or similar wording is displayed, you must abide by it and wait for a green signal. 2. Yield to Traffic and Pedestrians: Before proceeding with a right turn on a red light, you must come to a complete stop, yield to any oncoming traffic, and check for pedestrians crossing the street. Only when it is absolutely safe and clear should you initiate the turn. 3. Dedicated Right Turn Signal: In cases where a dedicated right turn signal is present, you must wait for the specific green arrow or signal to appear before initiating the right turn. Turning on a red arrow or red light in such instances is not permitted. 4. Right Turns on Red Arrows: While uncommon, some traffic signals operate with red arrows for right turns. Although turning right on a red arrow is generally prohibited, California law does allow it in specific situations. You must first stop and yield to oncoming traffic, then proceed with caution after ensuring no signs prohibit such a maneuver. Always exercise caution and abide by local traffic laws when turning right on a red light, keeping in mind these exceptions and rules to ensure a safe and legal driving experience in California."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Clarke said he was 'a week ahead of schedule' with his recovery. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Mitchell Johnson and Michael Clarke's Injury Updates: A Tale of Two Hamstrings Recently, it has been announced that pace bowling powerhouse Mitchell Johnson will miss the fourth Test match due to a minor hamstring complaint. Fortunately, the injury does not appear to be serious, and Johnson is expected to make a full recovery in time for the One Day International (ODI) tri-series. Meanwhile, Australian cricket team captain Michael Clarke has had to withdraw from the Test series against India due to his ongoing hamstring injury, but is actively working on his recovery in hopes of participating in the early stages of the World Cup. Mitchell Johnson, a key player in the Australian bowling line-up, has been experiencing some hamstring discomfort and has decided to skip the upcoming fourth Test match to ensure his performance remains uncompromised during the ODI tri-series. As Johnson's injury is not considered severe, it is believed that a period of rest and recuperation will be enough to resolve the issue and see him fit and ready for the next cricket event. On the other hand, Michael Clarke has not had such a smooth journey towards recovery. The Australian captain suffered a significant hamstring injury during the first Test against India, and ever since then, there has been a constant struggle to manage and rehabilitate it. Being ruled out of the Test series against India was a blow for both Clarke and the Australian team, but the focus has now shifted to ensure that the star player can make a strong and successful return to international cricket. Clarke's presence and contribution on the field are invaluable, and his recent update on his fitness progress was a sigh of relief for the fans and the team. In a statement, Clarke mentioned that he is currently \\"a week ahead of schedule\\" with his recovery, which brings hope that he will be able to return to play in the early stages of the prestigious World Cup event. However, rushing his recovery might be disastrous; taking a cautious approach while aiming to be fit as soon as possible seems to be the best course of action. Both Johnson's and Clarke's injuries underline the risk and strain that professional cricket can put on the athletes. Although they are examples of different severities and stages, their situations showcase the importance of proper injury management, timely intervention, and ensuring that the players receive optimal rest and medical support. In conclusion, Mitchell Johnson's absence from the fourth Test match due to hamstring issues appears to be a precautionary measure, and fans can expect to see him in action during the upcoming ODI tri-series. As for Michael Clarke, his road to recovery is ongoing, with the captain optimistically hoping to return to the field during the early stages of the World Cup. The Australian cricket team will undoubtedly miss the prowess of these two key players, but their long-term health and readiness for future events must be the priority."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is the one institution that binds women and men together to form a family, and this serves broad societal purposes. In California, a U.S. District Court Judge last week overturned Proposition 8, the California Marriage Protection Act. It was passed in November 2008 by California voters to recognize \\"only marriage between a man and a woman.\\" The majority of Californians, including two-thirds of the state's black voters, have just had their core civil right -- the right to vote -- stripped from them by an openly gay federal judge who has misread history and the Constitution to impose his views on the state's people. The implicit comparison Judge Vaughn Walker made between racism and opposition to same-sex marriage is particularly offensive to me and to all who remember the reality of Jim Crow. It is not bigotry, it is biology that discriminates between same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples. A marriage requires a husband and a wife, because these unions are necessary to make new life and connect children to their mother and father. Judge Walker's decision will not stand the test of time and history. Congress and the Supreme Court must act to protect all Americans' right to vote for marriage. Advocates of making same-sex marriage a legally recognized right claim that this will have no impact on traditional marriage -- that it can peacefully coexist alongside traditional marriage. On the contrary, it will have profound impacts. It will create a conflict for people of faith (and nonreligious people as well) who fervently believe in traditional man-woman marriage and the law. The Bible is so clear in its support of heterosexual marriage there is little need for us to go through an exhaustive definition of biblical marriage versus the types of unions allowed by law today. The Scriptures say in Genesis 2:24 that a man is to leave his family and cleave to his wife. This concept is repeated in Matthew 19:5 and Mark 10:7. All the scriptures in the Bible concerning marriage presuppose heterosexual marriage. We can teach our kids that there are important spiritual and societal reasons to believe in traditional marriage and oppose same-sex marriage. But if same-sex marriage becomes legally recognized across the country, our kids will be told that gay marriage is a civil rights issue and that those who oppose it are akin to the racists of history who opposed interracial marriage and supported slavery. We can teach our children at home that marriage is between a man and a woman, but our children's public schools will teach them that marriage includes same-sex couples. Both would be \\"equal marriages\\" under the law. What might this look like? In Massachusetts, where a ruling legalized same-sex marriage in 2004, kids in public schools are reading books depicting same-sex families. At a California charter school in 2008, kindergartners' parents objected when a school newsletter alerted them to \\"National Coming Out Day;\\" a parent told a local ABC-TV affiliate that a teacher at the school screened a film to kindergartners the previous year showing gay families. These kinds of ill-advised social experiments may produce a host of unexpected consequences. If gay marriage is allowed, the nation will soon begin to experience an increased degradation of the nuclear family -- resulting in fewer kids being raised by both a mom and a dad. Beyond that, those of us who believe in traditional marriage and are in a regulated profession -- such as counselor, physician, attorney or accountant -- and act in concert with our beliefs, may be vulnerable to losing our professional license and our livelihood. We can be a religious charity faithfully fulfilling our mission by serving our community, such as by providing adoption and other services, but if we refuse to provide those services to a same-sex couple, we have the choice of abandoning our beliefs or ending our mission. In 2003, Adoption.com was sued by two California homosexual men, who claimed illegal discrimination because the agency refused to serve homosexual couples. The agency lost the lawsuit and no longer serves adoptive parents in California. An even more substantive danger lies in the consequences of gay marriage on the next generation. Redefining marriage redefines family. Changing the concept of family will change both the definition and the pattern of parenting. What will the landscape of America look like if same-sex marriage is legalized across our nation? Social scientists report what most Americans have always known: Both boys and girls are deeply affected in biological and psychological ways by the presence of their fathers. If the American family loses the presence of the birth dad in the home, there will be huge consequences to the growth and stability of the next generation of children in that family. For example, repeatedly, scholarly studies focused on adolescence show that early onset of puberty in girls is associated with negative psychological, social, and health problems including depression, alcohol consumption, and higher teenage pregnancy. An eight-year study of girls and their families showed that a father's presence in the home, with appropriate involvement in his children's lives, contributed to daughters' reaching puberty at a later age. Despite the incredible adaptability of children, our entire culture should advocate for family structures that promote the most positive environments for coming generations. In addition to fighting the marriage redefinition, leaders from all sectors of our culture, including our churches, must work hard at improving heterosexual marriages. Counseling, modeling, and interventions are needed to help ailing marriages. Both battles must be fought if our families, which are the incubators of future societal greatness, are to be protected. Let's set our sights high. Let's not fall victim to the circling  argument of our opposition. We simply need an army of bipartisan leaders to strategize, organize, and prioritize the protection of marriage. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harry R. Jackson, Jr. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The author of this article argues against the legalization of same-sex marriage, claiming it poses threats to traditional marriage and family structures.

The investing genius made an eye-popping 37 million a day in 2013 - that's 1.5 million an hour - simply watching the shares in his conglomerate soar by more than 25 per cent. The Berkshire Hathaway boss' net worth bounced 12.7 billion to 59.1 billion over the period, making him the billionaire who made the most cash this year, according to a new survey. Battling it out: Warren Buffett, left, made 37million a day in 2013 - that's 1.5million an HOUR - bringing his eye-popping net worth to 59billion but Bill Gates, right, still tops the list of the world's richest people. But even with his staggering money-making, Buffett, who lives a notoriously humble existence despite his billions, only came second on the list of the world's Top 10 richest people, compiled by Wealth-X. Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates took the top spot for another year, with a total net worth of 72.6 billion, up from 61.1 billion in 2012. Gates' impressive gain saw him come second to Buffett in the gains stakes, and in third place was casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who's worth an estimated 35.3 billion this year after raking in 11.4 billion from his gambling houses in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore. Big year: Amazon's Jeff Bezos's 11.3 billion in earnings snatched him fourth place while Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg added 10.5 billion to make up a now staggering 24.7 billion net worth and take fifth spot. 1.

With the help of his companions, three of the finest musketeers in France, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, d'Artagnan makes his way to England to seek the Duke himself, so that he may recover the diamonds and restore the queen's honor. Still, when all problems seem overcome, the English Duke of Buckingham plans to invade France, remove King Louis XIII and marry the queen; on the other hand, Cardinal Richelieu and Milady want revenge on d'Artagnan and Buckingham.

This period marked a series of experiments in conservation, reforestation, and efforts to increase rainfall on the island. These environmental interventions were closely linked to the conceptualization of the processes of environmental change and helped establish the roots of environmentalism. Saint Helena, a remote island located in the South Atlantic Ocean, experienced significant deforestation due to human activities, such as the introduction of non-native species and the overexploitation of natural resources. This led to a decrease in rainfall and a decline in the island's biodiversity, raising concerns among scientists and officials about the long-term sustainability of the island. To address this issue, multiple artificial rainfall enhancement techniques were explored. One technique was cloud seeding, which involved dispersing particles or chemicals into the atmosphere to encourage the formation of rain clouds. Another method was the construction of fog fences to capture water droplets from the fog and channel the captured moisture into the ground to irrigate plants and replenish groundwater supplies. In addition, the island's reforestation efforts aimed to restore native vegetation. The reestablishment of healthy ecosystems could promote a more favorable microclimate, leading to an increase in local precipitation. These projects aimed at reversing the island's desertification and transforming it into a more sustainable habitat. The experiments conducted on Saint Helena laid the groundwork for environmentalism and the understanding of human-induced environmental change. It provided valuable insights into the complex relationship between ecosystems, climate, and human activity. Through these efforts, scientists and environmentalists developed new strategies for environmental management and conservation, contributing to a broader awareness of the importance of sustainable land use and preservation of our planet's resources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Kyphosis is a medical condition that affects the human spine, specifically the thoracic region, which is the upper and middle part of the back. This condition is characterized by an exaggerated forward rounding or curvature of the spine, often referred to as a \\"humpback\\" or \\"dowager's hump\\" appearance. In a healthy spine, there is a natural curve in the thoracic region that allows for flexibility, balance, and shock absorption. However, when this curvature becomes more pronounced than normal, it results in kyphosis. There are several types and causes of kyphosis, including: 1. Postural kyphosis: This is the most common form of kyphosis, often seen in adolescents and young adults, and is primarily caused by poor posture and slouching. In most cases, it is mild and can be corrected through physical therapy and practicing good posture. 2. Scheuermann's kyphosis: This type of kyphosis occurs in adolescents during growth spurts and is thought to be caused by abnormal growth of the vertebrae, leading to a more rigid and exaggerated curvature. Bracing or surgical intervention may be required in severe cases. 3. Congenital kyphosis: This rare form of kyphosis is present at birth and is caused by abnormal development of the spinal column during pregnancy. Depending on the severity, infants may require surgical intervention to prevent complications and developmental issues. 4. Osteoporosis-related kyphosis: As people age, their bone density can decrease, resulting in osteoporosis. This can lead to compression fractures in the vertebrae, causing the spine to curve forward progressively. Treatment often includes medications to improve bone density and bracing to support the spine. 5. Degenerative kyphosis: This form of kyphosis results from wear and tear on the spine over time due to aging or conditions like arthritis that cause gradual degeneration of the intervertebral discs and facet joints. Treatment varies depending on the severity and may include pain management, physical therapy, or surgery. Kyphosis can have various effects on the body, ranging from mild discomfort and cosmetic concerns to more severe issues like chronic pain, reduced mobility, and difficulty breathing. Treatment for kyphosis is primarily based on the severity of the condition and the underlying cause. In mild cases, conservative treatment options like physical therapy, postural training, and pain management are often sufficient. In more severe cases or when the condition is progressive, more aggressive treatments such as bracing or surgical intervention may be necessary. Diagnosis of kyphosis typically involves a thorough physical examination, assessment of medical history, and imaging tests like X-rays, CT scans, or MRI to evaluate the degree of curvature and potential causes. Early detection and intervention are essential for addressing the underlying issues and preventing long-term complications that can be associated with this spinal deformity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His parents divorced when he was four and his mother remarried soon afterwards. Since the family finances were strained by medical bills, he had to leave school at 16 in 1968. Context: To avoid conscription into the Australian Army, Tatchell moved to London in 1971. He had accepted being gay in 1969, and in London became a leading member of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) until its 1974 collapse. During this time Tatchell was prominent in organising sit-ins at pubs that refused to serve \\"poofs\\" and protests against police harassment and the medical classification of homosexuality as an illness. With others he helped organise Britain's first Gay Pride march in 1972.  In 1973, he attended the 10th World Youth Festival in East Berlin on GLF's behalf. His actions triggered opposition within and between different groups of national delegates including the Communist Party of Great Britain and National Union of Students. He was banned from conferences, had his leaflets confiscated and burned, was interrogated by the secret police (the Stasi) and threatened and assaulted by other delegates, mostly communists.  Tatchell later claimed that this was the first time gay liberation politics were publicly disseminated and discussed in a communist country, although he noted that, in terms of decriminalisation and the age of consent, gay men had greater rights in East Germany at the time than in Britain and much of the West.  Describing his time in the Gay Liberation Front, he wrote in The Guardian that:  [The] GLF was a glorious, enthusiastic and often chaotic mix of anarchists, hippies, leftwingers, feminists, liberals and counter-culturalists. Despite our differences, we shared a radical idealism - a dream of what the world could and should be - free from not just homophobia but the whole sex-shame culture, which oppressed straights as much as LGBTs. We were sexual liberationists and social revolutionaries, out to turn the world upside down. [...] GLF's main aim was never equality within the status quo. [...] GLF's strategy for queer emancipation was to change society's values and norms, rather than adapt to them. We sought a cultural revolution to overturn centuries of male heterosexual domination and thereby free both queers and women. [...] Forty years on, GLF's gender agenda has been partly won. [...] Girlish boys and boyish girls don't get victimised as much as in times past. LGBT kids often now come out at the age of 12 or 14. While many are bullied, many others are not. The acceptance of sexual and gender diversity is increasing. Question: What was the ideology of the GLF?. Whats the answer?","output":"The Gay Liberation Front (GLF)'s ideology was much more than simply seeking legal rights for gay individuals. It was a radical movement aimed at societal transformation to challenge and overturn deeply ingrained norms, biases and systemic patterns of discrimination about sexuality and gender roles. The GLF was a diverse assembly of people, including anarchists, hippies, left-wingers, feminists, liberals, and counter-culturalists, all united in their shared idealistic vision of a world free from sexual shamings and oppressions that impacted not just LGBT+ individuals but also straight people. The main aim of the GLF, as described by Tatchell, was not merely equality within existing societal paradigms, but rather it was about causing a cultural revolution, challenging and changing the basic values and norms of society. The members did not just want to adapt to existing societal norms but wished to fundamentally transform them. This transformative ideology of the GLF was focused on ending centuries of male heterosexual domination so that all sexual orientations and genders could experience freedom and equality. In essence, the GLF sought liberation through liberation; it aimed at creating a society where sexual orientation and gender identity were no longer sources of shame or discrimination. It strove for attitudinal and institutional changes, changing the way people thought about and treated homosexuality, advocating for acceptance of sexual and gender diversity, and, crucially, working towards the rights and safety of 'girlish boys and boyish girls', as well as LGBT+ kids in general. This ideology of the GLF would succeed in accomplishing considerable progress over the years—a fact that is apparent from the increased acceptance of sexual and gender diversity in present times compared to past eras. It is notably visible in the greater freedom with which LGBT+ kids now come out and the lower rates of victimisation they face. However, Tatchell did mention that their goal had only been \\"partly won\\", indicating there's still work to do."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Movie plot: The story is told in flashback by a villager, played by Mervyn Johns, as though to a person visiting after the war. He recounts: one Saturday during the Second World War, a group of seemingly authentic British soldiers arrive in the small, fictitious English village of Bramley End.[1] It is the Whitsun weekend so life is even quieter than usual and there is almost no traffic of any kind. At first they are welcomed by the villagers, until doubts begin to grow about their true purpose and identity. After they are revealed to be German soldiers intended to form the vanguard of an invasion of Britain, they round up the residents and hold them captive in the local church. The vicar is shot after sounding the church bell in alarm. In attempts to reach the outside world, many of the villagers take action. Such plans include writing a message on an egg and giving them to the local paper boy for his mother, but they are crushed when Mrs Fraser's cousin runs over them. Mrs Fraser then puts a note in Cousin Maude's pocket, but she uses it to hold her car window in place; her dog, Edward, then chews it to shreds after it blows onto the back seat. Mrs Collins, the postmistress, manages to kill a German with an axe used for chopping firewood, and tries to telephone elsewhere. The girls on the exchange see her light and decide that she can wait. Mrs Collins waits until she is killed by another German who walks into the shop moments afterwards. The girl at the exchange then picks up the phone, getting no reply. The civilians attempt to escape to warn the local Home Guard, but are betrayed by the village squire, who is revealed to be collaborating with the Germans. Members of the local Home Guard are ambushed and shot by the Germans. They begin to bow in until a young boy, George, succeeds in escaping; despite being shot in the leg, he alerts the army. British soldiers arrive, and â aided by some of the villagers, including a group of Women's Land Army girls, who have managed to escape, barricade themselves in, and arm...

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which girl had a deformation of her red blood cells?  Hint: Some individuals have a specific mutation in the primary sequence of their hemoglobin molecules that causes them to aggregate, resulting in a deformation of their red blood cells.

Food stamp program paid out 2.4 billion is shouldn't have between October 2013 and August 2014. National School Lunch Program doled out 1.7 billion extra. National School Breakfast Program spent 923 million unnecessarily – accounting for more than one-quarter of its expenses. The popular Women, Infants and Children nutrition assistance program also misspent 206 million.","output":"Title: The Issue of Misspent Government Funds in Nutrition Assistance Programs Introduction Nutrition assistance programs play a crucial role in alleviating food insecurity, poverty and malnutrition across the United States. However, in recent years, there have been increasing concerns about the effective utilization of public resources dedicated to these programs. Critics argue that the government's poor oversight and management practices have resulted in considerable wastage of taxpayers' money, undermining the effectiveness and sustainability of these essential public services. This article examines the scale and nature of this problem, focusing on four major federal initiatives – the Food Stamp Program, the National School Lunch Program, the National School Breakfast Program, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) nutrition assistance program. Food Stamp Program Between October 2013 and August 2014, the Food Stamp Program - now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - misspent a staggering 2.4 billion. This raises serious questions about the efficiency, accountability, and appropriateness of resource allocation in this vital initiative designed to enhance access to healthy food for millions of low-income families. National School Lunch Program The National School Lunch Program (NSLP), another major government effort to combat hunger, also exhibited questionable financial practices. In the same period, an extra 1.7 billion was doled out by the program. This level of over expenditure is concerning, especially considering the program's fundamental objective of providing nutritious, affordable meals to school-going children from disadvantaged backgrounds. National School Breakfast Program The National School Breakfast Program (NSBP) has shown comparable financial mismanagement and inefficiencies. The program spent an unnecessary 923 million during the specified timeframe, accounting for more than one-quarter of its expenses. As a program aimed at promoting healthy eating habits among children during their early years, it is disheartening to see such a significant amount of resources being wasted. Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Assistance Program Lastly, the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which targets low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women, as well as infants and children up to the age of five, misspent an additional 206 million. Like the other programs mentioned, WIC was established with the noble intention of improving the nutritional and health status of vulnerable groups in society. However, the improper distribution of resources threatens to derail its progress and compromise its overall effectiveness. Conclusion As one Republican congressional aide lamented, \\"They could triple the national debt on these programs, and it would still be impossible to challenge them,\\" highlighting the magnitude of the problem faced by these nutrition assistance programs. The misspent funds are not only a burden on taxpayers but also an impediment to delivering vital services to individuals and families who depend on them to maintain their health and well-being. Addressing the issue of financial mismanagement and waste in these initiatives should be a top priority for policymakers and administrators. This calls for rigorous evaluations, appropriate oversight, and transparent budgeting processes to ensure that public resources are allocated efficiently and effectively. The success and sustainability of these programs depend on our ability to eradicate financial inefficiencies and direct every dollar toward the betterment of those in need."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter.

Samuel Cook (January 22, 1931 - December 11, 1964), known professionally as Sam Cooke, was an American singer, songwriter, and entrepreneur. Influential as both a singer and composer, he is commonly known as the King of Soul for his distinctive vocals and importance within popular music. He began singing as a child and joined The Soul Stirrers before moving to a solo career where he scored a string of hit songs like \\"You Send Me\\", \\"Wonderful World\\", \\"Chain Gang\\", and \\"Twistin' the Night Away\\". Cooke was born Samuel Cook in Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 1931. In 1957 he added an \\"e\\" at the end of his name to signify a new start to his life. He was the fifth of eight children of the Rev. Charles Cook, a minister in the Church of Christ (Holiness), and his wife, Annie Mae. One of his younger brothers, L.C. (1932-2017), later became a member of the doo-wop band Johnny Keyes and the Magnificents.  The family moved to Chicago in 1933. Cooke attended Doolittle Elementary and Wendell Phillips Academy High School in Chicago, the same school that Nat \\"King\\" Cole had attended a few years earlier. Sam Cooke began his career with his siblings in a group called the Singing Children when he was six years old. He first became known as lead singer with the Highway QC's when he was a teenager, having joined the group at the age of 14. During this time, Cooke befriended fellow gospel singer and neighbor Lou Rawls, who sang in a rival gospel group.  In 1950, Cooke replaced gospel tenor R. H. Harris as lead singer of the gospel group the Soul Stirrers, founded by Harris, who had signed with Specialty Records on behalf of the group. Their first recording under Cooke's leadership was the song \\"Jesus Gave Me Water\\" in 1951. They also recorded the gospel songs \\"Peace in the Valley\\", \\"How Far Am I from Canaan?\\", \\"Jesus Paid the Debt\\" and \\"One More River\\", among many others, some of which he wrote. Cooke was often credited for bringing gospel music to the attention of a younger crowd of listeners, mainly girls who would rush to the stage when the Soul Stirrers hit the stage just to get a glimpse of Cooke. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How did he get his career started?","output":"Sam Cooke got his career started by singing as a child and initially joining a group called the Singing Children when he was six years old.

If a girl likes you, there's a good chance that she'll seem attentive and focused while you're talking in class, or if the two of you are in the same group conversation. Be nice and friendly, and also pay attention when she talks.","output":"Step 1: Observe her body language and facial expressions. Pay attention to the girl's body language and facial expressions while you are speaking. If she leans in towards you, maintains eye contact, and smiles frequently, these can be signs that she is interested in what you have to say. She may also react positively with a nod or laugh when you say something amusing. Step 2: Notice if she initiates conversations or tries to spend time with you. Girls who like you may try to engage in conversation with you more often than others. If she frequently starts conversations with you, asks for your opinion, or tries to spend time with you during breaks or after school, these can be signs that she is interested in you. Step 3: Observe how she interacts with others. To make sure that her attention to you is not just friendly behavior, compare her interactions with you to her interactions with others. If she appears to give you more attention or seems more enthusiastic when talking to you compared to others, it can be a sign that she likes you. Step 4: Look for any signs of flirting. Girls may flirt with someone they like by teasing them, engaging in playful banter, or making subtle physical contact. They may also give compliments or make subtle attempts to show their interest. Step 5: Ask for a friend's opinion. Sometimes it can be helpful to consult a friend that who knows the both of you to give their insight on whether they believe the girl likes you. A third-party perspective can help to provide additional information and context. Step 6: Get to know her better. If you suspect that she may like you, spend more time getting to know her on a personal level. Discover her interests, hobbies, and values to find common ground and build a stronger connection. This will also help you gauge her interest in you. Step 7: Observe if her behavior changes over time. If her attention towards you remains consistent or even increases over time, it is more likely that she likes you. Conclusion: If you notice multiple signs mentioned above that she is paying more attention to you and exhibiting signs of interest, then there is a good chance that the girl likes you in school.

Look for dress shirts and tops made of breathable fabrics. Go for clothing that is easy to wash and clean. Avoid low cut or skin-revealing clothing. Go for close-toed shoes with good support.","output":"Title: Building A Professional Wardrobe for School: Dressing Appropriately and Comfortably Introduction: Creating a professional wardrobe for school doesn't have to be a daunting task. With a bit of research and some smart decisions, you can achieve a trendy and comfortable look that adheres to your school's dress code. This article will guide you through the essential steps and offer advice for building an efficient wardrobe that proves both stylish and appropriate. Step 1: Discover Your School's Dress Code Before you start shopping, it's important to understand the specific dress code set by your school. Find out if there are any restrictions or specific requirements that you need to adhere to. This information can usually be found in the school handbook, on the school's website, or by asking a guidance counselor or teacher. Step 2: Invest in Staple Items Once you know the guidelines, focus on building your wardrobe around a few staple items. A pair of comfortable dress pants and a versatile blazer are essential for any professional wardrobe. These can be mixed and matched with a variety of tops to create different looks that are appropriate for school. Step 3: Choose Breathable Fabrics As you'll be wearing these clothes for extended periods, it's crucial to opt for breathable and comfortable fabrics. Look for dress shirts and tops made from materials like cotton, linen, or moisture-wicking synthetic blends. These fabrics will help to keep you cool and dry throughout the day. Step 4: Easy Washing and Cleaning Select clothing that is simple to wash and maintain, as you'll need to keep your professional wardrobe in tip-top condition. Avoid items that require dry cleaning or special care, and instead, go for machine-washable and wrinkle-resistant options. Step 5: Abide by Modesty Guidelines While you may see many fashionable and trendy clothing options available, it's critical to keep your school's dress code in mind. Avoid any low cut, skin-revealing, or provocative clothing. Stick to conservative and modest options, as they will ensure that you adhere to the dress code and project a professional image. Step 6: Opt for Supportive Shoes Footwear is often overlooked, but it plays a significant role in your overall comfort and professional appearance. Opt for close-toed shoes with good support, such as loafers, flats, or Oxfords. Avoid high heels, as they can be uncomfortable and cause health issues in the long run.
