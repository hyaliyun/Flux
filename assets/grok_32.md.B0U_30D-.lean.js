Sentence: Taking Off, directed by Miloš Forman is a comedy that explores themes of youth culture.","output":"The sentence \\"Taking Off, directed by Miloš Forman is a comedy that explores themes of youth culture.\\" is accurate in its description of the film's genre, subject matter, and director. This statement is true based on the provided information in the text. Taking Off, released in 1971, is an American comedy film directed by Czech director Miloš Forman. The movie represents Forman's first foray into filmmaking in the United States, showcasing his unique perspective in the new context of an American suburb. The central storyline revolves around an average couple residing in the suburbs of New York City, who face the challenge of their teenage daughter running away from home. As the couple attempts to reunite their family, they come into contact with other parents who have also experienced the disappearance of their children. This collective journey leads the characters to engage with and explore elements of youth culture which may have been unfamiliar to them in their previous lives. Consequently, the movie uses comedy, both in the form of situational humor and witty dialogue, to subtly touch upon various themes related to the experiences, attitudes, and behaviors of the younger generation. Given this context, it is evident that Taking Off is a comedy directed by Miloš Forman, which not only offers entertainment but also delves into the subject of youth culture, leading to a richer understanding of the complex relationship between parents and their teenage children.

For example, there's a party of about 30 people and they're all terrified of one person despite them being at a secret location and are all healthy looking young adults and the guy threatening them sounds haggard.

A strong downward strike with an ax on a corpse should lodge itself into something... seemed like the guy was swinging a bat instead of an ax.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who accidentally puts the diaper on while the baby crawls off? ?  Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly. Tom and Jerry catch up with the baby, only to lose it again, and fearing that it has crawled into a cement mixer on the 30th floor, the two dive straight in, only to find that the baby never did enter the mixer but instead playing with a hammer. The baby then playfully bonks Tom on the head. A:","output":"Tom accidentally puts the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off.

Throughout their history, the Liberals have been in electoral terms largely the party of the middle class (whom Menzies, in the era of the party's formation called \\"The forgotten people\\"), though such class-based voting patterns are no longer as clear as they once were. In the 1970s a left-wing middle class emerged that no longer voted Liberal.[citation needed] One effect of this was the success of a breakaway party, the Australian Democrats, founded in 1977 by former Liberal minister Don Chipp and members of minor liberal parties; other members of the left-leaning section of the middle-class became Labor supporters.[citation needed] On the other hand, the Liberals have done increasingly well in recent years among socially conservative working-class voters.[citation needed]However the Liberal Party's key support base remains the upper-middle classes; 16 of the 20 richest federal electorates are held by the Liberals, most of which are safe seats.

Premise: \\"The French Revolution in 1789 sent ripples of discontent through the Caribbean.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Discontent was unheard of in the Caribbean in the 18th century.\\"?","output":"First of all, to analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's break down the premise and hypothesis into their components: Premise: \\"The French Revolution in 1789 sent ripples of discontent through the Caribbean.\\" - Component 1: The French Revolution occurred in 1789. - Component 2: The French Revolution caused discontent in the Caribbean. Hypothesis: \\"Discontent was unheard of in the Caribbean in the 18th century.\\" - This statement suggests that there was no discontent present in the Caribbean throughout the entire 18th century. Next, let's compare the hypothesis against the components of the premise: 1. Considering Component 1 (The French Revolution occurred in 1789): - The French Revolution is a historical event that was part of the 18th century. - Therefore, the French Revolution has a potential effect in the context of the 18th century in this case. 2. Considering Component 2 (The French Revolution caused discontent in the Caribbean): - This shows that the French Revolution led to discontent in the Caribbean during the 18th century, specifically in 1789. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis: - The hypothesis suggests that discontent was not present in the Caribbean during the 18th century. - The premise, however, shows that the French Revolution in 1789 caused discontent in the Caribbean. In conclusion, the premise and the hypothesis contradict each other. The premise indicates that discontent indeed occurred in the Caribbean during the 18th century, at least due to the French Revolution, while the hypothesis asserts that discontent was unheard of during the same period. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Instead, it refutes it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II.

The Roman Caius Tiddlus is sent along with them to guide them and check they complete each task.The Twelve Tasks:1.\\tRun faster than Asbestos, champion of the Olympic Games. Asterix, helped by the magic potion, follows Asbestos until he runs so fast he becomes a rocket and exceeds the speed of sound, before hitting an apple tree. His nose swells up like a balloon and Obelix comments on how Gaulish it looks.2.\\tThrow a javelin farther than Verses, the Persian. Verses' javelin hits North America (still only inhabited by Indians, including another Goscinny-Uderzo character, Oumpah-pah), but Obelix's javelin somehow enters a stable orbit and ends up pursuing Verses into the distance. As far as anyone can tell, he's still running from it.3.\\tBeat Cilindric, the German. Cilindric turns out to be an unexpectedly diminutive man wearing a Judo gi but he quickly beats Obelix with a \\"fighting technique he learnt in a distant land\\". Asterix defeats Cilindric by tricking him into giving a lesson and asking for demonstrations that eventually end up with Cilindric's own arms and legs tied in knots.4.\\tCross a lake. The problem being that in the middle of the lake is the \\"Isle of Pleasure\\", a paradise inhabited by beautiful Sirens. Both Asterix and Obelix are enchanted and drawn to the island, but Obelix comes to his senses quickly after discovering that there are no wild boars on the island, has an incandescent argument with the Sirens, and storms off declaring that they can't call it the Isle of Pleasure if they don't serve wild boars, calling Asterix to follow...","output":"Asterix ties Cilindric's arms and legs in knots by tricking him into giving a lesson and asking for demonstrations that eventually end up with Cilindric's own arms and legs tied in knots."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Confronting the victim's sister Gail (Sarah Buxton), he proclaims his innocence and vows to return before being he is killed via electric chair. A year passes and Spring Break has come to Miami. Two football players, Skip (Nicolas de Toth) and Ronny (Rawley Valverde) are amongst the partygoers for the week-long festivities. While Spring Break is occurring, a mysterious biker appears and begins to dispatch people. The back of his bike has a lever that when pulled (combined with a button pushed by the biker) causes the victim to undergo a treatment similar to the electric chair. When Ronny ends up a victim of the mysterious killer, Skip attempts to find Ronny with the help of Gail, who works as a bartender during Spring Break. The duo soon find Ronny and learn that local police chief Strycher (John Saxon) and physician Doc Willet (Michael Parks) have covered up Ronny's death in order for the partygoers not to worry. However, as the body count rises, Gail and Skip begin to wonder if Diablo made good on his promise to return from the dead or is someone else responsible. A confrontation at a local tire yard between Gail and the biker reveals that the killer is Reverend Bates (Lance Le Gault), who thinks Spring Break is nothing more than an excuse for sins. Considering himself a \\"guardian angel\\", he feels all sinners must die like Diablo, \\"death by electrocution\\". Bates also confesses to being the real killer of Gail's sister. Skip arrives in time and fights off Bates. As the duo run, Bates hops on his bike and goes after them only to trip his bike on a stray tire. Bates goes off the bike onto an electric field and like those he murdered and Diablo, dies by electrocution. The next day, Skip and Gail decide to leave Florida and head to Ohio, where Skip hails from. My question: Who is the leader of the Demons motorcycle gang?

Ge Garden is very beautiful and peaceful. The ticket has a map on the back of it that I didn't noticed until I had already left. But to be honest, I don't think that map is very useful because it isn't very clear an tailed. In my opinion, it's better to improve it. Compared with He Garden, the map on the back of the ticket for He Garden is much clearer, more detailed and more useful. However, in the room that has the picture of the family members, there is only Chinese, no English, so my advice is to add English in interesting places. I got lost in the Slender West Lake. I spent about 30 minutes just trying to get out of one area. I think they need more signs posted along the trails. I like the Slender West Lake best, as she is so pretty! The ladies that were sweeping were very sweet. They always smiled at me and said hello, so it was nice. Taking a taxi is the most efficient  and quickest way to get around Yangzhou. I didn't have a problem getting to the places which I'd like to go to while using a taxi. The driver was very friendly. The fare isn't too high, either. But I didn't enjoy taking the bus. The bus ride to the Mastixia Bay   took long although I only had to pay one yuan. It was also hard finding where Bus 32 was. I tried asking some people in English but they couldn't understand me, so I had to ask in simple Chinese that I only know buy that still didn't work. I spent about one hour walking around the city to look for Bus 32. The tricycle  was nice, but it was a little too expensive for a small distance. Maybe I was _ by the guy who rode for me, but it was an enjoyable ride. I felt like I was part of the garden city more. Over all I am satisfied with Yangzhou and will recommend it to others.

For Elena, the smell brought back unsettling flashbacks of a time when she was trapped in a small, dimly lit room during a traumatic event, the pungent aroma of that soap lingering in the air. Laura, on the other hand, had her own haunting recollections associated with the soap, as it reminded her of a deeply upsetting aftermath from a past relationship that had emotionally drained her. The mere whiff of the soap was enough to throw them both into a spiral of unwanted memories, its aroma penetrating their minds and dragging them back to those dark moments that they desperately wished to forget. Despite the passage of time, both Elena and Laura could not shake the emotional impact the soap's scent had on them, and they dreaded the inevitable rush of painful feelings that would surface whenever they encountered it. It was a testament to the power of scent association and how certain fragrances could evoke such a strong emotional response, leaving them both struggling to overcome the shadow cast by their past experiences. But as this soap continued to haunt them, Elena and Laura also drew strength from each other's shared suffering, united by their shared torment and determined to overcome the grip that this seemingly innocuous object held on their lives.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The spore lands on a piece of bread - The spore grows hyphae into the bread - The mold forms a colony - Sporangiophores grow upward - The mold sends out spores. Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the process is: Spore production and dispersal by the parent mold colony. In order to provide a detailed and long answer, here's the complete explanation of the mold growth process, including the missing step: 1. Spore production and dispersal by the parent mold colony: Mold reproduces by releasing tiny, lightweight spores into the air. These spores are the mold's way of reproducing and can travel through the air, water, or even hitch a ride on animals and insects. The parent mold colony produces millions of these spores in the hopes that they will find a suitable environment to start a new colony. 2. The spore lands on a piece of bread: Once the spores are released into the environment, their goal is to find a suitable surface to land on. In this case, the spore lands on a piece of bread, which provides it with a food source and a place to grow. Bread is an ideal environment for mold growth because it contains moisture, nutrients, and a porous surface that allows the mold to easily penetrate the structure of the bread. 3. The spore grows hyphae into the bread: After landing on the bread, the spore begins germinating by growing thin, root-like structures called hyphae. These hyphae are responsible for absorbing nutrients, allowing the mold to grow and reproduce. The hyphae penetrate the bread, consuming the nutrients and moisture they find within the porous structure, acting as the primary absorption and anchor mechanism of the mold. 4. The mold forms a colony: As the mold absorbs nutrients and moisture from the bread, it forms a visible colony on the surface. This colony consists of millions of individual mold cells, which can appear in different colors depending on the species of mold. Mold can grow quickly and, in some cases, can become visible within 24-48 hours of initial spore germination. 5. Sporangiophores grow upward: The next step in the mold growth process is the formation of sporangiophores. These are specialized, aerial hyphae that extend above the main body of the mold colony. Their role is to support and protect the reproductive spores, helping them develop and ultimately be released into the environment. 6. The mold sends out spores: At the end of the sporangiophores are structures called sporangia that contain the newly produced spores. When conditions are right, the sporangia open or rupture, releasing the spores into the environment. These spores then disperse and look for a suitable environment to land on, germinate, and start the entire mold growth process again. In summary, the missing first step of the process is the spore production and dispersal by the parent mold colony. This step is essential for ensuring the continuity of mold growth and reproduction, as well as for maintaining genetic diversity within mold populations."},{"instruction":"Here's a question: What has happened to a person's money after he or she has used the last of it?

In other words, some performances might be better than others, either within an individual cast member's performance or across different cast members. This implies that the overall quality of the production may be affected by these variations. The use of the word \\"uneven\\" is a negative evaluation of the performances. 2. \\"Bound and determined\\": This phrase implies that the cast members are making a deliberate effort to duplicate Bela Lugosi's vampire accent. The use of the words \\"bound\\" and \\"determined\\" suggests a conscious and perhaps unyielding attempt to imitate this particular accent. This conveys a negative sentiment because it implies that the cast members are not bringing originality or their own flair to the characters, but rather mimicking something that has already been done before. 3. \\"Now-clichéd vampire accent\\": Mentioning that the accent has become cliché implies that the imitation of Bela Lugosi's accent is overused and no longer unique or interesting. A cliché is something that has become trite or commonplace, often through repeated exposure or use. Since the writer refers to the accent as \\"now-clichéd,\\" this denotes that it was once considered original but has since lost its novelty. The fact that the cast members are replicating such a clichéd accent instead of attempting something more fresh and distinctive adds to the overall negative sentiment of the sentence. In summary, the sentence conveys a negative sentiment through the three main points of criticism: the uneven performances, the cast members' determination to duplicate a specific accent, and the fact that this accent has become cliché. These elements together create a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction with the performances described."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review provided appears to be negative in nature, as it highlights the dissatisfaction of the user with the product they have purchased. There are several aspects presented in the review which emphasize the negative sentiment: 1. The issue with compatibility: The reviewer states that the male end of the extension cable does not fit into their NES, and the female end is unable to accept the NES controller. Since the primary purpose of an extension cable for NES is to extend the reach of the existing controller and enable seamless gameplay, the reviewer's experience indicates that the product fails to fulfill its core function. 2. The uncertainty about product specifications: The reviewer seems uncertain about the length of the cable, as they question if it is indeed 7 feet long. They also mention that they do not care about this aspect, showing that it is not the main concern for them. Their primary discontent lies in the product's incompatibility with their NES system. 3. The questioning of the product's existence: Finally, the reviewer expresses frustration by questioning why the \\"extension cable\\" exists, implying that it serves no useful purpose for them and does not meet their needs as a customer. They are clearly dissatisfied with the product, which is evident from their rhetorical question. In conclusion, based on the issues mentioned in the review, the sentiment expressed by the customer is negative. They are unhappy with the product's failure to serve its intended purpose, inability to fit their NES system, and seemingly serve no apparent use for them.

In July 2014 I made a reservation for a January 2015 Friday-Monday weekend stay at the Downtown Grand Las Vegas.  In January 2014 during my annual buddy-trip to Vegas I had seen the hotel and liked it very much, deciding I would stay there for future trips.    Unfortunately I just found out that a work meeting is requiring me to be in Europe on Monday of this years' trip, meaning I have to cancel my Vegas trip as I have to fly to Europe on Saturday instead in order to make the meeting.  Even more unfortunate, despite 6 WEEKS NOTICE, Choice Hotels/Downtown Grand  refuses to refund the 426.76 I paid back in July for this reservation merely because I received a prepaid discount.  Apparently their business practices don't account for people being forced to change or cancel plans over a 6 month period.  Even worse, I couldn't even change to another weekend or give the room to one of my Vegas trip buddies.  No cancellations, no changes, no transfers. However now that the unmoved reservations people I talked to on the phone know I can't make it, the hotel will pocket my money and sell the room to someone else.  I suggest the Choice Hotels/The Downtown Grand re-evaluate this business practice.  In the meantime, unless they see this review, change their mind, and refund my money (a scenario under which I will be happy to alter this review), they have ensured that they have lost a customer for life.  I will never, EVER, stay at the Downtown Grand or any other Choice Hotel again.   Congratulations on taking my 426.76 and providing nothing in return, in addition to profiting on 5 months' interest on my money from July until now, Mr. or Ms. Downtown Grand hotel manager.

George Galloway (born 16 August 1954) is a British politician, broadcaster, and writer. Between 1987 and 2015, with a gap in 2010-12, he represented four constituencies as a Member of Parliament, elected as a candidate for the Labour Party and later the Respect Party. After becoming the youngest ever Chairman of the Scottish Labour Party in 1981, he became General Secretary of the London-based charity War on Want in 1983, remaining in the post until elected as MP for Glasgow Hillhead (later Glasgow Kelvin) at the 1987 general election. In 2003, Galloway was expelled from the Labour Party, having been found guilty by the party's national constitutional committee of four of the five charges of bringing the party into disrepute, including having called on Arabs to fight British troops. In January 1994, Galloway faced some of his strongest criticism on his return from a Middle Eastern visit during which he had met Saddam Hussein. At his meeting with the Iraqi leader, he reported the support given to Saddam by the people of the Gaza Strip which he had just visited: \\"I can honestly tell you that there was not a single person to whom I told I was coming to Iraq and hoping to meet with yourself who did not wish me to convey their heartfelt, fraternal greetings and support.\\" He ended his speech with the statement \\"Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability.\\" Galloway has asserted that he was saluting the Iraqi people rather than Saddam Hussein in the speech, which was translated for the Iraqi leader.  As news of the incident reached the UK, Labour leader John Smith, in a statement, said: \\"I deeply deplore the foolish statement made in Iraq by Mr. George Galloway. In no way did he speak for the Labour Party and I wholly reject his comments.\\" Shortly after his return, Galloway was given a \\"severe reprimand\\" by the Labour Chief Whip, Derek Foster, for his unauthorised trip to Iraq. The MP apologised for his conduct and undertook to follow future instruction from the whips.  For his visit with Saddam, Galloway was dubbed the \\"MP for Baghdad North\\". Galloway said, when he spoke before the U.S. Senate on 17 May 2005, that he had \\"met Saddam Hussein exactly the same number of times as Donald Rumsfeld met him.\\" Whereas \\"Rumsfeld met him to sell him guns\\", Galloway had \\"met him to try to bring about an end to sanctions, suffering and war.\\" Ask a question about this article.","output":"What was the purpose of George Galloway's meeting with Saddam Hussein, according to his statement made before the U.S. Senate on 17 May 2005?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The \\"everyman\\" protagonist, Dr. Frank Sangster, is a dentist with a fairly pleasant but rather innocuous, ordinary and uneventful life. But all of this gets derailed, and Frank's life descends into an increasingly complex mess, from the minute a beautiful and seductive new patient named Susan Ivey comes to him, seeking a root canal and a little pain relief. On Susan's initial office visit, Frank schedules her for a root canal the very next day, and offers her some Ibuprofen to address her pain in the meanwhile. Claiming that she is allergic to the offered medication, Susan requests a prescription for the addictive pain-killer Demerol. Frank provides the prescription, but only for five tablets. However, Susan changes the dosage from five tablets to fifty when she collects the medication from her pharmacist. Susan arrives for her appointment twelve hours late, having mistaken the time. She seduces Frank, talking him into getting drunk and having sex with her. During the night, Susan steals all of Frank's narcotics. The next day, there is a DEA agent at Frank's office demanding to see the dentist's narcotics supply, because an 18-year-old has driven a car off a cliff under the influence of cocaine hydrochloride from a bottle registered to the dentist. Knowing that Susan has stolen his entire drug supply, Frank puts the agent off, saying he dispensed it all to patients. The agent leaves with the promise that if Frank fails to produce the empty containers in two days, the DEA will place him under arrest.

Q:Given the following context:  Beginning on December 11, 1945, Stafford hosted the Tuesday and Thursday broadcasts of NBC musical variety radio program The Chesterfield Supper Club. On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, participated in the first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the evening—one for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.Stafford moved from New York to California in November 1946, continuing to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances on the show to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested using some of the folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the American Folklore Society, with the first prize of 250 awarded in 1949.  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person that restricted her appearance on the show to only Tuesdays?

The answer to the question: What did Hans Müller think would prevent tragedy befalling he and his family? is inside the article: After World War II, a German named Hans Müller is one of a shipload of Jewish refugees who disembark at Haifa in 1949. Like many other concentration camp survivors, Hans has psychological problems, including survivor guilt. At one point, he mistakes a woman and some children for his murdered family. At the first opportunity, he sneaks out of the refugee camp and goes into the city. When he spots a policeman, Hans panics and reacts by fleeing. The policeman chases him down and begins questioning him. Hans becomes very agitated and attacks, leaving the man unconscious in the street. Hans flees and ends up sleeping in the countryside, where he is found by a teenage orphan Sabra, Yehoshua \\"Josh\\" Bresler. Hans pretends to be an eccentric American, out to see Israel firsthand. Josh offers to be his guide. During their journey, Hans reveals that he was a professional juggler; Josh persuades him to pass on his knowledge. Meanwhile, police detective Karni sets out to track the fugitive down. On their journey, Josh is injured when he wanders into a minefield. He is taken to a hospital at a nearby kibbutz, but has only broken his leg. While Josh recovers, Hans becomes acquainted with one of the residents, Ya'el (Milly Vitale). They are attracted to each other, but he at first strongly resists her attempt to persuade him to remain at the kibbutz. He reveals to her that he had ignored warnings from friends to flee Nazi Germany before it was too late, making the fatal mistake of counting on his fame and popularity to protect his family. Gradually, however, he begins to settle in. Karni finally tracks Hans down and tries to take him into custody. Hans panics again and barricades himself in Ya'el's room with her rifle, but Ya'el and Karni get him to admit he needs help and to give himself up., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"Hans Müller, the German protagonist in the narrative you provided, believed that his fame and popularity would protect his family, preventing tragedy from befalling them. Müller was a professional juggler before World War II, and it seemed that his celebrity status gave him a false sense of security during the Nazi regime's rise in Germany. In retrospect, he recognized this as a fatal mistake because he ignored warnings from friends encouraging him to flee the country while he could. Instead, he stayed, wrongly assuming that his public recognition would shield his family. The fallacy of this belief is tragically located in the aftermath, when Müller survives the concentration camp but his family does not. After this, he carries psychological burdens such as survivor guilt."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"How did athletics guide the formation of debate?\\"  Context: \\"Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates, and 1909, the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Athletics played a significant role in shaping the formation of debate by providing a model for how debates were structured, promoted, and perceived during the early years of intercollegiate debating competitions. Between 1892 and 1909, when intercollegiate debates gained popularity in universities such as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, the language, symbols, and metaphors from athletics were borrowed to frame these early debates. Debates were given a high level of importance, being featured on the front pages of college newspapers and noted in yearbooks. The team members participating in the debates received recognition similar to athletes – they were awarded the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. Debates even adopted the tradition of holding rallies before debating teams headed off to matches. However, despite the similarities between athletics and debates, the latter did not achieve the same widespread appeal as sports. There are several reasons for this: 1. Scoring in debates was subjective, unlike in sports where scoring is more objective and clear winners are determined. Debates often ended with no definitive victory for either side due to the nature of the arguments and the differing perspectives of the judges.   2. During the late 19th century, there was a growing concern about the impact of modern life on the human body, and athletics offered a physical and healthy outlet that helped to counteract these negative influences. As such, athletics held a more important role in society and provided an antidote to the challenges posed by modern life. In conclusion, athletics served as an influential guide for the formation of debate by helping to shape its structure, promotion, and perception in the early years of intercollegiate debates. The language, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics provided a framework for debates, while the recognition and traditions associated with sports helped to elevate the status of debating competitions. However, debates did not attain the same level of popularity as athletics due to the subjectivity of scoring and the specific societal needs that athletics addressed in this period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: The high ionic radius of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass (108.5 vs 106.5 Ohm·cm, DC at 250 °C).  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Pb2+ ions cause lead glass to possess several unique properties, primarily due to their high ionic radius. They include: 1. High refractive index: The incorporation of Pb2+ ions in glass increases its refractive index, which measures the degree to which light is bent as it passes through the material. This results in increased light dispersion and a more brilliant appearance in comparison to soda-lime glass. Lead glass is often used in the making of high-quality optical lenses and fine glassware, such as wine glasses and crystal chandeliers. 2. High density: The presence of Pb2+ ions in lead glass leads to a higher density in comparison to regular glass. This increased density lends the glass a more substantial feel, often desired in luxury items. 3. Improved workability: The high ionic radius of Pb2+ ions lowers the working temperature and increases the viscosity of the glass. This property makes lead glass easier to work with and shape, making it a preferred choice for intricate glass art, sculptures, and detailed designs. 4. High electrical resistance: The immobility of Pb2+ ions in the glass matrix hinders the movement of other ions. This results in high electrical resistance in lead glass, two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass, making it a suitable insulator for specific electronic applications. 5. Increased radiation shielding: Due to its higher density and atomic number, lead glass provides effective shielding against X-rays and gamma radiation, making it an essential material in medical imaging equipment, such as X-ray machines and CT scanners, and nuclear facilities. In summary, Pb2+ ions significantly alter the properties of lead glass, rendering it more suitable for various applications than regular glass, including high-quality optics, fine glassware, intricate glass art, radiation shielding, and more."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating?

Title: The Towering Inferno Movie plot: Architect Doug Roberts returns to San Francisco for the dedication of the Glass Tower, which he designed for owner James Duncan. At 138 stories (1,800Â ft/550Â m), it is the world's tallest building. Shortly after his arrival, an electrical short starts an undetected fire on the 81st floor. While Roberts accuses the building's electrical engineer, Roger Simmons of cutting corners, Simmons insists the building is up to standards. During the dedication ceremony, public relations chief Dan Bigelow is ordered to turn on the tower's exterior lights to impress the guests and dignitaries. The lighting overloads the electrical system and Roberts orders it shut off. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor and the San Francisco Fire Department is summoned. Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to the 81st floor but fail to prevent a security guard opening a door, leading to a fire flash which burns Giddings (and who is later disclosed to have died). Roberts reports the fire to a dismissive Duncan, who refuses to order an evacuation. Ill-equipped firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze, which soon spreads out of control. SFFD Chief Michael O'Halloran forces Duncan to evacuate the guests in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor, directing them to express elevators. A guest, Lisolette Mueller, who is being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne, rushes to the 87th floor to check on a young family. Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to stay under budget. Duncan, aided by Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey, directs the elevator evacuation from the Promenade Room until the fire renders the express elevators unsafe. Not heeding Duncan's directions, one last group takes an elevator to the ground, but are killed when it stops on the fire's floor. The fire also traps Bigelow and his secretary/mistress Lorrie in his 65th floor office, killing them. Security Chief Harry Jernigan and Roberts rescue Mueller and the family from 87.

Please answer this question: What is the inner core of the Earth believed to consist of?","output":"The inner core of the Earth is believed to consist of two primary elements, iron and nickel, along with a small percentage of other elements, such as sulfur, oxygen, and silicon. Located at the heart of our planet, the inner core is estimated to have a radius of approximately 1,216 kilometers (760 miles), making it about 70% the size of Earth's moon.  The existence of the Earth's inner core was proposed back in the early 20th century when seismologist Inge Lehmann discovered that earthquake shockwaves were being refracted when they encountered a solid layer below the outer core. This observation, combined with subsequent seismic data, provided strong evidence for the presence of a solid central core. Currently, it is believed that the Earth's inner core is under conditions of immense pressure and temperature, reaching levels of 3.3 million to over 5 million times atmospheric pressure, or up to 330-360 gigapascals (GPa), and around 5,000 to 7,000 degrees Celsius (9,000-13,000 degrees Fahrenheit). This extreme environment in the inner core prompts the unique material properties and behaviors that are observed. Iron, which is the dominant component, forms a crystalline structure at such elevated temperatures and pressures. This solid iron-nickel alloy remains stable despite the high temperature, because the tremendous pressure at the inner core prevents it from transitioning to a liquid state. This contrasts with the outer core, which is comprised of a swirling, swirling, molten mixture of iron and nickel as the pressure there is lower. To understand why the inner core remains solid, we must inspect the concept of phase diagrams, which illustrate the different states of a substance under varying pressures and temperatures. The phase diagram of iron reveals that, even at the extreme temperatures found in the inner core, iron remains in a solid state under high pressures. Consequently, the extreme Earth's interior keeps the inner core in a close-packed, crystalline structure. Aside from iron and nickel, studies have suggested that other elements, including lighter elements such as sulfur, oxygen, and silicon, are present in smaller amounts within the inner core. This composition can have a significant impact on the physical properties of the core, like its density and the speeds its associated seismic waves. Understanding the precise composition of the Earth's inner core is an ongoing area of scientific investigation that holds critical insight into our planet's formation, history, and geodynamics. In conclusion, the inner core of the Earth is believed to consist predominantly of iron and nickel in a solid state, with the presence of minor amounts of other elements such as sulfur, oxygen, and silicon. The extraordinary pressure and temperature conditions experienced at the inner core enable these metals to maintain a stable, crystalline structure that contributes to the unique geochemical and geophysical properties observed within the heart of our planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What type of fruit is a Duncan","output":"A Duncan is a type of citrus fruit, specifically a cultivar of grapefruit. The scientific name of grapefruit is Citrus × paradisi, and it belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes other citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, and limes. Grapefruits are believed to have originated in the Caribbean, specifically Barbados, as a natural cross between the sweet orange and the pomelo. The Duncan grapefruit cultivar can be traced back to a seed planted by Captain A. T. Duncan of Safety Harbor, Florida, in 1892. This variety stands out for its distinctive characteristics that make it popular among grapefruit enthusiasts. Following are some notable attributes of the Duncan grapefruit: 1. Appearance: The Duncan grapefruit has an oblong to round shape with a moderately smooth, thin, but firm rind. The rind color can vary from pale yellow to deeper yellow, depending on the degree of ripeness. Additionally, the outer layer may present an occasional blush of pink or slight russeting. 2. Pulp: The Duncan grapefruit's pulp is typically light yellow, with some specimens featuring a slight tinge of pink. The pulp is arranged in segments that are enclosed by a relatively thick membrane. This particular attribute renders the Duncan grapefruit less suitable for the fresh fruit market but ideal for juicing and making preserves. 3. Taste: Known for its juicy and flavorful nature, the Duncan grapefruit offers a perfect balance of sweetness and tartness, providing a refreshing and satisfying taste. The flavor has been described as rich, aromatic, and slightly tangy, possessing a depth that differentiates it from other grapefruit cultivars. 4. Seeds: Unlike some other grapefruit varieties, a distinguishing feature of the Duncan grapefruit is its high seed content, containing multiple seeds per fruit segment. This characteristic makes it less favored among those who prefer seedless varieties but does not detract from its delicious flavor. 5. Cultivation: Duncan grapefruits tend to thrive in subtropical climates with temperate winters and warm summers, which is why they flourish in regions such as Florida and Texas in the United States. They require well-drained, fertile soil and plenty of sunlight to produce an abundant harvest. 6. Harvest: The fruit generally matures between November and January. The rind may still exhibit some green hues when ripe, as the color change is affected by climate and temperature. Therefore, growers need to pay close attention to pulp texture and taste to determine the ideal time for harvest. In summary, the Duncan grapefruit is a cultivar known for its rich taste, balanced sweetness and tartness, juicy pulp, and high seed content. Although it may not be as favored in the fresh fruit market due to its seeds and thick membrane, the Duncan grapefruit is an ideal choice for juicing and making preserves. Its distinctive flavor and attributes make it a popular choice among grapefruit lovers, and it continues to be grown and enjoyed around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the case of adding a direct flame to a container of acid, the following steps can be analyzed: 1. Identify the acid: Different acids have different properties and reactivity levels. Some might be more volatile than others when heated, and some might produce hazardous byproducts when subjected to high temperatures. Therefore, identify the specific type of acid in the container to understand its properties. 2. Assess the container: The container holding the acid should also be taken into consideration. Some materials might be resistant to heat and chemical reactions, while others could become unstable, melt, or otherwise allow the acid to escape or mix with other substances. Ensure that the container is heat resistant and safe for use with the specific acid. 3. Safety: When adding heat to an object, especially when dealing with potentially hazardous chemicals like acids, ensure the proper safety precautions are taken. This might include wearing gloves, goggles, and a mask or using heat-resistant tools. 4. Apply heat: Carefully apply the direct flame to the container of acid, ensuring that you maintain an appropriate distance from the flame. Monitor the temperature and reaction closely, as some acids can generate toxic fumes or even explode when heated. 5. Observe the reaction: As heat is added to the acid, observe any changes in its physical properties or chemical makeup. The heat may cause the acid to react with or break down certain compounds within it, or it could create new compounds altogether. This could potentially result in a variety of effects, such as changes in color, the release of gas or vapors, or even an explosion. 6. Record results: Document the results of the experiment, including any changes in the acid's properties, the release of gases or vapors, and any hazards that were observed. This information can be used to refine the process and better understand the consequences of adding heat to different acids. In conclusion, adding a direct flame to a container of acid causes a variety of potential effects, depending on the specific type of acid and the properties of the container. It's crucial to take safety precautions and carefully monitor the reaction as heat is applied, as some acids can be volatile and produce dangerous byproducts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy is on track for a majority, taking about 80% of declared seats. But a quarter of parliamentary seats are allocated to the military, meaning it will remain hugely influential. Last weekend's vote was Myanmar's first openly contested general election for 25 years. The NLD won elections decisively in 1990 - only for the result to be nullified and Ms Suu Kyi placed under long-term house arrest. President Thein Sein and Min Aung Hlaing have congratulated Ms Suu Kyi on her party's performance in the polls, though have not formally conceded defeat. They have agreed to hold talks on national reconciliation with her after the final results are announced. More than 47% of results have been declared so far, and on Thursday morning, the NLD were said to be 38 seats short of a majority. The ruling military-backed Union Solidarity Development Party (USDP) - which won the last, widely criticised election five years ago - has so far gained about 5% of the seats being contested in Myanmar, also known as Burma.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods.

This is considered as directly impacting a step of the process, specifically the step where the seeds sprout. The reason is that the number of seeds that successfully sprout determines the number of plants that will grow and ultimately produce vegetables. If some seeds do not sprout, it leads to a reduction in the total plant count and a corresponding decrease in the amount of vegetables harvested."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Measure the square footage of each room you plan to heat or cool and add them together. If you're installing a furnace or central air conditioning system, this typically includes every room. Can we infer the following? central air conditioning system has a q","output":"To calculate BTUs per square foot, you can follow these steps: 1. Measure the square footage: Measure the length and width of each room you plan to heat or cool, then multiply the length by the width to get the square footage for each room. You can do this for each room and then add the square footage of all the rooms together. Make a note of this total area. 2. Determine the necessary heating or cooling capacity: To determine the necessary heating or cooling capacity for your space, you need to consider the specific conditions of the space, such as the climate, insulation levels, ceiling height, and any major heat-generating appliances. However, for rough estimation, you can use general guidelines based on square footage.  For heating, you typically need 20-30 BTUs per square foot in moderately insulated spaces. For cooling, you typically need 20-25 BTUs per square foot in moderately insulated spaces. 3. Multiply the square footage by the BTUs needed per square foot: Take the total square footage from step 1 and multiply it by the number of BTUs you need per square foot, as determined in step 2. This will give you the total BTUs needed for the entire area.  For example, if you have a 1,500 square foot space and want to determine the necessary BTUs for cooling: 1,500 sq ft * 20-25 BTUs per sq ft = 30,000-37,500 BTUs. To answer the last part of your question, we cannot directly infer that a central air conditioning system has a specific range or predetermined amount of BTUs, without considering the space size and required capacity. Each air conditioning system has a different capacity, which should be matched to the needs of the specific area it serves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Can we infer the following? The Treaty of Berlin effectively haulted the First Silesian War.","output":"Yes, we can infer that the Treaty of Berlin effectively halted the First Silesian War. The treaty was signed on 28th July 1742 in Berlin between Habsburg Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, who was also the Queen of Bohemia, and Prussian King Frederick the Great. This formal peace treaty built upon the preliminary agreement reached through English mediation in the Treaty of Breslau on 11th June 1742. To fully understand the context and significance of the Treaty of Berlin, it is essential to consider the historical background and the consequences of the agreement. The First Silesian War was part of the larger War of the Austrian Succession, which started in 1740. When Emperor Charles VI died without a male heir, several European powers, including Prussia, disputed Maria Theresa's right to inherit the Habsburg lands. King Frederick the Great seized this opportunity to invade the wealthy and strategically crucial province of Silesia in December of 1740. Maria Theresa was caught off-guard by Prussia's invasion, and her forces initially suffered significant setbacks. However, the Austrian forces gradually regained their footing and managed to push back against the Prussian advances. With both powers embroiled in a costly and drawn-out struggle, they turned to diplomacy as a viable means to end the conflict. Through English mediation, the Treaty of Breslau was agreed upon, paving the way for the Treaty of Berlin to formally end the First Silesian War. The Treaty of Berlin had several important provisions. The most crucial of these was the concession made by Maria Theresa, recognizing Prussian sovereignty over most of Silesia. In return, Frederick the Great agreed to provide military support to Maria Theresa's husband, Francis Stephen, in his bid for the imperial title as the Holy Roman Emperor. This treaty solidified the peace between Austria and Prussia temporarily, allowing both sides to focus on their other military campaigns involved in the larger War of the Austrian Succession. Although the Treaty of Berlin had indeed put an end to the First Silesian War, the peace that it established did not last long. The uneasy truce between Austria and Prussia came undone in 1744 when Frederick the Great seized the opportunity presented by the war against France to launch a surprise attack on Maria Theresa's Austria, igniting the Second Silesian War. To summarize, we can infer that the Treaty of Berlin effectively halted the First Silesian War, with both Austria and Prussia agreeing to end their conflict over Silesia. However, this peace was short-lived, as fresh hostilities resumed with the Second Silesian War in 1744."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Marjorie Jacqueline \\"Marge\\" Simpson (nee Bouvier) is a fictional character in the American animated sitcom The Simpsons and part of the eponymous family. She is voiced by Julie Kavner and first appeared on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" on April 19, 1987. Marge was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Context: Matt Groening first conceived Marge and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family. Marge was named after Groening's mother Margaret \\"Marge\\" Groening, who has said she bears little similarity to the character, stating, \\"It's really weird to have people think you're a cartoon.\\" Marge's beehive hairstyle was inspired by the titular Bride in Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue.  Marge debuted with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series airing on the Fox Network. Marge and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show.  Matt Groening believes that episodes featuring Marge are among the most difficult episodes to write. Bill Oakley believes that the \\"junior\\" writers are usually given Marge episodes because he and writing partner Josh Weinstein were given several to write during their first season. During the third season of the show, most of the writers focused on Bart and Homer, so David M. Stern decided to write a Marge episode, which became \\"Homer Alone\\" (season three, 1992). He felt that they could achieve a \\"deeper vein\\" of comedy in an episode where Marge has a nervous breakdown, and James L. Brooks quickly approved. Question: What was his process in creating her? Answer:","output":"The process of Matt Groening creating Marge Simpson started when he was called to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show in 1986. Initially, Groening had planned to adapt his comic strip, Life in Hell, but upon realizing that he would have to give up the publication rights, decided to go with a different concept. 1. Conceiving the idea of a dysfunctional family: Groening decided to create an animated dysfunctional family, which later became the Simpsons. This idea came to him in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office, where he hurriedly sketched the first versions of the characters. 2. Naming and drawing inspirations from his own family: Groening drew inspirations for the names and characteristics of the characters from his own family members. Marge Simpson was named after his own mother, Margaret \\"Marge\\" Groening. However, his mother stated that she bears little similarity to the character. 3. Designing Marge's iconic appearance: The most notable feature of Marge's design is her high beehive hairstyle. Groening took inspiration from the Bride of Frankenstein for this hairstyle, which was also a popular look that his mother adorned during the 1960s. He added his unique twist to the design by coloring her hair blue. 4. Character development: Marge made her first appearance on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" on April 19, 1987. As the series evolved into its own half-hour show, The Simpsons, in 1989, Marge's character was further developed alongside the rest of the Simpson family as the main characters. 5. Writing challenges: Matt Groening has admitted that episodes featuring Marge are among the hardest to write. Writers often struggle to capture her nuances and depth as a character, leading to the assignment of Marge-centric episodes to \\"junior\\" writers, as Bill Oakley has mentioned. This ultimately created opportunities for these writers to explore deeper veins of comedy as seen in the episode \\"Homer Alone\\" (1992), where Marge experiences a nervous breakdown. In conclusion, the process of creating Marge Simpson involved Matt Groening's spur-of-the-moment decision to sketch an animated family, drawing inspirations from his own family for character names and traits, designing an iconic appearance for Marge, and further developing her character in the series for added depth and nuance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

He was editor of Astounding Science Fiction (later called Analog Science Fiction and Fact) from late 1937 until his death and was part of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Campbell wrote super-science space opera under his own name and stories under his primary pseudonym, Don A. Stuart. Campbell also used the pen names Karl Van Kampen and Arthur McCann. Editor T. O'Conor Sloane lost Campbell's first manuscript that he accepted for Amazing Stories, entitled \\"Invaders of the Infinite\\". \\"When the Atoms Failed\\" appeared in January 1930, followed by five more during 1930. Three were part of a space opera series featuring the characters Arcot, Morey, and Wade,. A complete novel in the series, \\"Islands of Space\\", was the cover story in the Spring 1931 Quarterly. During 1934-35 a serial novel, The Mightiest Machine, ran in Astounding Stories, edited by F. Orlin Tremaine, and several stories featuring lead characters Penton and Blake appeared from late 1936 in Thrilling Wonder Stories, edited by Mort Weisinger.  The early work for Amazing established Campbell's reputation as a writer of space adventure. When in 1934 he began to publish stories with a different tone he wrote as Don A. Stuart, a pseudonym derived from his wife's maiden name.  From 1930 until the later part of that decade, Campbell was prolific and successful under both names. Three significant stories published under the pseudonym are \\"Twilight\\" (Astounding, November 1934), \\"Night\\" (Astounding, October 1935), and \\"Who Goes There?\\" (Astounding, August 1938). \\"Who Goes There?\\", about a group of Antarctic researchers who discover a crashed alien vessel, formerly inhabited by a malevolent shape-changing occupant, was published in Astounding almost a year after Campbell became its editor and it was his last significant piece of fiction, at age 28. It was filmed as The Thing from Another World (1951), The Thing (1982), and again as The Thing (2011).  Campbell held the amateur radio call sign W2ZGU, and wrote many articles on electronics and radio for a wide range of magazines.  The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction wrote: \\"More than any other individual, he helped to shape modern sf.\\" After 1950, new magazines such as Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction moved in different directions and developed talented new writers who were not directly influenced by him. Campbell often suggested story ideas to writers (including \\"Write me a creature that thinks as well as a man, or better than a man, but not like a man\\"), and sometimes asked for stories to match cover paintings he had already bought.  Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and eventually became a friend. Asimov said of Campbell's influence on the field: \\"By his own example and by his instruction and by his undeviating and persisting insistence, he forced first Astounding and then all science fiction into his mold. He abandoned the earlier orientation of the field. He demolished the stock characters who had filled it; eradicated the penny dreadful plots; extirpated the Sunday-supplement science. In a phrase, he blotted out the purple of pulp. Instead, he demanded that science-fiction writers understand science and understand people, a hard requirement that many of the established writers of the 1930s could not meet. Campbell did not compromise because of that: those who could not meet his requirements could not sell to him, and the carnage was as great as it had been in Hollywood a decade before, while silent movies had given way to the talkies.\\"  One example of the type of speculative but plausible science fiction that Campbell demanded from his writers is \\"Deadline\\", a short story by Cleve Cartmill that appeared during the wartime year of 1944, a year before the detonation of the first atomic bomb. As Ben Bova, Campbell's successor as editor at Analog, wrote, it \\"described the basic facts of how to build an atomic bomb. Cartmill and Campbell worked together on the story, drawing their scientific information from papers published in the technical journals before the war. To them, the mechanics of constructing a uranium-fission bomb seemed perfectly obvious.\\" The FBI descended on Campbell's office after the story appeared in print and demanded that the issue be removed from the newsstands. Campbell convinced them that by removing the magazine \\"the FBI would be advertising to everyone that such a project existed and was aimed at developing nuclear weapons\\" and the demand was dropped.  Campbell was also responsible for the grim and controversial ending of Tom Godwin's short story \\"The Cold Equations\\". Writer Joe Green recounted that Campbell had \\"three times sent 'Cold Equations' back to Godwin, before he got the version he wanted ... Godwin kept coming up with ingenious ways to save the girl! Since the strength of this deservedly classic story lies in the fact that the life of one young woman must be sacrificed to save the lives of many, it simply would not have the same impact if she had lived.\\"  Green wrote that Campbell \\"enjoyed taking the 'devil's advocate' position in almost any area, willing to defend even viewpoints with which he disagreed if that led to a livelier debate.\\" As an example, he wrote, Campbell \\"pointed out that the much-maligned 'peculiar institution' of slavery in the American South had in fact provided the blacks brought there with a higher standard of living than they had in Africa ... I suspected, from comments by Asimov, among others - and some Analog editorials I had read - that John held some racist views, at least in regard to blacks.\\" Finally, however, Green agreed with Campbell that \\"rapidly increasing mechanization after 1850 would have soon rendered slavery obsolete anyhow. It would have been better for the USA to endure it a few more years than suffer the truly horrendous costs of the Civil War.\\"  In a June 1961 editorial called \\"Civil War Centennial,\\" Campbell argued that slavery had been a dominant form of human relationships for most of history and that the present was unusual in that anti-slavery cultures dominated the planet. He wrote, \\"It's my bet that the South would have been integrated by 1910. The job would have been done - and done right - half a century sooner, with vastly less human misery, and with almost no bloodshed ... The only way slavery has ever been ended, anywhere, is by introducing industry ... If a man is a skilled and competent machinist - if the lathes work well under his hands - the industrial management will be forced, to remain in business, to accept that fact, whether the man be black, white, purple, or polka-dotted.\\"  According to Michael Moorcock, \\"He also, when faced with the Watts riots of the mid-sixties, seriously proposed and went on to proposing that there were 'natural' slaves who were unhappy if freed. I sat on a panel with him in 1965, as he pointed out that the worker bee when unable to work dies of misery, that the moujiks when freed went to their masters and begged to be enslaved again, that the ideals of the anti-slavers who fought in the Civil War were merely expressions of self-interest and that the blacks were 'against' emancipation, which was fundamentally why they were indulging in 'leaderless' riots in the suburbs of Los Angeles.\\"  On February 10, 1967, Campbell rejected Samuel R. Delaney's Nova a month before it was ultimately published, with a note and phone call to his agent explaining that he didn't feel his readership \\"would be able to relate to a black main character\\". There reputedly exists a letter from him to horror writer Dean Koontz in which Campbell argues that a technologically advanced black civilization would be a social and a biological impossibility. Did he become an activist for Slavery?","output":"There is no concrete evidence to suggest that John W. Campbell Jr. became an activist for slavery. While he expressed certain controversial views on race and slavery in his editorials and conversations, it is important to note that he often played the role of a 'devil's advocate' as a way to engage in lively debates. Many of his views discussed the historical context of slavery and its potential end through industrialization, rather than advocating for its continuation or revival.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. was born on September 27, 1982, and grew up in the impoverished Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was 2, and his father permanently abandoned the family. Although Wayne and Birdman have a father-son relationship and Birdman calls Carter his son, Wayne's biological father and namesake (Dwayne Carter) is still alive. Context: Carter's debut solo album Tha Block Is Hot was released when he was 17 and featured significant contributions from the Hot Boys. It debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and was later certified platinum by the RIAA. The album earned Carter a 1999 Source magazine nomination for \\"Best New Artist\\", and also became a Top Ten hit. The lead single was \\"Tha Block Is Hot\\". After the release of Tha Block is Hot, Carter was featured on the single \\"Bling Bling\\", with B.G., Juvenile, and Big Tymers. His verse appeared only on the radio version of the song, while on the album version he performed on the chorus.  His 2000 follow-up album Lights Out failed to attain the level of success achieved by his debut but was certified gold by RIAA. Critics noted the lack of coherent narratives in his verses as evidence that he had yet to mature to the level of his fellow Hot Boys. The lead single was \\"Get Off the Corner\\", which was noticed for an improvement in its lyrical content and style. The second single, which received less attention, was \\"Shine\\" featuring the Hot Boys. Near the release of Lights Out, Lil Wayne was featured on the single, \\"Number One Stunna\\" with Big Tymers and Juvenile, which peaked at No. 24 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart.  Lil Wayne's third album 500 Degreez, released in 2002, followed the format of his previous two, with significant contributions from the Hot Boys and Mannie Fresh. While being certified gold like its predecessor, it also failed to match the success of his debut. The title was a reference to the recently estranged Hot Boys member Juvenile's recording, 400 Degreez. The lead single was \\"Way of Life\\" which failed to match the success of his previous singles. After the release of 500 Degreez, Wayne was featured on the single \\"Neva Get Enuf\\" by 3LW. Question: What was some of the songs from the album?.

Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators.  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person that is re-making the garden that was seen as a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners?

Last night about 3 am I was awakened by the sound of a growling cat on the floor next to the bed , and cat - patter going across the room . The growling sounded much like I ' ve heard from a cat in physical pain before , so I got up to check it out . One cat chased the other ( growling ) out of the room as I turned on the light . Why was the narrator awake at such a rough hour ?","output":"The narrator was awakened at such a rough hour, around 3 am, primarily due to the sounds of a growling cat and the patter of cat movements across the room. The growling noise resembled the sound that a cat in physical pain would make, which triggered the narrator's concern and urged them to get up and investigate the situation. Additionally, it seems that one cat chased the other, making the growling cat leave the room as soon as the light was turned on. There could be several reasons why the cats were behaving this way at that particular hour, and why this unusual behavior happened to wake the narrator up. Firstly, cats are naturally nocturnal animals, which means they are typically more active during the night compared to the daytime. Therefore, it is not uncommon for cats to engage in play or territorial disputes during late-night hours, which could result in noises such as growling or the sound of running. Secondly, cats in a multi-cat household may engage in aggressive behavior or territorial issues. This could take place when one cat perceives another cat encroaching on its space or resources, such as food, toys, or preferred resting places. If there is an issue between the two cats, it could result in chasing and growling as they try to assert dominance or maintain their territory. It is possible that the cat was growling in response to such a situation, feeling threatened or attempting to communicate its discomfort. Thirdly, it is worth considering that the growling cat might have been experiencing some form of physical pain or discomfort. The narrator mentioned that the growling sounded similar to what they have heard from a cat in pain before. Although the cats' activity could be attributed to play or territorial disputes, it is essential to ensure that the growling cat does not require medical attention. Pain or discomfort can cause a change in a cat's behavior, making them more irritable or aggressive. Overall, the narrator was awake at that rough hour due to the concern elicited by the unusual and potentially alarming sounds produced by their cats. The growling and chasing behavior might be attributed to a combination of the cats' natural nocturnal tendencies, a potential dispute over territory or resources within the household, or perhaps an indication of physical pain or discomfort experienced by the growling cat. Regardless of the cause, the sounds were enough to disturb the narrator's sleep and prompt them to investigate and try to understand the situation better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The man is not wearing a shirt. 2. He is climbing the side of a large rock. These details indicate that the man is engaged in an outdoor activity or sport, potentially rock climbing or bouldering. The absence of a shirt could be due to hot weather conditions, physical exertion, or personal preference. However, these factors do not explicitly point to a beach or swimming context. Hypothesis: Man swimming at the beach. The hypothesis suggests that the man is swimming at the beach. However, the premise does not provide any information related to swimming or a beach setting. Climbing a large rock could occur in various settings, such as mountains, cliffs, or even indoor climbing gyms. Wearing no shirt is also not exclusive to beach environments. Based on the available information in the premise, there isn't enough evidence to conclusively determine that the man is swimming at the beach.

The term evolved through the history of music, designating a variety of forms until the Classical era, when it took on increasing importance, and is vague. By the early 19th century, it came to represent a principle of composing large-scale works. It was applied to most instrumental genres and regardedalongside the fugueas one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music.

Following major announcements from Facebook, Vine, Bebo and others, Snapchat has revealed its own ‘chat’ feature. Users within the popular image-sharing app can now message friends and make live video calls. Scroll down for video. Snapchat has unveiled its new messaging service that allows you to talk to other users. You can also now share live video with them (pictured) to make quick and instant calls. The update for the app is being released today on iOS and Android. The new feature, dubbed Chat, continues Snapchat’s theme of being quick, easy and simple. With just a swipe you’ll be able to privately message your friends. To use Chat, you simply load up the app as usual. When in your Snapchat inbox, you then swipe right on a friend’s name to send then a written message. The messages work like a regular Snap, and will be deleted after both of you have seen it and quit your respective chat screens. There is a button that lets you save important information, though, or of course you can always take a screenshot. If you and your friend happen to be chatting at the same time the app will alert you by saying they are ‘Here’ on the screen. Then, pressing and holding the screen will let you chat face to face instantly. Holding the top of the screen will show your friend the view out of the camera on the back of your phone. Touching the bottom of the screen will switch to the front camera, so you can show them a quick video selfie if you want. The latest update follows the previous change, which added Stories to Snapchat. This enabled users to have an image on their profile available for viewing for 24 hours. The chat feature, though, seems to be a clear rebuttal to moves from Snapchat’s rivals. Facebook, Vine, Bebo and possible even Twitter have all made moves in the instant messaging field in the past few months. Snapchat's move seems to be an attempt to ensure they hang onto their chunk of the lucrative photo and text communication market. At the end of 2013 it was estimated that Snapchat had over 26 million users in the US alone, with many others around the world. And in a survey of American college students in February, 77% said they used Snapchat on a daily basis. But the company still apparently holds only 5% of the 'selfie' market, with this move perhaps an attempt to keep them in the game. To use Snapchat's new Chat feature (pictured) you simply need to swipe right on one of your friend's names in the app's inbox. Messages are deleted when you both quit the chat window. You can activate the front (left) and rear (right) cameras on your device by dragging your finger to the bottom and top of your phone respectively. Back. in February Facebook bought hugely popular messaging app WhatsApp for. 19 billion (£11.4 billion), after failing in a previous 3 billion to. buy Snapchat. At the start of April, Vine revealed its ‘Vine Messages’ service that enabled users to send messages to each other. This. directly followed once-popular social network Bebo’s attempts to get. back into the game with Blab, their own video messaging service. Facebook,. meanwhile, is busy trying to increase the profile of its Messenger app,. with rumours that it will shift WhatsApp users onto its native. messaging client. They recently announced a selfie feature for Messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself. And. even Twitter is getting in on the game – it’s rumoured they are. considering letting users have secret conversations on the site.","output":"The instant messaging war has intensified as Snapchat unveils its new chat feature that allows users to send messages and make live video calls within the popular image-sharing app. This update, available on iOS and Android, is called \\"Chat\\" and is designed to be quick, easy, and simple.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you have temperatures above 75 °F (24 °C) during the summer, plant your vegetable crops in May or June. Make sure they are planted after the threat of frost is over. Lettuce, cabbage, kale, and tomatoes are all great options to plant in the summer. Most fruit, like apples, oranges, lemons, and limes can be grown on trees in a 12,000 square feet (1,100 m2) area. Start with planting a fruit tree in a pot to monitor the soil and water intake, and then transfer it to the ground after 1 year during the early spring. Most fruit trees will not start bearing fruit until they are 2 to 3 years old. Vine fruits, like grapes, can be grown anywhere with a trellis that they can climb. If you live in an area that gets below freezing and has a lot of precipitation, plant grains like rye. Rye is able to withstand the cold temperatures and the heavy rainfall that will happen in many areas of the world. Plant your rye in the early fall before the first frost hits. Winter grains will usually give a higher crop yield than summer grains. Summer grains, like corn, do best during warm weather. If your summers get hot, plant corn in May or June and let it grow over the summer months. Corn does especially well in the midwest area of the United States. Rice needs a tropical climate to grow. Southeast Asia is the best climate for rice crops. Potatoes, beets, radishes, and other vegetables that grow underground prefer to grow during the colder months. Plant root vegetables in July or August to prepare for a fall harvest. You can grow these even if the threat of frost is near, since they are hearty enough to withstand it.","output":"This article provides guidance on planting various vegetable crops, fruit trees, and grains based on seasonal temperatures and regional climate conditions for optimal growth and harvest yields."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Southern's deputy chief operating officer, Alex Foulds, said: \\"While we will do everything we can to get passengers where they want to go, we have to warn people that journeys may be disrupted and take longer than normal. The politics behind the Southern rail dispute What's the Southern Rail strike about? How bad have Southern rail services got? \\"We are sorry that yet again passengers will have their plans disrupted by what is pointless industrial action. Our door remains open for meaningful talks.\\" The planned six-day strike starting on 9 January involves both the unions. Most routes are expected to have no services. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: \\"Our guards members on Southern Rail remain rock-solid and absolutely determined in their action in defence of rail safety this morning.\\" The urged transport ministers to engage in direct talks with the union. The Department for Transport said the dispute was between Southern and the unions and \\"not something the government is involved in\\". The RMT has previously accused Southern of \\"hoarding profits\\" but the rail operator said it made a loss last year and would not make any profit this year. During the last drivers' strike, Aslef went into talks with GTR at conciliation service Acas. Mr Cash said he was not allowed in. The negotiations ended without a deal. Commuter Robin Marchant, from Brighton, has organised a mass peaceful protest for passengers from 3 January to 5 January. So far more than 1,000 people have shown interest in the Facebook event.","output":"The Rail Maritime and Transport Union and Aslef unions are striking due to a dispute with Southern Rail's parent firm, Govia Thameslink, over changes to the role of guards on new trains, leading to significant travel disruption and future strikes planned."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It's beautiful in form but weak in function. The style is great but it is messy to use. At least one ounce of a drink will go up into the cap while shaking. If it does not settle back into the container, it runs down the sides and all over your hands, counter, floor etc. when you take the cap off. Pouring from the shaker is equally as messy due to the bad arrangement of the holes in the strainer. I was really disappointed and sent mine back.

Despite appreciating the aesthetics and design of the cocktail shaker, the customer encountered significant problems with its functionality. The issues mentioned include liquid going up into the cap while shaking, making the process messy, and an inconvenient arrangement of holes in the strainer which causes difficulty in pouring.

Hypothesis: Non-household mail is not included in bill/payment figures. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. In this scenario, the premise states that the mail used by non-households for purposes like paying bills and sending bills to other non-households is unknown. As a result, it is not considered or included in the bill/payment statistics presented in the table in question. This premise sets up a clear context for how non-household mail is treated when it comes to bill/payment calculations. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement asserting that non-household mail is not included in the bill/payment figures. Given the premise's explanation of how non-household mail remains unknown and is not factored into bill/payment data, the hypothesis is a direct logical consequence of the premise. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment because the information provided by the premise leads to the conclusion stated in the hypothesis. When we examine the premise, we see that it implies the specific exclusion of non-household mail from the related statistics. Therefore, the hypothesis is a valid logical inference based on the information given in the premise. In summary, the premise entails the hypothesis since it provides information regarding the exclusion of non-household mail from bill/payment figures, which directly supports and validates the hypothesis statement.

Those who only remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to seek out this charming piece of late '60s satire. Ustinov stars as a convicted embezzler (we first see him during his last day in gaol where he is preparing the prison governor's tax return) who, sensing that the future is in computers, poses (by means of a deft piece of identity theft) as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate an American multinational. Ustinov (who co-wrote the script) is on top form, as is the delightful Maggie Smith, here unusually cast as an accident-prone cockney-sparrow dolly bird. Bob Newhart also puts in an amusing performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden is satisfyingly sleazy as Ustinov and Newhart's womanising boss. What do I particularly like about this film? Not only is it a well-thought-out 'caper movie' but it's also a touching little love story; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumbling into love (the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effective.) So, what is there not to like? Well, the script is no more computer-literate than most films (that is, hardly at all) even though it captures the feel of late '60s 'big iron' business computing quite well. Also there are a couple of small plot glitches that you're not likely to notice until the second or third viewing, but I consider these to be minor niggles. As I said, this is a film which is well worth seeking out, and after you've seen it once you'll want to see it again at regular intervals.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who is decided to not be an enemy of the Amazons?  In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battled Ares, the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home. Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who is decided to not be an enemy of the Amazons is Steve. This refers to USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, who crash-lands on the island of Themyscira and after being interrogated, is concluded by Queen Hippolyta to not be a threat to the Amazon population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: When medication doesn't work: Innovative program eases ADHD symptoms naturally Ten-year-old Mallory Oakes loves to read – in fact, she has been doing it since before she was 2 years old. Her mother knew she had a gifted child, but those gifts would not come without challenges. “I think I knew from very early on that she was different, but she was my first child, so I figured anything that I saw, there was a chance that she would grow out of it,” Amy Oakes told FoxNews.com. “She would wake up in the middle of the night with night terrors at a very young age, she stopped napping around 15 months … any type of change in our schedule could set off an epic tantrum.” Oakes didn’t know it then, but her daughter Mallory was one of more than 10 percent of American children living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) “She was diagnosed in first grade after there were some difficulties in the classroom,” Amy said. “But there were other components to it -- there was oppositional defiant disorder, there were some [autism] spectrum-like behaviors, and difficulty later on socializing with other children.” Oppositional defiant disorder is one of the most common conditions linked to ADHD in children and is characterized by anger, tantrums, opposition to authority and, sometimes, aggressive behavior. For Mallory, the disorder led to a pattern of epic meltdowns which left Amy reeling— and willing to try anything to control them. “Initially, I tried a number of different things -- different kinds of therapies; art therapies. I took her to somebody who supposedly could heal through touch,” she said. “We tried some medication therapies that ended up being really a nightmare for us, and making matters worse.” Medication is often the first line of defense in conventional medicine for kids with ADD and ADHD, with doctors prescribing everything from stimulants to antipsychotics and even antidepressants to help control the symptoms. The spectrum of ADHD and related disorders is broad, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment. “There were times I remember saying to my husband that her behaviors are holding our family hostage because it could be one meltdown a day, it could be five meltdowns a day,” Amy said. “She couldn't do anything to stop it, and I really began to realize that her brain wouldn't let her, even if she wanted to be good, her brain wasn't allowing her to.” Mallory’s oppositional behavior reached a fever pitch when the family moved from their home in Hoboken, N.J. to the suburb of Glen Rock, N.J. in 2014. “She wasn't able to attend mainstream school anymore and the school that we ended up putting her in was an end-of-the-road school … in my mind, it was not a place where she belonged,” Amy said. Desperate for a solution, Amy started searching for success stories about kids like Mallory who had been helped by different therapies. That’s when she found the Brain Balance Achievement Center in Allendale, N.J. “We went in for the assessment and her behaviors at the assessment were really terrible,” Amy said. “I thought we weren't going to get accepted to the program, and they told us they could help us and we never looked back.” The specialized learning centers, of which there are now 80 throughout the country, were developed by Dr. Robert Melillo, a neurology researcher and author of the book “Disconnected Kids,” to help balance the brains of kids with learning disorders, like Mallory. “What thinking really is is really coordinating different networks in the brain so that we can bring all of those networks together at one time,” Melillo told FoxNews.com. “And if [kids] have poor coordination in their body, they often have poor coordination in their brain -- poor coordination between their networks -- so they can't bring all these networks together to learn in the most optimal way.” The program uses a combination of sensory motor (physical) exercises and academic learning to help stimulate and strengthen the parts of the brain responsible for certain disorders. “If you get a child who has really strong left brain and delayed right brain, those are kids that may be labeled with attentional problems or behavioral problems or social issues,” Melillo said. “The easiest way to get their brain to become coordinated is by making their body coordinated, so a large part of what we're doing is this sensory motor interaction, building their muscle tone, building their strength, building their body spatial awareness.” The program also incorporates what Melillo calls “bionutritional” guidelines to make sure children are getting the proper nutrition for optimal learning. Parents are a big part of the learning experience and are tasked with at-home exercises to do with their kids. Mallory attended the Brain Balance Achievement Center three times a week after school for three months at a time, starting in November 2014. She has since gone on to complete two more cycles of Brain Balance learning and no longer takes medication to manage her condition. “She's playing on the basketball team now, she's involved in theatre -- things that she wasn't able to do because her behaviors prohibited her from doing them,” Amy said. “I really felt very hopeless, before we found Brain Balance, so the fact that I just have hopes for her now is a beautiful thing, and I think she can do anything she wants to do.” For more information, visit BrainBalanceCenters.com.","output":"A program developed by Dr. Robert Melillo, a neurology researcher and author of the book “Disconnected Kids,” may help balance the brains of children with learning disorders like ADHD.

Eleanor Crooks, Press Association. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga does not feel Andy Murray is the player he was and claims locker-room rivals are less fearful about facing the Scot. Their fourth-round clash at the US Open tomorrow should provide a real measure of where Murray's form is after an up-and-down first three rounds. The Scot has not faced anyone inside the top 70, yet has already dropped sets to Robin Haase and Andrey Kuznetsov, either side of a good performance against Matthias Bachinger in round two. Beatable: Jo-Wilfried Tsonga fancies his chances when he takes on Andy Murray in the fourth round. Brute force: The Frenchman celebrates beating Pablo Carreno Busta in round three. The good news for Murray is he will surely be back on Arthur Ashe, a court he loves, for the Tsonga match and away from his nemesis, Louis Armstrong Stadium. Should Murray win, it would be his first victory over a top-10 player since lifting the Wimbledon title last year. Tsonga said: \\"The locker room is maybe a bit less afraid of Andy because he's losing a few more matches than in the past. But I don't know any player who once on court is going to be super confident against Andy. \\"He's different than in the past maybe because I feel he's not serving as strong as he used to, nor maybe hitting as strong as he used to. \\"And during matches he's showing more when he seems in pain with his back or hip region, I'm not sure. You can see it on some moves, too.\\" Murray declared himself in the best shape since before his back surgery almost a year ago when he arrived in New York, and maintained that is the case despite his cramp issues in round one. He is no longer in pain from his back but has struggled to maintain his intensity through matches and has developed a bad habit of allowing leads to slip away. He was pegged back by Kuznetsov after looking in complete control at a set and a break up, and went on to drop the third set, but Murray was happy with the way he handled the lows. Frustrated: It's been far from plain sailing for Murray as he's struggled through to the fourth round. Support: The Scot's loyal fans have stuck by him at Flushing Meadows. Determined: Tsonga has been knocked out in all three previous grand slams in 2014. Pen to paper: Tsonga signs autographs for excited fans after seeing off Busta. \\"Each time I had a slip, I did a decent job of getting myself back into the sets, getting a break straight away,\\" Murray said. \\"Even when I got broken at the end of the match, I broke the next game. When I was down 4-1 in the third set, I got myself back into the set. \\"That's really what you need to do. You need to give yourself opportunities in every set and in matches. Then it will start to become natural again.\\" Murray was unable to turn things back his way the last time he met Tsonga, in Toronto earlier this month, when from 3-0 up in the deciding set he allowed the match to slip away. It was Murray's first loss to Tsonga in a competitive match since the Australian Open in 2008 and he retains a dominant 9-2 lead in their head to head. \\"I played a good match,\\" said eighth seed Murray, looking back to the Toronto match. \\"I was up a break in the third set and didn't manage to close it out. So obviously if I get myself in that position again, hopefully I'll do a better job of that. But I don't need to change too much. \\"It will be a tough match. We've played each other a lot of times. He's obviously playing well right now. He had a great week in Canada. He's played some good tennis so far here. \\"I've had a lot of close matches with him but I've won a lot against him, as well. I would say (my game) matches up well.\\" Tsonga had been having a poor season until Toronto, where he beat Novak Djokovic, Murray, Grigor Dimitrov and Roger Federer back to back to lift the second Masters title of his career and climb back into the top 10. Determined: Murray has only lost twice to Tsonga in 11 ATP tour matches with Tsonga. Girlfriend: Murray's partner Kim Sears has been at the US Open offering the Scot support. The 29-year-old is not reading too much into his win over Murray and admits the best-of-five-set format in slams does not suit him as well as best of three. \\"Andy is someone I know very well, against whom I don't have a good record,\\" said Tsonga. \\"But I'm feeling good. I expect to play a good match. Playing three sets, it's always more physical. I like when it's in three sets. \\"(Toronto) is positive because it means that I'm able to play well against him. I hope I will do that again. \\"One shouldn't overestimate this win, he still leads our head to head and now he'll be aware of the danger and maybe it plays against me. \\"A bit as with Djokovic, he's really tough for me because he returns very well.\\"","output":"- Jo-Wilfried Tsonga believes Andy Murray's form has dipped and players are less fearful about facing the Scot. - Murray's fourth-round clash against Tsonga at the US Open will serve as a measure of his form after an inconsistent first three rounds. - Despite dropping sets, Murray believes he has handled the lows well. - Murray has a dominant 9-2 lead in their head-to-head record but lost to Tsonga in Toronto earlier this month. - Tsonga credits his recent victory over Murray as a positive sign but acknowledges the best-of-five-set format at grand slams suits him less than best of three."},{"instruction":"-  Air enters the nose or mouth and travels through the windpipe into the lungs - The lungs have a series of smaller and finer tubes and sacs - Air reaches the smallest and finest air sacs called alveoli - Oxygen travels from the alveoli into the blood - Oxygen-rich blood is carried to the heart - Oxygen-rich blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart - Cells take in the oxygen rich blood and release carbon dioxide rich blood - The carbon dioxide rich blood travels to the lungs  What might be the last step of the process?

Write an article based on this \\"Bahrain's justice minister has said 47 medical workers will be charged with acting against the state during the recent unrest in the Gulf kingdom.\\"","output":"Title: Unraveling Bahrain’s Court Case Against 47 Medical Professionals Amid Unrest On a recent note, Bahrain's justice minister announced that 47 healthcare workers are to be charged for undermining the state during the recent period of significant civil unrest in this Arabian Gulf nation. Allegations, as serious as these, merit an understanding of the current political landscape of Bahrain, the role and responsibility of medical providers in such tumultuous conditions, and a grasp of the potential implications of this unprecedented legal action. Bahrain, officially the Kingdom of Bahrain, is a small island nation located near the Western shores of the Persian Gulf. The recent disturbances mark an escalation in an ongoing struggle between the Sunni led government and the nation's Shiite majority population. It is within this tension-filled environment that the 47 medical workers, including doctors and nurses, have been stationed and accused of compromising state security. According to the justice ministry, these medical professionals are accused of \\"promoting efforts to bring down the government\\" during the unrest by allegedly converting medical facilities into coordination centers for the protestors, and allegedly pushing propaganda that exaggerated the conditions on the ground. The healthcare workers in question vehemently denied these charges, contending their actions were purely driven by humanitarian needs during the crisis.  The role of medical professionals, irrespective of the political climate, is primarily dedicated to saving and preserving lives. They fulfill a noble duty by providing essential care amid the chaos, often risking their own safety. During periods of civil unrest, these responsibilities invariably get heightened due to increased injuries and trauma. With this backdrop, the charges against them seem counter-intuitive to their professional responsibilities and may raise global concern. The implications of this case could extend far beyond the confines of Bahrain. It constitutes a potential violation of Geneva Conventions, which protect medical personnel, ambulances, and hospitals during conflicts, and prohibits any punishment for carrying out medical activities compatible with professional ethics. It might also deter medical professionals from providing necessary care during future conflicts, fearing similar accusations. If prosecuted, the case may set a troubling precedent internationally where medical professionals are penalized for carrying out their medical duties during periods of civil unrest. It can pose a significant challenge to the International Community and Human Rights organizations, given it steps into uncharted territories of mediating between national law enforcement and the sacrosanct ethics of healthcare. On a national level, the charges against these healthcare workers may further fuel tensions between the government and the protestors, possibly triggering a new wave of unrest. It could also gain international attention and pile pressure on the Bahrain government over its handling of the protests. On the flip side, if these allegations find substantive proof, it may provide a new dimension to how organized dissent operates in times of political unrest and could possibly lead to governance reforms in such situations. In conclusion, the recent claims made by Bahrain's justice ministry concerning 47 healthcare workers not only inflame the country's volatile political situation but also spur global concern. The case bridges the sensitive overlap of medical ethics, the principles of justice, and duties towards the state. What transpires from this situation would undoubtedly set a precedent for potential future instances and shape international policies and response towards the role of healthcare in times of civil unrest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is what I hit myself in the mouth with. The curved end glance off my left front central incisor. It hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more. I chalked it up to it being a karmic reminder about patients and dental pain as I’ve never had a cavity let alone a dental abscess. It let me feel your pain.

Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos.A three-year civil war followed his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king. In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, with the death of Louis the Child, and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r....

Revolving around the fictional character and family of New Jersey-based Italian American mobster Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), the show portrays the difficulties he faces as he tries to balance the conflicting requirements of his home life and his criminal organization. These are often highlighted during his therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco). The series features Tony's family members, mafia colleagues and rivals, in prominent roles and story arcs, most notably his wife Carmela (Edie Falco) and protégé Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli).  - Edith \\"Edie\\" Falco (born July 5, 1963) is an American television, film, and stage actress, known for her roles as Diane Whittlesey in the HBO series \\"Oz\\" (19972000), Carmela Soprano on the HBO series \\"The Sopranos\\" (19992007), the title character of the Showtime series \\"Nurse Jackie\\" (200915), and Sylvia Wittel on the Louis C.K. web series, \\"Horace and Pete\\" (2016).  - Christopher Moltisanti, played by Michael Imperioli, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series \\"The Sopranos\\".

On a television program, for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in dramas than in comedies, especially in soap operas. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format. Webcomics are more likely to use story arcs than newspaper comics, as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term \\"story arc\\" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series \\"Wiseguy\\", and was quickly adapted for other uses.  - New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern United States and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.

Question: Question: \\"Where can Bermuda residents and visitors go to see the same types of Bermuda currency issued to financial institutions?\\"  Context: \\"In 1970 the country switched its currency from the Bermudian pound to the Bermudian dollar, which is pegged at par with the US dollar. US notes and coins are used interchangeably with Bermudian notes and coins within the islands for most practical purposes; however, banks levy an exchange rate fee for the purchase of US dollars with Bermudian dollars. Bermudian notes carry the image of Queen Elizabeth II. The Bermuda Monetary Authority is the issuing authority for all banknotes and coins, and regulates financial institutions. The Royal Naval Dockyard Museum holds a permanent exhibition of Bermuda notes and coins.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Bermuda residents and visitors who are interested in viewing the different types of Bermuda currency issued to financial institutions can visit several locations within the country. One of the primary places to see such currency is the Royal Naval Dockyard Museum, which houses a permanent exhibition showcasing Bermuda's notes and coins throughout history. Since its inception in 1970, the Bermudian dollar has been pegged at par with the US dollar, making both currencies virtually interchangeable for most transactions on the islands. However, it is important to note that banks may charge an exchange rate fee when purchasing US dollars with Bermudian dollars. One distinctive feature of Bermudian notes is the portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II on their designs. The Bermuda Monetary Authority is the institution responsible for the issuance of banknotes and coins, as well as the regulation of financial organizations within the country. As such, it serves as another potential destination for those looking to observe Bermuda currency. While the main focus of the Authority is on monetary policy, regulation, and issuing currency, its premises may also provide valuable information on the available currency types and their relevant financial histories. Furthermore, interested parties may choose to visit local banks and financial institutions to inquire about the various Bermuda currency types in circulation. While not all banking institutions may have displays of currency available for public viewing, staff members may be able to provide information or direct visitors to appropriate resources for learning more about Bermuda's unique currency system. Another way to explore the history of Bermuda currency, including past and current banknotes and coins, is through online resources and virtual museum exhibits. Websites dedicated to numismatics may offer detailed information on Bermudian currency, along with high-quality images so people can experience the designs and features of these notes and coins from the comfort of their own homes. In conclusion, to see the same types of Bermuda currency issued to financial institutions, the Royal Naval Dockyard Museum is the top choice for a physical location, while the Bermuda Monetary Authority, local banks and financial institutions, and online resources offer additional opportunities for learning about Bermuda's fascinating monetary history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It brought the scandal to light.","output":"No, the word \\"light\\" does not have the same definition in the next two sentences. In each sentence, \\"light\\" carries a different meaning, showcasing how the English language often has several meanings for a single word based on context. Let's analyze each sentence to understand the distinct meanings: 1. \\"He stepped into the light.\\" In this sentence, \\"light\\" refers to the visible natural agent or radiation that enables the human eye to perceive objects. It typically comes from sources like the sun, a lamp, or any artificial or natural source of illumination. Here, the word \\"light\\" is used in the literal, physical sense. When the person \\"stepped into the light,\\" it suggests that he moved from an area of shadow or darkness into an illuminated space. 2. \\"It brought the scandal to light.\\" In this sentence, \\"light\\" refers to the exposure, discovery, or revelation of information, in this case, the scandal. This meaning of \\"light\\" is metaphorical rather than literal. When something is \\"brought to light,\\" it means that the information was previously hidden, obscure, or unknown, and now it has been disclosed or made public. The word \\"light\\" in this context is symbolic of truth and knowledge, as opposed to the physical property in the first example. Thus, it is clear that the word \\"light\\" has different definitions in both sentences. The first refers to the literal, physical aspect of illumination, while the second pertains to the metaphorical act of revealing or disclosing hidden information or truth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.  Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff.  But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.  Warner’s committee is also investigating possible... What did Trump think of Sen. Mark Warner the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee?

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Jurisprudence is the science, study, and theory of law. It includes principles behind law that make the law. Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as jurists or legal theorists (including legal philosophers and social theorists of law), hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, of legal reasoning, legal systems, and of legal institutions. Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems in two rough groups:  - Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e. the state of being male, female or an intersex variation which may complicate sex assignment), sex-based social structures (including gender roles and other social roles), or gender identity. Some cultures have specific gender roles that can be considered distinct from male and female, such as the hijra (chhaka) of India and Pakistan.  - Jurisdiction (from the Latin \\"ius, \\" meaning \\"law\\" and \\"\\" meaning \\"to speak\\") is the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility, e.g., Michigan tax law. In the federations like USA, areas of jurisdiction apply to local, state, and federal levels; e.g. the court has jurisdiction to apply federal law.  - JURIST is an online legal news service hosted by the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, powered by a staff of more than 60 law students working in Pittsburgh and other US locations under the direction of founding Publisher & Editor-in-Chief Professor Bernard Hibbitts, Acting Executive Director Andrew Morgan, Research Director Jaclyn Belczyk, Technical Director Jeremiah Lee, Managing Editor Joseph Macklin and Chief of Staff Steven Wildberger. It features continuously updated US and international legal news and expert commentary. JURIST is dedicated to advancing civic education, supporting sound decision-making and promoting the rule of law by objectively reporting, documenting and analyzing important legal developments as they happen. JURIST seeks to encourage teaching, learning, and scholarship within the legal community and in the general community.  - In jurisprudence, procedural defenses are a form of defense, via which a party argues that it should not be held liable for a legal charge or claim brought against it. In common law jurisdictions the term has applications in both criminal law and civil law. Procedural defenses are applicable independently of the question of guilt or innocence in a criminal proceeding, and independently of substantive findings for or against a plaintiff or defendant in a civil proceeding.  - Reason is the capacity for consciously making sense of things, applying logic, establishing and verifying facts, and changing or justifying practices, institutions, and beliefs based on new or existing information. It is closely associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art and is normally considered to be a definitive characteristic of human nature. Reason, or an aspect of it, is sometimes referred to as rationality.   - A defendant is a person or entity accused of a crime in criminal prosecution or a person or entity against whom some type of civil relief is being sought in a civil case.  - In jurisprudence , prosecutorial misconduct is \`\` an illegal act or failing to act , on the part of a prosecutor , especially an attempt to sway the jury to wrongly convict a defendant or to impose a harsher than appropriate punishment . '' It is similar to selective prosecution .  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - A theory is a contemplative and rational type of abstract or generalizing thinking, or the results of such thinking. Depending on the context, the results might for example include generalized explanations of how nature works. The word has its roots in ancient Greek, but in modern use it has taken on several different related meanings.   - Criminal justice is the system of practices and institutions of governments directed at upholding social control, deterring and mitigating crime, or sanctioning those who violate laws with criminal penalties and rehabilitation efforts. Those accused of crime have some protections against abuse of investigatory and prosecution powers.  - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"  - In jurisprudence, selective prosecution is a procedural defense in which a defendant argues that he should not be held criminally liable for breaking the law, as the criminal justice system discriminated against him by choosing to prosecute. In a claim of selective prosecution, a defendant essentially argues that it is irrelevant whether he is guilty of violating a law, but that the fact of being prosecuted is based upon forbidden reasons. Such a claim might, for example, entail an argument that persons of different age, race, religion, or gender, were engaged in the same illegal actions for which the defendant is being tried and were not prosecuted, and that the defendant is \\"only\\" being prosecuted because of a bias. In the US, this defense is based upon the 14th Amendment, which stipulates, \\"nor shall any state deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\\"  - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.  - Natural law (\\"lex naturalis\\") is a philosophy that certain rights are inherent by virtue of human nature and can be understood universally through human reason. Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze human nature to deduce binding rules of moral behavior. The law of nature, as determined by nature, is universal.

Culture Club are an English band that was formed in 1981. The band comprised Boy George (lead vocals), Roy Hay (guitar and keyboards), Mikey Craig (bass guitar) and Jon Moss (drums and percussion). They are considered one of the most representative and influential groups of the 1980s. Culture Club sold more than 50 million albums and 100 million singles (including Boy George solo) records worldwide, including 7 million-records awards RIAA certificate in the United States. In 1981, Blitz Club regular Boy George occasionally sang with the group Bow Wow Wow under the stage name Lieutenant Lush. After his tenure with the group ended, George decided to start his own band and enlisted bassist Mikey Craig, drummer Jon Moss, and finally guitarist Roy Hay.  Realising they had an Irish gay man as the lead singer, a black Briton on bass, a blond Englishman on guitar and keyboards, and a Jewish drummer, they eventually decided to call themselves Culture Club. The group recorded demos, which were paid for by EMI Records, but the label was unimpressed and decided not to sign the group. Virgin Records heard the demos and signed the group in the UK, releasing their albums in Europe, while Epic Records released their albums in the United States and much of the rest of the world since Virgin did not have a US presence at the time. George began sporting a look inspired by Siouxsie Sioux with \\"heavy make-up and swaggy hair\\".  The band released two singles in May and June 1982, \\"White Boy\\" and \\"I'm Afraid of Me\\", though both failed to chart. In August the single \\"Mystery Boy\\" was released in Japan. In September of that year, the group released their third single, \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\", a reggae-influenced number, which became one of their biggest hits. The song went to No. 1 in the UK in late 1982 and became an international smash, peaking at No. 1 in over a dozen countries (No. 2 in the US), this track sold up to 6.5 million copies worldwide.  The band's 1982 debut on Top of the Pops created tabloid headlines, which focused on George's androgynous style of dress and sexual ambiguity. Magazines began to feature George prominently on their covers. Pete Burns, lead singer of the new wave band Dead or Alive, would later claim he was the first to wear braids, big hats, and colourful costumes, but George would cut back with a sharp-tongued remark, \\"It's not who did it first, it's who did it better.\\"  The band's debut album, Kissing to Be Clever (UK No. 5, US No. 14) was released in October 1982, and the follow-up single, \\"Time (Clock of the Heart)\\", became another Top 10 hit in the US (Number 2) and UK (Number 3). \\"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\\" also became a Top Ten hit in the US (Number 9) and in Canada. This gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group since The Beatles to have three Top Ten hits in America from a debut album. Kissing to Be Clever sold over 1.5 million copies in the US, being certified platinum, and sold another 3 million worldwide at the time of its release.

This article: Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Another effective way to help your child obey is by praising or rewarding them when they are behaving appropriately. When you see your daughter eating her food instead of throwing it, say, “Mindy, I love how you are eating and using good table manners. Keep that up and you’ll earn your favorite dessert!”  Experts believe positive reinforcement such as praise and rewards is much more effective than a consequence. Rather than lecturing or withholding privileges when undesirable behavior occurs, they suggest ignoring it and only giving your attention when your child is behaving appropriately. The goal is to get the child to do more positive behaviors to get more attention. This encourages the child to behave well, leaving less opportunity for misbehavior. For example, the parent might ignore it when their child throws food but lay on the praise when they eat as they should. If your child knows and understands what’s expected of them, they are less likely to break the rules. Sit down with your child and explain your family’s rules. Keep the rules clear, simple, and consistent. Also, make them aware of any consequences, such as if rules are broken, gaining points on a chart. When disciplining the child, discuss the rule, its consequence, and how the child can do better.  For instance, your rules might sound like, \\"Walk indoors. No running!\\" \\"Complete homework before playtime,\\" or \\"Clear away your area after an activity, such as homework or arts and crafts.\\" As an example, you might have a rule to treat others with respect. If your child throws a tantrum, you could talk to them about how it's disrespectful for them to behave that way. Then give them an example of how they could express their emotions differently. Post the rules in plain sight, so your child is constantly reminded of how they should behave. Try pinning them to the wall near your points chart (or jar), posting them on the fridge, or hanging a sign up on your kitchen door. It's important that your child learn to follow rules even when no one is watching. Resist the urge to micromanage the child's behavior.  For example, you could have the child check off positive behaviors, such as doing their homework and cleaning up after themselves. If you have multiple children, teach them to help each other follow the rules, rather than to tattle. For example, if one child notices that the other is running in the house, she could say, \\"Hey, we're supposed to walk when we're in the house. You could get hurt or break something.\\" Maintain the same rules and the same consequences within your household to help your child establish norms of behavior. That way, they know what to do, and what will happen if they don’t comply.  Try to be consistent across contexts and caregivers. For instance, the child shouldn’t be able to break the rules simply because friends are visiting. Similarly, mom shouldn’t have one set of rules while dad has another. You should also have the same expectations for your child even when you are tired. Don't let them use your exhaustion as a free pass to misbehave. In addition, your rules should be consistent between your children—one child shouldn't be allowed to break rules and not have consequences enforced. When other children visit your home, they should follow the same rules as your children. Ask your child to explain the rules to their friends or relatives when they get to your home, as this will help reinforce the child's understanding of the rules. Some kids have bucketfuls of energy and they get into trouble because they don’t know how to effectively channel it. Give your child plenty of opportunities to move their bodies and work their minds. They’ll be less likely to misbehave, as a result.  Let your child go outside to burn off energy or dedicate a special place inside where they can play. Try keeping fun coloring books, puzzles, and games nearby to keep them preoccupied. Be realistic when it comes to your child. Don’t expect an energetic child to sit quietly for hours at a time. Observe how your child functions and set up parameters that increase their odds of being obedient.","output":"This article suggests that praising and rewarding good behavior, setting clear and consistent rules, and giving children opportunities to burn off energy can help them obey and behave well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What Forrest is the later half of the movie set in The Amazon rain Forrest Answer:","output":"Title: The Heart of Amazonia Genre: Action/Adventure Plot: Act 1: A Thief's Awakening In the fast-paced city of New York, a skilled artefact thief named John Dawson thrives in recovering lost and forgotten relics, selling them to the highest bidder. Known by his alias, \\"The Phantom,\\" he lives an extravagant lifestyle, keeping a low profile. However, John grows disillusioned with his career path and the impact it has on the world's hidden treasures. One day, while reluctantly delivering a stolen Aztec artefact to a shady collector, John unwittingly gets pulled into an ancient prophecy. The artefact holds a powerful secret that, if unlocked, could change the course of human history. The secret lies deep within the Amazon rainforest, known as the heart of Amazonia. Act 2: Journey to the Heart Realizing the weight of responsibility, John decides to return the artefact to its rightful place. He reaches out to his only confidant, Maddy, a brilliant anthropologist and amateur historian. With her knowledge of Aztec culture and history, she becomes the keys to solving the mysterious prophecy. The two embark on a perilous journey to the Amazon rainforest, using Maddy's extensive knowledge to track the artefact's origins. Along their way, they face dangerous challenges, including wild animals, treacherous terrain, and wrathful spirits guarding the artefact. Also, they are being pursued by a dangerous crime syndicate and a corrupt government agency who are just as eager to harness the artefact's hidden powers—fame, fortune, and power. Act 3: The Amazon Unleashed As they venture deeper into the heart of Amazonia, John begins to understand the magnificence and untamed beauty of the jungle. There, they meet Imara, a member of a lost tribe that was the original keeper of the artefact. Imara shares her tribe's knowledge of the artefact and the prophecy, which foretells the return of the spirit of the Amazon and the chance to unleash its full power. As they continue to unravel the prophecy's mystery, the group finds themselves immersed in fierce battles against the human enemies pursuing the artefact and the powerful spirits that defend it. The Amazon rainforest begins to reveal its mystical and magical qualities, involving John, Maddy, and Imara in a quest far greater than they ever imagined. Act 4: The Final Battle In the heart of the Amazon, the group discovers the temple where the artefact must be returned. With time running out, they face off against the syndicate and corrupt agency now joined forces to claim the artefact's power. The epic battle ensues, involving the forces of nature, powerful spirits, and the extraordinary skills and determination of John, Maddy, and Imara. As the climactic fight intensifies, the spirit of the Amazon awakens, revealing its true form as an ancient guardian that can reshape the fate of the world. With the spirit's guidance, John manages to return the artefact to its rightful place, unleashing the hidden power that restores harmony to Amazonia and the world. Epilogue: A New Beginning With the task completed, the spirit of the Amazon grants John, Maddy, and Imara its gratitude and blessings. Recognizing their selfless act, the once-rich Phantom decides to devote the rest of his life to preserving the world's cultural treasures and working alongside Maddy and Imara to protect Earth's natural wonders. The adventure leaves a deep impact on their lives, rediscovering their true identities and purpose. John, Maddy, and Imara decide to remain friends, vowing to protect the world's mysteries and their newfound bonds with the spiritual guardians that have given them a second chance. The movie concludes with the powerful message of respect for nature, culture, and the true power that lies within the human spirit in The Heart of Amazonia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Erica MacKinnon and Bill Sneed have lived all over the world and spent a couple of years in a rented Los Angeles duplex considering whether to move to Miami or Seattle, Oakland or Portland, Maine. Instead, nearly a year ago, the business and life partners packed up and headed to Detroit, which they had visited months earlier in search of computer coders for their small commercial digital-animation company. “We spent three days in Detroit, and we just fell in love with the city,” said MacKinnon, 38. “We couldn’t believe the mix of the location and the water and the people.” They also appreciated the expansive 90-year-old brick homes priced below most nondescript L.A. bungalows. Those homes, in Detroit neighborhoods filled with 4,000- to 7,000-square-foot beauties, are in hot demand, both by newcomers to Michigan and Detroit suburbanites. New residents have come to Detroit from Paris, Panama, New York, Washington and San Francisco, lured to the city by its creative vibe, sense of urban adventure and affordable homes — even when they buy abodes with a butler’s pantry and third-floor servants’ quarters. [Detroit tries unconventional approach to restoring its housing market] Buyers think: “Why not trade a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan and have an 8,800-square-foot mansion in Detroit for half of that?” said Kenan Bakirci, an agent for Max Broock who for almost 20 years has focused on Palmer Woods and Sherwood Forest, two historic neighborhoods in north-central Detroit. In a city where homes still can cost less than a beat-up Chevrolet, demand has revved up for luxury residences that look as if a Bentley or vintage Cadillac belongs in their garages. These high-end homes in the city’s historic neighborhoods frequently attract multiple offers and often sell above the listing price, real estate agents say. Detroit is a city of empty lots and faded or abandoned homes, and the poverty rate is more than twice the national average. Many blue-collar workers live in suburban bungalows, and executives own sprawling homes in the suburban cities of Grosse Pointe or Bloomfield Hills. Many people are not aware of Detroit’s mansion districts, where auto barons and wealthy business owners spared no expense to build homes from 1900 to 1929. Homes in the Palmer Woods neighborhood have living rooms large enough to seat 110 at a jazz concert. Some come with carriage houses and basement bars big enough for 50 guests. “Homes that are move-in ready get heated action — multiple offers within the first week,” said Ryan Cooley, who leads O’Connor Realty and landed Sneed and MacKinnon their home. Some receive eight or more offers, he said. In September, MacKinnon and Sneed moved into a stately 1923 brick home with room for an art studio for Sneed, guest rooms for visits by nieces and nephews, and a home office for their Yankee Peddler animation and design company. They beat out several other offers for the home in Indian Village, one of the half-dozen Detroit neighborhoods where mansions and luxury homes or condominiums are found. [Why this 24-year-old is buying up abandoned homes in Detroit] Betty J. Warmack has sold homes in Detroit, mainly in Indian Village, for more than 30 years and says she has never seen this much demand and multiple offers. “I sold an attorney from New York a house, a psychiatrist from New York a house and a blogger” from Europe bought in Indian Village, a neighborhood on Detroit’s east side that is on the National Historic Register, she said. “It’s quite a comeback.” Homes that four years ago rarely sold for more than 200,000 fetch twice that amount if they are ready for their new owners to move in, real estate agents say. About 15 homes sold for 500,000 or more last year through October, more than double the seven high-end sales for the same period in 2014, according to Realcomp, which runs the city’s multiple-listing service. A few carry price tags of more than 1 million, a rarefied amount that only one Detroit home has sold for since 2006. That home, the Alfred J. Fisher mansion in Palmer Woods, went for 1.6 million in 2014 — more than homes in the tony suburbs fetched that year, according to Realcomp. It sold again last year, for 1.55 million to General Motors President Daniel Ammann and his wife, Pernilla, a partner in a New York advertising agency. (A high-profile mansion once owned by Motown Records founder Berry Gordy Jr. in the Boston-Edison neighborhood was taken off the market in July.) Austin Black II, a broker and owner of City Living Detroit, says he is amazed at how many executives have decided that it’s time to live in the city of Detroit, because for years they would house-hunt only in the nicer suburbs, where there were 217 million-dollar homes that sold in 2014 and 229 through October, Realcomp data shows. Inventory in the city has been low for months, Black said, with only a handful of homes for sale in prime neighborhoods. It’s gotten so tight, he said, that he has gone door to door in a few neighborhoods seeking people who are ready to put their homes up for sale. “I have 20 or so clients who are ready and able to purchase a home right now. Inventory doesn’t exist,” Black said. [Michael Bolton is trying to save Detroit. Yes, that Michael Bolton.] Demand in the mansion districts is so high and inventory so low, Black and others say, that some buyers are opting for adjoining neighborhoods, with stately but less elegant homes. The rising home prices may begin to persuade current homeowners to cash in their mansions and elegant abodes, some of which could fetch record or near record prices. But “because the market is doing so well lately, some sellers get aggressive with pricing” and those homes sell much slower, Black said. To many, the influx of new residents is one of several signs that Detroit may finally be on a roll. Quicken Loans Chairman Dan Gilbert, a Detroit native, is one of the city’s largest commercial landowners, purchasing more than 80 properties downtown for 2.2 billion. And the Kresge and Skillman foundations, JPMorgan Chase and others have committed millions of dollars to revitalization. Still, those efforts are not enough to jump-start the real estate market and undo the prolonged structural decline of Detroit’s housing stock. So city officials have introduced efforts to either raze or auction abandoned houses. And a community bank is experimenting with a program to renovate vacant houses and, if necessary, absorb a loss to sell them to buyers who may not qualify for traditional loans. Detroit has neighborhoods that have been ravaged by years of neglect and middle-class flight. It’s a city where dozens of homes are purchased at auction for as little as 1,000 to 7,000. That helps explain why in Detroit and three adjoining cities, homes sold for a median price of 20,158 through October of last year, which is up from the 15,011 median in 2014 and more than double the median price of 9,751 in 2012, according to Realcomp. Despite an influx of entrepreneurs, artists and hipsters, Detroit’s population fell from 951,000 in 2000 to about 680,250 in 2014. So new residents are moving into a city full of contrasts: Population and employment bases­ have declined for decades; crime and insurance for home and auto are high. Yet new restaurants and art galleries are opening, and high-end shops are starting to show up from New York, Germany and elsewhere. [For downtrodden Detroit, hopes of revitalization ride streetcar rails] Demand for larger luxurious homes may be an indication of Detroit’s comeback; buying has heated up since the city filed for bankruptcy in July 2013 (it emerged about 17 months later). Tech start-ups and boutiques have opened, and investors from China and Europe started buying commercial properties or blocks of homes, many in marginal neighborhoods. Sneed and MacKinnon said they knew that the market was competitive and that they wanted a home in Indian Village, citing its architectural beauty and proximity to the Detroit River and Belle Isle, a 985-acre island park. So they moved to Detroit in frigid February and rented a loft near downtown. “I wanted . . . to be ready when spring hit for any houses on the market,” MacKinnon said. “We wanted a beautiful, craftsman, old historic home.” They looked at eight homes and then saw the one they bought: a 4,878-square-foot property on a double lot filled this past summer with peonies, hostas and wind chimes. The Georgian revival has a big homey kitchen and a beautiful fireplace in the living room, four bedrooms on the second floor, and a third-floor office and fifth bedroom. It was spacious without being grand and just felt right from the moment they walked in, MacKinnon said. So they were aggressive and offered 430,000 — well above the 395,000 asking price. The owner accepted in two days. They have learned about their home’s history from him: It was built in 1923 at a cost of 12,750 for W.J. Davidson, who worked in General Motors’ executive offices, and was said to be a wedding present. Despite being self-employed, Sneed and MacKinnon had pre-qualified for a larger loan, so they landed a mortgage quickly using a local lender. Home insurance was a bit trickier, but after shopping around, they are satisfied with the policy’s 2,400 annual premium. Their new home requires some improvements — paint and hardwood floors, electrical and fire- and security-alarm upgrades — but basically it was ready for them to move in, except for cleaning out items left in the basement and a few small repairs. “We have had personal invites to join Thanksgiving parties and 100-year house parties, which is something that never happened in Los Angeles. Back there we never knew our neighbors,” MacKinnon said. [JPMorgan is betting 100 million on Detroit. Can it leverage a lot more?] Family members have come for visits, including MacKinnon’s mother and sister, who have shown up three times, she said. Other guests say they were misinformed about Detroit, from negative headlines, and appreciated the food culture, parks and how easy it is to get downtown. For some higher-priced deals, buyers need to put down more cash because their homes may not appraise at the prices they are paying, some agents said. Some offer all-cash purchases — an easy choice for New Yorkers who sell their 3 million apartment and buy a 500,000 mansion. About 40 percent of high-end purchases are all-cash sales, Cooley estimates. Nationwide, 27 percent of housing purchases were all cash in November, often by investors, according to the National Association of Realtors. Valrie Honablue, a psychiatrist who grew up in Panama, paid cash for her first Detroit home in 2010. She was living in Atlanta when she read about Motown’s real estate opportunities. “The prices are so low; something is wrong,” she said. So she drove to the city to see for herself. She bought one in Indian Village. Shortly after moving to Detroit, she left for “the job of a lifetime” but bounced back within two years, drawn by “the people and the possibilities” and the beautiful homes. Her second Detroit home had been vacant for 17 years when she bought it in June 2014. She got it for a bargain price but expects to spend five or six years renovating it, partly to spread out the improvement costs. Warmack, her agent, calls her “the pied piper of Detroit.” A dozen people have followed her to the city and bought homes. Many who move to Detroit bring their jobs or businesses with them. Sneed and MacKinnon are among them. “We just couldn’t get ahead” in Los Angeles, Sneed said. Now after nearly a year in Detroit, they operate their Yankee Peddler animation company from a loft, own a huge home with oversize gardens, and have made new friends who clue them into culture, festivals, dog parks and more. “We know we’re taking a gamble. . . . But there’s a passion here,” Sneed said. They have turned into Detroit boosters and are eager to celebrate their home’s 100th birthday in seven years. Said MacKinnon: “I can’t believe I live on this street. It blows me away how beautiful these streets are.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Detroit's historic neighborhoods, with 4,000 to 7,000sq ft houses, are attracting multiple offers from buyers trading smaller apartments in cities like New York and San Francisco to buy mansions for a fraction of the price.

Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts.

After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd.

Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display.

Answer the questions at the end based on the text. Lebanon, officially known as the Lebanese Republic, is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity. At just 10,452 km (4,036 sq. mi.), it is the smallest recognized country on the entire mainland Asian continent.  The earliest evidence of civilization in Lebanon dates back more than seven thousand years, predating recorded history. Lebanon was the home of the Canaanites/Phoenicians and their kingdoms, a maritime culture that flourished for over a thousand years (c. 1550–539 BC). In 64 BC, the region came under the rule of the Roman Empire, and eventually became one of the Empire's leading centers of Christianity. In the Mount Lebanon range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite Church was established. As the Arab Muslims conquered the region, the Maronites held onto their religion and identity. However, a new religious group, the Druze, established themselves in Mount Lebanon as well, generating a religious divide that has lasted for centuries. During the Crusades, the Maronites re-established contact with the Roman Catholic Church and asserted their communion with Rome. The ties they established with the Latins have influenced the region into the modern era. 1. About how long ago was the first civilization in Lebanon? 2. Was this before recorded history? 3.

Question: Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which friend took a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase?  Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Ben took a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. This is because Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, and statins are a class of cholesterol medication that work specifically by inhibiting the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We don't have much time!'' shouted a muffled voice from outside. Step 1: Continue the story by introducing the person knocking on the door I chose to have the person knocking on the door be an urgent voice, possibly a close friend or ally of Terrill, to emphasize the tense atmosphere and the need for the characters to act quickly. Terrill hesitated for a moment, his eyes darting back and forth between the beautiful woman and the door. He knew they were running out of time, but he couldn't bear the thought of leaving her behind. Step 2: Show the character's internal struggle I chose to illustrate Terrill's dilemma, torn between the woman he cares about and the impending danger outside. This adds an emotional layer to the story and deepens the connection between the events. \`\`Hold on, I'll be right there!'' he called out, taking one last look at her fading eyes. As he felt a pang of guilt, he carefully placed a gentle kiss on her forehead, and whispered a soft promise to return. Step 3: Have the character make a decision while demonstrating his feelings for the woman This is crucial in showing Terrill's attachment to the woman and the sacrifice he is making by leaving her side. It foreshadows the possibility of him coming back for her later in the story. Steeling himself, Terrill hurried towards the door, unbolted the lock, and swung it open. A man in a tattered coat, desperate and sweating, stood before him. \\"They're coming, Terrill, we have to get out of here now,\\" he urged, glancing nervously down the dark hallway. Step 4: Introduce the consequence of the character's decision and the urgency of the situation I brought another character into the scene to heighten the tension, conveying the sense of urgency of their need to escape. This also suggests that there is a broader conflict occurring outside the immediate setting. Nodding, Terrill reluctantly followed his companion down the hallway. He glimpsed back one last time, only to see that she had never looked so beautiful even with her eyes growing dim. He prayed that he'd be able to save her before it was too late. Step 5: Close the passage by emphasizing the character's thoughts and feelings Here, I remind the reader of Terrill's emotional attachment to the woman and his determination to return to her. This sets up potential future events in the story and ensures that the reader is invested in the outcome of the narrative."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

And David said, 'Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?'\\" This verse comes from 1 Samuel, a book in the Old Testament of the Bible. The passage takes place during the reign of King Saul, the first king of Israel, and narrates a dialogue between David and King Saul's servants. In this situation, David, who later becomes the second king of Israel and one of its most notable figures, is reacting to the proposal of becoming Saul's son-in-law. The words spoken by Saul's servants suggest that David is to be married to one of King Saul's daughters in recognition of his heroism and victories against the Philistines. Upon hearing this proposal, David expresses his thoughts and asks the servants if they think it is a minor matter for him to become the king's son-in-law. He emphasizes that he is a poor man, perhaps referring to his humble origins or his lack of wealth at the time. Additionally, David describes himself as being lightly esteemed, meaning he may not hold a high social status or be highly valued by others in that moment. David's response indicates that he is not sure he is worthy of such an elevated position, despite his heroic deeds.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Which of the following musical traits did not become more common during the Romantic era: chromatic, tonally colorful, or codified?\\" is in \\"The music of the Romantic era, from roughly the first decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century, was characterized by increased attention to an extended melodic line, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling romanticism in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like nocturnes, fantasias, and preludes being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized. The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing. The art song (or Lied) came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of grand opera, ultimately transcended by Richard Wagner's Ring cycle.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","output":"'Codified'. During the Romantic era, music became more chromatic, tonally colorful, and dissonant, meaning it strayed from the fixed, established (or codified) norms that characterized the Classical era. This period of music transitioned away from the codified forms, and moved towards more free-form pieces such as nocturnes, fantasias, and preludes, where the conventional exposition and development of themes were often disregarded or minimized. Thus, while chromaticism and tonal color became more common, within their complex and rich harmonies, and emotional expressivity, the codified structures didn't become more common but were rather seen as less prominent in the Romantic era musical composition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Although I love this movie, I can barely watch it, it is so real. So, I put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers.

Another \\"user\\" wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary. I'm all for that ! It's absolutely obvious that most of these people who've made comments about \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" may not have been born when it was released. They are mentioning other movies Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman have appeared in, at a later time. I'll be just as ruinously frank: I am 82-years-old. If you're familiar with some of my other comments, you'll be aware that I was a professional female-impersonator for 60 of those years, and also have appeared in film - you'd never recognize me, even if you were familiar with my night-club persona. Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this film ? YOU BET I DO !!.... ....and am not the least bit ashamed. If you haven't run-into some of them, it's your loss - but, there's a huge chance you have, but just didn't know it. So many moms, dads, sons and daughters could surprise you. It should be no secret MANY actors/actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of \\"Midnight Cowboy\\". Who is to judge ? I can name several, current BIG-TIME stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities, and weren't the least bit damaged by their time spent there. I make no judgment, because these are humans, just as we all are - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you name the attributes, they are all there, no matter what the package looks like. The \\"trivia\\" about Hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of \\"Ratzo\\" is a gem - he can be seen driving his auto all around Los Angeles - how do you think he gets his input? I can also name lots of male-stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money. Although the nightclub I last worked in for 26 years was world-famous and legit, I can also name some HUGE stars that had to be constantly chased out our back-street, looking to make a pick-up. This should be no surprise today, although it's definitely action in Hollywood and other cities, large and small. Wake-up and smell the roses. They smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue. Some of the \\"users\\" thought \\"Joe Buck\\" had been molested by his grandma. Although I saw him in her bed with a boyfriend, I didn't find any incidence of that. Believe-it-or-not, kids haven't ALWAYS had their own rooms - because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going-on in the master-bedroom. Whose business? Hoffman may have begged for change on the streets, but some of the \\"users\\" point-out that Jon Voight was not a major star for the filming of \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" - his actual salary would surprise you. I think he was robbed ! No one can doubt the clarity he put into his role, nor that it MADE him a star for such great work as \\"Deliverance\\". He defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it: few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie. The end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open, but society has always been hip. I also did not find any homosexuality between \\"Ratzo\\" and \\"Joe\\" - they were clearly opposites, unappealing to one another. They found a much purely higher relationship - true friendship. If you didn't understand that at the end of the movie, then you've wasted your time. \\"Joe's\\" bewilderment, but unashamed devotion was apparent. Yes, Voight deserved an Oscar for this role - one that John Wayne could never pull-off, and he was as handsome in his youth. Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks. He gave them superbly. Wayne got his Oscar. Every character in this film was beautifully defined - if you don't think they are still around, you are mistaken. \\"The party\\" ? - attend some of the \\"raves\\" younger people attend.....if you can get in. Look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs - you'll see every outrageous personality. Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of society's sleek women who have to get down to the nitty-gritty at times. If you were shocked by her brilliant acting, thinking \\"this isn't real\\", look at today's \\"ladies\\" who live on the brink of disrepute....and are admired for it. The brutality \\"Joe\\" displayed in robbing the old guy, unfortunately, is also a part of life. You don't have to condone it, but it's not too much different than any violence. \\"Joe\\" pointedly named his purpose - in that situation, I'd have handed-over the money quicker than he asked for it.

Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields.

His earliest and strongest musical influence was Django Reinhardt, the gypsy guitarist. Byrd was best known for his association with Brazilian music, especially bossa nova. In 1962, Byrd collaborated with Stan Getz on the album \\"Jazz Samba\\", a recording which brought bossa nova into the mainstream of North American music.  - Bossa nova is a genre of Brazilian music, which developed and was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s and is today one of the best-known Brazilian music genres abroad. The phrase \\"bossa nova\\" means literally \\"new trend\\". A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following in the 1960s, initially among young musicians and college students.  - Stanley \\"Stan\\" Getz (February 2, 1927  June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as \\"The Sound\\" because of his warm, lyrical tone, his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as \\"one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists\\". Getz went on to perform in bebop and cool jazz groups, but is perhaps best known for popularizing bossa nova with the worldwide hit single \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" (1964) performed with Astrud Gilberto, and for his work done under the influence of João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim.  - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs.

Write an article using the following points: Mehdi Benatia was sold to Bayern Munich for £20million. 27-year-old said he was forced out as Roma needed the money. James Palotta slammed Benatia, calling him poisonous and a liar. Article:","output":"Title: \\"Mehdi Benatia's Controversial £20M Sale to Bayern Munich: A turmoil in the Football World\\" The world of football was rocked when it became known that 27-year-old football star, Mehdi Benatia, was sold to Bayern Munich for £20 million. The transfer drew wide attention not just for the significant sum involved, but for the controversy and subsequent war of words that ensued between Benatia and his former club, AS Roma. Firstly, it is important to address the aspect of financial transaction involved in the deal. Benatia was sold to Bayern Munich for a staggering amount of £20 million. In the high-stakes world of football, such transactions are common. However, what makes this deal stand out is the claim by Mehdi Benatia that he was 'forced out' of Roma as the club needed the money. Benatia, an established central defender, was only 27 at the time - an age considered as being in the prime for a footballer. The fact that the Moroccan international claimed that he was forced out of the club raised eyebrows. To put it into context, it's as if a valuable piece of an orchestra has been removed, not because it was out of tune, but because there is more financial value in selling it. This brings up questions on whether the integrity of the sport is being compromised for financial gains. Moving on from the financial aspect, it is also necessary to delve into the repercussions that this particular transfer had on personal relationships and reputations within the club. James Palotta, AS Roma President, had strong words for Benatia following the transfer. He slammed the footballer calling him 'poisonous' and a 'liar'. Clearly, this sale didn't just have a financial impact, but resulted in a personal feud between the club administration and the player. These tags, 'poisonous' and 'liar', attached to Benatia by Palotta, painted a very negative image of the player. They painted a picture of a footballer who was disruptive and dishonest – two characteristics which are not associated with professional sportspersons.  In conclusion, the sale of Mehdi Benatia to Bayern Munich was more than just a regular transfer. It was a saga filled with accusations, controversies and a hefty financial transaction. It left a mark on the reputation of the player, stirred the integrity of the sport, and created a ripple in the football community, which still resonates. The transfer is a reminder of the complex relationships, financial factors and personal egos that are at play in the world of professional football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the difference between earlier strips and these strips? Context: Shorter, black-and-white daily strips began to appear early in the 20th century, and became established in newspapers after the success in 1907 of Bud Fisher's Mutt and Jeff. Humour strips predominated at first, and in the 1920s and 1930s strips with continuing stories in genres such as adventure and drama also became popular. Thin periodicals called comic books appeared in the 1930s, at first reprinting newspaper comic strips; by the end of the decade, original content began to dominate. The success in 1938 of Action Comics and its lead hero Superman marked the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books, in which the superhero genre was prominent.

Please answer the following question: Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes.

Choices:  - ground - sand box - michigan - warm bed - warm place  The rationale to choose \\"sand box\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"A cat would prefer to relieve itself in a sandbox. Cats have a natural instinct to bury their waste, making the sandbox the most suitable option amongst the given choices. The rationale for choosing \\"sandbox\\" is as follows: 1. Ground: While cats may occasionally relieve themselves on the ground, especially if they are outdoors and no suitable substrate is available, it is not their preferred choice. 2. Sandbox: Cats have a natural preference for a soft, granular substrate like sand, which allows them to easily dig a small hole to bury their waste. This helps them keep their environment clean and odor-free, as well as minimizing the risk of attracting predators or other threats. Therefore, a sandbox makes an ideal place for a cat to relieve itself. 3. Michigan: This is not a suitable answer as Michigan is a U.S. state and does not describe a specific environment where a cat could relieve itself. 4. Warm bed: Cats are unlikely to relieve themselves in a warm bed as they are instinctively clean animals and do not want to soil their sleeping area. 5. Warm place: While cats do enjoy spending time in warm, comfortable spots, they will not usually choose to relieve themselves in such areas, as they typically seek to keep their living space clean. In summary, a sandbox is the best choice among the given options for a cat to relieve itself, as it provides a suitable environment that aligns with their natural instincts to bury their waste and maintain a clean living space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the popular mind, the history of Hong Kong, long the entryway to China for Westerners, begins in 1841 with the British occupation of the territory. However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.  After reading the above, is \\"The Portuguese\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who were the first Europeans to control the greatest port in the East?\\"?","output":"Yes, \\"The Portuguese\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"Who were the first Europeans to control the greatest port in the East?\\" based on the information provided.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: For five years, Superman (Brandon Routh) has abandoned his adopted home of Earth while on a journey to visit the remains of Krypton. His seemingly selfish decision has ruined his image in the eyes of many, including journalist Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who writes a scathing article claiming that the world \\"doesn't need Superman\\". Billionaire Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), who lost his fame and fortune after being exposed as a criminal by Superman, secures an early release from prison and marries an old heiress, whose subsequent death makes him wealthy once again. Upon returning to Metropolis, Superman, in his human identity of Clark Kent, is shocked to discover the consequences of his disappearance. While covering the launch of a space shuttle, he narrowly saves a plane carrying Lois and other observers from crashing after a mysterious power failure, an act that earns him much goodwill. Unbeknownst to anyone, the accident was triggered by Luthor using Kryptonian technology stolen from the Fortress of Solitude. Clark tries to fix his relationship with Lois, but soon learns that she is engaged to Richard White (James Marsden), nephew of Daily Planet editor-in-chief Perry White (Frank Langella), with whom she shares a young, asthmatic son, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu). Luthor has his aide Kitty (Parker Posey) distract Superman, allowing Lex to steal a sample of kryptonite from a museum. Suspecting his involvement, Lois requests an off-the-record interview aboard his private yacht. Luthor admits that he is indeed responsible and reveals his true plan: to create a new continent modeled after Krypton that he can shape in his image, while triggering massive tsunamis that will wipe out the nations of the world and force humanity to turn to him for survival. Jason has an asthmatic attack when Luthor reveals the kryptonite, but has no subsequent reaction when Luthor holds the stone near him.     The Fortress of Solitude as depicted in the film.

Yes or no? Answer: There have also been three authors who wrote one book each, Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham), Sebastian Faulks and Jeffery Deaver . Question: who did james bond work for Answer:","output":"James Bond, the famous literary character created by Ian Fleming, works for the British Secret Service, specifically the \\"00\\" branch. The iconic secret agent, Agent 007, has been the protagonist in numerous books, movies, and other media since his debut in the 1953 novel, \\"Casino Royale.\\" The character's employment under the British Secret Service is a central aspect of his identity and forms the basis for many of the plotlines in the series. The British Secret Service, also known as MI6 (Military Intelligence, Section 6), is a governmental agency responsible for conducting intelligence and espionage operations in foreign nations. The fictional \\"00\\" section, of which Bond is a part, consists of elite agents with a unique license to kill, enabling them to execute their missions with skill and precision. As for the three authors mentioned in the question - Kingsley Amis (writing under the pseudonym Robert Markham), Sebastian Faulks, and Jeffery Deaver - they have indeed written James Bond novels, continuing the character's literary legacy after Fleming's death in 1964. Each author brought their distinct style and interpretation of the famous secret agent, further enriching the world of James Bond and his thrilling adventures fighting criminal masterminds and global conspiracies. Throughout the series, James Bond works closely with his superiors, particularly M, the head of MI6, and other notable characters like Miss Moneypenny and Q, who provide him with cutting-edge gadgets and expert assistance. Bond's employment by MI6 often puts him in dangerous situations, requiring him to travel to exotic locations, infiltrate criminal organizations, and protect the interests and security of the United Kingdom. In conclusion, the famed literary character James Bond works for the British Secret Service (MI6), serving as a globetrotting \\"00\\" agent tasked with undertaking high-risk espionage missions for the nation's security. The character's steadfast commitment to his work and extraordinary exploits have made him one of the most popular figures in spy fiction, with his adventures being chronicled not only by creator Ian Fleming but also by various authors like Kingsley Amis, Sebastian Faulks, and Jeffery Deaver, who have carried on the tradition and entertained fans for decades."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: China Unicom Boycott of Google May Signal Fallout Is Spreading      (For more stories about Google in China, see {EXTR <GO>}.)      By Mark Lee      March 25 (Bloomberg) -- China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd.’s boycott of Google Inc.’s search engine signals the fallout from the U.S. company’s defiance of government censorship is spreading, analysts said.      Unicom doesn’t use Google search boxes on its phones and only works with companies that abide by Chinese law, President Lu Yimin told reporters yesterday in Hong Kong. On March 23, billionaire Li Ka-shing’s Tom Online Inc. said it stopped using Google on its portal.      “If you were partnering with Google in China, your business plans have just fallen apart,” Bertram Lai, head of research at CIMB-GK Securities in Hong Kong, said by phone. “You need to scramble and find new partners.”      Google’s decision to stop censoring its Chinese service has spurred speculation that advertisers may switch to rival search engines such as that of Baidu Inc. In the U.S., Go Daddy Group Inc., the world’s largest registrar of domain names, said yesterday it’s refusing to offer new site identities in China, citing increased Internet spying by the government on its citizens.      Chinese partners for Google’s search operations need to review their business ties as the U.S. company’s Internet service license in China needs to be renewed soon, said Fang Meiqin, research director at BDA China Ltd., a Beijing-based telecommunications industry consultant.      Sale Postponed      Google said in January that it postponed to an unspecified date the sale of two handsets co-developed with Unicom, after the U.S. company said its stand on Internet censorship may lead to its exit from China. Lu denied Unicom was involved in the phones’ development.      “Unicom has dropped Google from its handset plans because Google no longer operates within China,” Lai, who rates Unicom shares “underperform,” said. “It makes sense for them to make the decision immediately” to avoid the costs of reprogramming handsets to remove Google later, he said.      Mountain View, California-based Google, which has partnerships with China Mobile Ltd. and Sina Corp., said March 22 it began routing China-based subscribers to an unfiltered search service on its Hong Kong site, following through on a Jan. 12 statement to end self-censorship of its Google.cn portal.      Google’s redirection of its search queries is effectively a pullout from China, reducing the appeal for advertisers, Steven Chang, the Shanghai-based chief executive officer for China at Zenith Optimedia, which buys ads from Google and Baidu on behalf of clients, said in an interview this week.      ‘Advertisers Will Switch”      “If traffic at Google’s Hong Kong site is not as good as the Chinese site, advertisers will switch,” Elinor Leung, head of Internet research at CLSA Ltd., said this week. Chinese companies including Baidu, Tencent Holdings Ltd., and Sohu.com Inc. will benefit, she said.      Baidu, operator of the country’s biggest search engine, rose 2.3 percent to 608.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, while Sohu dropped 1.9 percent.      Elaine Feng, executive vice-president at Tom Online, said the company only works with partners that are compliant with regulations. She said the Chinese Internet company ended its relationship with Google after the expiry of an agreement, without giving details on the timing.      Go Daddy’s announcement came two days after Google said it stopped self-censorship. Christine Jones, executive vice president and general counsel of the Scottsdale, Arizona-based registrar, disclosed the company’s change in policy at a hearing of a congressionally mandated commission yesterday in Washington.      Partnerships      Google teamed with China Mobile in January 2007 to offer mobile and Internet services in the world’s most populous country. The U.S. firm also struck a partnership with Sina to provide search on China’s third-most visited Web portal.      Rainie Lei, spokeswoman at China Mobile, didn’t reply to e- mail and phone messages seeking comment. Cathy Peng, a spokeswoman at Sina declined to say if the company plans to retain its search agreement with Google.      Baidu, based in Beijing, accounted for 58.6 percent of China’s online search market last quarter, compared with 35.6 percent for Google, according to research company Analysys International.      --Editors: Mark McCord, Suresh Seshadri.

China Unicom said the Google search function would not be provided on phones using the US company’s Android-based operating system. Unicom said the handsets’ manufacturers would choose which search engines to use instead.      “We are willing to work with any company that abides by Chinese law . . . we don’t have any co-operation with Google currently,” said Lu Yimin, Unicom’s president.      The Chinese government has struggled in recent days to respond to Google’s decision to redirect Chinese users of its search function to its uncensored Hong Kong site.      Internet users using Google have experienced widely divergent search results in different parts of the country and at different times of the day, in part a reflection of splits in the Chinese government over how to react to the US group’s move.      But Unicom’s statement is confirmation that Google’s stance against censorship in China could carry a substantial commercial cost, through its exclusion from the fast-growing mobile internet market in the country.      According to official Chinese figures, the country has 384m internet users, but 745m mobile subscribers, many of them regular users of the internet on their handsets. Last year, China Unicom and its two competitors started third-generation mobile businesses and have signed up millions on customers to the higher-end services.      In January, after announcing its intention to stop censoring its search engine in China, Google delayed the launches of two Android-based mobile handsets that Samsung and Motorola had developed for Unicom.      Unicom’s website has since started taking pre-orders for the Motorola device. China Unicom did not explain the delay or say when the phones would be launched.      Analysts said China Unicom was likely to take a blow from its decision. “Their distribution of the iPhone is not going very well, and therefore Android was an important part of their strategy,” said Charice Wang, an analyst at Ovum, the telecoms research company.      China Mobile, the world’s largest mobile operator, offers more than a dozen smartphones running on its own platform which is based on Android and which feature Google as one search engine among others. So far, the company has not said whether it will drop Google. But last week, Wang Jianzhou, chairman, was already playing down the company’s co-operation with Google, saying that the two did not have an exclusive relationship.      “They are likely to switch to Baidu soon,” said Ms Wang, the Ovum analyst, referring to Google’s Chinese competitor in internet search. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"China Unicom, a big phone company in China, has decided to stop using Google's search engine on its phones. This is because Google decided not to follow the Chinese government's rules about controlling what people can search for on the internet. This could be bad for Google because China has a very big market for mobile phones and the internet, and now people might start using other search engines like Baidu instead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. Question: Who said the national guard will help with border surveillance?

However, the review does highlight a couple of downfalls, such as the delicate posts that seem easy to bend and the insecure backings. These concerns led the reviewer to give it a 4-star rating instead of 5. Despite these issues, the reviewer still appreciates the product's value for its price and mentions that the earrings come in attractive packaging consisting of a small black drawstring bag placed inside a small black jewelry box.

By the middle 1950s, he had become one of the best-loved and most successful children's book writers in the world. His books are very popular with young readers. They enjoy the invented words and the pictures of unusual funny animals and plants. In 1954, life magazine published a report about school children who could not read. The report said many children's books were not interesting. Doctor Seuss strongly hoped to help children and decided to write books that were interesting and easy to read. He used words with the same ending sound, like fish and wish. He did not receive training in art. Yet, he drew the pictures for most of his books. In 1957, Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat. He used less than 230 words to write the book and even a six-year-old should be able to read it. It was a fun story and easy to read. Children loved it. Their parents loved it, too. Today it is still one of the stories they like best. The success of The Cat in the Hat made him want to write more books for children. In 1960, he wrote a book using less than fifty words. The book is called Green Eggs and Ham. In 1984, Doctor Seuss won a Pulitzer Prize  . He was honored for the education and enjoyment his books provided American children and their parents. He died at the age of 87, but his influence remains. Millions of his books have been sold worldwide. People say his books helped change the way American children learned to read. Yet, his books are loved by people of all ages. Doctor Seuss once said, \\"I do not write for children. I write for people.\\" Question: People like his books because the books   _  . Options: A: are cheap and easy to get B: were written in different languages C: are easy and interesting to read D: were written with invented words Answer:","output":"People like his books because the books are easy and interesting to read (Option C) and were written with invented words (Option D). According to the article, Doctor Seuss wrote books that were both captivating and easy to read making them particularly appealing to younger readers. This was a deliberate effort on his part to address the issue of children's books not being interesting, as was reported by Life magazine in 1954. His books are also known for the invented words they contain and the depictions of unusual, humorous animals and plants, adding to their unique appeal and distinguishing them from other children's literature. This made his books not only accessible to children but also highly entertaining, helping to change the way American children learned to read. However, despite the popularity of his books among children, Doctor Seuss insisted that he wrote for people of all ages, not just for children. This is reflected in his continued global popularity, years after his death, among readers young and old. His use of recurring end sounds in words (rhyming words), while making the books easier to read for beginners, also added a rhythmic and fun element to the reading experience, making his books more appealing to a broader audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Metallica opted for extensive touring instead of releasing a single or video to promote the album. Metallica spent March to August 1986 touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath, which Osbourne perceived as a mockery toward him. Referring to that occasion, Ulrich stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for its excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname \\"Alcoholica\\". The band members occasionally wore satirical T-shirts reading \\"Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All\\". The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. \\"In the B-markets, people really don't know what we're all about. But after 45 or 50 minutes we can tell we've won them over. And fans who come to hear Ozzy go home liking Metallica.\\" Metallica won over Osbourne's fans and slowly began to establish a mainstream following.The tour, however, was notable for several incidents. Hetfield broke his wrist in a mid-tour skateboarding accident, and his guitar technician John Marshall played rhythm guitar on several dates. The European leg of the Damage, Inc. Tour commenced in September, with Anthrax as the supporting band. After the performance of September 26 in Stockholm, the band's bus rolled over on a stretch of icy road the following morning. Burton was thrown through a window and killed instantly. The driver was charged with manslaughter but was not convicted. The band returned to San Francisco and hired Flotsam and Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted to replace Burton. Many of the songs that appeared on the band's next album, ...And Justice for All, were composed during Burton's career with the band.

Usage: The task requires us to classify a hateful Bengali post into two classes: personal or non-personal depending on the topic. The post provided is in Bengali: \\"বিচারক মেয়েটা কে আমার কাছে নিয়ে আসো,আমি তাকে ধরে সিফাদু থেরাপি দিবো.\\" which translates to \\"Bring the girl to me, I will give her a good therapy by holding her.\\", this sentence is hateful and inappropriate. It clearly meets the criteria of a hateful post as it encourages violence and has a negative intention towards the person. Part #2: Identifying the protected characteristics. Usage: Protected characteristics include race, religion, sex, and sexual orientation. In this example, the post targets gender (sex) as a protected characteristic. The post is specifically demeaning and threatening towards a girl. Part #3: Classifying the post into personal or non-personal. Usage: Personal classification would be if the post is directly targeting an individual or specific person, whereas non-personal classification would be if the post is targeting a general group or an unspecified person with certain characteristics. In this case, the post can be considered \\"personal\\" because it is specifically referring to a girl in a particular situation. However, there is ambiguity as the post does not provide detailed information about the girl, and it could potentially be considered non-personal if it refers to any girl fitting the same situation."},{"instruction":"Question: what do porcupines eat I found the following answer on Google: Porcupines have become a pest in Kenya and are eaten as a delicacy.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Pick from: a). no; b). yes;","output":"b). yes Both questions are inquiring about the same information, which is pricing strategies for software projects. In order to provide a detailed answer, I will discuss various factors to consider and various pricing models that are commonly used. When charging for a software project, it is important to consider the following factors: 1. Project complexity: Software projects can range from simple to highly complex. The more complex the project, the more time and effort it will require from you and your team, and this should be factored into the price. 2. Project scope: Determine the overall scope of the project. This includes the features and requirements of the software, as well as integration with other systems, design, testing, and ongoing support. 3. Time and resources: Consider the time and resources required to complete the project. This includes team members' salaries, overhead costs, and outside expenses such as licenses and software tools. 4. Market pricing: Research what competitors or similar companies are charging for similar projects to make sure you're pricing your services competitively. Once you have considered these factors, you can choose from several common pricing models for software projects: 1. Fixed price: In this straightforward model, you would calculate the total cost of the project (including time, materials, and overhead costs) and then charge the client a set amount. This option can be appealing to clients, as they know upfront what the project will cost, but it can also be risky for developers if the project scope changes or unforeseen issues arise. 2. Time and materials: With this model, you would charge the client for the actual time and resources spent on the project. This allows for more flexibility in the event of changes or unexpected issues, but can be less attractive to clients who are looking for a fixed price. 3. Retainer: In this model, clients pay a set retainer fee to secure your services for a period of time, and the software project is billed against the retainer. This can be a good option for ongoing projects or when the scope of the project is not yet defined. 4. Value-based pricing: Rather than charging based on time or resources, you would charge the client based on the value your software will provide to their business. For example, if your software leads to increased sales or reduced operational costs, you would charge a percentage of that value. This can be an attractive option for clients looking for a return on their investment but can be difficult to quantify and negotiate. 5. Milestone-based pricing: With this model, you would divide the project into different stages or milestones, and the client would pay for each completed milestone. This can be a good option for projects that have clearly defined stages, allowing the client to manage their cash flow and giving the developer regular payments throughout the project. In summary, when charging for a software project, consider factors such as project complexity, scope, time and resources, and market pricing. Investigate the various pricing models available and choose the best one for your particular project and client's needs. It may also be beneficial to offer multiple pricing options to clients to accommodate their concerns and preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, it's important to distinguish between the former town of Watervliet and the city of Watervliet, which still exists today. While the town of Watervliet has been dissolved and no longer possesses the same jurisdiction or land area that it once did, the city of Watervliet stands as a separate, smaller entity within Albany County in New York. The city of Watervliet has evolved from a part of the larger historical town. Over time, the boundaries and jurisdictions of regions change due to various factors, such as population growth, economic interests, and infrastructure developments. In this case, the area that was once the town of Watervliet underwent significant changes as it was divided into different municipalities. Despite these alterations, the legacy and history of the town of Watervliet live on in the names and histories of the areas that it once comprised.

Possible A: toy store, bar, casino, table, family room  Why is \\"family room\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"The \\"family room\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons, primarily because it is a space within a household specifically designed for leisure activities, socializing, and relaxation among family members, including children. In contrast, the other given answers do not typically cater to children engaging in play or match the appropriate context for conducting games. Here's a brief analysis of these options to better understand why \\"family room\\" stands out as the most appropriate answer: 1. Toy store: While a toy store does cater to children and provides a variety of games and playthings, it is essentially a commercial place for purchasing these items, not a location for children to freely play games. 2. Bar: A bar is an establishment primarily intended for adults, focusing on the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. This environment is generally not designed for, nor is it suitable for, children to play games. 3. Casino: Much like a bar, a casino is an adult-centric space built around gambling and betting activities, which are not appropriate or permissible for children. Consequently, a casino would not be a suitable location for children to play games. 4. Table: Although some games, such as board games and card games, can be played on a table, the term \\"table\\" in itself is not a location or a designated place for game-playing.

She was very scared. Aunt Angela was a different temperament she was hypotensive.  But I can use this background: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication.

During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues. They go to Andrei's house where they find him already dead. After the chase, Dorganosov demands the rest of his payment from his contractor, who is revealed to be Anatoly Grishin. While they are arguing, Komarov himself arrives and orders Grishin to kill Dorganosov.

She has won four World Cup overall championships--one of only two female skiers to do so, along with Annemarie Moser-Proll--with three consecutive titles in 2008, 2009, and 2010, plus another in 2012. Vonn won the gold medal in downhill at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the first ever in the event for an American woman. She has also won a record 8 World Cup season titles in the downhill discipline (2008-2013, 2015, 2016), 5 titles in super-G (2009-2012, 2015), and 3 consecutive titles in the combined (2010-2012). In her Olympic debut at the 2002 Winter Olympics at age 17, Vonn raced in both slalom and combined in Salt Lake City, with her best result coming with sixth in combined. On March 4, 2003, she earned a silver medal in downhill in the Junior World Championship at Puy Saint-Vincent, France.  Vonn credits a change in her attitude toward training to a bike ride with fellow ski racer Julia Mancuso and Mancuso's father Ciro when Vonn visited them at their home in Lake Tahoe, California. With little biking experience, she quickly found herself miles behind Julia and Ciro. Alone and embarrassed, she realized she needed drastic revision of her training regimen and her attitude toward training if she was going to be successful.  On March 24, 2004, Vonn was the downhill silver medalist at the U.S. Alpine Championships at Mt. Alyeska Resort, Girdwood, Alaska. Earlier that year 2004, Vonn climbed onto the World Cup podium for the first time with a third-place finish in downhill in January 2004 at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Her maiden victory in that specialty came at Lake Louise, Alberta, in December 2004. She captured five more World Cup podiums over the next two months.  In 2005, she competed in four races at her first World Championships held in Bormio, Italy, pulling in fourth-place finishes in both the downhill and the combined. She was ninth in super-G, but failed to finish the giant slalom. She cited the unexpected appearance of her father, with whom she has a strained relationship, for rattling her before the event.

It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.  - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.  - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.  - Raymond Towers \`\` Ray '' Holmes ( 20 August 1914 -- 27 June 2005 ) was a British fighter pilot who was feted by the press as a war hero who saved Buckingham Palace from being severely damaged by German bombing during the Battle of Britain .

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question 1: What are some examples of a catalyst in a chemical reaction? Question 2: What are the catalysts used in chemical reactions of alkenes? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1 and Question 2 are related but not asking the same thing. Question 1 is a general inquiry about examples of catalysts in chemical reactions, while Question 2 is specifically asking about catalysts used in chemical reactions involving alkenes. I will provide long and detailed answers to both questions below. Question 1: What are some examples of a catalyst in a chemical reaction? A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed or changed in the process. Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy needed for a reaction, allowing it to proceed more rapidly. There are many examples of catalysts in various chemical reactions, and they can be classified as heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts, depending on their phase compared to the reactants' phase. Here are some examples: 1. Enzymes: Enzymes are biological catalysts that play a crucial role in living organisms. They are typically proteins that speed up biochemical reactions by binding to specific molecules called substrates. For example, the enzyme amylase catalyzes the breakdown of starch into glucose. 2. Hydrogenation catalysts: In the hydrogenation process, hydrogen gas is added to an unsaturated compound, resulting in a saturated compound. A common example is the hydrogenation of vegetable oils to produce solid margarine. This reaction typically uses a metal catalyst such as nickel, platinum, or palladium. 3. Haber process catalyst: The Haber process is used to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. This reaction is carried out at high temperatures and pressures, using an iron-based catalyst. The catalyst increases the rate of conversion, making ammonia production more efficient. 4. Zeolites: Zeolites are porous materials with a high surface area that can act as catalysts in various reactions. They are widely used in the petrochemical industry for processes such as cracking, which involves breaking down large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller, more useful molecules. Zeolites can be tailored to have specific pore sizes and shapes, which allows them to selectively catalyze specific reactions. 5. Acid catalysts: Certain reactions require an acidic environment to proceed. Examples of acid catalysts include sulfuric acid in the synthesis of esters and phosphoric acid in the dehydration of alcohols to form alkenes. Question 2: What are the catalysts used in chemical reactions of alkenes? Alkenes are hydrocarbons containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond. These unsaturated hydrocarbons can undergo various chemical reactions, and specific catalysts are often employed to facilitate these processes. Some examples of catalysts used in alkene reactions include: 1. Metal catalysts: The hydrogenation of alkenes, a process wherein hydrogen is added across the carbon-carbon double bond, is often catalyzed by metals such as palladium, platinum, or nickel. 2. Acid catalysts: The addition of water to an alkene (hydration) is typically performed using an acid catalyst like concentrated sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid. 3. Peroxy acids: In the epoxidation of alkenes, a reaction that involves the conversion of carbon-carbon double bonds to epoxides (three-membered cyclic ethers), peroxy acids like meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) or peracetic acid can be used as catalysts. 4. Lewis acids: Reactions like halogenation (the addition of a halogen, such as chlorine or bromine, across the carbon-carbon double bond), and the addition of hydrogen halides (like HCl or HBr) to alkenes are facilitated by Lewis acids, such as aluminum chloride or boron trifluoride (BF3), which coordinate to the reactants and activate them for reaction. In conclusion, while Question 1 and Question 2 are related, they are not asking the same thing. Question 1 requests general examples of catalysts in chemical reactions, whereas Question 2 specifically targets catalysts used in reactions involving alkenes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is there any value for Re.1 left in India? Which cars have the best re-sale value in India? Do those questions have the same meaning? Available choices:  A). no  B). yes","output":"A). No The two questions do not have the same meaning. Let me elaborate on each of them. 1. Is there any value for Re.1 left in India? This question is asking if the Indian Rupee (INR) with a 1 rupee denomination still holds any value or significance in the Indian economy. Though the value of 1 rupee has indeed diminished due to inflation, it still holds value and is in circulation in the form of coins. The 1 rupee coin is still being used for smaller transactions and as change for other denominations. However, when comparing it to higher denomination notes or coins, the purchasing power of 1 rupee is quite limited. 2. Which cars have the best re-sale value in India? This question is asking about the automobile scenario in India, specifically, the cars that have a good resale or residual value after a few years of ownership. Resale value is the amount for which a used car can be sold after a certain period, which depends on factors like brand reputation, condition of the car, demand for that specific model, and other relevant factors. In India, some of the cars with the best resale values are: a) Maruti Suzuki Swift and Swift Dzire: These models are known for their reliability and fuel efficiency, making them popular choices for city driving. As a result, they typically hold their value well in the used car market. b) Toyota Innova: The Toyota Innova is a popular MPV in India due to its durability, low-maintenance costs, and spacious interiors. It is also used extensively by commercial operators like taxi fleet owners, which speaks to its reliability and overall utility. Hence, it has a good resale value. c) Honda City: Honda City has been a popular sedan in the Indian automobile market, mainly due to its impressive fuel efficiency, reliable engine, and comfortable interiors. The long-standing reputation of Honda in the market adds to the resale value of the City. d) Hyundai i10 and i20: The Hyundai i10 and i20 are known for their reliability, stylish design, and fuel efficiency. These models have proven to be popular choices among Indian car buyers, and their demand in the used car market contributes to their high resale value. In summary, these two questions have different meanings. While the first question deals with the value of the 1 rupee denomination in the Indian economy, the second question pertains to cars that have a high resale value in the Indian automobile market."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

On 13 February 2013 the LHC's first run officially ended, and it was shut down for planned upgrades. 'Test' collisions restarted in the upgraded collider on 5 April 2015, reaching 6.5 TeV per beam on 20 May 2015 (13 TeV total, the current world record).

Because of the unit conventions then in use, the gravitational constant does not appear explicitly in Cavendish's work. Instead, the result was originally expressed as the specific gravity of the Earth, or equivalently the mass of the Earth. His experiment gave the first accurate values for these geophysical constants. The experiment was devised sometime before 1783 by geologist John Michell, who constructed a torsion balance apparatus for it. However, Michell died in 1793 without completing the work. After his death the apparatus passed to Francis John Hyde Wollaston and then to Henry Cavendish, who rebuilt the apparatus but kept close to Michell's original plan.

Article: A week after scoring a five-state rout against Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton scored another big win over the Vermont senator by crushing him in Arizona.      But Sanders easily dispatched Clinton in Utah and Idaho, the other two Western states that voted Tuesday. Both states held caucuses, a format that has favored Sanders.      Story Continued Below      Arizona, though, was the biggest prize of the night, with 85 proportionally allocated delegates at stake. With more than 96 percent of precincts counted in the state as of late Wednesday morning, Clinton was ahead 58 percent to 40 percent.      Sanders was looking to recapture the burst of momentum he enjoyed after his surprise win in Michigan on March 8. But he entered the day trailing Clinton by double digits in Arizona.      Shortly after The AP and networks called Arizona for Clinton, Sanders reminded supporters in San Diego just how far he had come in less than a year, while predicting a better finish in Utah and Idaho.      “When we began this campaign, we were considered a fringe candidacy,\\" Sanders said. \\"Well, 10 months later we have now won 10 primaries and caucuses and unless I’m very mistaken, we’re gonna win a couple more tonight.\\"      Before launching into a version of his stump speech, the Vermont senator also suggested that his campaign played a role in bringing out voters to the polls, regardless of whether they voted for him.      Delegates Remaining: 56 Delegates 2,814 1,893 56 0 2,382 Delegates Needed for Nomination      \\"When we began this campaign, we talked about the need for millions of people to become involved in the political process,\\" he said. \\"Tonight in Utah, tonight in Idaho and tonight in Arizona there are record-breaking turnouts in terms of voters.\\"      Sanders wrapped his speech by asking supporters to bring their friends and family out to vote in California's June 7 primary, the largest delegate prize in the Democratic primary campaign. \\"If there is a large voter turnout, we will win here in California,\\" he said, echoing a common refrain.      He then issued a more explicitly triumphant statement once the later outcomes were clear. “I am enormously grateful to the people of Utah and Idaho for the tremendous voter turnouts that gave us victories with extremely large margins,\\" Sanders said. \\"These decisive victories in Idaho and Utah give me confidence that we will continue to win major victories in the coming contests.”      Clinton, speaking to supporters in Seattle, said she was \\"proud\\" to have won Arizona before turning her focus to the Republican race.      The terrorist attacks in Brussels on Tuesday, she said, underscored the importance and gravity of the presidential election. \\"The last thing we need, my friends, are leaders who incite more fear,\\" she continued.      “We can’t throw out everything we know about what works and what doesn’t and start torturing people,\\" she remarked, alluding to Ted Cruz's call for more stringent policing of Muslim communities and Donald Trump's insistence that torture could have prevented the attacks in the European capital that killed 34 (including three suicide bombers) and wounded hundreds.      \\"What Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and others are suggesting, it’s not only wrong, it’s dangerous. It will not keep us safe. This is a time for America to lead, not to cower. And we will lead, and we will defeat terrorists that threaten our friends and allies,\\" she said.      Sanders campaigned at the U.S.-Mexico border on Saturday, appearing with Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.). Clinton had the support of Arizona Democratic Reps. Ann Kirkpatrick and Ruben Gallego.      Unlike the other four candidates left running in either major party, Sanders opted to campaign in Idaho, Utah and Arizona on Monday rather than address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference in Washington, D.C. He delivered a foreign policy speech in Salt Lake City in which he called for a restart of the Middle East peace process.      Following Tuesday's primaries, Clinton has 1,214 pledged delegates, while Sanders has 911. Counting pledged superdelegates, Clinton has 1,681 and Sanders 927, according to The AP.      The Democratic race next moves to the Saturday caucuses in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington state, where Sanders is likely to do well.      \\"Our campaign will continue to compete in every state and will work to amass as many pledged delegates as possible everywhere,\\" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in a memo after Clinton's March 15 sweep. \\"In fact, we already have staff on the ground in every state that votes through the end of April. But our pledged delegate lead is so significant that even a string of victories by Sen. Sanders over the next few weeks would have little impact on Sec. Clinton’s position in the race.\\"      Clinton's allies in Congress are calling on Sanders to wind down his campaign or, short of that, stop attacking the former secretary of state directly. A prolonged primary battle, they say, will only aid Trump in a potential general election matchup. ||||| Hillary Clintonis projected to be the winner of the Arizona Democratic primary, giving her a victory over presidential rival Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) SandersSanders poised to announce presidential campaign: report On The Money: Trump agrees to end shutdown without wall funding | Senate quickly clears short-term funding measure | House to vote tonight | Federal workers could get back pay within days | Dems take victory lap Shutdown ends without funding for Trump’s border wall MORE in the most delegate-rich of Tuesday night’s contests.

Meanwhile, Clinton is focused on uniting the Democratic party behind her in order to square off against Republican nominee Donald Trump. |||||Summary:","output":"In the latest round of democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton scored a win over Bernie Sanders in Arizona, taking 41 of the 85 delegates.

When we moved in a month ago, Mary wanted to get a dog to keep out burglars. However, we finally decided that it would be cheaper to put an iron grille in front of the door and get a burglar alarm. Last week, I went to a shop and bought an alarm for just over PS200. It consists of a control unit with three smaller units. I put the control unit in the lounge and put the other units in place by the front door, back door and lounge windows. That night I soon fell asleep because I was confident that no one could get into our house undetected. At about 1:50 a.m. I woke up suddenly and heard the siren. It was like an ambulance driving right through our bedroom. I couldn't leave the siren on all night. I went downstairs in the dark. When I reached the bottom of the stairs, I switched on the light and looked around. Oh my gosh. The back door was unlocked. I rushed to lock it and it was just at that exact moment that the 'burglar' disappeared behind a curtain. Guess what? It was an ordinary house lizard .Apparently the alarm system had been made for American or European homes in which lizards are never seen. I switched the alarm off and sat down to watch.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.

After a car crash, some friends are possibly dead, but keeps on living their previous lives, while all sorts of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys are after them, but we never really find out who they are (possibly they were the ones in the other car, but we certainly don't hear anything about why they are after them). The final scenes especially seem filmically ambitious, but I can't get anything coherent out of it. The opening scene, where the bad guys (who wear some strange masks) cut a blond girl's wrist and gather up some of her blood is never explained or followed up on. Unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons who're trying to pull Cassie (Sagemiller) back from the dead... but no, that doesn't seem to work. The bad guys are just bad guys; they really just mess up a story that might otherwise have been interesting.

Firstly, the reviewer expresses disappointment over Eliza Dushku's character and role size. The reviewer also mentions that they find the story nonsensical, calling out a specific subplot for being unexplained and seemingly irrelevant. Additionally, the reviewer criticizes the film's incorporation of antagonists as unnecessary and disruptive.  However, the reviewer does highlight a few positive points such as the physical attractiveness of the main actress, Melissa Sagemiller, as well as her acting talent. Regardless, these positive reviews are overwhelmed by the negative aspects discussed throughout the review.  Finally, the reviewer rates the movie 3 out of 10, which is generally considered as a poor score, indicating dissatisfaction with the film.

Ships sometimes sink  far away from land. When this happens, the sailors  have to get into small boats. If another ship does not come and help them and they do not have enough food or water, they will die. Most people believe we must not drink sea water. They believe that if we do, we shall be very ill because of all the salt in the water. A doctor called Alain Bombard did not believe this. He thought that people could stay alive by drinking sea water and eating small fish, animals and plants from the sea. On 19 October 1953, he set out in a small boat to cross the Atlantic Ocean . He did not take any food or water with him. Every day Dr. Bombard drank just a little sea water. He also caught fish and they had water in them. He drank this water. He could not cook the fish, so he ate them as they were. He took small plants from the sea, which gave him more food.

A disc jockey, often abbreviated as DJ, is a person who plays existing recorded music for a live audience. Most common types of DJs include radio DJ, club DJ who performs at a nightclub or music festival, and turntablist who uses record players, usually turntables, to manipulate sounds on phonograph records. Originally, the \\"disc\\" in \\"disc jockey\\" referred to gramophone records, but now \\"DJ\\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files on a CDJ or laptop. The title \\"DJ\\" is commonly used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted pseudonyms or stage names. Several techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the cueing, equalization and audio mixing of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.  Club DJ turntable techniques include beatmatching, phrasing and slip-cueing to preserve energy on a dance floor. Turntablism embodies the art of cutting, beat juggling, scratching, needle drops, phase shifting, back spinning and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of samples in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a musical instrument rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use harmonic mixing to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys.  Recent advances in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include phrasing and beatmatching, which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic synchronization of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled \\"sync\\". Most DJ mixers now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in beats per minute (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources.  In the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques.","output":"This text is about a disc jockey, commonly referred to as a DJ.

Please answer the following question: Background: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future.  Paragraph: Rob always confuses the terms climate and weather. He found it's better to compare them if he needs to learn more about their characteristics. To make things easier, he labeled the weather of his city as char A. Then he labeled the climate of this city as char B. Once finished with learning their characteristics, Rob focused on climate change issues. For that, he labeled the climate of present time as char C and climate just before industrial revolution as char D.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Does char A represent longer or shorter time period than char B? A:","output":"Char A represents a shorter time period than char B. In the paragraph, char A is used to represent the weather of Rob's city, while char B represents its climate. Weather is a temporary condition and can change quickly, while climate is the long-term average of weather patterns in a particular location. Since weather conditions are temporary and ever-changing, they cover a shorter time period compared to climate, which covers a longer time period, encompassing the overall trends and variations in weather experienced in a location."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both exceptionally bright, they would often dream of a life out of the small town atmosphere, fantasizing a life in the vibrant, bustling city of Chicago. Our film opens, touching on their monotonous small town life and modest parental home. Their supportive yet overbearing parents are introduced who, due to a fear of loneliness, subtly undermine their children's proposed steps toward independence. Daniel, a talented computer programmer, and Jane, an ambitious business student, finally realize the need to break free when their parents' subtle undermining becomes direct opposition to their dreams. Inspired by a shared desire for autonomy, they decide to save their earnings to purchase a flat in the city, their sanctuary in the hustle of life. At first, Daniel and Jane face numerous challenges. Balancing full-time jobs, saving money, and, most challenging, keeping their plans a secret from their parents. Some comedic relief ensues as they narrowly dodge their parents' suspicions, toss and turn with financial dilemmas, and misunderstanding about their shared space in their future flat. In the climax of the movie, their parents accidentally stumble upon Daniel and Jane's secret savings stash. The confrontation pits the twins' dreams up against their parents' understanding of a successful life. With heated argument, they finally get their parents to see their perspectives, accomplishments, and grownup decisions. Their parents allow them to move out, not quite supportive but accepting their children's pursuit of independence. The movie concludes with Daniel and Jane moving into their city flat, finding their freedom in the midst of the echoing city noises.

Steven Frederic Seagal was born in Lansing, Michigan on April 10, 1952, the son of medical technician Patricia (1930-2003) and high school math teacher Samuel Seagal (1928-1991). His mother was of Dutch, English, and German ancestry, while his paternal grandparents were Russian Jews who immigrated to the U.S. He also has Irish and Mongolian heritage. When Seagal was five years old, his parents relocated to Fullerton, California. Seagal moved to Japan at some point between 1971 and 1973. The date of his journey has become a point of contention due to Seagal's statement that he studied with Morihei Uyeshiba, the founder of aikido, who died in 1969. Terry Dobson, a fifth-degree black belt who studied with the master from 1961 to 1969, dismissed this claim, saying, \\"That story is bull. [Back then] I never heard of Steven Seagal.\\" By 1974 Seagal had returned California. That year he met Miyako Fujitani, a second-degree black belt and daughter of an Osaka aikido master who had come to Los Angeles to teach aikido. When Miyako returned to Osaka, Seagal went with her. The following year they married and had a son, Kentaro, and a daughter, Ayako. He taught at the school owned by Miyako's family (though he is often stated to have been the first non-Asian to open a dojo in Japan). As of 1990, Miyako and her brother still taught there, and her mother was the chairwoman.  Seagal initially returned to Taos, New Mexico, with his student (and later film stuntman) Craig Dunn, where they opened a dojo, although Seagal spent much of his time pursuing other ventures. After another period in Japan, Seagal returned to the U.S. in 1983 with senior student Haruo Matsuoka. They opened an aikido dojo, initially in North Hollywood, California, but later moved it to the city of West Hollywood. Seagal left Matsuoka in charge of the dojo, which he ran until the two parted ways in 1997.  Seagal helped train Brazilian Mixed Martial Artist Lyoto Machida, who credited Seagal for helping him perfect the front kick that he used to knock out Randy Couture at UFC 129 in May 2011.

House lawmakers spar on contraceptives rule Catholics, contraceptives and Capitol Hill.

At a GOP press conference Thursday, Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C., a Catholic herself, took a personal approach in explaining her opposition. \\"This is about religious freedom,\\" said Ellmers. \\"When my father, my father is deceased, but when I was a child he sat me down and he looked me in the eye and he said, 'Renee, some day you will have to fight for your religion.'

Those who knew Nidal Malik Hasan before he was a major in the Army -- and the suspect in last week's mass killing at Fort Hood -- say he was long known for militant Islamist views. Doctors who crossed paths with Hasan in medical programs paint a picture of a subpar student who wore his religious views on his sleeve. Several doctors who knew Hasan spoke to CNN, but only on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation of the shooting, which left 12 soldiers and one civilian dead and dozens of other people wounded. Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who faces 13 counts of premeditated murder, \\"was clearly espousing Islamist ideology\\" during his time as a medical student at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, one of his former classmates told CNN. Hasan's family has revealed little about him, saying in media interviews that Hasan was a \\"good American\\" and a lifelong Muslim who complained he was harassed in the Army because of his religion. His former classmates describe a much more militant Hasan. His presentations for school were often laced with extremist Muslim views, one source said. \\"Is your allegiance to Sharia law or the United States?\\" students once challenged Hasan, the source said. \\"Sharia law,\\" Hasan responded, according to the source. The incident was corroborated by another doctor who was present. The source recalled another instance in which Hasan was asked if the U.S. Constitution was a brilliant document. Hasan replied, \\"No, not particularly,\\" according to the source. The former classmate told CNN that he voiced concerns about Hasan to supervisors at the school. A second former medical school colleague of Hasan said several people raised concerns about Hasan's overall competence. Even though Hasan earned his medical degree and residency, some of his fellow students believed Hasan \\"didn't have the intellect\\" to be in the program and was not academically rigorous in his coursework. Hasan \\"was not fit to be in the military, let alone in the mental health profession,\\" this classmate told CNN. \\"No one in class would ever have referred a patient to him or trusted him with anything.\\" The first classmate echoed this sentiment. Hasan was \\"coddled, accommodated and pushed through that masters of public health despite substandard performance,\\" the classmate said. He was \\"put in the fellowship program because they didn't know what to do with him.\\" The second classmate said he witnessed at least two of Hasan's PowerPoint discussions that included what he described as extremist views. In these presentations, which were supposed to be about health, Hasan justified suicide bombings and spoke about the persecution of Muslims in the Middle East, in the United States and in the U.S. military, the source said. Some in the crowd rolled their eyes or muttered under their breath, he said, and others were clearly uncomfortable. Those in the audience, which included program supervisors, did not loudly object to Hasan's presentations, but did complain to their higher-ups afterward. The supervisors expressed \\"appreciation, understanding and agreement\\" that the complaints would be discussed, but it was unclear what action, if any, came, the source said. When the classmate challenged Hasan personally, Hasan dodged the questions, the source said. Despite the controversy that his schoolwork created, classmates did not view Hasan as mentally unstable or psychotic, the source said. Questions remain over how much Hasan's behavior and actions in school were reflected in his personnel files. Col. Kimberly Kesling, deputy commander of Clinical Services for Darnell Medical Center at Fort Hood and Hasan's supervisor at the post, told reporters last week that Hasan was doing a good job in Texas. \\"As a supervisor, I am aware of the job performance of people coming into our organization, that is part of our credentialing process,\\" Kesling said. \\"The types of things that were reported to me via his evaluation report were things that concerned me, but did not raise red flags toward this [the shootings] in any way, shape, or form.\\" \\"His evaluation reports said that he had some difficulties in his residency, fitting into his residency, and we worked very hard to integrate him into our practice and into our organization, and he adapted very well, was doing a really good job for us,\\" she said. Prompted by reports of former classmates, however, Army investigators would like to speak with people who have had contact with Hasan and who may have information about his activities and behavior, Maj. Gen Kevin Bergner, head of U.S. Army public affairs, said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates weighed in on the information surfacing about Hasan. \\"I deplore the leaks that have taken place,\\" he said on a trip to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. People are talking about \\"what they know, which is one small piece of the puzzle.\\" \\"They don't know whether or not what they're leaking might jeopardize a potential criminal investigation and trial,\\" he said. \\"People who have a piece of this, frankly, ought to keep quiet and let the authorities go forward on this in an organized and comprehensive way,\\" Gates said. Hasan came under investigation last year when his contacts with radical imam Anwar al-Awlaki were intercepted by terrorism investigators monitoring the cleric's communications, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. An employee of the Defense Department's Criminal Investigative Services, assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force, decided to drop the investigation after reviewing the intercepted communications and Hasan's personnel files. Hasan remained hospitalized Thursday from gunshot wounds he received from two police officers who responded to last week's shooting. CNN's Brian Todd and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.

Summarize this article: The 13-year-old boy who was apparently bitten by a shark while \\"free-diving\\" on Sept. 29, 2018, in Encinitas, Calif. The family released a photo of the boy but not his name. (Photo: Family photo via Rady Children's HospitalñSan Diego)      A kayaker who helped rescue a teen attacked by a shark off a California beach says the shark stalked the kayak during the life-and-death race to shore.      The 13-year-old boy was \\"free diving\\" – without scuba gear – when he was attacked Saturday morning off Beacon's Beach in Encinitas, 25 miles north of San Diego. The youth was airlifted to a local hospital and his condition was stabilized, Encinitas Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said.      Chad Hammel said he was lobster hunting with two friends when he heard shouts. Hammel thought someone was excited because they had caught \\"some big bugs\\" on the first day of the lobster-diving season.      \\"But it kept going, and I realized he was yelling, 'I got bit!'\\" Hammel told OnScene TV.      More: Shark attack injures boy, 13, at Southern California beach      More: Suspected shark attack kills man in his 20s near Cape Cod, police say      Hammel said he and his friends swam over with the kayak and pulled the boy, 13, inside.      \\"His whole clavicle was ripped open,\\" Hammel said. \\"You could see the ball-and-socket joint, everything.\\"      Hammel said his friends were off-duty first responders and worked to calm the boy and stanch the bleeding as they brought the kayak to shore.      \\"We started heading in, and the shark was behind the kayak; he didn't want to give up yet,\\" Hammel said, adding that the kayak was \\"full of blood.\\"      The youth was conscious when he was airlifted to Rady Children’s Hospital-San Diego. Witnesses said the attack happened in about 9 feet of water, more than 100 yards from shore, Giles said. Some estimated the shark at 11 feet long.      The first day of lobster-diving season draws big crowds, and dozens of people were on the beach and in the water when the attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m.      Giles said investigators will attempt to determine the species of shark that attacked the boy. A shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, he said. In April 2017, a woman was badly injured by a shark off of San Onofre Beach, about 30 miles north of Encinitas.      Two weeks ago a Brazilian tourist was killed by a shark while boogie boarding off of Cape Cod in Massachusetts.      Giles said Beacon's and other nearby beaches would be closed until Monday morning, and a surf contest scheduled for Saturday was canceled.      Encinitas resident Leslie King surfs and hunts lobsters in the waters off Beacon's Beach. She said she won't be deterred by the attack.      \\"Surfers and divers know the risks,\\" she said. \\"I've never heard of any surfer or diver say they are going to stop after a shark attack – if it doesn't involve them.\\"      Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2NUKTcY ||||| LOS ANGELES (AP) — A 13-year-old boy skin diving for lobsters was attacked by a shark Saturday along the Southern California coast but was quickly pulled from the water by other divers and flown to a trauma center, authorities said.      The boy was in critical but stable condition more than nine hours later at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego, spokesman Carlos Delgado said.      The boy underwent surgery but no other information about him, including his name, was released.      The boy suffered traumatic upper torso injuries, city Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles told reporters earlier at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas, about 27 miles (43 kilometers) north of downtown San Diego.      The attack occurred just before 7 a.m., during the opening hour of California's popular spiny lobster season.      The boy was attacked in about 9 feet (2.7 meters) of water approximately 150 yards (137 meters) offshore. He was brought to shore by three bystanders, Giles said.      Emergency responders arrived, and the boy was flown by helicopter to the trauma center.      \\"He was conscious, he was above water, and the bystanders were able to get him up on the beach ... and he was talking all the way to when he was being transported,\\" the captain said.      The three rescuers were identified only as an off-duty police officer from nearby Oceanside, an off-duty state lifeguard and a friend who were also diving for lobsters. Giles said the trio provided a \\"tremendous amount of aid to that young man.\\"      Witnesses estimated the shark was about 11 feet (3.3 meters) long, but the type was not known, he said.      Lifeguards immediately turned to clearing people out of the water. Giles noted there were multiple other divers in the area.      The waters off about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) of beach were ordered closed for 48 hours, and a nearby surfing competition was canceled before it got underway.      Lifeguards were being brought in from various agencies while a San Diego County sheriff's helicopter scouted from the air. In the immediate hours after the attack, there was no sign of shark activity or signs of typical prey such as seals, dolphins and porpoises, although a seal was reported in the area earlier, Giles said.      \\"This is a nonfatal incident; we don't want anybody else getting injured,\\" he said.      The most recent fatal shark attack in the area was in 2008 when a swimmer was killed at Solana Beach. A more recent attack along the Camp Pendleton coast of north San Diego County was not fatal.      Earlier this month, a man died after being bitten by a shark off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. ||||| Summary:","output":"A 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark while free-diving off Beacon's Beach in Encinitas, California.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The first and second sentences present contradictory statements, which means that the truth of one implies the falsity of the other. We need to analyze each sentence to understand the implications. Sentence 1: \\"Uh, on my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases.\\" This sentence indicates that there have been a significant number of Workmen's Compensation cases at the speaker's workplace. Workmen's Compensation cases are usually associated with injuries and illnesses incurred by employees during the course of their work. The presence of multiple cases suggests that there might be some safety concerns or hazardous working conditions in this particular workplace. Sentence 2: \\"There was never a Workmen's Comp case at my job.\\" In this statement, the speaker claims that there have never been any Workmen's Compensation cases in their workplace – essentially stating that the workplace has had no issues related to work-related injuries or illnesses. Given the contradictory nature of these two sentences, it is impossible for both to be true at the same time. If the first sentence is true (that there indeed were many Workmen's Comp cases at the workplace), then the second sentence must necessarily be false, as a significant number of cases negates the claim that there were none. On the other hand, if the second sentence is true (there were never any Workmen's Comp cases), then the first sentence is false, as it wrongly states that the workplace had many cases. In conclusion, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is false. They cannot both be true simultaneously due to their contradictory nature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Though researchers generally believe that sexual orientation is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, with biological factors involving a complex interplay of genetic factors and the early uterine environment, they favor biological models for the cause. They believe that sexual orientation is not a choice, and some of them believe that it is established at conception. That is, individuals do not choose to be homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, or asexual. While current scientific investigation usually seeks to find biological explanations for the adoption of a particular sexual orientation, there are yet no replicated scientific studies supporting any specific biological etiology for sexual orientation.

Answer:","output":"The question you asked is quite broad as there have been numerous individuals who have held the office of Chief Minister in different countries and states. Chief Minister is the executive head of government in a state or territory. For example, in India, each state has its own Chief Minister, while in the United Kingdom, First Ministers are the head of government in their respective devolved administrations, such as Scotland and Wales. To provide you with a comprehensive answer, I will mention a few notable Chief Ministers from various regions. 1. India: India has 28 states and 8 Union Territories, each with its own Chief Minister, making it impossible to list all of them here. However, a few notable individuals include: - Jawaharlal Nehru: The first Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh (1946–50), who later became the first Prime Minister of India. - Jyoti Basu: The longest-serving Chief Minister in India, who held the position for West Bengal from 1977 to 2000. - Jayalalithaa: A prominent female politician who served as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for several non-consecutive terms between 1991 and 2016. 2. United Kingdom: In the United Kingdom, the First Ministers are the leaders of their respective devolved administrations, and a few notable individuals include: - Nicola Sturgeon: The current First Minister of Scotland, serving since 2014. - Mark Drakeford: The current First Minister of Wales, in office since 2018. - Arlene Foster: The former First Minister of Northern Ireland, who held the position from 2016 to 2021. 3. Australia: In Australia, each state has a Premier who acts as the Chief Minister. A few noteworthy examples are: - Daniel Andrews: The current Premier of Victoria, serving since 2014. - Gladys Berejiklian: The former Premier of New South Wales, who held the position from 2017 to 2021. - Annastacia Palaszczuk: The current Premier of Queensland, in office since 2015. 4. Canada: In Canada, the term \\"Premier\\" is used instead of \\"Chief Minister\\" for the head of government in each province or territory. A few notable Premiers include: - John Horgan: The current Premier of British Columbia, serving since 2017. - François Legault: The current Premier of Quebec, in office since 2018. - Doug Ford: The current Premier of Ontario, in office since 2018. These are just a few examples of Chief Ministers, First Ministers, or Premiers from different regions around the world.

Answer:","output":"William II, Margrave of Meissen, also known as Wilhelm the Rich, was born on 23 April 1371. He was the second son of Margrave Frederick \\"the Strict\\" of Meissen and Catherine of Henneberg. His mother, Catherine of Henneberg, was born in approximately 1334 and died on 15 July 1397. She was a member of the House of Henneberg, a German noble family whose rule extended across parts of Thuringia, Franconia, Hesse, and today's Bavaria. Catherine was the daughter of Count Heinrich II of Henneberg and his wife, Jutta of Brandenburg-Salzwedel. His father, Frederick \\"the Strict\\" of Meissen, was born on 30 November 1332 and died on 21 May 1381. He was a prominent member of the House of Wettin and held the title of Margrave of Meissen, which was a noble rank equivalent to a medieval marquess or a modern ranking of a crown prince. Regarding his spouse, it is said that William II might have been married to Amelia of Mazovia, a Polish noblewoman. However, this information is debated, and according to historian Karlheinz Blaschke, it is likely that he remained unmarried throughout his life. William II, along with his brothers Frederick I, the Elector of Saxony, and George, jointly inherited the Osterland and Landsberg under the division of Chemnitz in 1382. When Margrave William I \\"the One-eyed\\" died in 1407, William II and his brother Frederick I also inherited part of Meissen. They later agreed to a fresh division of the Meissen territory in the 1410 Treaty of Naumburg and further divided the Osterland in 1411. William II fought alongside his brother Frederick in the Hussite War in Bohemia. The Hussite War was a series of conflicts between the Catholic Church and the followers of the religious reformer Jan Hus, who were later known as Hussites. William II died on 13 March 1425. Unfortunately, the exact cause of his death remains unknown, but his contributions to the House of Wettin and the territories he governed are significant in the history of the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vedder said, \\"Making No Code was all about gaining perspective.\\" Released in 1996, No Code was seen as a deliberate break from the band's sound since Ten, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that \\"No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.\\" The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination, with Ament stating, \\"In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up.\\" Although the album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the singles \\"Who You Are\\" (sample ), \\"Hail, Hail\\", and \\"Off He Goes\\". As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A European tour took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was \\"a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time\\" and that \\"it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band.\\" Following the short tour for No Code, the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The sessions for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort between all members of the group, with Ament stating that \\"everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band.\\" On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has \\"turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations.

The most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. gale force), the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI), and the radius of vanishing wind. An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to 1×10−5 s−1.On Earth, tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes, from 100–2,000 kilometres (62–1,243 mi) as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin. If the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude (222 km (138 mi)), then the cyclone is \\"very small\\" or a \\"midget\\". A radius of 3–6 latitude degrees (333–670 km (207–416 mi)) is considered \\"average sized\\". \\"Very large\\" tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8 degrees (888 km (552 mi)). Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed), radius of maximum wind, latitude, and maximum potential intensity.Size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.The upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere, which at low latitudes is 15,000–18,000 metres (50,000–60,000 ft).

Murray Newton Rothbard (; March 2, 1926 - January 7, 1995) was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School, a historian, and a political theorist whose writings and personal influence played a seminal role in the development of modern right-libertarianism. Rothbard was the founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism, a staunch advocate of historical revisionism, and a central figure in the twentieth-century American libertarian movement. In 1953, in New York City, he married JoAnn Schumacher (1928-1999), whom he called Joey. JoAnn was his editor and a close adviser, as well as hostess of his \\"Rothbard Salon\\". They enjoyed a loving marriage, and Rothbard often called her \\"the indispensable framework\\" behind his life and achievements. According to Joey, patronage from the Volker Fund allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first fifteen years of their marriage. The Fund collapsed in 1962, leading Rothbard to seek employment from various New York academic institutions. He was offered a part-time position teaching economics to the engineering students of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1966, at age 40. This institution had no economics department or economics majors, and Rothbard derided its social science department as \\"Marxist.\\" However, Justin Raimondo writes that Rothbard liked his role with Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics.  Rothbard continued in this role for twenty years, until 1986. Then 60 years old, Rothbard left Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute for the Lee Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he held the title of S.J. Hall Distinguished Professor of Economics, an endowed chair paid for by a libertarian businessman. According to Rothbard's friend, colleague and fellow Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Rothbard led a \\"fringe existence\\" in academia, but was able to attract a large number of \\"students and disciples\\" through his writings, thereby becoming \\"the creator and one of the principal agents of the contemporary libertarian movement.\\" Rothbard maintained his position at UNLV from 1986 until his death. Rothbard founded the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1976 and the Journal of Libertarian Studies in 1977. In 1982, he co-founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama, and was vice president of academic affairs until 1995. The Institute's Review of Austrian Economics, a heterodox economics journal later renamed the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, was also founded by Rothbard in 1987.  After Rothbard's death, Joey reflected on Rothbard's happiness and bright spirit. \\"...he managed to make a living for 40 years without having to get up before noon. This was important to him.\\" She recalled how Rothbard would begin every day with a phone conversation with his colleague Llewellyn Rockwell. \\"Gales of laughter would shake the house or apartment, as they checked in with each other. Murray thought it was the best possible way to start a day.\\" Rothbard was irreligious and agnostic toward the existence of God, describing himself as a \\"mixture of an agnostic and a Reform Jew.\\" Despite identifying as an agnostic and an atheist, Rothbard was critical of the \\"left-libertarian hostility to religion\\". In Rothbard's later years, many of his friends anticipated that he would convert to Catholicism, but he never did.

But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain.

He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan, who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah.  Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella. As filming continues, her identification with her rôle gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished.  By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella.

By the middle 1950s, he had become one of the best-loved and most successful children's book writers in the world. His books are very popular with young readers. They enjoy the invented words and the pictures of unusual funny animals and plants. In 1954, life magazine published a report about school children who could not read. The report said many children's books were not interesting. Doctor Seuss strongly hoped to help children and decided to write books that were interesting and easy to read. He used words with the same ending sound, like fish and wish. He did not receive training in art. Yet, he drew the pictures for most of his books. In 1957, Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat. He used less than 230 words to write the book and even a six-year-old should be able to read it. It was a fun story and easy to read. Children loved it. Their parents loved it, too. Today it is still one of the stories they like best. The success of The Cat in the Hat made him want to write more books for children. In 1960, he wrote a book using less than fifty words. The book is called Green Eggs and Ham. In 1984, Doctor Seuss won a Pulitzer Prize  . He was honored for the education and enjoyment his books provided American children and their parents. He died at the age of 87, but his influence remains. Millions of his books have been sold worldwide. People say his books helped change the way American children learned to read.

Article: The Gunpowder Plot was conspiracy   to kill King James I, as well as the members of the House of Lords and Commons at the re-opening of Parliament. It was designed by a group of Catholics in protest against the anti-Catholic laws that were being introduced by the king. Robert Catesby was the leader of the group. It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses   on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks.

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

On selvää, että toimenpiteiden käyttöönotto pankkien tarjoaman tiedon standardoimiseksi on välttämätöntä, jotta kuluttajat voivat tehokkaasti arvioida ja vertailla eri pankkipalveluita ja tuotteita. Tämä auttaa heitä löytämään itselleen parhaiten sopivan vaihtoehdon ja mahdollistaa paremman kilpailun finanssialalla. Ensimmäinen askel tiedon standardoimiseksi voisi olla selvien ja ymmärrettävien käyttöehtojen luominen, jotka kattavat kaikki pankkituotteet ja -palvelut. Tämä tarkoittaa, että pankkien tulisi käyttää yhteistä terminologiaa ja esittää hinnat ja kulut selkeällä ja yksinkertaisella tavalla. Tämän ansiosta kuluttajat voivat helposti verrata eri pankkien tarjouksia samalla mittakaavalla. Lisäksi pankkien tulisi parantaa avoimuuttaan ja tiedonantoaan. Tämä voi tarkoittaa, että pankkien on julkaistava selkeät ja helposti saatavilla olevat tiedot tuotteistaan ja palveluistaan verkkosivuillaan sekä asiakaspalvelussaan. Tietoja on myös päivitettävä säännöllisesti, jotta kuluttajat saavat aina ajantasaiset tiedot käytössään. Yksi tapa edistää vertailukelpoisen tiedon saatavuutta on luoda keskitetty, puolueeton ja helppokäyttöinen verkkosivusto, joka sisältää kaikki tarvittavat tiedot eri pankkien tarjoamista tuotteista ja palveluista. Tämä sivusto voisi toimia apuna kuluttajille, jotka etsivät itselleen sopivaa pankkituotetta tai -palvelua, ja auttaa heitä tekemään tietoon perustuvan päätöksen. Lopuksi on tärkeää, että pankkien tiedon standardointitoimenpiteisiin liittyvät määräykset ja ohjeistukset ovat selkeitä, ja että valvontaviranomaiset valvovat niiden noudattamista. Tämä varmistaa, että kaikki markkinoilla toimivat pankit noudattavat samoja sääntöjä ja että kuluttajille annetaan tasapuoliset ja yhdenmukaiset tiedot vertailun pohjaksi.

Do not buy this and, if you must use this bc your boss gives it to you, buy a Pearlcorder or even a Panasonic, pay for it yourself if your boss won't, because it will save you hours and hours of frustration. You could probably use a Dora the Explorer or Barbie Doll tape player to better effect that this trashy Sony, in my opinion.P.S. I gave it one star bc this site won't let you give zero or negative stars. .S Answer:","output":"After reading the review, I would conclude that this review would decrease the chances of me buying the product.  Step 1: Analyze the reviewer's experience. The reviewer states that they have received the product from multiple employers and even bought one on their own. This indicates that they have had multiple experiences with the product, which provides credibility to their review. Step 2: Assess the reviewer's opinion on the product's price. The reviewer mentions that the product is inexpensive compared to other transcribers on the market. While this might be seen as a positive aspect, the reviewer argues that the low price may be a reflection of the product's poor quality. Step 3: Evaluate the reviewer's issues with the product. The reviewer claims to have thrown away numerous micro-cassettes, thinking they were faulty, before realizing that the problem lay with the transcriber itself. This suggests that the product's performance is significantly below expectations and may cause costly mistakes. Step 4: Consider the reviewer's recommendations. The reviewer urges potential buyers not to purchase the product and even suggests buying a different brand or model, even if it means paying out of pocket. This implies a strong negative sentiment about the product and that alternatives are likely to offer a better experience. Step 5: Take note of the overall rating. The reviewer gives the product a one-star rating, only because the site doesn't allow for zero or negative stars. This further emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the product. In summary, the reviewer's negative experience with the product, their frustrations, and their strong recommendation against purchasing it would decrease the chances of me buying the product."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Make this proper case.","output":"Tehnopatogennymi areas, also known as technopathogenic zones, are specific locations close to the operation of large equipment, electronic devices, or areas with harmful emissions. These areas are characterized by the potentially adverse impact on human health, the environment, and overall well-being. In these zones, the presence of man-made sources substantially contributes to an unhealthy environment. Technopathogenic areas can also impede the functioning of electronic devices and generate safety hazards to the population. Some of the most prominent examples of tehnopatogennymi zones consist of sites near industrial facilities, power plants, telecommunication towers, and electronic waste disposal areas. Other examples include areas with high levels of air and noise pollution or those exposed to hazardous substances. People living or working in tehnopatogennymi zones can experience a wide range of negative health effects, including respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. Prolonged exposure to harmful emissions and electromagnetic radiation can lead to a decreased quality of life and an increased risk of developing chronic health conditions. The adverse impact of tehnopatogennymi zones is not limited to human health. The surrounding environment can also experience significant degradation in these areas. Habitats for native plants and animals can be disrupted, leading to a loss of biodiversity and imbalances within local ecosystems. Furthermore, soil and water contamination can occur, threatening the availability and quality of essential natural resources. To minimize the harmful effects of tehnopatogennymi areas, several measures can be taken by both the public and private sectors. These include: 1. Implementing strict regulations for the construction and operation of large industrial facilities, particularly those that produce hazardous emissions or generate significant noise pollution. 2. Encouraging the sustainable use of technology and fostering research to develop cleaner, more environmentally friendly methods for energy production, telecommunication, and waste disposal. 3. Establishing buffer zones or green spaces between tehnopatogennymi areas and residential communities to reduce exposure to harmful substances. 4. Conducting regular environmental monitoring and risk assessments to identify potential technopathogenic zones and the relevant health hazards they pose. This information can be used to inform the public, allowing them to make informed decisions about the proximity of their homes or workplaces to these areas. 5. Investing in public awareness campaigns and educational programs to inform the general public about the dangers associated with exposure to harmful emissions and electromagnetic radiation. This can lead to a change in behavior and encourage the adoption of preventative measures, such as using protective equipment or limiting the time spent in these areas. 6. Enhancing collaboration between government agencies, local authorities, industry stakeholders, and environmental organizations to formulate effective policies and strategies to manage and mitigate the negative impact of tehnopatogennymi zones on human health and the environment. In conclusion, tehnopatogennymi areas pose a significant threat to both human health and the environment. By implementing proper regulations, promoting sustainable technology, and increasing public awareness, we can work together to reduce the adverse effects of these dangerous zones and create a healthier, more sustainable world for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Process: - Green is a color that gathers sunlight easily - Sunlight is gathered by the leaves of the plant - The sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis - The glucose travels the plant - The plant uses that glucose as energy to grow.  Question: suppose less pollution in the air happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"Less air pollution is expected to have a positive, or more effect on the process of photosynthesis, thereby influencing the production of more sugar (glucose) and oxygen in plants. To understand this, it's essential to note that photosynthesis is a process that heavily relies on the availability of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide (CO2). Firstly, photosynthesis occurs when plants absorb sunlight through their green pigment, chlorophyll. This sunlight contributes to the chemical reaction that converts CO2 and water into glucose and oxygen. Glucose provides the necessary energy that allows plants to grow while oxygen is released back into the atmosphere. Under conditions of high pollution, the air is often filled with particulates and harmful gases such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. These pollutants can obstruct the sunlight from reaching the plants, thereby limiting the light energy that plants can absorb for photosynthesis. Furthermore, these pollutants can directly damage the stomata, the part of the plant where CO2 is absorbed, disrupting the intake of CO2, which is a critical component of photosynthesis.  When the pollution levels are reduced, more sunlight can reach the green leaves of the plants, enhancing their ability to carry out photosynthesis. With more sunlight, the plants can break down more CO2 into glucose and subsequently produce more energy for growth.  At the same time, the reduction of harmful gases means less damage to the stomata, boosting the plant's efficiency in absorbing CO2. This increase in CO2 absorption coupled with the availability of more sunlight leads to more glucose being produced.  The increase in photosynthesis also means that more oxygen is being produced as a byproduct. This is because oxygen is released when water is broken down during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. So, less pollution allows a more efficient breakdown of water due to increased available sunlight, leading to more oxygen being produced. In conclusion, a decrease in air pollution would result in more sunlight and CO2 being available for photosynthesis. This increased availability leads to more glucose and oxygen being produced, facilitating the plant's growth and contributing to healthier and cleaner air. Therefore, it is fair to say that reduced pollution has a direct, positive, or 'more' effect on the photosynthesis process by allowing plants to produce more sugar and oxygen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona.

So, there were some places that the big country called the Soviet Union took over during a really long time ago called 1939 and 1940. For example, they took some parts of a country named Poland, and later, after a big fight called World War II, they gave some parts back to Poland. But there were other places that the Soviet Union kept, even after 1991 when it changed its name to the Russian Federation. Some of these places were taken from countries named Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. Now, there is a tricky question about which regions never remained part of the Soviet Union. This question is kind of unanswerable because there are many countries and regions in the world that the Soviet Union never took over or controlled.

Insulin is the specific hormone that assists cells in absorbing sugar (glucose) from the blood. When there is an increase in glucose levels in the blood after a meal, the pancreas releases insulin. Insulin then helps cells absorb the glucose by binding to receptors on the cell surface, enabling them to take up glucose from the bloodstream.

However, the usage is so limited that federal laws and other official acts do not require to be decreed in Romansh. Romansh has its origins in the vulgar Latin spoken by the Romans, but due to its limited number of speakers, over the course of time, it has developed into several different dialects.

Wilson, is a diplomat who most recently has served as a U.S. ambassador to Gabon, Sao Tome and Principe. Due to his extensive background, Wilson is approached by Plame's CIA colleagues to travel to Niger and glean information as to whether yellowcake uranium is being procured by Iraq for use in the construction of nuclear weasons. Wilson determines to his own satisfaction that it is not.After military action is taken by George W. Bush, who justifies it in a 2003 State of the Union address by alluding to the uranium's use in building weapons of mass destruction, Wilson submits an op-ed piece to the New York Times claiming these reports to be categorically untrue.Plame's status as a CIA agent is subsequently revealed in the media, the leak possibly coming from White House officials including the Vice President's chief of staff and national security adviser, Scooter Libby, in part to discredit her husband's allegation that the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq. As a result, Plame is instantly dismissed from the agency, leaving several of her delicate operations in limbo and creating a rift in her marriage.Plame leaves her husband, further angered by his granting of television and print interviews, which expose them both to public condemnation and death threats. Wilson ultimately persuades her, however, that there is no other way to fight a power as great as that of the White House for citizens like them.

These interviews, meant to expose the truth, further expose the couple to public scrutiny and danger. However, Wilson ultimately convinces Plame that using media platforms is the only way for them to fight against the enormous power of the White House and make their voices heard. Reunited, Valerie Plame testifies before a Congressional committee to give her account of the events and to shed light on how her identity was leaked. The investigation leads to the conviction of Scooter Libby, the Vice President's chief of staff and national security adviser, on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. He is sentenced to 30 months in prison. However, President Bush decides to commute the jail time given to Libby, which demonstrates the power dynamics at play and the potential limitations in seeking justice against high-level political figures. Throughout the story, Valerie Plame and Joseph C. Wilson struggle to balance their personal and professional lives in the face of adversity. They learn the importance of standing up against an unjust system, despite the risks and potential personal consequences. The movie plot offers an interesting exploration of the abuse of power within the political landscape and the measures individuals must take to fight for truth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Rowena and Billy Wrangler are model high school students. They study hard and do extremely well on achievement tests. And next year,Rowena will be attending Harvard University.Billy,her younger brother,hopes to go to Cornell.What makes Rowena and Billy different from most students is that they don't go to school.In fact,they've never been to school.Since kindergarten,they've studied at home.Like many of more than one million people who receive home schooling in the United States, they feel as if they've gotten a good education. The home-schooling trend began in the U.S.in the 1980s with parents keeping their children out of public schools so they could provide religious education at home. Today,as the home-schooling trend continues to grow,parents are more likely to consider home schooling as an option because they believe schools don't do a very good job of teaching and are occasionally dangerous places.But can parents really do a better job? The answer in many cases is yes.In many studies,students taught at home ranked average or above average when compared to students who went to public schools.More importantly,these students were often more self-directed and have a greater depth of knowledge.They were well prepared for academic challenges. One such student,Robert Conrad, now a sophomore at university, claims he really learned how to study and schedule his time during his eight years of home schooling.Still, not every student is as successful as Robert. \\"For every home-schooling success story,there are an equal number of failures.\\"states Henry Lipscomb,an educational researcher.\\"There are just so many disadvantages that students taught at home have to overcome.\\" For example,they have fewer chances to get in touch with others of their own age.Consequently,they sometimes lack the usual social skills.\\"No matter what,though,\\"states Lipscomb,\\"home-schooling is a growing trend.I think we'll be seeing more and more of this.\\" Options: A parents can do a better job than schools B home-schooling will be more and more useful C home-schooling is good in some aspects D students taught at home make greater achievements Answer: C home-schooling is good in some aspects Question: A:","output":"Based on the article, which statement best reflects the author's view on home-schooling?

However, it doesn't provide any information about her actual baking skills. Instead of confirming the hypothesis, the paragraph provides information that suggests that Maria could be a good baker.

Nevertheless, the information from the paragraph is insufficient to definitively conclude her level of baking skills. A more accurate hypothesis could be: \\"Maria enjoys baking, saw an advertisement for a baking contest, and decided to enter a pie.

Please answer this question: castaway whos story led to the novel robinson crusoe?","output":"The story that led to the creation of the novel \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" is the real-life tale of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish sailor who was marooned on a deserted island and survived for more than four years. Born in 1676 in the coastal town of Lower Largo, Fife, Scotland, Selkirk was a headstrong and independent young man who would later inspire Daniel Defoe to write the classic novel. Before venturing on his own, Alexander Selkirk had sailed with the buccaneers, specifically under the command of English privateer and explorer, William Dampier. In 1703, he joined the expedition led by Dampier to plunder Spanish ships and territories in the Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans. Selkirk served as the sailing master aboard one of the vessels, the Cinque Ports, commanded by Captain Thomas Stradling. In 1704, the Cinque Ports and its companion ship, the St. George, had reached the Juan Fernández Islands off the coast of present-day Chile. At that point, the Cinque Ports was in poor condition, and Selkirk began to question its seaworthiness. He raised his concerns with Captain Stradling, advising him to have the ship repaired. However, Stradling dismissed Selkirk's concerns, and the two men's argument escalated to a boiling point. Selkirk, convinced of the ship's impending doom, insisted on being left behind on the uninhabited island of Más a Tierra (presently known as Robinson Crusoe Island). Realizing that his debate with Captain Stradling was fruitless, Selkirk managed to salvage a few belongings — including a musket, gunpowder, carpenter's tools, a knife, a Bible, some clothing, and navigation equipment — and requested to be left ashore. Stradling complied, and marooned Selkirk on the remote island. Despite his initial hardships, Selkirk proved to be incredibly resourceful and adaptable in his new environment. He used the resources available on the island to survive profoundly. He hunted wild goats, which had been introduced by earlier sailors, to obtain food and clothing. With the help of feral cats, he controlled the rat infestation, which threatened his food supply and safety. Furthermore, he cultivated vegetables, constructed two huts from local materials, and eventually found a level of comfort in his isolation. After over four years of living alone on the island, Selkirk was finally rescued on February 2, 1709, by the privateer vessel, the Duke, under the command of Woodes Rogers. Rogers wrote an account of Selkirk's ordeal, and the story became widely known in England. Daniel Defoe used Selkirk's astonishing tale as inspiration for his novel \\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" published in 1719, although he modified the story and added various fictional elements. Defoe's novel went on to achieve great success and literary significance, ultimately securing a place in the canon of world literature. Nevertheless, the real-life story of Alexander Selkirk's remarkable survival on a deserted island serves as a testament to human resilience and resourcefulness, transcending the boundaries of fiction and establishing itself as an iconic, adventurous, and inspiring tale."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why.

Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter.

His work includes the Viriconium sequence of novels and short stories (1971-1984), Climbers (1989), and the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, which consists of Light (2002), Nova Swing (2006) and Empty Space (2012). He is widely considered one of the major stylists of modern fantasy and science fiction, and a \\"genre contrarian\\". The Times Literary Supplement described him as 'a singular stylist' and the Literary Review called him 'a witty and truly imaginative writer'. Harrison's enduring fantasy sequence concerning the fictitious city of Viriconium consists of three novels and various short stories and novels written between 1971 and 1984. Viriconium is known as the Pastel City. Both universal and particular, the city has a shifting topography and history, and is sometimes known by names such as 'Uroconium'.  The first book, The Pastel City (1971), presents a civilization in decline where medieval social patterns clash with the advanced technology and superscience energy weapons that the citizens of the city know how to use but have forgotten how to engineer. The more complex second novel is A Storm of Wings (1982). It is set eighty years later than The Pastel City. and stylistically it is far denser and more elaborate. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. Harrison brilliantly depicts the workings of civilization on the verge of collapse and the heroic efforts of individuals to help it sustain itself a little longer.  The third novel, In Viriconium (1982) (US title: The Floating Gods), was nominated for the Guardian Fiction Prize during 1982. It is a moody portrait of artistic subcultures in a city beset by a mysterious plague. Where the previous books in the series held some sword and sorcery elements, In Viriconium goes beyond black humour into a coma of despair.  The short story \\"A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium\\" (1985; later retitled \\"A Young Man's Journey to London\\") is set in our world. It explains that Viriconium can be visited via a mirror in a bathroom in a cafe in England.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what is storm of wings about?","output":"A Storm of Wings, the second novel in the Viriconium sequence, is about a civilization that is on the verge of collapse.

Mail the certificate to the pedigree association.\\" Article:","output":"Title: How to Transfer Pet Ownership via a Registration Certificate Introduction Transferring the ownership of a pet is a vital step when giving or selling your beloved animal to a new owner. Legitimate organizations make use of registration certificates to ensure that the change of ownership is properly documented and authenticated. This article will guide you through the process of locating your pet's registration certificate, filling in the transfer information, and mailing the certificate to the pedigree association. Step 1: Locate the pet's registration certificate The very first step in transferring pet ownership is locating your pet's registration certificate. This document serves as the official record of your pet's pedigree and ownership history. It is issued by pedigree associations such as the American Kennel Club or the Cat Fanciers' Association, among others. Most pet owners receive this certificate upon the initial registration of their pet. If you have misplaced it or haven't yet received it, you can contact the pedigree association that your pet is registered with to acquire a replacement or verify if the pet is registered. Step 2: Fill in the transfer information on the back of the certificate Once you have the registration certificate in hand, turn it over and locate the transfer information section on the back. This section is where you will provide all the necessary details about the new owner, including their name, address, and contact information. It is essential to provide accurate details to ensure that the new owner is easily reachable should any issues arise. Double-check the information and confirm with the new owner to avoid any errors or confusion. Step 3: Sign the certificate as the old owner As the current owner of the pet, you will need to record your signature on the registration certificate to officially transfer the ownership to the new owner. Be sure to sign legibly and include the date of transfer alongside your signature. It is a good idea to use a pen with permanent ink to avoid smudging or fading over time. It's also recommended to make a photocopy of the completed and signed certificate for your records before mailing it to the pedigree association. Step 4: Mail the certificate to the pedigree association The final step in the process is to mail the signed registration certificate to the pedigree association responsible for issuing the document. Choose a secure and reliable method for mailing the certificate, such as registered mail or a courier with tracking capabilities. Check if the association has specific mailing instructions that you need to follow. Be sure to follow these guidelines to prevent any delays in processing the transfer. Conclusion Transferring pet ownership through a registration certificate may seem like a daunting task, but following these steps will make the process much simpler. By locating and filling in the transfer information on the certificate, and mailing it to the pedigree association, you are safeguarding your pet's pedigree records and ensuring a smooth transition for both the new owner and your beloved animal companion. Remember always to double-check the accuracy of the information on the certificate and to use secure mailing methods for the safe and timely transfer of the documentation.

To provide a more detailed insight into the languages Queen Victoria studied, it is known that she was a polyglot and spoke several languages, including her native English. Throughout her childhood education, she learned German, French, Italian, and Latin. Additionally, she later gained some knowledge of Hindustani (now referred to as Hindi or Urdu), which she began learning in 1837 upon her ascension to the British throne. Victoria's interest in languages was attributed to her passion for learning, as well as the demands of her royal duties and her role as the head of a vast empire. A proficiency in multiple languages facilitated communication with visiting diplomats, heads of state, and other international figures. Furthermore, her linguistic abilities also provided opportunities for her to appreciate literature and to engage in meaningful conversations with her subjects from diverse backgrounds. In conclusion, the original sentence does not address the question related to the languages Queen Victoria studied. To answer the question, it is important to note that she was proficient in English, German, French, Italian, and Latin, and had some knowledge of Hindustani."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: I can use this background: Generally speaking, more mafic magmas, such as those that form basalt, are hotter and less viscous than more silica-rich magmas, such as those that form rhyolite. Low viscosity leads to gentler, less explosive eruptions.  Now, I have a new situation: John visited Sicily to see Mount Etna eruption. He noticed that magma there formed rhyolite. He was so excited to an eruption that when next time Kilauea eruption started in Hawaii, he went to see that. He found that unlike Etna Kilauea eruption formed basalt.  Answer this question please: Which eruption would have higher temperature, Etna or Kilauea? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the magma type for each volcano - Mount Etna: rhyolite - Kilauea: basalt Step 2: Recall the relationship between magma type and temperature from the background information - More mafic magmas (such as basalt) are hotter than more silica-rich magmas (such as rhyolite) Step 3: Compare the magma types of Mount Etna and Kilauea according to their temperature - Kilauea's eruption formed basalt, which is a more mafic magma - Mount Etna's eruption formed rhyolite, which is more silica-rich magma Step 4: Determine which eruption had a higher temperature - Since Kilauea's eruption formed more mafic basalt magma, it would have a higher temperature than Mount Etna's eruption that formed rhyolite.

To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D?  Hint: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information and Le Chatelier's principle, test C observed a forward reaction while test D observed a reverse reaction. When a forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. Conversely, when the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Therefore, test C saw higher concentrations of the products in comparison to test D. In test C, the stress applied to the system caused the forward reaction to be favored, leading to an increase in product concentrations and a decrease in reactant concentrations as the system tried to establish a new equilibrium. In test D, however, the system responded to the applied stress by favoring the reverse reaction, causing the product concentrations to decrease and the reactant concentrations to increase, as the system attempted to counteract the stress and establish a new equilibrium position."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: microwave bowl Available options: 1. can hold ideas  2. can hold carrots  Answer:","output":"The best way to microwave a bowl depends on what you're trying to achieve. If you want to heat up its contents, the best approach would be: 1. Choose the right type of bowl: Make sure the bowl is microwave-safe. This means it should not have any metallic parts, should not be plastic or melamine, and should be labeled as microwave-safe. 2. Choose the content: Based on the available options, it seems like the goal is to either heat up ideas or carrots. Since ideas can't be heated physically, the best choice would be to use the bowl to hold and heat carrots. Step-by-step process: 1. Prepare the carrots: Wash, peel, and cut the carrots into desired shapes and sizes. 2. Place the carrots in the microwave-safe bowl: Ensure the bowl is spacious enough to avoid overcrowding the carrots. This way, they will heat up evenly. 3. Cover the bowl: Use a microwave-safe lid or a microwave-safe plate to cover the bowl. This helps retain moisture and steam, which aids in cooking the carrots evenly. 4. Set the microwave: Adjust the microwave power to medium or around 50% of its total capacity. This is a good starting point to ensure the carrots don't overcook too quickly. 5. Microwave the carrots: Heat the carrots in the microwave for around 3-4 minutes. Keep an eye on them and check every minute or so to ensure they don't overcook or burn. Stir the carrots to ensure even cooking. 6. Check for desired tenderness: After 3-4 minutes, check the carrots for tenderness by inserting a fork into one of the carrot pieces. If the fork goes in easily, the carrots are ready. If not, continue microwaving in 1-minute increments until they reach the desired tenderness. 7. Carefully remove the bowl: Use oven mitts or a towel to remove the hot bowl from the microwave. Be cautious when lifting the lid or plate covering the bowl, as steam may escape. 8. Serve and enjoy: Use a serving utensil to transfer the cooked carrots onto plates, or serve them directly from the bowl.

Context: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Karen gets some cream from her cabinet to use on her cuts after she gets done showering.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which arm's blood vessels are more dilated? Answer:","output":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, Karen's right arm has a cut that is red and easy to see, which indicates that the blood vessels in her right arm are more dilated. Dilation of blood vessels allows increased blood flow to the affected area, which can cause the redness and visibility of the cut. The left arm's cut, which is hardly noticeable, has less vasodilation, making the right arm's blood vessels more dilated in comparison."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Options: - enlightenment - confusion - loss of innocence - solution - sadness  Explain why a human would choose \\"sadness\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human might choose \\"sadness\\" as the answer to the question because learning about world poverty can evoke strong emotions and empathy, especially when confronted with the harsh realities of poverty and its effects on individuals and communities.  There are several reasons why learning about world poverty could lead to feelings of sadness: 1. Empathy: As humans, we are capable of empathizing with the pain and suffering of others. When we learn about people living in extreme poverty, it is natural to feel sad for the hardships they face daily, such as lack of access to food, clean water, healthcare, and education.  2. Inequality: Learning about world poverty can create a sense of sadness due to the vast inequalities that exist between the various countries and communities. People may feel disheartened knowing that some individuals have abundant resources, while others struggle to meet their basic needs. 3. Helplessness: The enormity of the poverty problem might make some individuals feel overwhelmed and helpless, which can lead to a sense of sadness. They might be uncertain about how to contribute towards solving the issue or may feel that their efforts could be insignificant in the larger scheme of things. 4. Reflection on own privilege: Gaining awareness about world poverty can force individuals to confront their own privilege and disparities in their lives compared to those in poverty. This realization can lead to feelings of guilt, which may contribute to overall sadness. 5. Challenges to beliefs: Learning about world poverty can challenge one's long-held beliefs or assumptions about the world, potentially leading to sadness. For example, if a person believed that the world was mostly fair and just, knowing about the extent of poverty might make them question that perspective. While learning about world poverty can lead to sadness for these reasons, that same awareness can also inspire empathy, action, and a desire for a more equitable world, encouraging people to work towards meaningful solutions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Options: (A). no. (B). yes.","output":"The answer is (A). no.  These two questions are not the same. While both inquire about the potential replacement for social media, they distinctly differ in the time frame being considered. The first question, \\"What will replace social media?\\" is open-ended in regard to when this shift might occur. The query might be asking about potential future developments, whether near or far, that could potentially supplant the prevalence and influence of social media. This inquiry might lead to discussion on a range of advancements in technology or societal shifts like augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, or even possibilities like a mass return to more traditional forms of communication due to potential feelings of overload or negative effects from current social media usage. On the other hand, the second question, \\"What will replace social media in 2016?\\" confines the discussion to what could or did replace social media during that specific year. Since 2016 has already passed, this question can only be addressed by looking at historical data and technological trends of that period. Given that we know social media use continued to grow in and after 2016, with platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter maintaining strong presences and new platforms like TikTok beginning to make their mark in the years that followed, it is clear that no significant replacement occurred during that year.

Voting will take five weeks, with results due on 16 May. More than 814 million people are eligible to vote in a poll dominated by corruption and high inflation. Mr Negi, who lives in the Himalayan village of Kalpa in Kinnaur district, will cast his vote on 7 May, the day voting will be held in all five seats of Himachal Pradesh. The Election Commission of India has held him up as an example to others, and Google India recently put out a video on Mr Negi - #PledgeToVote tells the \\"true story of a man who never missed an opportunity to vote\\". Election Commission of India Since the video went up on 24 March, it has been viewed by nearly 1.7 million people around the world.

Then, he puts on his coat and cap, picks up his walking stick and begins his journey to the polling centre. Walking upright and sure-footed on the snow-covered road which winds through apple orchards and pine woods, he arrives at the polling station to a grand welcome by fellow tribespeople before casting his vote. The film also describes Mr Negi as the country's first voter - it says that independent India's first polling station was set up at Kalpa months before elections were held in the rest of India in February 1952. \\"Before the roads got blocked in deep winter, we voted several months ahead of the rest of India on 25 October 1951,\\" Mr Negi says. \\"Since then I have voted in every general election and the state assembly elections.

Information:  - In zoological nomenclature, a subphylum is a taxonomic rank below the rank of phylum.   - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta.  - Starfish or sea stars are star-shaped echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea. Common usage frequently finds these names being also applied to ophiuroids, which are correctly referred to as brittle stars or \\"basket stars\\". About 1,500 species of starfish occur on the seabed in all the world's oceans, from the tropics to frigid polar waters. They are found from the intertidal zone down to abyssal depths, below the surface.  - Tube feet are small active tubular projections on the oral face of an echinoderm, whether the arms of a starfish, or the undersides of sea urchins, sand dollars and sea cucumbers. They are part of the water vascular system.  - The term sand dollar (or sea cookie or snapper biscuit in New Zealand, or pansy shell in South Africa) refers to species of extremely flattened, burrowing sea urchins belonging to the order Clypeasteroida. Some species within the order, not quite as flat, are known as sea biscuits. Related animals include other sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and starfish.  - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\"  \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\"  \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives.  - Eleutherozoa is a subphylum of echinoderms . They are mobile animals with the mouth directed towards the substrate . They usually have a madreporite , tube feet , and moveable spines of some sort , and some have Tiedemann 's bodies on the ring canal . All living echinoderms except Crinoidea belong here .  - The madreporite is a lightcolored calcareous opening used to filter water into the water vascular system of echinoderms. It acts like a pressure-equalizing valve. It is visible as a small red or yellow button-like structure, looking like a small wart, on the aboral surface of the central disk of a sea star. Close up, it is visibly structured, resembling a \\"madrepore\\" (stone coral, Scleractinia) colony. From this, it derives its name.  - Scleractinia, also called stony corals or hard corals, are marine animals in the phylum Cnidaria that live on the seabed and build themselves a hard skeleton. The individual animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc with a mouth and a fringe of tentacles. Although some species are solitary, most are colonial. The founding polyp settles on the seabed and starts to secrete calcium carbonate to protect its soft body. Solitary corals can be as much as across but in colonial species the polyps are usually only a few millimetres in diameter. These polyps reproduce by budding but remain attached to each other, forming a multi-polyp colony with a common skeleton, which may be up to several metres in diameter or height according to species.  - Sea urchins or urchins, archaically called sea hedgehogs, are small, spiny, globular animals that, with their close kin, such as sand dollars, constitute the class Echinoidea of the echinoderm phylum. About 950 species of echinoids inhabit all oceans from the intertidal to deep. The shell, or \\"test\\", of sea urchins is round and spiny, typically from across. Common colors include black and dull shades of green, olive, brown, purple, blue, and red. Sea urchins move slowly, feeding primarily on algae. Sea otters, starfish, wolf eels, triggerfish, and other predators hunt and feed on sea urchins. Their roe is a delicacy in many cuisines. The name \\"urchin\\" is an old word for hedgehog, which sea urchins resemble.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'. A:","output":"Subject Entity: Subphylum Eleutherozoa Object Entity: Phylum Echinodermata The relation of 'parent taxon' is present between Subphylum Eleutherozoa and Phylum Echinodermata, as Eleutherozoa is a subphylum under the phylum Echinodermata."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The apparent silence of IS sources on the issue could be evidence that something has happened to al-Baghdadi.  But there was a similar lack of official IS denial of rumours that the group's spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, had been killed in air strikes earlier this year - something that later turned out to be unfounded. A Twitter account purportedly belonging to Adnani has claimed Baghdadi should be on his way to a speedy recovery, but the account is almost certainly fake, as it refers to Adnani in the third person at one point. Were it real, Twitter would have deleted it some time ago, having cracked down on all traces of an official IS presence on its platform. Regardless of the veracity of the present reports, it is of interest to assess what impact Baghdadi's death would have on the fortunes of IS. IS is heavily invested in the image of Baghdadi, who had projected himself as a caliph for a year before a caliphate was declared in June 2014. One of the signs of this was Baghdadi's original declaration rebranding the group as Isis - the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant- in April 2013, an evolution from the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI). Isis implied an Islamic state entity whose presence in Iraq and Syria was a mere geographic accident, and subject to future expansion. ISI on the other hand, had implied an independent emirate that could perhaps be subsumed into the long-term global project of al-Qaeda. The shift from ISI to Isis was marked with slogans such as \\"the promised project of the caliphate\\" and songs like \\"Close ranks and pledge allegiance to Baghdadi\\". Thus, IS's basis for claiming to be a state and caliphate is closely tied to Baghdadi's persona, which initially thrived on hiding behind audio messages. Key also to Baghdadi's legitimacy in the eyes supporters is his claimed lineage from the Prophet Muhammad's family and tribe, as well as scholarly knowledge of religious jurisprudence. The problem then is to find a viable successor to Baghdadi in the event of his death. No other figure in IS is publicly cultivated to claim the position of caliph, with credentials of education in Islamic law. In addition, the persona of Baghdadi is credited with ISI's rise, to a transnational entity that controls contiguous territory and has all the trappings of a state. Senior figures within IS - such as members of the Shura Council, which supposedly gave legitimacy to the caliphate declaration - remain otherwise unknown. Nothing suggests that other high-ranking IS figures, such as Adnani and field commanders such as Omar Shishani and Shaker Abu Waheeb, are being projected as potential successors to Baghdadi. Therefore IS could find itself in disarray in the event of Baghdadi's death if it cannot immediately achieve consensus on a successor who can live up to his legacy and command allegiance from the world's Muslims. Indeed, the group's rank-and-file is by no means monolithic. Many members - particularly from likeminded jihadi groups such as Jamaat Ansar al-Islam- have pledged allegiance on the notion that IS is a \\"winning horse\\" that can project itself as a caliphate. If that credibility disappears, the pledges of allegiance, which it should be noted are made to Baghdadi as \\"caliph of the Muslims\\", could well vanish.  Members would then revert to their original group identities, reducing Islamic State's ranks. Summary:","output":"The silence of IS sources regarding al-Baghdadi's health could imply that something has happened to him, but similar silences have previously proven unfounded. IS is heavily invested in Baghdadi's image, and its claims of being a state and caliphate are closely tied to his persona. If Baghdadi were to die, finding a successor with his religious knowledge and lineage could be problematic, leading to potential disarray in the group. Furthermore, the \\"winning horse\\" perception of IS could dissipate, causing members to revert to their original group identities and reducing the Islamic State's ranks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given equation: -45f - 25f + 7560 = 25f + 13f Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left-hand side, we have -45f and -25f. Combining these: -45f - 25f = -70f On the right-hand side, we have 25f and 13f. Combining these: 25f + 13f = 38f Now, our equation becomes: -70f + 7560 = 38f Step 2: Isolate the variable 'f' by moving the terms with 'f' to one side of the equation and constants to the other side. To move the 38f term from the right-hand side to the left-hand side, we need to subtract it from both sides: -70f - 38f = 38f - 38f - 7560 Adding the like terms: -108f = -7560 Step 3: Solve for 'f'.

Donatien Alphonse Francois de Sade was born on 2 June 1740, in the Hotel de Conde, Paris, to Jean Baptiste Francois Joseph, Count de Sade and Marie Eleonore de Maille de Carman, cousin and Lady-in-waiting to the Princess of Conde. He was his parents' only surviving child. He was educated by an uncle, the Abbe de Sade. In Sade's youth, his father abandoned the family; his mother joined a convent. He was raised with servants who indulged \\"his every whim,\\" which led to his becoming \\"known as a rebellious and spoiled child with an ever-growing temper.\\"  Later in his childhood, Sade was sent to the Lycee Louis-le-Grand in Paris, a Jesuit college, for four years. While at the school, he was tutored by Abbe Jacques-Francois Amblet, a priest. Later in life, at one of Sade's trials the Abbe testified, saying that Sade had a \\"passionate temperament which made him eager in the pursuit of pleasure\\" but had a \\"good heart.\\" At the Lycee Louis-le-Grand, he was subjected to \\"severe corporal punishment,\\" including \\"flagellation,\\" and he \\"spent the rest of his adult life obsessed with the violent act.\\" At age 14, Sade began attending an elite military academy.

After 13 months as a sub-lieutenant, he was commissioned to the rank of cornet in the Brigade de S. Andre of the Comte de Provence's Carbine Regiment. He eventually became Colonel of a Dragoon regiment and fought in the Seven Years' War. In 1763, on returning from war, he courted a rich magistrate's daughter, but her father rejected his suitorship and instead arranged a marriage with his elder daughter, Renee-Pelagie de Montreuil; that marriage produced two sons and a daughter.

Their marriage is not helped by Clara's opinionated mother living with them in their small one bedroom apartment. However, Clara does wish that their life would be a little more exciting as Andrew said on their honeymoon that their married life would be, least of all by Andrew acknowledging their latest wedding anniversary, their fifth.

Options: a. 1.5 %, b. 2.5 %, c. 3.5 %, d. 4.5 %, e. 5.5 % A:","output":"Let us break down the problem step by step. Step 1: Rephrase the problem If the couple gives a 10% discount, the total items sold increases by 15%. We need to find the increase in their gross income from sales at the end of one month. Step 2: Assume initial values for easy calculation Let's assume that the couple initially sells 100 items at 100 each (without discount). This means their initial monthly gross income was 10,000 (100 items x 100). Step 3: Calculate the new selling price and item quantity after the 10% discount With the 10% discount, the new selling price becomes 90 (10% off from 100). Since the number of items sold increases by 15%, the new total quantity of items sold becomes 115 (100 + 15% of 100). Step 4: Calculate the new monthly gross income With the new selling price and item quantity, the new monthly gross income will be 10,350 (115 items x 90). Step 5: Calculate the increase in gross income Now we need to find the percentage increase in the monthly gross income. The increase in gross income is 10,350 - 10,000 = 350. Step 6: Find the percentage increase in gross income To find the percentage increase, divide the increase in income by the initial income and multiply by 100: (350 / 10,000) × 100 = 3.5% Therefore, the correct answer is c. 3.5%."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the church that is of red brick and Pevsner considered it \\"astonishingly restrained.\\"  In 1859 Burges began work with Ambrose Poynter on the Maison Dieu, Dover, which was completed in 1861. Emulation of the original medieval style can be seen in his renovation of the grotesque animals and in the coats of arms incorporated into his new designs. Burges later designed the Council Chamber, added in 1867, and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover, a town meeting and concert hall. The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices. Although Burges designed the project, most of it was completed after his death by his partners, Pullan and Chapple. The listed status of the Maison Dieu was reclassified as Grade I in 2017 and Dover District Council, the building's owner, is seeking grant funding to enable a restoration, focussing on Burges's work.In 1859–60, Burges took over the restoration of Waltham Abbey from Poynter, working with Poynter's son Edward Poynter and with furniture makers Harland and Fisher. He commissioned Edward Burne-Jones of James Powell & Sons to make three stained-glass windows for the east end, representing the Tree of Jesse. The Abbey is a demonstration of Burges's skills as a restorer, with \\"a profound sensitivity towards medieval architecture.\\" Mordaunt Crook wrote of Burges's interior that, \\"it meets the Middle Ages as an equal.\\" In 1861–2, Burges was commissioned by Charles Edward Lefroy, secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons, to build All Saints Church, Fleet, as a memorial to Lefroy's wife. She was the daughter of James Walker, who established the marine engineering company of Walker and Burges with Burges's father Alfred, and this family connection brought Burges the commission. Pevsner says of Fleet that \\"it has no shape, nor character nor notable buildings, except one,\\" that one being All Saints.

The church's interior is simply decorated yet stands out for its massive sculpture, particularly of the tomb of the Lefroys and of the gabled arch below which the tomb originally sat.

The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How was Euthydemus threatened?\\" is in \\"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Euthydemus was threatened when the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III around 210 BCE. However, after being victorious in the field, Antiochus realized the advantages of maintaining the status quo and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimizing the Greco-Bactria dynasty.

(originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast--he was \\"dazed and exhausted\\" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completely) Okay, first off, I'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'. So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being \\"wowed\\" by each frame visually. How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life? \\"Heck\\" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. Of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...). Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!). But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color. No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story. But, I'm glad to say, it's not! A Bug's Life has real heart. Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them! Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think! Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has. This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing. The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots. Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not \\"dumbing down\\" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not. All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point. Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay? How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is extremely positive and passionate. The reviewer is strongly defending the movie \\"A Bug's Life\\" against criticisms they perceive as unjust. They feel very connected to the characters and story, and admire the amount of detail and artistic value in the animation, as well as the complexity and subtlety of the narrative. The reviewer argues that the movie achieves a balance between compelling storytelling and impressive visuals. They also commend Pixar for assuming intellect and emotional complexity in their audience, and making a movie that functions on many different levels, offering richly satisfying viewing experiences for both children and adults. Furthermore, they believe that the movie has genuine heart and emotional resonance, and can be profoundly relatable and comforting in its depiction of a wide range of human experiences and emotions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Information:  - A nightclub (also known as a discothèque, disco, dance club or club) is an entertainment venue and bar which serves alcoholic beverages that usually operates late into the night. A nightclub is generally distinguished from regular bars, pubs or taverns by the inclusion of a stage for live music, one or more dance floor areas and a DJ booth, where a DJ plays recorded music and where coloured lights illuminate the dance area. Another distinction is that whereas many pubs and sports bars aim at a mass market, nightclubs typically aim at a niche market of music and dancing enthusiasts and clubgoers. The upmarket nature of nightclubs can be seen in the inclusion of VIP areas in some nightclubs, for celebrities and their guests. Nightclubs are much more likely than pubs or sports bars to use bouncers to screen prospective clubgoers for entry. Some nightclub bouncers do not admit people with ripped jeans or other informal clothing as part of a dress code. The busiest nights for a nightclub are Friday and Saturday night. Most clubs or club nights cater to certain music genres.  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.  - Nelson Ackerman Eddy (June 29, 1901  March 6, 1967) was an American singer and actor who appeared in 19 musical films during the 1930s and 1940s, as well as in opera and on the concert stage, radio, television, and in nightclubs. A classically trained baritone, he is best remembered for the eight films in which he costarred with soprano Jeanette MacDonald. He was one of the first \\"crossover\\" stars, a superstar appealing both to shrieking bobby soxers as well as opera purists, and in his heyday, he was the highest paid singer in the world.  - A baritone is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range lies between the bass and the tenor voice types. It is the most common male voice. Originally from the Greek , meaning \\"deep (or heavy) sounding\\", music for this voice is typically written in the range from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C (i.e. FF) in choral music, and from the second A below middle C to the A above middle C (A to A) in operatic music, but can be extended at either end. The baritone voice type is generally divided into the baryton-Martin baritone (light baritone), lyric baritone, \\"Kavalierbariton\\", Verdi baritone, dramatic baritone, \\"baryton-noble\\" baritone, and the bass-baritone.  - Bobby soxer is a 1940s sociological coinage describing the often very zealous fans of traditional pop music, in particular its creators like singer Frank Sinatra. Bobby soxers were usually teenage girls and young adult women from about 12 to 25. Fashionable adolescent girls wore poodle skirts and rolled down their socks to the ankle. In high schools and colleges, the gymnasium was often used as a dance floor; however, since street shoes and street detritus might damage the polished wood floors, the students were required to remove their shoes and flop dance in their bobby socks, hence the phrase \\"sock hop\\".  - The Love Parade is a 1929 American Pre-Code musical comedy film about the marital difficulties of Queen Louise of Sylvania (Jeanette MacDonald) and her consort, Count Alfred Renard (Maurice Chevalier). Despite his love for Louise and his promise to be an obedient husband, Count Alfred finds his role as a figurehead unbearable.  - Maurice Auguste Chevalier (September 12, 1888  January 1, 1972) was a French actor, cabaret singer and entertainer. He is perhaps best known for his signature songs, including \\"Louise\\", \\"Mimi\\", \\"Valentine\\", and \\"Thank Heaven for Little Girls\\" and for his films, including \\"The Love Parade\\" and \\"The Big Pond\\". His trademark attire was a boater hat, which he always wore on stage with a tuxedo.  - Sharon Rich (born June 11, 1953) is an author and film historian, best known for the biography \\"Sweethearts\\" about 1930s singing stars Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. She was close friends for many years with Jeanette's older sister, actress Blossom Rock (aka Marie Blake). Along with interviewing hundreds of people, Rich had access to many collections of private letters, Eddys personal scrapbooks, diary entries, FBI files and MacDonalds unpublished autobiography. As follow up documentation to \\"Sweethearts\\", Rich has written several additional books and edited and written over seventy magazine articles. In 1995 she was awarded a Dame of Merit by the Knights of Malta for her contribution to History and Literature.  - Sweethearts : The Timeless Love Affair On screen and Off Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy is biographical book by Sharon Rich . First published in hardback in 1994 by Donald I. Fine , Inc. , the book covers the relationship of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy . Rich drew heavily on Eddy 's mother , who had kept Eddy 's diaries and letters .  - Edith Marie Blossom MacDonald (August 21, 1895  January 14, 1978), known as Blossom Rock, was an American actress of stage, film and television. She was occasionally billed as Marie Blake or Blossom MacDonald. Her younger sister was screen actress and singer Jeanette MacDonald.  - One Hour with You is a 1932 American Pre-Code musical comedy film about a married couple who find themselves attracted to other people. It was produced and directed by Ernst Lubitsch \\"with the assistance of\\" George Cukor, and written by Samson Raphaelson, from the play \\"Only a Dream\\" by Lothar Schmidt. It stars Maurice Chevalier, Jeanette MacDonald and Genevieve Tobin and features Charles Ruggles and Roland Young. A French-language version, called \\"Une heure près de toi\\" was made simultaneously, with Lili Damita playing Genevieve Tobin's role.  - Love Me Tonight is a 1932 American Pre-Code musical comedy film produced and directed by Rouben Mamoulian, with music by Rodgers and Hart. It stars Maurice Chevalier as a tailor who poses as a nobleman and Jeanette MacDonald as a princess with whom he falls in love. It also stars Charles Ruggles as a penniless nobleman, along with Charles Butterworth and Myrna Loy as members of his family.  - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music.

(iii) No.","output":"(iii) No. The next sentence does not follow the preceding text, as it incorrectly states that the Inter-American Peace Force (IAPF) established the Organization of American States (OAS) on 23 May 1965. In actuality, the information provided before indicates that the IAPF was established by the OAS on the same date, signifying that the OAS had already been in existence before the creation of the IAPF. The Organization of American States is an international organization founded on 30 April 1948, with the purpose of promoting regional solidarity, cooperation, and development among its member countries in the Americas. The establishment of the Inter-American Peace Force on 23 May 1965 came as a response to the United States' intervention in the Dominican Republic, which was undertaken to prevent the emergence of communist influence and the further destabilization of the Caribbean region. The IAPF was primarily composed of over 42,600 United States military personnel, but other countries also contributed troops, adding a multinational dimension to the peacekeeping force. Countries that contributed troops to the IAPF included Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, emphasizing the collective efforts of the OAS to promote peace and stability in the Americas. In summary, the statement in question reverses the roles of the Organization of American States and the Inter-American Peace Force, thereby providing incorrect information. It is essential to recognize the accurate relationship between these two entities, with the OAS being the founding organization that established the IAPF, rather than the other way around."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The answer is:","output":"The last step of the process, after placing your non-dominant foot on the front of the skateboard, pushing off with your other foot on the ground, consistently pushing with your dominant leg, and placing both feet on the skateboard when comfortable, would be to maintain balance and control while riding the skateboard. To do this, follow these tips: 1. Evenly distribute your weight: Make sure your weight is centered over the skateboard, with both feet relatively equal distances from the nose and tail of the skateboard. Maintain a slight bend in your knees to improve balance. 2. Find your footing: Determine your preferred stance, either with your left foot forward (called \\"regular\\") or your right foot forward (called \\"goofy\\"). Ensure that your non-dominant foot is near the front of the skateboard and your dominant foot is near the back when you're ready to push. 3. Maintain an appropriate posture: Keep your back straight and your shoulders aligned with your hips while riding the skateboard. This helps you maintain balance and control while still allowing for quick movements and adjustments. 4. Look ahead: Focus on the path in front of you, not on your feet or the skateboard itself. This will help you anticipate any obstacles or changes in terrain and adjust your stance accordingly. 5. Practice turning and carving: To turn on a skateboard, gently shift your weight towards your toes or heels, depending on the direction you want to go. For sharper turns, lean more heavily and pivot your hips in the desired direction. 6. Brake safely: To slow down or stop on a skateboard, you can either use the foot braking method or practice drag-stop techniques. For foot braking, gently lower your pushing foot to the ground and let it drag behind you while maintaining balance on the board. For drag-stop techniques, learn how to safely slide or perform powerslides to control your speed. 7. Build confidence and practice: As with any skill, practice is key to becoming a comfortable and confident skateboarder. Build up your skills by riding in safe, open areas free from obstacles and gradually progress to more challenging terrains. By incorporating these tips and techniques into your skateboarding experience, you can successfully complete the process and enjoy a smooth and controlled ride."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Greg Louganis is finally on a Wheaties box, three decades after his four Olympic gold medal wins. The diver won gold at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics, and though he didn't come out as gay until 1995 (when he also revealed he was HIV-positive), Louganis has argued in the past that rumors of his sexual orientation kept him off Wheaties boxes at the time (a charge Wheaties denies). Now, after a Chicago woman's petition, he's finally getting the honor, the Chicago Tribune reports. Julie Sondgerath started the petition last summer after watching an HBO documentary on Louganis; it eventually got more than 40,000 signatures, and on Tuesday, General Mills announced that Louganis would appear on \\"Wheaties Legends\\" boxes, which will be in stores for three to six months starting in May. Swimmer Janet Evans and track and field star Edwin Moses will also be featured on the boxes, which are intended for athletes who have retired from competition. Sondgerath sent a link to her petition to Louganis right after she started it, and he thanked her, but \\"I think really he resigned himself to the fact it wasn't going to happen,\\" Sondgerath tells the Tribune. (General Mills says the petition didn't directly impact its decision to feature Louganis.) \\"Back in '95, I wasn't expected to live very long because we thought of HIV-AIDS as a death sentence,\\" Louganis tells NPR. \\"So to be here today, now 56, the box means so much more to me than it would have then because I feel like I'm being embraced as a whole person, not just for my athletic achievements.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Greg Louganis, Olympic Diving Legend, Finally Graces Wheaties Box Amidst Speculation of Past Discrimination Three decades after his last Olympic gold medal win, Greg Louganis – a legendary American diver – has finally secured his spot on the Wheaties cereal box. In the past, Louganis has argued that rumors concerning his sexual orientation kept him from receiving this honor, a claim that Wheaties denies. Now, thanks to a petition by a Chicago woman, he is being celebrated as a Wheaties Legend alongside swimmer Janet Evans and track and field star Edwin Moses.  Louganis won two gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and another two at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but despite his incredible achievements, he was not honored with a Wheaties cover. Often referred to as \\"The Breakfast of Champions,\\" Wheaties was known for featuring accomplished athletes on its cereal boxes and was seen as an acknowledgment of one's sporting prowess. Many speculate that it was Louganis' sexual orientation – which he publicly acknowledged as gay in 1995 alongside announcing that he was HIV-positive – that kept him away from the recognition he truly deserved. It wasn't until Julie Sondgerath, a Chicago woman, started a petition last summer after watching an HBO documentary on Louganis' life, that the athlete's fans came together to rectify this past oversight. Her petition ultimately gathered over 40,000 signatures, and on Tuesday, General Mills announced that Greg Louganis, Janet Evans, and Edwin Moses, would appear on \\"Wheaties Legends\\" boxes, which are dedicated to athletes who have retired from competition. These special edition boxes are set to hit stores for a span of three to six months starting in May. Although General Mills has denied that the petition directly impacted its decision, Louganis supporters are ecstatic. Sondgerath, the woman behind the petition, shared with the Chicago Tribune how Louganis seemed to have given up on receiving this honor, thanking her for her efforts, but having resigned himself to the idea that it would never happen. The emotional weight of this event is not lost on Louganis himself. Speaking to NPR, he reflected on his journey, saying, \\"Back in '95, I wasn't expected to live very long because we thought of HIV-AIDS as a death sentence. So to be here today, now 56, the box means so much more to me than it would have then because I feel like I'm being embraced as a whole person, not just for my athletic achievements.\\" As Greg Louganis graces the Wheaties Legends box this year, it serves as a powerful reminder of the battles athletes like him have fought, both in and out of the sporting world. His story is inspiring countless others and stirs conversations around diversity, inclusion, and the acknowledgement of talented individuals regardless of their background or personal choices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Adrian Durham. I was at Carrow Road to watch Norwich 0-0 Manchester City, and here is the Durham Dossier. Lots of expensive attacking players forgot how to score. Blunted: Strikers Edin Dzeko (left) and Alvaro Negredo (right) were left frustrated at Norwich. Manuel. Pellegrini. He hasn’t won anything in Europe as a manager, but he’s. been gifted a golden opportunity to do something special and historic at. Manchester City. It looks to me like he was out-coached by Mourinho on. Monday and had no answer, and you could even argue he was out-coached by. Chris Hughton at Norwich. Expectations: Manuel Pellegrini will be considered a failure if he can't win a trophy this season. Nous: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho out-thought Pellegrini in their midweek clash. Read Mark Ryan's report from Carrow Road. Fernandinho has been brilliant but Pellegrini has struggled to cope. without the midfielder. The elite managers are made of stronger stuff. than that. And when you need a goal I’m not sure Aleksandar Kolarov for Alvaro Negredo was. the right substitution, and indeed City didn’t score and didn’t really. threaten after that substitution. In fact Norwich looked more likely to. win it. Martin Demichelis made Chico Flores look like Rambo at one point in the second half. Being useless, the Argentine centre back completely misjudged a bouncing ball and realised it was about to sail over his head to send Gary Hooper clear on goal. Back to your feet: Manchester City's Martin Demichelis spent too much time on the ground at Carrow Road. So after feeling the slightest touch of Gary Hooper’s fingertips on his back he threw himself forward to the ground, and somehow referee Jon Moss bought it and blew for a free kick. Demichelis was booed, I suspect by his own fans as well as the Norwich faithful. Maybe Yaya Toure was frustrated with his own dreadful performance but. that’s no excuse to kick out at an opponent who’s on the floor. Ricky van Wolfswinkel and Yaya went for a ball, for some strange reason. the Ivorian decided to flick a boot at the Dutchman. He should have. seen red, City are lucky he didn’t. Another one missed by ref Jon Moss,. who should have stuck to drumming with Culture Club. In pain! Ricky van Wolfswinkel is left on the deck after receiving a kick from Yaya Toure. Distraught: The pair went up for a ball together and Van Wolfswinkel was left incandescent with rage. Norwich fans were magnificent, getting behind their team, even if celebrating a home draw like they’d won a trophy was a touch over the top. But that song they sing – 'On The Ball, City' - is just plain wrong. Not giving up: A Norwich fan sings loud and proud during the uninspiring 0-0 draw. Its opening line probably didn’t make sense when it was first penned in 1902: 'Kick off, throw in, have a little scrimmage.' Does this only have meaning in Norfolk? Fair play to them, they sung it very loud and proud. Unfortunately the last line 'Hurrah we’ve scored a goal' (I’m not joking) had no relevance to this game. Nathan Redmond. The Norwich teenager has got pace and balance, his touch is usually excellent, but his final ball – be it a shot or a cross – needs improvement. He can play wide and in the hole, and Man City really struggled to keep him quiet. If his rate of progression continues I expect him to be in the England picture by the time World Cup 2018 comes around, if not Euro 2016. Prospect: Nathan Redmond flew down the Norwich wing on more than one occasion on Saturday. Tempted to give it to Ricky van Wolfswinkel who has now scored just once in his 17 appearances. For £8.5m Norwich City expect more, that’s big money for them. But it has to go to Stevan Jovetic. He cost £22m and he looks like the kind of striker who might have the occasional brilliant game, but at Carrow Road he looked lazy and languid, and not physically made for a dust-up with the Premier League’s centre-half beasts. He was a poor man’s Dimitar Berbatov. He was taken off, unsurprisingly. Must improve. Abysmal: City's Stevan Jovetic needs to pull up his socks and prove why they spent so much money on him. Joleon Lescott’s contract is running out and he’s failed to rediscover his title winning form under the new boss; Matija Nastasic has gone backwards; and Demichelis – a genuine Pellegrini signing – is frankly awful. City have one decent centre back, Vincent Kompany. That’s poor squad management. If Pellegrini wins the quadruple or a treble then he’s a genius. If he wins a trophy he’s done well in his first season. If he wins nothing with this City squad he’s failed. Reliance: Vincent Kompany is the only world class centre defender that City have. Joseph Yobo. 13-and-a-half years after first playing in the Premier League, he slotted in straight away and looked solid at the back for Norwich alongside Sebastien Bassong. He was David Moyes first signing at Everton, and was excellent for the Toffees. If he continues the form he showed on his Canaries debut then that will be a shrewd signing from Hughton, because defensively they’ve not been great this season. Solid: Joseph Yobo is back playing in England after a spell in Turkey with Fenerbahce. Chris Hughton may possibly be doing just that. In December 1982, as a 24-year-old full back at Spurs, Hughton was interviewed about his football philosophy. The subsequent article in a football magazine was titled: 'Less Attacking – More Success'. It seemed to be a philosophy he was pursuing rigidly at Norwich, but without the success bit. But at Cardiff last week (even in defeat) Hughton’s side attacked and created chances. Against Manchester City you’d have been forgiven for thinking he would send his side out to defend. But with Anthony Pilkington, Nathan Redmond and Hooper all starting, it was more 4-3-3 than 4-5-1. Unfortunate: Gary Hooper thought he had scored for Norwich but it was ruled out for offside. Even when Hooper was injured half way through the second half Hughton resisted any temptation to sit deep, making a like-for-like substitution bringing van Wolfswinkel on. Hopefully he won’t revert to negative, defensive ways because Norwich were good to watch.Now he just needs to teach his strikers to score. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"- Norwich 0-0 Manchester City - Lots of expensive attacking players forgot how to score - Manuel Pellegrini has struggled to cope without midfielder Fernandinho - Yaya Toure's poor performance led him to kick out at an opponent, and should have seen a red card - Norwich fans were magnificent, supporting their team throughout the match - Nathan Redmond showed great potential as a future England player - Stevan Jovetic was disappointing, performing lazily and being taken off the pitch - Manchester City's poor squad management has left them with just one decent center back, Vincent Kompany - Joseph Yobo's return to the Premier League showed solidity in Norwich's defense - Chris Hughton's potential shift in football philosophy might bring success to Norwich Norwich City's game against Manchester City ended in a goalless draw, as the attacking players from both sides struggled to score throughout the match. Manchester City's coach, Manuel Pellegrini, has had a difficult time coping without midfielder Fernandinho. Yaya Toure's performance was also underwhelming, leading him to kick out at an opponent and potentially earning a red card. The Norwich fans were unwavering in their support for their team. Norwich had a strong defensive performance as well, with Joseph Yobo providing solidity and Chris Hughton potentially shifting football philosophy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Two neighboring towns from Texas produced their food in different ways. Silver town was sustainable and didn't use any fertilizers or pesticides, while Gold town did.  Which town caused more fertilizer runoff? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the two towns and their food production methods. - Silver town: sustainable, no use of fertilizers or pesticides - Gold town: uses fertilizers and pesticides Step 2: Determine which town's method contributes to fertilizer runoff. - Fertilizer runoff is caused by excess fertilizers being carried away from fields by rain or irrigation water, resulting in the contamination of nearby water bodies. Step 3: Compare the towns based on their food production methods. - Since Silver town is sustainable and doesn't use any fertilizers or pesticides, it doesn't contribute to fertilizer runoff. - Gold town, on the other hand, uses fertilizers in their food production. This makes it more likely for their fields to experience fertilizer runoff, as excess nutrients from their fertilizer use can be carried away by rainwater or irrigation. Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on the comparison. - Considering the food production methods of the two towns, Gold town caused more fertilizer runoff due to its use of fertilizers in farming, whereas Silver town didn't contribute to fertilizer runoff because of its sustainable practices and the absence of fertilizers and pesticides in its food production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Republicans ‘rein in’ the IRS in new budget after years of grievances\\" Article:","output":"Title: Republicans ‘rein in’ the IRS in new budget after years of grievances Introduction: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has faced ongoing criticism and allegations of mismanagement for years. Now, after years of grievances, the Republican Party has taken decisive action to \\"rein in\\" the tax agency. The new budget, which has been passed by the GOP-dominated legislature, is set to make significant changes to how the IRS operates to improve its reputation, efficiency, and effectiveness. Step 1: Explain the issues with the IRS Over the years, the IRS has faced numerous scandals and criticisms. These issues range from inefficiency in processing tax returns, the targeting of conservative groups for enhanced scrutiny, and budget mismanagement. The agency has faced bipartisan condemnation, with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressing frustration at the apparent unwillingness of the IRS to address these concerns. Step 2: Present the new budget's provisions The new budget, crafted by the Republican Party, is designed to address and rectify these long-standing concerns. Among its provisions, the budget includes the following measures: - Increased transparency: The IRS will now be required to disclose more information on how it spends taxpayer dollars, as well as providing regular reports to Congress on its management performance and internal audits. - Enhanced oversight: The budget establishes a new oversight board to monitor the IRS, ensuring that the agency is held accountable for any mismanagement or failures in service. - Streamlined processes: The IRS will be encouraged to invest in modernizing its IT infrastructure, hiring additional personnel, and implementing more efficient processes that improve the speed and accuracy of tax return processing. Step 3: Analyze the impact on the IRS These measures are expected to have a significant impact on the IRS. With increased transparency and oversight, it will become significantly more challenging for the agency to continue its current practices without facing repercussions. This, in turn, should create a more efficient and effective tax collection agency that can better serve its taxpayers. Additionally, the investment in modernizing the IRS's IT infrastructure will likely lead to a more streamlined and user-friendly experience for taxpayers. In the long run, this could result in an increase in taxpayer compliance and a reduction in tax fraud and evasion. Step 4: Discuss potential criticisms While the new budget's provisions are aimed at addressing the concerns and grievances surrounding the IRS, there are critics who believe that the measures do not go far enough. Some argue that the budget does not provide enough funding to truly overhaul the agency, while others believe that the entrenched bureaucracy within the IRS may prevent meaningful change from taking place. Step 5: Conclusion In conclusion, the Republican Party's new budget aims to tackle the years of grievances surrounding the IRS, with provisions designed to increase transparency, provide better oversight, and modernize the agency's processes. While critics argue that the measures may not be sufficient to bring about transformative change, the new budget represents a significant step towards addressing the systemic issues that have plagued the IRS and improving the agency's public reputation and performance. Only time will tell if these measures will be successful in reining in the IRS and ensuring that the agency operates more efficiently and fairly for the benefit of all taxpayers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

Review: Long story short, I called Cingular for the first time today and spent nearly an hour trying to get someone there to port in my old number. What a frustrating and rotten experience, including being given the wrong number to call, and then being told that it was the wrong number (by a rather rude representative) after being put on hold for a long time. After some more bad customer service, I finally got to a supervisor and told him that this was perhaps the worst \\"customer service\\" I'd ever experienced, and that this was my first and last day with Cingular. I can not imagine ever needing to call them down the road for something and going through this type of frustrating hassle again. I am going to send the phone back and order another one with ANOTHER CARRIER! Too frustrating. Answer:","output":"The customer was clearly dissatisfied with their experience with Cingular's customer service.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Petroleum jelly products like Vaseline act as a shield, helping to seal in the natural moisture of your eyelashes and eyebrows. Just simply put some Vaseline petroleum jelly on the roots of your eyelashes before going to bed.  Rinse your eyelashes with warm water in the morning. You can even rub the Vaseline on your eyebrows. You could use a Q-Tip or clean mascara brush to apply. Try applying Vaseline to your eyelashes every night while you sleep and in weeks you should have longer, thicker eyelashes. While some holistic health practitioners warn against petroleum jelly, the kind that you can buy in stores is regarded as safe by both the FDA and Health Canada. However, petroleum jelly from unregulated markets may be dangerous. Stick to brand names from trusted retailers if you use this treatment. These oils are known to strengthen and stimulate eyelash growth. You could also mix them together.  Just pour a few drops of the oil onto a Q-Tip, and then coat your eyelashes with it. Keep it on your lashes for a few minutes (around 5-8 minutes) and then rinse. Do this once a day for 1-2 weeks, and you should notice the effect soon. Also apply olive or coconut oil on your eyelids and on the skin under your eyes every night (before you go to bed) for a noticeable effect. Apply olive or coconut oil with a cotton swab. Plan not to use eye makeup on days when you use oil, as the oil could cause cosmetics like mascara to run or bleed. Despite the disgusting idea of rubbing raw eggs on your eyelashes, eggs are a very good way of getting lengthy, healthy eyelashes.  The high protein in eggs can help create thicker and longer eyelashes. In addition, eggs contain biotin and B vitamins that play a major role in improving the overall texture of your lashes. Just beat 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of glycerin until you get a thick, creamy texture. Then rub this mixture onto your eyelashes using a cotton swab and keep on for 15 minutes. Rinse off using cold water. Repeat this remedy 3 times a week for a few months. Look for glycerin at your local drugstore, pharmacy, craft store, or grocery store. Use a clean brush or a cotton swab to apply castor oil on your lashes before going to bed. You can also add a few drops of vitamin E oil to the castor oil before applying.  Leave it on overnight, then rinse it off with lukewarm water in the morning. Alternatively, mix together 2 tablespoons each of castor oil and fresh aloe vera gel. Apply it on your eyelashes using a cotton swab. Leave it on overnight, then rinse it off the next morning.  You could also add a few drops of the oil to your mascara tube. The peels are rich in vitamins C and B, folic acid and other nutrients that promote the growth of eyelashes.  Also, when infused in olive or castor oil, they will help enhance the cleansing and stimulating properties of the oil. Put 1 tablespoon of moderately dried lemon peels in a container. Pour enough olive or castor oil into the container, so that the peels get soaked. Allow the mixture to sit for a couple of weeks. Using a clean mascara stick, apply the oil on your eyelashes before going to bed. Leave it on overnight, then wash it off with warm water in the morning. Follow this remedy for a few months to get encouraging results.","output":"This article is all about how to make your eyelashes and eyebrows longer and thicker by using natural products like Vaseline, olive oil, coconut oil, eggs, lemon peels, and castor oil, which are all safe to use at home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that got married to the woman who was smuggled to Paris as a teenager? , can you please find it?   On returning to London, Moore undertook a seven-year teaching post at the Royal College of Art. He was required to work two days a week, which allowed him time to spend on his own work. His first public commission, West Wind (1928–29), was one of the eight reliefs of the 'four winds' high on the walls of London Underground's headquarters at 55 Broadway. The other 'winds' were carved by contemporary sculptors including Eric Gill with the ground-level pieces provided by Epstein.  1928 saw Moore's first solo exhibition, held at the Warren Gallery in London.  In July 1929, Moore married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the Royal College. Irina was born in Kiev in 1907 to Ukrainian–Polish parents. Her father did not return from the Russian Revolution and her mother was evacuated to Paris where she married a British army officer. Irina was smuggled to Paris a year later and went to school there until she was 16, after which she was sent to live with her stepfather's relatives in Buckinghamshire. Irina found security in her marriage to Moore and was soon posing for him. Shortly after they married, the couple moved to a studio in Hampstead at 11a Parkhill Road NW3, joining a small colony of avant-garde artists who were taking root there. Shortly afterward, Hepworth and her second husband Ben Nicholson moved into a studio around the corner from Moore, while Naum Gabo, Roland Penrose, Cecil Stephenson and the art critic Herbert Read also lived in the area (Read referred to the area as \\"a nest of gentle artists\\"). This led to a rapid cross-fertilization of ideas that Read would publicise, helping to raise Moore's public profile. The area was also a stopping-off point for many refugee artists, architects and designers from continental Europe en route to America—some of whom would later commission works from Moore. The answer is:","output":"The last name of the person that got married to the woman who was smuggled to Paris as a teenager is Moore. In the text, it is mentioned that \\"In July 1929, Moore married Irina Radetsky\\", and Irina is the woman who was smuggled to Paris as a teenager."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How did Hillary Clinton decide to choose Tim Kaine as her running mate? Choose your answer from:  (a). no.  (b). yes. The answer is:","output":"(b). yes. The two questions both ask about the reasons behind and the process of selecting Tim Kaine as the running mate for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Although the phrasing of the questions is slightly different, they essentially inquire about the same information.  To provide a detailed answer, it is important to understand the factors that played a role in Tim Kaine being chosen as Hillary Clinton's running mate. Tim Kaine, a moderate Democrat, was selected for several reasons: 1. Experience: Tim Kaine had an extensive political background, having served as the Mayor of Richmond, Governor of Virginia, and later as a U.S. Senator from Virginia. This experience made him an attractive choice for balancing the presidential ticket. 2. Swing State Advantage: Virginia is an important swing state in U.S. presidential elections, and having a running mate from this region was likely to help Clinton's chances of winning the state. Tim Kaine's popularity in Virginia made him a valuable asset for this purpose. 3. Bilingual Skills: Tim Kaine was fluent in Spanish, which could help Hillary Clinton connect with the growing Hispanic population in the United States. Kaine's language abilities and dedication to Hispanic causes potentially positioned the Clinton ticket in a favorable light within this significant voting bloc. 4. Safe Choice: Due to his moderate political views and affable personality, Tim Kaine was seen as a non-controversial and safe choice. He was unlikely to alienate any specific group or create unnecessary conflict within the Democratic Party. 5. Compatibility: It is generally believed that Clinton and Kaine had a good working relationship and compatible policy views. Their combined expertise in foreign and domestic policy created a complementary partnership focused on a strong and stable administration. In summary, the answer to both questions is yes, as they essentially ask for an explanation of the circumstances and reasons behind the selection of Tim Kaine as Hillary Clinton's running mate in the 2016 US Presidential Election."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Background: Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume.  Paragraph: Many years ago there was a beach Called Coast Brigs where many coral and other life lived. A refinery that burned coal was built nearby and over time the water nearby became very acidic. The coral and marine life died because of this but a few miles north on another beach named Greendale the same creatures are surviving just fine.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will building a refinery at Greendale cause the acidity of the water to increase or decrease? Answer:","output":"Building a refinery at Greendale could likely cause the acidity of the water to increase. The associated process of burning fossil fuels, particularly coal, results in an increase in carbon dioxide emissions. This excess carbon dioxide eventually enters the Earth's oceans, leading to ocean acidification, which as explained, is the process how carbon dioxide decreases the pH level of seawater, turning it more acidic.  In the provided background information, it is clearly indicated that the refinery built near Coast Brigs contributed to the acidity of the water in that area. Over time, the water body near the refinery became so acidic that it led to the death of coral and other marine organisms in the vicinity. Evidently, the burning of coal in the refinery led to the rise in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which then got absorbed in the ocean waters, thereby raising the acidity. Once an area of the ocean becomes too acidic due to this process, it can pose severe repercussions for the marine ecosystem. In the case of Coast Brigs, it resulted in the death of corals and marine life. This acidification tends to destroy the calcium carbonate structures of many marine organisms including shellfish and corals, which is the building block of their skeletons and shells, and thus, it impacted their survival. Drawing on this information, it is reasonable to expect that if a similar refinery were to be built at Greendale, then there would likely be a similar rise in the acidity of the surrounding water. The burning of fossil fuels would release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which would then be absorbed by the oceans, leading to an increase in acidification. As a result, the marine organisms in Greendale, like the corals and shellfish that are currently surviving, might also be at risk of dying due to the increased acidity.  However, it is important to take note that this conclusion is a projection. It relies on the assumption that the process at the new refinery would be identical to the one near Coast Brigs and that environmental conditions are overall similar. In reality, factors like further distance from the water body, cutting-edge technology to limit emissions, variation in ocean currents and temperatures, and stronger environmental legislations might mitigate some of the potential negative effects. Despite that, the basic premise remains that refineries which burn coal contribute globally to the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, thus, theoretically increasing ocean acidification."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Also known as Palazia and Laurentia, the two saints were likely born in the Eastern Roman Empire. Details about their early life and family background remain largely unknown. However, what is known is that they devoted their lives to spreading the message of Christianity and faced untold suffering for their belief. In 302 AD, during the time of the Roman Emperor Diocletian, Christians were severely persecuted, and many were subjected to horrific torture or killed. Yet, despite the oppressive atmosphere, Palatias and Laurentia continued to preach and convert people to Christianity. Their resilience and courage in the face of persecution made them beloved figures in the early Christian church. Ultimately, their unyielding commitment to their faith led to their capture by the Roman authorities. They were both brutally tortured and eventually executed in Ferma, a region near Ancona, Italy. Their death marked the end of their earthly lives but also solidified their status as Christian martyrs. In recognition of their sacrifice, a major shrine was erected in their honor at the Ancona Cathedral in Italy. The cathedral is not only an architectural masterpiece but also serves as a testament to the unbreakable spirit of Saints Palatias and Laurentia.

No The statement \\"The island of Jamaica offers a wealth of activities, sites, and attractions\\" does not support the conclusion that \\"Jamaica has no coastline.\\" In fact, being an island, Jamaica is surrounded by coastlines on all of its sides. As a Caribbean island, Jamaica is known for its beautiful beaches and coastal attractions. Jamaica's coastline measures approximately 1,022 kilometers (635 miles), offering a variety of stunning landscapes and seascapes. The island is known for its white-sand beaches such as Negril's Seven Mile Beach, Montego Bay's Doctor's Cave Beach, and Ocho Rios' Dunn's River Falls. These pristine coastal areas are popular destinations for both relaxation and adventure, enticing visitors from around the world to engage in activities such as sunbathing, swimming, snorkeling, and scuba diving. Moreover, Jamaica's coastline is also home to vibrant coral reefs, teeming with diverse marine life. Located off the coast of Port Antonio, the Blue Lagoon is a famous natural harbor with deep blue waters that are rich in marine creatures, providing excellent snorkeling opportunities. Another noteworthy coastal attraction is the Luminous Lagoon in Falmouth, where visitors experience a glowing natural phenomenon called bioluminescence, created by microscopic organisms living in the water. Aside from its sandy shores, Jamaica's coastline boasts other attractions such as historic port towns and picturesque fishing villages. Port Royal was once a notorious pirate hub in the 17th century, and its remnants can still be seen today. Other coastal communities like Treasure Beach, Old Harbour, and Little Bay offer visitors an authentic glimpse into the lives and culture of Jamaicans who reside by the sea. Furthermore, Jamaica's coastal areas contribute significantly to the island's economy, culture, and ecology. The tourism and fishing industries, for example, support the livelihoods of numerous local families and contribute to the preservation of traditional ways of life. The coastal ecosystems, including mangroves, sand dunes, and seagrass beds, provide essential habitats for a wide array of species and serve vital functions in maintaining environmental health, such as filtering pollutants, mitigating erosion, and fostering biodiversity. In conclusion, Jamaica not only has a coastline, but it is an essential aspect of the island's appeal, offering a wealth of activities, sites, and attractions for visitors to explore. The coastline's striking beauty, abundant marine life, and significant cultural and ecological value make it a defining feature of this Caribbean destination.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The title should be descriptive of the agreement, for example: Independent Consulting, Independent Contractor Agreement, or Freelance Web Design Contract. Center your title in bold type at the top of the contract like this:Independent Contractor Agreement After each name, include the title by which you will refer to that party throughout the contract. If dealing with a business, include its full legal name with the “Inc.” or “LLC” suffix; do not include the names of the individuals signing the contract on behalf of that business. Here are two examples:  This Independent Contractor Agreement (\\"Agreement\\") is made and entered into by and between, John Doe (\\"Contractor\\") and Jane Smith (\\"Client\\"). John Doe (\\"Contractor\\") and Jane Smith (\\"Client\\") agree as follows: . . . The length of the description will depend on the complexity of the job. There is no reason to make the description more complicated than necessary. Nevertheless, you should define the scope of work with sufficient clarity that the client knows the work he or she will be getting and you know what work falls inside or outside the contract.  “Contractor will help Client throw a party” is too broad. Will you provide food and music, or will you simply hire caterers and musicians to provide these services? Will you hire crew to set-up the party and/or provide cleanup? You need to provide sufficient detail so that the work doesn’t spiral beyond what you thought you were hired to do. You could write, “Contractor will organize Client’s party by hiring caterers, musicians, florists, and crew to perform set-up and take-down. Contractor will also supervise these same.”  Sometimes a short description will work. This works best for businesses that provide services that can be summarized in a brief paragraph. For example, a social media consultant might describe the job as follows: “Setting up and maintaining social media accounts for Client with Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Developing and implementing social advertising campaign, and training current staff to continue with social marketing efforts.” If you can use a short description, then you might want to type: \\"Contractor will provide Client with the following services:\\" and then leave some blank lines or space. By doing this, you can reuse the same contract for multiple jobs. With each new job, you can just type or write in the description. Some tasks are self-explanatory. If you are confident there will be no dispute over what work is to be performed, you may want to use general terms for this section of the contract.  An example of general terms (as opposed to specific) would be to say \\"paralegal services,\\" \\"secretarial services,\\" or \\"consulting,\\" instead of describing all of the functions of a paralegal, secretary, or consultant. Using general terms will allow you to leave this section unchanged from contract to contract, thereby reducing errors, and speeding up the process of producing a contract for each client. If you provide a service that relies heavily on technical or design specifications, describing a project in your freelancing contract may mean your contract is several pages long and changes drastically from one client to the next. For services such as this, you may want to describe the job as providing client with \\"services described in the attached project plan.\\" By doing this, you can then attach each client’s personal project plan to his or her contract. Using this format gives you the flexibility of describing each job in detail without having to change your entire contract for each new job.

By Leon Watson for MailOnline A father battered senseless by a man who taunted his daughter has angrily condemned British 'joke justice' after prosecutors let his attacker off with just a £400 fine.

He recalls the attacker, who appeared intoxicated, becoming increasingly aggressive as Mr. Tait attempted to calmly defuse the situation. The verbal altercation quickly escalated into a physical one, with the man launching a brutal assault on Mr. Tait. Despite several witnesses stepping forward and confirming the severity of the crime, the assailant faced minimal consequences in the form of a £400 fine. The Tait family, outraged by the lenient penalty, has been voicing their disappointment and frustration with the British justice system. Mr. Tait believes that such a light punishment not only fails to deter criminals, but also sends a dangerous message to would-be offenders, emboldening them to escalate their violent behavior. Seeking to bring attention to the issue, the Tait family has launched a campaign advocating for harsher penalties for those who commit violent acts against others, particularly when they involve unprovoked attacks on children. In addition, they are striving to garner public support, with Mr. Tait regularly sharing his story and expressing his desire for justice to be served. In response to their efforts, numerous people have come forward to share their own experiences with the British 'joke justice' system, revealing the inadequacy and failure to punish offenders as a significant problem. Together, the community is joining forces through social media campaigns, petitions, and public demonstrations to raise awareness and demand change in the way these cases are handled. As public interest grows and pressure mounts, politicians and legal authorities are being forced to review current policies and acknowledge the system's shortcomings. Discussions on revising the guidelines to impose stricter consequences for those who cause severe physical harm are now underway, with hopes that future cases will see a more appropriate response to violent offenders. Mr. Tait's bravery in confronting his daughter's harasser and his continued efforts to fight for justice have inspired many to join his cause. Through sharing his story and speaking out, he has rallied the support of his community and brought national attention to the deficiencies of the criminal justice system. In doing so, he has instigated important conversations about violence and the need for reform, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that no one has to suffer the same indignity and lack of justice that his own family has experienced. While the road to change may be long and challenging, the Tait family remains resolute in their pursuit of a more just legal system for the people of Britain, one that holds criminals accountable for their actions and provides a sense of closure and security for victims and their families."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Slobozia District (Raionul Slobozia) is an administrative district of Transnistria, Moldova. It is the southernmost district of Transnistria, located mostly south of Tiraspol. Its seat is the city of Slobozia, located at , on the river Dniester. The district contains 4 cities/towns and 12 communes (a total of 24 localities, including small villages/hamlets):  - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.  - Tîrnauca (Romanian \\"Ternivka\\", , \\"Ternovka\\") is a commune and village in the Slobozia District of Transnistria, Moldova, situated on the east bank of the river Dniester, between Tighina and Tiraspol. It is notable for being home to the largest bottle-shaped building in the world, the Butylka hotel and museum.  - A is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features a large number of extremely small \\"rooms\\" (capsules) intended to provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require the services offered by more conventional hotels.  - Tiraspol (Russian and ) is internationally recognised as the second largest city in Moldova, but is effectively the capital and administrative centre of the unrecognised Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria). The city is located on the eastern bank of the Dniester River. Tiraspol is a regional hub of light industry, such as furniture and electrical goods production.  - Butylka ( Russian for bottle ) is the name of a museum and hotel , sometimes also called the Spirit Museum Hotel . It is located in the village Tîrnauca ( Ternovka ) , 10 km from Tiraspol , the capital of Transnistria . The museum is notable for being housed inside a five - story structure shaped like a giant bottle . It is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest building in the world in the shape of a bottle . The museum features owner Grigory Korzun 's vast collection of liquor .  - The Dniester River, or Dnister River ( translit. \\"Dnister\\", , ) is a river in Eastern Europe. It runs first through Ukraine and then through Moldova (from which it separates the breakaway territory of Transnistria), finally discharging into the Black Sea on Ukrainian territory again.  - Moldavia (or \\"\\", Romanian Cyrillic alphabet: ) is a historical region, and former principality in Eastern Europe, corresponding to the territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester river. An initially independent and later autonomous state, it existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it united with Wallachia as the basis of the modern Romanian state; at various times, Moldavia included the regions of Bessarabia (with the Budjak) and all of Bukovina.   - A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a fridge and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flatscreen television and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours. In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.  - A bottle is a rigid container with a neck that is narrower than the body and a mouth. By contrast, a jar has a relatively large mouth or opening which may be as wide as the overall container. Bottles are often made of glass, clay, plastic, aluminium or other impervious materials, and typically used to store liquids such as water, milk, soft drinks, beer, wine, cooking oil, medicine, shampoo, ink, and chemicals. A device applied in the bottling line to seal the mouth of a bottle is termed an external bottle cap, closure, or internal stopper. A bottle can also be sealed by a conductive \\"innerseal\\" by using induction sealing.  - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public.  - Transnistria (Moldovan: ), officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR ); also called Transdniester, Trans-Dniestr, Transdniestria, or Pridnestrovie, is a self-proclaimed republic on a strip of land between the River Dniester and the border with Ukraine, recognised only by three non-United Nations (UN) states. The region is considered by the UN to be part of Moldova. The PMR controls most of the territory to the east of the River Dniester, and also the city of Bender and its surrounding localities on the west bank, in the historical region of Bessarabia.  - Moldova (or sometimes ), or Moldavia, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The capital city is Chiinu.  - Bessarabia (; \\"Bessarabiya\\"; \\"Besarabiya\\") is a historical region in Eastern Europe, bounded by the Dniester river on the east and the Prut river on the west. Today Bessarabia is mostly occupied by modern-day Moldova, with the Ukrainian Budjak region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian Chernivtsi Oblast covering a small area in the north.  - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world.  - Clay is a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter. Clays are plastic due to their water content and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying or firing. Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure. Depending on the soil's content in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red. Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 45 m, and colloid chemists use 1 m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 m and silt particles as being larger.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.

The time and money that doctors spend on their medical education is probably one reason for this problem. A visit to a doctor's office costs from 15 to 50 dollars. It's so expensive. Many people in the United States think that doctors are overpaid. However, most doctors disagree. They say that they were asked to study medicine for a long time. Tuition for many years of medical education costs a lot of money. Doctors say that it is necessary for most medical students to borrow money from the bank to pay their tuition. Because their money must be repaid to the bank, young doctors need to receive a lot of money for their work. So they charge people high prices for medical care. Therefore the cost of medical care in America is high. Because high tuition is one cause of high costs, one way to lower costs would be to have medical school that are free or have low tuition.

Several years earlier, Tom fell more than 100 feet during a climb and because her parents Tom and Molly (Jennifer Beals) are afraid she might hurt herself, they have ordered Maddy not to climb. Tom had some internal injuries from that earlier fall which he did not know about and now the injury has paralyzed him from the neck down. There is an experimental operation costing 250,000 which can save him, but insurance will not pay for the operation and the family does not have the money. Harderbach Financial's president Brisbane (Michael Des Barres) refuses to loan the amount and does so by putting loopholes in a contract Molly signed (he is really trying to avoid loaning any money at all). When asked if he has a heart, Brisbane coldly responds \\"This is not an emotional issue, Mrs. Phillips. A bank has no heart. Only paper in a vault\\". That is when Maddy first gets the idea to rob the bank. Maddy steals three go-carts from her father's race course (Tom has a race track where people race in go-carts) and convinces her two friends Gus (Max Thieriot) and Austin (Corbin Bleu) to help her. They remain hesitant, so she tells both of them that she loves him and does not care for the other and gives half of her friendship necklace to each of them, claiming she has the other half. They break into Harderbach Financial (a bank in which Molly had begun to work for, designing a security system). They manage to break in, but with her mother at the hospital visiting their father, she is forced to babysit her younger brother Max. She and Gus progress to a room with thousands of security deposit boxes while Austin keeps the guards away from them. Maddy has to free climb to get to the exit when her hook gets caught in a crack when using the handhelds. She cracks the code (finding it is Madeline) and they flee the room, unintentionally setting off the alarm as...

Please answer a question about the following article about Emotion: Emotions involve different components, such as subjective experience, cognitive processes, expressive behavior, psychophysiological changes, and instrumental behavior. At one time, academics attempted to identify the emotion with one of the components: William James with a subjective experience, behaviorists with instrumental behavior, psychophysiologists with physiological changes, and so on. More recently, emotion is said to consist of all the components. The different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline. In psychology and philosophy, emotion typically includes a subjective, conscious experience characterized primarily by psychophysiological expressions, biological reactions, and mental states. A similar multicomponential description of emotion is found in sociology. For example, Peggy Thoits described emotions as involving physiological components, cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, surprise etc.), expressive body actions, and the appraisal of situations and contexts.

(Associated Press)      Deborah Hersman of the National Transportation Safety Board speaks in front of a photograph of some seats of Asiana Flight 214, which crashed on Saturday, July 6, 2013, at San Francisco International... (Associated Press)      With each new bit of information, the picture emerging is of pilots who were supposed to be closely monitoring the plane's airspeed, but who didn't realize until too late that the aircraft was dangerously low and slow. Nothing disclosed so far by the National Transportation Safety Board investigators indicates any problems with the Boeing 777's engines or the functioning of its computers and automated systems.      \\"The first thing that's taught to a pilot is to look at the airspeed indicator. It is the most important instrument in the cockpit,\\" said Lee Collins, a pilot with 29 years and 18,000 hours experience flying a variety of airliners. \\"Airspeed is everything. You have airspeed, you live. You don't, you die.\\"      Investigators are still trying to nail down hundreds of details about the crash last Saturday that killed two people and injured dozens. NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman has cautioned against reaching conclusions.      But investigators already know a great deal. They've listened to the Boeing 777's voice recorder, which captured the last two hours of conversation in the cockpit. They've downloaded its flight data recorder, which captured 1,400 indicators of what was happening on the plane, from the temperatures inside and out to the positions of cockpit instruments.      The flight's four pilots have been interviewed, as have passengers and dozens of witnesses. Air traffic control recordings and video of the flight's last moments, including the crash itself, have been examined.      Here's what investigators have revealed about a Seoul-to-San Francisco flight that was normal until its last minutes, when the wide-body jet carrying 307 people rapidly lost altitude:      The pilot flying the plane, Lee Gang-kuk, 46, had nearly 10,000 hours of flying experience, but just 35 hours flying a Boeing 777. He had recently completed training that qualified him to fly passengers in the 777, and was about halfway through his post-qualification training. He was seated in the left cockpit pilot seat. In the co-pilot position was Lee Jeong-Min, an experienced captain who was supervising Lee Gang-kuk's training. It was Lee Gang-kuk's first time landing a 777 in San Francisco.      At 11:19:23 PDT, after a nearly 11-hour flight, the plane was traveling over the San Francisco Peninsula. The weather was near perfect, sunny with light winds.      Lee Jeong-Min and a third pilot sitting in a jump seat just behind the main seats, a first officer, were supposed to be monitoring the plane's controls. One of their most important jobs was to closely monitor the plane's two airspeed indicators. In the U.S., if an amber bar is more than five knots above or below the target speed during landing, the pilot flying is supposed to abort and make another attempt, according to pilots interviewed by The Associated Press.      As the plane descended to 1,600 feet, the autopilot was turned off. At 1,400 feet, the plane's airspeed was about 170 knots.      The flight data recorder shows the plane's autothrottle _ similar to a car's cruise control _ was set on idle during the approach, Hersman said, and that there were multiple commands at times given to the autothrottle and autopilot.      At 11:26:58 and 1,000 feet, the pilots made contact with the airport tower. When they were cleared to land 12 seconds later, the plane's altitude had dropped to about 600 feet. The plane was configured for its approach and the landing gear was down. The airspeed was about 149 knots. A target speed of 137 knots was set.      At 500 feet there was an audible automated altitude alert. The airspeed was about 134 knots. At this point that pilots realized they weren't properly lined up with the runway, Hersman said.      \\"Between 500 and 200 feet, they had a lateral deviation and they were low. They were trying to correct at that point,\\" she said.      At 200 feet and another automated altitude call out, the airspeed had slowed to 118 knots _ well below the target level.      At this point, U.S. pilots would typically call for an aborted landing because the plane was more than 5 knots below its target speed, Collins said. But at no point in between 500 and 100 feet does the voice recorder show the pilots making any comment related to airspeed, Hersman said at a briefing Thursday.      Hersman said at earlier briefings that it was not until 200 feet _ 16 seconds before impact _ that Lee Jeong-Min, the instructor pilot \\"recognized the auto-throttles were not maintaining speed.\\"      At 125 feet and 112 knots, both throttles started moving forward, indicating more fuel was being sent to the engines to increase power and speed. That was eight seconds before impact. Even if the autothrottles weren't fully turned on, either of the pilots in the two front seats could reach down and manually push the throttle levers forward to increase power.      It was about this time that the cockpit voice recorder indicated the first officer _ the third pilot seating behind the front two pilots _ realized the plane was traveling too slowly and called for an increase in speed.      A second later, Lee Gang-kuk's yoke can be heard rattling violently on the voice recorder. This is the sound of a stick shaker going off, a piece of safety equipment that tells a pilot the plane is about to stall because it has slowed to a dangerous speed and lost lift.      When the pilots in the two front seats realized the plane was in trouble, they both reached for the throttle. Passengers heard a loud roar as the plane revved up in a last-minute attempt to abort the landing.      At three seconds before impact, the plane reached its slowest speed of 103 knots. Its engines were at 50 percent power and power was increasing. At this time, one of the pilots called for an aborted landing.      At one and a half seconds before impact, another of the pilots calls for an aborted landing.      At 11:28, with the airspeed up three knots, the landing gear, followed by the plane's tail, collided with the seawall just short of Runway 28 Left. The plane careened wildly before slamming down onto the tarmac and sliding about 1,000 feet. The tail was sheared off and three flight attendants seated in the back of the plane fell out. Rocks from the seawall and pieces of the mangled landing gear were strewn along the runway.      The NTSB's investigation is being followed closely by pilots in the U.S. and around the world. At one gathering of pilots in Dallas Wednesday night, the discussion centered on why the Asiana pilots didn't realize their low speed sooner. No one had an answer.      \\"There are a lot of very experienced airline pilots who are scratching their heads right now,\\" Collins said. ||||| US crash investigators looking into the Asiana accident have provided an unusual amount of information to the public. Is that heading off conspiracy theories or creating confusion?      From Twitter pictures of the burned cabin to a second-by-second account of the aircraft’s flight speed, investigators are being unusually forthcoming with details about the Asiana Airlines crash at the San Francisco airport, leading some to champion a new era of transparency while others warn it does more harm than good.      In the days since the July 6 crash, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released detailed information about its investigation including timelines, pictures, and information about the pilot’s background that some transportation analysts say is unprecedented.      “The NTSB has always been available to answer journalists’ questions after aviation accidents, but it often took a degree in aeronautics or long years on the airline beat to understand what was being said. This crash, however, is being explained in real time and in much simpler terms than in the past,” former transportation journalist Micheline Maynard wrote in a Forbes column this week.      In the past five days the agency has tweeted and posted multiple pictures of the aircraft on its website, uploaded videos of its daily briefings, and provided thorough accounts of the plane speed, hours of experience of the pilots, and cockpit conversations.      In comparison, information about the last fatal accident in the United States involving a commercial flight was slower and more traditional. When a Continental Express flight crashed while approaching the Buffalo airport in February 2009, there was no social media stream with photo and video footage.      The new transparency is particularly worrisome to the Air Line Pilots Association, which released a statement this week saying that it is “stunned by the amount of detailed operational data from on-board recorders released by the [NTSB] this soon into the investigation.”      The union, which represents only American pilots, has particular reason to be concerned with much of the preliminary media reports focusing on what role pilot error played in the crash. But it contends that the level of information released could adversely affect the investigation:      “It is imperative that safety investigators refrain from prematurely releasing the information from on-board recording devices,” the organization wrote. “We have seen in the past that publicizing this data before all of it can be collected and analyzed leads to erroneous conclusions that can actually interfere with the investigative process.”      Deborah Hersman, chairman of the NTSB, responded to the criticism by telling the press her organization is responsible to the public.      “We are the advocate for the traveling public,” Ms. Hersman said Tuesday.      Hersman, who at age 39 became the youngest chairman of the NTSB when she was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2009, has become the face of the new transparency push as she holds daily press conferences in San Francisco and multiple interviews with cable news outlets.      “Since she's taken over, it seems like information has been much more accessible to the public,\\" Frank Pitre, a lawyer who closely follows the agency and is representing two passengers who were on the Asiana flight, told the San Francisco Chronicle.      Hersman also faces a public with more tools at its disposal for doing its own investigative work. Websites like Flight Aware provide radar data for the Asiana Flight, and anonymous users quickly posted what they claim as the tape of the conversation between air-traffic controllers and the Asiana pilots      “What we know is that if you don’t put the facts out there, in a vacuum other people will create them,” Hersman said in an interview with CBS News. Her organization’s use of social media channels is “about having a conversation with the people who care about the work you do.”      According to Bloomberg, which pulled user comments from the forums at Flyertalk.com, Hersman's approach is earning mixed reviews. Among the postings:      astroflyer: “In the age of twitter, I don’t think it makes sense to withhold any findings at all until 9 months down the road. A large plane crashed at a major American airport. People want to know why and whether the cause might be relevant to their own future flying.”      Milepost: “I expect tomorrow D. Hersman will be detailing the pilots meals and calorie counts, their favorite colors, and answering the eternal question: boxers or briefs. I still think too much raw data is being disclosed in isolated bits and pieces that allow for too much amateur conjecturing, without having gone through the critical review and piece-it-all together analysis.” ||||| SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tapes of 911 emergency calls made moments after an Asiana Airlines jet crashed at San Francisco airport last Saturday reveal panic and confusion, and highlight some possible problems as emergency services raced to the scene.      Passengers evacuate from a Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft after a crash landing at San Francisco International Airport in California July 6, 2013 in this file handout photo provided by passenger Eugene Anthony Rah released to Reuters on July 8, 2013. REUTERS/Eugene Anthony Rah/Handout via Reuters/Files      The crash of the Boeing 777 killed two and injured more than 180. The first police and fire personnel arrived at the crash scene in about two minutes, and local officials said brave rescue efforts and effective triage of the many wounded likely saved lives.      Still, the 11 minutes of 911 tapes released by the California Highway Patrol portray a tense and sometimes chaotic situation as severely injured passengers awaited help.      “There are people laying on the tarmac with critical injuries, head injuries. We’re almost losing a woman here,” one passenger said in a taped call, stating she had been waiting for 20 to 30 minutes.      The tapes appear to confirm witness accounts that several people were left unattended near the end of the runway as emergency crews focused on the main crash site.      “We have people over here who weren’t found,” another 911 caller said.      Three flight attendants and one Chinese student, who died in the accident, were ejected from the back of the plane after the tail broke off, according to National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Deborah Hersman.      Officials are also investigating whether one of the two Chinese teenagers killed in the crash was run over by a fire truck, according to the San Francisco Fire Department. The large number of non-English-speaking passengers also presented some unexpected problems.      “We’re looking at this, and what we can learn from it,” Rob Dudgeon, deputy director of the department of emergency management at the city and county of San Francisco, said in a phone interview on Thursday.      ‘SOMETHING OUT OF A NIGHTMARE’      At a news conference on Monday, police and firefighters described a dramatic scene of running up an emergency escape chute to board the burning aircraft, handing out knives so crew could cut trapped people free, and tearing away seats and luggage to clear choked exit paths.      “It was like something out of a nightmare,” said San Francisco police officer Jim Cunningham, describing a plane cabin filling with thick black smoke as rescuers worked to free a few trapped passengers even after most had gotten off safely.      The call to evacuate the plane was made 90 seconds after it came to a halt on the runway, Hersman said on Wednesday. The crew first told passengers to remain seated, but an evacuation began after a flight attendant reported seeing fire outside the plane.      The NTSB will examine whether proper evacuation procedures were followed, Hersman said, adding that “hindsight is 20/20.”      Some passengers on the taped 911 calls reported not seeing ambulances and fire trucks.      But emergency responders say procedures call for not bringing vehicles too close to the scene, in order to avoid chaos and collisions. In this case, there was also a worry that the plane could explode, said Mindy Talmadge, a spokesman for the San Francisco Fire Department.      “There’s active fire, and there’s fuel leaking, and there’s debris all over the field, the last thing you want to do is take a chance of the plane exploding,” she said in a phone interview on Thursday. A fire burned through much of the plane’s cabin, although Hersman said the fuel tanks did not rupture.      Dudgeon said procedures called for a methodical approach in identifying the injured, starting in one spot and working forward. That could potentially leave some victims unattended for many minutes.      “If you start to worry about go here, go there, you miss things,” Dudgeon said. “As a paramedic, when you’re doing triage, you start where you are. You keep moving forward until you’ve triaged everybody.”      Naj Meshkati, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies aviation safety, said he recalled other plane crashes where passenger groups were overlooked initially.      “In this day and age that we have the GPS and the surveillance camera system, I think something should be changed and could be changed,” he said, adding that overall emergency response at the crash “worked beautifully.”      Some 40 to 50 ambulances were sent to the crash site, said Dr. John Brown, medical director for Emergency Management Services, San Francisco. Some left the scene with up to five injured people in them to make sure the critically injured arrived quickly at hospitals, he said.      ‘OVERALL, SYSTEM WORKED WELL’      The most sensitive issue for responders in the aftermath of the crash was whether they may have inadvertently caused one of the fatalities.      Robert Foucrault, coroner for San Mateo County, where the airport is located, said autopsy results on how two Chinese teenage girls died would be released in about two weeks.      Emergency personnel declined to comment specifically on the matter. Dudgeon said that generally speaking, emergency-vehicle drivers are trained to look everywhere around them. “Everybody’s eyes are everywhere,” he said. “It’s heads on a swivel.”      The triage of the injured resulted in some non-English speaking victims being separated from their families. Most of the passengers on the flight were Chinese and Korean, and it is not clear if any of the emergency responders spoke those languages.      Passenger Eugene Rah recalled helping a non-English speaker whose injured wife was sent to San Francisco General Hospital.      “He was very nervous,” Rah said on Monday, adding that for several hours the man was not sure where his wife was or what condition she was in.      Medical personnel say the most important thing is to make sure the most critically injured patients get treatment as quickly as possible, even if it means separating families.      “The psycho-social issues are real, but they’re trumped by the medical issues,” said Chris Barton, chief of emergency medicine at San Francisco General Hospital, which received 66 injured passengers and crew.      In some cases, when uninjured Korean or Chinese children arrived at the hospital with their injured parents, the hospital admitted the children to the pediatric ward so they would have a place to stay and would not be separated from their recuperating parents, he said.      Barton and other area hospital staffers said the response by emergency personnel on the crash site was impressive, with patients arriving promptly and with initial care, such as drip systems for intravenous fluids, already handled.      “Overall, the system worked well,” Barton said. “The triage, the communication.”      That was not always apparent to passengers on the scene.      Slideshow (3 Images)      “There’s not enough medics out here,” one 911 caller said, saying a woman on the runway was “pretty much burned, very severely on the head, and we don’t know what to do.      “She will probably die soon if she doesn’t get help,” the female caller said. “Is there any way we can assist her?”      To another caller, who said he had yet to see a fire truck, the dispatcher said, “We are responding, trust me.” ||||| The wreckage of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 lies near the San Francisco runway July 7. (Photo: NTSB via Getty Images) Story Highlights Light may have been sunlight reflecting off the bay      Investigators found the plane was too low and too slow in its approach      The worst of the fire came around the right engine      Federal crash investigators say the Asiana Airlines pilot who saw a bright light before the crash said it didn't affect the plane's approach into San Francisco International Airport.      Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, had said Wednesday that the pilot complained of a bright light that temporarily blinded him. She clarified Thursday that the pilot saw the light while about 500 feet in the air and that it might have been sun reflecting off the bay, but that the pilot wasn't sure.      Hersman said the pilot described turning his head and then looking back and finding that his vision wasn't impaired because he could still see the plane's controls. She said neither of the pilots mentioned the light during interviews and there is no discussion about it on the cockpit-voice recorder.      \\"The light source was straight in front of the airplane but not on the runway,\\" Hersman said. \\"He stated that he did not think the light affected his vision.\\"      Two passengers died in the crash when Flight 214 slammed into a seawall Saturday at the end of the runway. The impact ripped off the back of the plane and tossed three flight attendants and their seats onto the runway.      Investigators found the plane was too low and too slow in its approach, but the investigation into whether pilots or equipment are to blame is expected to take 12 to 18 months.      Hersman added details in her final on-scene briefing about the plane's approach from 500 feet above ground, when the plane was going 134 knots. The crew's target was to land at 137 knots, but the plane slowed to 103 knots just before impact.      Hersman said there was no mention of the plane's speed until nine seconds before impact, when it was about 100 feet in the air.      \\"Almost immediately after that is the first comment about speed,\\" Hersman said.      Then at three seconds before impact and again at 1.5 seconds before, crewmembers call to abort the landing, Hersman said.      The worst of the fire came around the right engine, which leaked oil after the crash, Hersman said. But she said firefighters entering the cabin at the left door just in front of the wings found nearly pristine seats before the fire spread inside and destroyed them. The floor was damaged a bit between the third and fourth doors, and worst behind the fourth door.      After gathering perishable information at the scene, she said, investigators will spend months sifting through data and interviews to determine what happened.      \\"This is just the tip of the iceberg,\\" Hersman said.

Investigators discovered that the pilots didn't realize the plane was going too slow and too low until it was too late. To understand what happened, they listened to the voice recorder from the cockpit, looked at the positions of the cockpit instruments, interviewed the pilots, passengers, and witnesses, and examined video of the crash. The plane lost altitude quickly as it approached the runway, and although the pilots tried to correct it, the plane was still going too slow. At the last moment, they tried to abort the landing, but the plane hit a seawall just short of the runway."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the below context:  Against this background, a \\"great assembly\\" was organised by the Manchester Patriotic Union formed by radicals from the Manchester Observer. The newspaper's founder Joseph Johnson was the union's secretary. He wrote to Henry Hunt asking him to chair a meeting in Manchester on 2 August 1819. Johnson wrote: Nothing but ruin and starvation stare one in the face [in the streets of Manchester and the surrounding towns], the state of this district is truly dreadful, and I believe nothing but the greatest exertions can prevent an insurrection. Oh, that you in London were prepared for it. Unknown to Johnson and Hunt, the letter was intercepted by government spies and copied before being sent to its destination. The contents were interpreted to mean that an insurrection was being planned, and the government responded by ordering the 15th Hussars to Manchester. The mass public meeting planned for 2 August was delayed until 9 August. The Manchester Observer reported it was called \\"to take into consideration the most speedy and effectual mode of obtaining Radical reform in the Common House of Parliament\\" and \\"to consider the propriety of the 'Unrepresented Inhabitants of Manchester' electing a person to represent them in Parliament\\". The magistrates, led by William Hulton, had been advised by the acting Home Secretary, Henry Hobhouse, that \\"the election of a member of parliament without the King's writ\\" was a serious misdemeanour, encouraging them to declare the assembly illegal as soon as it was announced on 31 July.   The radicals sought a second opinion on the meeting's legality which was that \\"The intention of choosing Representatives, contrary to the existing law, tends greatly to render the proposed Meeting seditious; under those circumstances it would be deemed justifiable in the Magistrates to prevent such Meeting.\\"On 3 August, Hobhouse conveyed the view of the Attorney-General that the magistrates were incorrect to declare 9 August meeting illegal as it was called to consider the election of a representative and...

Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \\"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \\"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \\"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help.

These are virtually still images revealing the key elements of the film: Justine (Kirsten Dunst) the bride in deep melancholy with birds falling behind her; of a lawn with trees and a sundial with two different shadows; Pieter Breughel's Hunters in the Snow (often used as interpretation of an idealised nostalgia) the non existent 19th hole (limbo) and the Black Horse collapsing catastrophically in slow motion (id/ego battle); Justine as a bride being swept along by a river; and her being held back by her wedding dress; and finally Justine and her nephew building their magic cave before the earth crashes into Melancholia becoming one. The film continues in two parts.Part One: \\"Justine\\" is of an ideal and perfect wedding that sweeps bride Justine along and which clashes with Justines fragile world.This act begins with an clumsy, oversized wedding vehicle unable to negotiate a curve in the road.Newlyweds Justine and Michael (Alexander Skarsgård) arrive two hours late to their own reception at the family estate where Justine's sister Claire and her husband John reside. Justine happens to notice a particularly bright red star in the twilight sky which John identifies as Antares.During the course of the wedding we realise that each of the characters represent a metaphor. These metaphors are developed during the night of the wedding reception. Her brother-in-law, John, represents sacrifice (cost of the wedding) and social conformity. Her dad is hedonistic and selfish therefore unable to connect at a meaningful level with Justine. Her mother ,Gaby (honesty) is brutally; ruthlessly and pathologically honest which gets her thrown out of the wedding. However Justines sister ,Claire, who represents order urges Justine to dishonestly hide her debilitating melancholy from her bland, gormless, doting husband, Michael, (This is highlighted by his wedding speech) and anyway...

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Swiss Mennonite Conference (also Konferenz der Mennoniten der Schweiz or Conférence Mennonite Suisse) is an Anabaptist Christian body in Switzerland.  - Conrad Grebel ( c. 1498 -- 1526 ) , son of a prominent Swiss merchant and councilman , was a co-founder of the Swiss Brethren movement . In 1961 a Mennonite University College was named after him in Waterloo , Ontario .  - Friesland (official) or Frisia is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands. It is situated west of Groningen, northwest of Drenthe and Overijssel, north of Flevoland, northeast of North Holland, and south of the North Sea. In 2010, the province had a population of 646,000 and a total area of .  - The Swiss Brethren are a branch of Anabaptism that started in Zürich, spread to nearby cities and towns, and then was exported to neighboring countries. Today's Swiss Mennonite Conference can be traced to the Swiss Brethren.  - In the Christian gospels, the ministry of Jesus begins with his baptism in the countryside of Roman Judea and Transjordan, near the river Jordan, and ends in Jerusalem, following the Last Supper with his disciples. The Gospel of Luke states that Jesus was \\"about 30 years of age\\" at the start of his ministry. A chronology of Jesus typically has the date of the start of his ministry estimated at around AD 2729 and the end in the range AD 3036. Jesus' \\"Early Galilean ministry\\" begins when after his Baptism, he goes back to Galilee from his time in the Judean desert. In this early period he preaches around Galilee and recruits his first disciples who begin to travel with him and eventually form the core of the early Church as it is believed that the Apostles dispersed from Jerusalem to found the Apostolic Sees. The \\"Major Galilean ministry\\" which begins in Matthew 8 includes the commissioning of the Twelve Apostles, and covers most of the ministry of Jesus in Galilee. The \\"Final Galilean ministry\\" begins after the death of John the Baptist as Jesus prepares to go to Jerusalem.  - The Mennonites are Christian groups belonging to the church communities of Anabaptist denominations named after Menno Simons (14961561) of Friesland (which today is a province of the Netherlands). Through his writings, Simons articulated and formalized the teachings of earlier Swiss founders. The early teachings of the Mennonites were founded on the belief in both the mission and ministry of Jesus, which the original Anabaptist followers held to with great conviction despite persecution by the various Roman Catholic and Protestant states. Rather than fight, the majority of these followers survived by fleeing to neighboring states where ruling families were tolerant of their radical belief in believer's baptism. Over the years, Mennonites have become known as one of the historic peace churches because of their commitment to pacifism.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'country of citizenship' with 'switzerland'. Answer:","output":"The entity that has the relation 'country of citizenship' with 'Switzerland' is the Swiss Mennonite Conference (also Konferenz der Mennoniten der Schweiz or Conférence Mennonite Suisse). This Anabaptist Christian body is based in Switzerland and traces its roots back to the Swiss Brethren movement, which was co-founded by Conrad Grebel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
