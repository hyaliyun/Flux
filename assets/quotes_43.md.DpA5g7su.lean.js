The change could help Twitter improve its private messaging capabilities and become a more competitive player in the messaging space.

However, it's still unclear how Twitter plans to make money from its direct messaging feature.","output":"Twitter has boosted its direct messaging system with an update that now allows users to send and receive messages from anyone who follows them, regardless of whether users follow each other, as reported by The Next Web. This latest development is expected to enhance Twitter's private messaging features, giving the social media platform an edge in the messaging sphere. With the expanded messaging options, Twitter is looking to compete more handsomely with other messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and iMessage. Some users see this update as an indication that Twitter is looking for new ways to monetize its platform. The addition of sponsored direct messages or improving advertisement targeting capabilities for marketers are some of the potential options being floated around as to how Twitter can best earn money from its direct messaging feature. Twitter has been struggling to grow its user base in recent years and has been unable to attract new users at the same pace as other social networks. The direct messaging feature has been one of the most-used features of the platform, and by improving it, Twitter could earn significant revenue by selling ads within its direct messaging system. Despite concerns about Twitter's future earnings prospects, the company's executives claim that there is no set plan for monetizing the new messaging system. Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey has said that his team's focus is on improving the platform's user experience and he was confident that this latest update was a step towards achieving that goal. The expansion of Twitter's direct messaging capabilities could give the company a significant advantage in a highly competitive and lucrative market, as it revamps its offerings to entice both advertisers and users.

This new treatment has the potential to revolutionize the way doctors treat this condition and has given patients new hope for a better quality of life. The new treatment works by targeting a specific protein that is known to play a role in the development and progression of the condition. By blocking the activity of this protein, the new treatment is able to slow or stop the progression of the condition and in some cases, even reverse its effects. Patients who have received this new treatment have reported significant improvements in their symptoms, including reduced pain and inflammation, fewer flare-ups, and better mobility. In clinical trials, the treatment has been shown to be effective in a majority of patients who received it, with few side effects reported. The potential impact of this new treatment on patients is significant. For those who have been suffering from this previously untreatable condition, the new treatment offers a ray of hope, providing an opportunity for them to live a healthier, more comfortable life. It also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs by reducing the need for expensive and invasive treatments that are currently used to manage the condition. While the new treatment is still in its early stages of development, the promising results from early trials suggest that it has the potential to change the lives of millions of people who suffer from this condition.

The study revealed that smoking could damage DNA in various organs, including the lungs, bladder, and liver. The study's lead author, Dr. John Doe, stated that the findings show that smoking could cause not just cancer but a variety of other illnesses. The researchers analyzed data from more than 16,000 individuals from three different studies to determine the long-term effects of smoking on DNA. The study found that smoking can cause serious and long-lasting damage to DNA. Specific changes to the DNA were also identified, which could point to disease development in the future. Dr. Doe explained that the DNA damage caused by smoking does not go away when the person quits smoking. Even when a person stops smoking, the damage already done to their DNA can persist, making them more susceptible to diseases such as cancer. The centerpiece of the study was the identification of a pattern of genetic changes in the DNA of smokers. These changes pointed to inflammation as a cause of tissue damage, a process that could ultimately lead to cancer, said Dr. Doe. These findings have far-reaching implications for public health. As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the health costs of smoking can run into billions of dollars. Now, with the long-term damage that smoking can inflict on DNA, these costs are expected to rise tremendously. Overall, this study underlines the serious health risks of smoking and emphasizes the need for anti-smoking campaigns, policies, and regulations.

Write an article detailing the discovery and what it means for the search for extraterrestrial life.","output":"Article: Scientists Discover New Exoplanet That May Support Life A new exoplanet has been discovered outside our solar system that could potentially harbor life. The planet, named Ross 128 b, is located just 11 light-years away from Earth and has been described as a \\"temperate\\" world, meaning it has the right conditions for liquid water to exist on its surface. It was found using an instrument called the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), based at the European Southern Observatory's La Silla Observatory in Chile. The team estimates that Ross 128 b has a mass similar to Earth's and orbits its star every 9.9 days. One of the most exciting features of this newly discovered planet is its proximity to Earth. At just 11 light-years away, it is one of the closest exoplanets to us that could potentially host life. Ross 128 is a relatively cool and inactive red dwarf star, making it a prime candidate for having a habitable planet in its orbit. While it is still too early to tell if Ross 128 b actually harbors any life, the discovery of this exoplanet brings us one step closer to finding extraterrestrial life. The quest to understand if there is other life in the universe is one of the great scientific pursuits of our time, and the discovery of planets like Ross 128 b is a promising sign. Over the past few years, scientists have discovered thousands of exoplanets, many of which are located in their star's habitable zone - the region around a star where conditions could potentially support liquid water and, therefore, life. However, Ross 128 b stands out from many other exoplanets due to its proximity and its potential for stable climate conditions. Despite its positive prospects, there are still many unknowns about this exoplanet. Additional observations and research will be necessary to determine whether or not Ross 128 b actually has an atmosphere and if it does, whether that atmosphere could support life. However, the discovery of this planet is a promising step forward in our search for extraterrestrial life. In conclusion, the discovery of Ross 128 b is an exciting breakthrough in the quest to find life outside our solar system. As technology advances, we are discovering more and more exoplanets that could potentially harbor life, and we are closer than ever to answering one of the biggest scientific questions of our time: Are we alone in the universe?"},{"instruction":"The Eiffel Tower is a wroughtiron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.

The country's soybean crop is expected to fall by about 10% this year, according to the national agricultural agency CONAB. Though it's still early in the growing season, the lack of water is already causing problems for farmers. In Argentina, farmers are facing similar challenges. The country's corn and soybean crops are expected to decline by 15% and 8%, respectively, due to the drought. The situation is worsened by the fact that Argentina is already grappling with economic issues and currency devaluation. Chile and Uruguay are also being impacted by the drought. In Chile, the lack of rainfall is affecting fruit production, while in Uruguay, farmers are struggling to grow crops such as rice and soybeans. Experts say that climate change is likely worsening the drought. South America is situated between two oceans, and changes in ocean currents can affect rainfall patterns. Additionally, deforestation and other human activities can exacerbate weather patterns, making them more extreme. The agricultural sector in the region is a major contributor to the economy, and the current drought is likely to have far-reaching consequences. Countries may need to import more food to make up for the shortfalls in production, driving up prices and exacerbating food insecurity. Efforts are underway to address the crisis. In Brazil, the government is offering financial aid to farmers affected by the drought, while Argentina's government has declared a state of agricultural emergency.

La palabra \\"cover\\" en inglés efectivamente funciona por sí sola como sustantivo con el significado de \\"cubierta\\". Cuando decimos \\"cover\\" como sustantivo, estamos hablando de algo que cubre, protege o encierra otra cosa, como la tapa de un recipiente, la cubierta de un libro, o incluso en un sentido más abstracto como cobertura en seguros. El término \\"covering\\", por otro lado, también es un sustantivo, pero tiende a enfocarse más en la idea de algo que actúa cubriendo, como material o tejido que cubre. \\"Covering\\" sugiere más bien la acción de cubrir realizada o el material usado para cubrir. Se utiliza, por ejemplo, para hablar de materiales que sirven específicamente para cubrir algo, como el revestimiento de un mueble, la tela para tapizar, o materiales de construcción. En resumen, aunque ambos pueden traducirse al español como \\"cubierta\\", \\"cover\\" se utiliza más frecuentemente para objetos específicos que actúan como la tapa o protección de algo (pudiendo ser estos objetos tangibles o conceptuales), mientras que \\"covering\\" se inclina más hacia el material o sustancia que se usa para cubrir o revestir algo. Ejemplos para diferenciarlos: - \\"Book cover\\" (La cubierta del libro). - \\"Floor covering\\" (Revestimiento o cubrimiento del suelo). Ambas palabras cumplen la función de nombrar algo que cubre, pero su uso se inclina por distintas preferencias contextuales y semánticas."},{"instruction":"vale puedes resumir esa explicacion de forma sencilla y practica en un par de oraciones, una por cada significado","output":"Claro, aquí tienes una forma sencilla y práctica de entenderlo: - **Cover**: Se refiere a algo específico que actúa como tapa o protección, como la **cubierta** de un libro o la **tapa** de un frasco.

Putting it all together, the line \`ws.Cells(i, 7).Value = numericValue\` is used within a VBA macro to iterate over a series of rows (thanks to \`i\` being part of what is likely a loop), and for each of these rows, insert the value from \`numericValue\` into the 7th column (column G) of the worksheet represented by \`ws\`.

Aquí hay algunos pasos y sugerencias para abordar y solucionar tu problema: 1. **Verificar la Existencia del Color**: Asegúrate de que el color \`material_dynamic_neutral60\` esté definido en tu archivo \`colors.xml\` bajo la carpeta \`res/values\`. Si estás utilizando los colores Material Design introducidos en versiones más recientes de Android, verifica que tu aplicación sea compatible con esas versiones. 2. **Compatibilidad de Temas y Versiones**: Ten en cuenta que los colores dinámicos (como sugiere el nombre de tu color) son una característica relativamente nueva y pueden no ser soportados en versiones más antiguas de Android. Si estás apuntando a versiones antiguas, considera proporcionar una alternativa para esos casos. 3. **Usar una Imagen Directamente**: Si prefieres usar una imagen de fondo para tu \`ImageView\` y planeas reemplazarla mediante código tras tomar una foto, pero sin usar Java directamente, considera definir una imagen por defecto dentro de tu archivo XML. Por ejemplo, podrías tener una imagen llamada \`default_background.png\` en tu carpeta \`res/drawable\` y en tu XML harías algo así: \`\`\`xml <ImageView android:layout_width=\\"wrap_content\\" android:layout_height=\\"wrap_content\\" android:src=\\"@drawable/default_background\\" /> \`\`\` 4. **Editar el XML para Uso de Imagen de Fondo**: Para establecer una imagen de fondo en un \`ImageView\` directamente desde XML, usualmente utilizas \`android:src=\\"@drawable/your_image\\"\` para referenciar una imagen en tu carpeta \`drawable\`. NOTA: el uso de \`android:background\` establece el fondo del componente, pero para un \`ImageView\`, usualmente manipularías el \`src\` para cambiar la imagen mostrada. 5. **Reemplazar la Imagen sin Código Java**: Aunque mencionas que prefieres no usar código Java para cambiar la imagen después de tomar una foto, la manipulación de elementos de UI basados en acciones del usuario (como capturar una foto) generalmente requiere algo de interacción a nivel de código. Sin embargo, las Data Bindings o View Bindings pueden ofrecer una aproximación más declarativa, aún requerirán que tu lógica de selección/resolución de imágenes esté implementada en el código que maneja el resultado de la captura de la foto. Si después de asegurarte de que \`material_dynamic_neutral60\` está correctamente definido y aún enfrentas problemas, podría ser útil revisar los logs de error (\`logcat\`) para obtener más información específica del problema. La compatibilidad y la versión mínima de API (definida en tu \`build.gradle\` bajo \`minSdkVersion\`) también juegan un papel crucial al considerar características como colores/materials dinámicos."},{"instruction":"se puede poner un fondo al imageview sin usar el apartado de colors","output":"Sí, es posible establecer un fondo en un \`ImageView\` sin usar directamente el apartado de colores, refiriéndote a usar imágenes o incluso otros recursos drawable en lugar de definir un color sólido. Aquí te muestro cómo puedes hacerlo: # Usar un drawable como fondo Puedes colocar cualquier imagen o drawable como fondo del \`ImageView\` utilizando el atributo \`android:src\` para el contenido principal de la imagen o \`android:background\` para el fondo del view. Aquí tienes un ejemplo usando \`android:src\`: \`\`\`xml <ImageView android:layout_width=\\"match_parent\\" android:layout_height=\\"match_parent\\" android:src=\\"@drawable/tu_imagen\\" /> \`\`\` Y aquí un ejemplo utilizando \`android:background\`: \`\`\`xml <ImageView android:layout_width=\\"match_parent\\" android:layout_height=\\"match_parent\\" android:background=\\"@drawable/tu_imagen_de_fondo\\" /> \`\`\` En ambos casos, \`@drawable/tu_imagen\` y \`@drawable/tu_imagen_de_fondo\` se refieren a archivos de imagen que deberías tener en la carpeta \`/res/drawable\` de tu proyecto Android. # Gradientes y otros drawables Aparte de imágenes, puedes utilizar cualquier otro recurso Drawable, como gradientes, para establecer como fondo. Por ejemplo, podrías tener un archivo XML de gradiente llamado \`background_gradient.xml\` ubicado en tu carpeta \`/res/drawable\`: \`\`\`xml <?xml version=\\"1.0\\" encoding=\\"utf-8\\"?> <shape xmlns:android=\\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\\" android:shape=\\"rectangle\\" > <gradient android:startColor=\\"#FF0000\\" android:endColor=\\"#00FF00\\" android:angle=\\"45\\"/> </shape> \`\`\` Y luego puedes referenciar este archivo como fondo de tu ImageView: \`\`\`xml <ImageView android:layout_width=\\"wrap_content\\" android:layout_height=\\"wrap_content\\" android:background=\\"@drawable/background_gradient\\" /> \`\`\` # Notas adicionales - Ten en cuenta que \`android:src\` es útil para imágenes que quieres mostrar manteniendo la relación de aspecto, mientras que \`android:background\` establece el drawable como un fondo que puede estirarse para cubrir todo el \`ImageView\`. - La manipulación de imágenes a nivel de XML es bastante limitada. Para funcionalidades más avanzadas, como cargar una nueva imagen cuando se toma una foto, generalmente requerirás implementar alguna lógica en tu código.

Una vez que el usuario se registra o inicia sesión, la contraseña no se almacena ni se puede recuperar de manera sencilla. Si necesitas que el usuario ingrese su contraseña por alguna razón (por ejemplo, para una funcionalidad de re-autenticación), deberás pedirle que la ingrese de nuevo. 2. **Recuperar el nombre y apellido:** Si estás almacenando el nombre y apellido del usuario en Firestore en el momento del registro, puedes recuperar estos datos realizando una consulta a Firestore donde busques el documento asociado al ID del usuario autenticado. Suponiendo que guardaste los datos del usuario en una colección llamada \`\\"usuarios\\"\` y que el documento tiene el mismo ID que el proporcionado por \`FirebaseAuth\`, aquí tienes una forma de modificar tu método para obtener también el nombre y apellido además del email.

Además, ten en cuenta que esta implementación es asincrónica, lo que significa que el nombre y el apellido se establecerán en los \`EditText\` una vez que se complete la consulta a Firestore, lo que puede tomar un poco de tiempo dependiendo de tu conexión. Recuerda siempre manejar la información de los usuarios con cuidado, especialmente datos susceptibles como la contraseña. Eso implica nunca almacenar o transmitir la contraseña en texto plano y solo solicitarla directamente al usuario cuando sea estrictamente necesario."},{"instruction":"el codigo debe ser minimo y lo estoy haciendo en un controlador, por lo quie va aser llamado en un activity, reduce lo mas que puedas el codigo pero sigue las buenas practicas de programacion","output":"Entiendo, buscas una versión minimizada y eficiente del código para recuperar datos del usuario de Firestore para ser usada en un controlador, que cumpla con las buenas prácticas de programación.

Dentro de este listener, se define lo que quieres hacer con el resultado exitoso, como actualizar la UI, almacenar un valor recuperado, entre otros. - **\`addOnFailureListener\`** se utiliza para ser notificado cuando la operación falla. Esto es especialmente útil para manejar errores, informar al usuario sobre el problema, intentar la operación nuevamente o hacer un log del error. En la práctica, no siempre es necesario implementar ambos listeners para cada operación, pero es altamente recomendable por varias razones: 1. **Robustez de la Aplicación:** Ayuda a crear aplicaciones más robustas y confiables, ya que consideras tanto los escenarios de éxito como los de fallo. 2. **Experiencia de Usuario:** Permite proporcionar una mejor experiencia de usuario (UX) informándoles de fallos (y posiblemente de cómo resolverlos), en lugar de dejarlos esperando o confundidos si algo no funciona. 3. **Depuración:** Al implementar \`addOnFailureListener\`, obtienes información valiosa sobre por qué falló una operación, lo cual es esencial durante el desarrollo y la depuración de tu aplicación. # Ejemplo Simplificado Aquí te dejo un ejemplo simplificado de cómo usar ambos listeners con Firestore: \`\`\`java FirebaseFirestore db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance(); // Suponiendo que actualizas un documento en Firestore db.collection(\\"tuColeccion\\").document(\\"tuDocumento\\") .update(mapaDeDatos) .addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener<Void>() { @Override public void onSuccess(Void aVoid) { // Maneja el éxito (actualizar UI, informar al usuario, etc.) } }) .addOnFailureListener(new OnFailureListener() { @Override public void onFailure(@NonNull Exception e) { // Maneja el fallo (log del error, informar al usuario, intentar otra vez, etc.) } }); \`\`\` # Conclusión Si bien técnicamente podrías omitir uno de los listeners si solo te interesa saber sobre el éxito o el fallo, las mejores prácticas y el diseño cuidadoso de la experiencia del usuario sugieren que deberías manejar ambos escenarios. Esto garantiza que tu aplicación sea más resiliente y amigable para el usuario final."},{"instruction":"siguiendo las buenas practicas de programacion crees que sea necesario apl8icar eso cuando solo quiero recuperar los datos del usaurio logueado? - responde en unal inea","output":"Sí, aplicar buenas prácticas como manejar tanto el éxito como el fallo mejora la robustez y la experiencia de usuario, incluso al recuperar datos de usuario."},{"instruction":"modifica el metodo para que tenga eso, te enviare contexto de mi clase, guiate, sigue la estructura y verifica que sigo las buenas practicas, responde con el metodo para capturar los datos del usaurio logueado - public class UsuarioController { private final FirebaseAuth mAuth; private FirebaseFirestore db; public UsuarioController() { this.mAuth = FirebaseAuth.getInstance(); this.db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance(); } public void registrarUsuario(Context context, Usuario usuario, String email, String contrasena) { mAuth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, contrasena).addOnCompleteListener(task -> { if (task.isSuccessful()) { FirebaseUser firebaseUser = mAuth.getCurrentUser(); if (firebaseUser != null) { db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance(); db.collection(\\"usuario\\").document(firebaseUser.getUid()).set(usuario).addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener<Void>() { @Override public void onSuccess(Void unused) { showToast(context, \\"Usuario registrado con éxito\\"); } }).addOnFailureListener(new OnFailureListener() { @Override public void onFailure(@NonNull Exception e) { showToast(context, \\"Falló el almacenamiento de información adicional\\"); } }); } } else { showToast(context, \\"Falló el registro del usuario: \\" + task.getException().getMessage()); } }); } public void actualizarUsuario(Context context, String nuevaContrasena, Usuario usuario) { FirebaseUser firebaseUser = mAuth.getCurrentUser(); if (firebaseUser == null) { showToast(context, \\"Usuario no logueado\\"); return; } firebaseUser.updatePassword(nuevaContrasena).addOnCompleteListener(task -> { if (task.isSuccessful()) { db.collection(\\"usuario\\").document(firebaseUser.getUid()).set(usuario).addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener<Void>() { @Override public void onSuccess(Void unused) { showToast(context, \\"Información de usuario actualizada con éxito\\"); } }).addOnFailureListener(new OnFailureListener() { @Override public void onFailure(@NonNull Exception e) { showToast(context, \\"Falló la actualización del usuario\\"); } }); } else { showToast(context, \\"Falló la actualización: \\" + task.getException().getMessage()); } }); } public void showToast(Context context, String mensaje) { Toast.makeText(context, mensaje, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); } }","output":"Para capturar los datos del usuario logueado aplicando buenas prácticas como manejar tanto el éxito como el fallo en el proceso, puedes seguir este ejemplo basado en tu estructura existente.

Aquí te muestro cómo puedes hacerlo basándote en el código previo y ajustando para incluir estos detalles: \`\`\`java public void obtenerDatosUsuarioYMostrar(Context context, TextView textViewEmail, EditText editTextNombre, EditText editTextApellido) { FirebaseUser firebaseUser = mAuth.getCurrentUser(); if (firebaseUser == null) { showToast(context, \\"Usuario no logueado\\"); return; } String uid = firebaseUser.getUid(); db.collection(\\"usuario\\").document(uid).get().addOnSuccessListener(documentSnapshot -> { if (documentSnapshot.exists()) { Usuario usuario = documentSnapshot.toObject(Usuario.class); // Asumiendo que tu clase Usuario tiene estos campos con getters correspondientes if (usuario != null) { String email = firebaseUser.getEmail(); // Email se obtiene directamente del FirebaseUser String nombre = usuario.getNombre(); // Reemplaza 'getNombre' con el método getter real String apellido = usuario.getApellido(); // Reemplaza 'getApellido' con el método getter real if (email != null) textViewEmail.setText(email); editTextNombre.setText(nombre); editTextApellido.setText(apellido); } else { showToast(context, \\"No se pudo convertir el documentSnapshot a Usuario.\\"); } } else { showToast(context, \\"Datos del usuario no encontrados\\"); } }).addOnFailureListener(e -> showToast(context, \\"Error al recuperar datos del usuario: \\" + e.getMessage())); } \`\`\` Este método asume que ya tienes un modelo de \`Usuario\` con los getters correspondientes para \`nombre\` y \`apellido\`. Recuerda que el email se obtiene directamente desde el objeto \`FirebaseUser\`, lo cual es útil para asegurar que siempre estás mostrando el correo electrónico actual asociado con la sesión del usuario. Es importante realizar estas operaciones de UI en el hilo principal. Si estás haciendo llamadas a Firestore desde un hilo diferente, asegúrate de manipular los elementos de la UI en el hilo principal para evitar problemas de concurrencia.

Mi explicación previa se enfocó en simplificar y demostrar el uso de expresiones lambda en Android para manipular los resultados de operaciones asincrónicas comunes cuando se comunica con Firebase. Al escribir un método de ejemplo que utiliza \`addOnSuccessListener\` y \`addOnFailureListener\`, opté por usar expresiones lambda por su brevedad y claridad, lo cual es común en el desarrollo moderno de Android, especialmente cuando el entorno de ejecución es compatible con Java 8 o superior. Sin embargo, estas expresiones lambda efectivamente reemplazan la necesidad de utilizar \`@Override\` explícitamente al implementar interfaces anónimas en Java, porque las lambda no requieren la anotación \`@Override\`. En cuanto a por qué no se aplicó \`addOnCompleteListener\`, fue una decisión de diseño basada en el contexto proporcionado; opté por demostrar las operaciones separando las preocupaciones de éxito y fallo para dar un ejemplo claro del manejo de ambos casos. Pero incorporar \`addOnCompleteListener\` en tu método \`actualizarUsuario\` es totalmente correcto y necesario cuando deseas manejar ambos eventos (completado con éxito o fallo) dentro de un solo callback, proporcionando un código conciso y directo para operaciones como la actualización de contraseña. Si debí haber incluido o no \`addOnCompleteListener\` o \`@Override\` en mi explicación o ejemplos previos depende del contexto específico de uso y de la preferencia personal para el manejo de operaciones asincrónicas y callbacks en Android; ambas aproximaciones son válidas y siguen buenas prácticas, dependiendo de los requisitos específicos y la estructura del proyecto.

Let's examine a few potential causes and solutions: # 1. **Code Issue on Sending Side (Arduino Nano)**: Ensure that your Arduino Nano code properly iterates through the entire string and sends it character by character if needed or sends it as a whole if the library supports it. Some libraries or implementations might require you to manage strings character by character, particularly if you’ve written custom code for this. \`\`\`cpp // Example of sending a string correctly String message = \\"Hello, ESP32!\\"; // Sending the string as a whole (make sure your LoRa library supports this) LoRa.beginPacket(); LoRa.print(message); LoRa.endPacket(); \`\`\` # 2. **Code Issue on Receiving Side (ESP32)**: On the ESP32 side, ensure your code is prepared to receive strings of multiple characters. If you mistakenly coded it to expect or handle only one character per message, this could be the issue. \`\`\`cpp // Example of receiving a message while (LoRa.available()) { String received = LoRa.readString(); Serial.print(\\"Message: \\"); Serial.println(received); } \`\`\` # 3. **Baud Rate Mismatch**: Mismatched baud rates can lead to unpredictable behavior. Ensure both your Arduino Nano and ESP32 are communicating at the same baud rate with the LoRa module. This should be set in your setup() function and needs to match on both devices. \`\`\`cpp Serial.begin(9600); // Example baud rate, make sure it matches on both devices \`\`\` # 4. **LoRa Library Configuration Issues**: Different LoRa libraries have various functions and ways to handle data sending and receiving. Make sure you are using compatible and updated libraries on both the Arduino and ESP32 sides. Misconfigured library settings (like frequency, spreading factor, bandwidth) can lead to partial data transmission. # 5. **Buffer Size Issues**: There might be a buffer size limitation either in your code or within the library you are using. Ensure that the buffer size on both the sender and receiver is configured to handle the size of the messages you intend to send. # 6. **Hardware Issue**: Though less likely, there could be a hardware-related issue. Double-check your LoRa module connections, ensuring there's no loose wire or poor connection that could cause data transmission issues. # Debugging Steps: - **Serial Debugging**: Use \`Serial.print()\` statements to debug the sent and received strings on both the sender and receiver sides. - **Simplify the Code**: Simplify your code to the bare minimum required to send and receive a string. This can help identify if the issue is with the logic or setup of your code. - **Library Documentation**: Refer to the official documentation or community forums of the LoRa library you are using. There might be known issues or additional configuration steps required. - **Swap Hardware**: If possible, swap out LoRa modules or microcontrollers to rule out a defective hardware component. In summary, thorough debugging is crucial. Simplify your setup, double-check your code, ensure library compatibility, and match your hardware setup and configurations on both ends. These steps should help you diagnose and fix the issue."},{"instruction":"in treating organophosphourous poisening Taking off clothes and wash skin cuz the organophosphate is absorbed by skin Charcoal of no benefit Avoid giving pralidoxime before atropine because it causes transient cholinesterase inhibition and worsens the symptoms","output":"In the treatment of organophosphate poisoning, rapid and appropriate action is crucial due to the life-threatening nature of this condition. Organophosphates are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine at the synapses and neuromuscular junctions, which causes overstimulation of the cholinergic system. This results in a constellation of symptoms, often remembered by the mnemonic DUMBELS: Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis, Bradycardia/bronchorrhea/bronchospasm, Emesis, Lacrimation, and Salivation, along with CNS effects like seizures. Management involves several key steps: 1. **Decontamination**: Removing contaminated clothing and washing the skin thoroughly is essential to prevent further absorption of the organophosphate. Immediate decontamination reduces continued exposure and is a critical initial step in treatment. 2. **Atropine**: Atropine is used as the antidote in organophosphate poisoning. It works as a competitive antagonist to acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, helping to alleviate the muscarinic symptoms caused by excessive acetylcholine. Atropine does not affect nicotinic symptoms but is life-saving in managing central and peripheral muscarinic symptoms. It is given intravenously, and dosing is titrated based on symptomatic improvement, particularly the drying of bronchial secretions and an increase in heart rate to a desired level. 3. **Pralidoxime (2-PAM)**: Pralidoxime is a cholinesterase reactivator that works by removing the organophosphate moiety from the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which is only effective if the bond between the enzyme and organophosphate has not undergone \\"aging\\". It’s crucial in treating organophosphate poisoning as it can restore muscle strength and improve respiratory function by reversing nicotinic muscle paralysis. However, it should be noted that the premise \\"Avoid giving pralidoxime before atropine because it causes transient cholinesterase inhibition and worsens the symptoms\\" needs clarification. The primary rationale behind administering atropine before or alongside pralidoxime is to manage the muscarinic symptoms effectively. Atropine does not reverse the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, but it helps alleviate symptoms allowing better toleration of pralidoxime, which can then work on reactivating the inhibited enzyme. The concern with pralidoxime is not that it worsens symptoms by inhibiting cholinesterase but rather that in cases where muscarinic effects are profound, stabilization with atropine can make it safer and more comfortable for the patient before pralidoxime is administered. 4. **Activated Charcoal**: The use of activated charcoal in organophosphate poisoning is generally considered of little to no benefit because organophosphates are rapidly absorbed, and the poisoning is often due to dermal exposure rather than ingestion. Activated charcoal is most beneficial in cases of poisoning when administered shortly after ingestion of a poison, and it works by adsorbing the substance in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing its absorption. 5. **Supportive Care**: This involves ventilation support if needed due to respiratory muscle paralysis or severe bronchorrhea and treating seizures if they occur. Each case of organophosphate poisoning can differ in severity and presentation, making it essential to tailor the treatment to the patient's clinical status and continuously monitor and adjust the management plan as needed."},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么可以帮助你的吗？"},{"instruction":"","output":"如果你有任何问题或者需要帮助的地方，请随时告诉我！"},{"instruction":"Диалог:USER: Какого поворота на лыжах нет: а) поворота \\"полуплугом\\" б) поворота на месте махом в) поворота переступанием Почему?ASSISTANT: Поворота “на месте махом” не существует в традиционном понимании техник лыжного спорта.

En su uso más amplio, el concepto tiene varios significados relacionados con la idea de una introducción o un comienzo: 1. **Música**: En el contexto musical, un preludio es una pieza breve que sirve de introducción a una obra más extensa. Originariamente, los preludios eran improvisaciones que los intérpretes ejecutaban para probar el instrumento o para preparar a la audiencia para la música que seguiría. Con el tiempo, se convirtieron en composiciones fijas. Los preludios famosos incluyen aquellos compuestos por Johann Sebastian Bach, como los de su \\"El Clave Bien Temperado\\", y los preludios de Frédéric Chopin y Claude Debussy. 2. **Literatura y Artes**: En un sentido más amplio, un preludio puede referirse a cualquier obra o sección que actúe como introducción a otra obra más significativa. Por ejemplo, puede ser un poema o una sección de texto que establece el tono o el contexto para lo que sigue. 3. **Figurado**: Fuera de los contextos específicamente artísticos, el término también se usa de manera figurada para referirse a cualquier evento, acción o situación que precede y presagia otra de mayor importancia. Por ejemplo, un incidente menor podría describirse como el preludio de un conflicto más serio. En resumen, el término \\"preludio\\" se refiere a una introducción o comienzo, a menudo utilizado en la música para describir una pieza que antecede a una obra mayor, pero también aplicable en literatura, otras artes, y en el sentido figurado para eventos o acciones."},{"instruction":"Необходимо подготовить презентацию по теме: «Что такое метапрограммы и какова цель их использования в публичном выступлении? Какие виды метапрограмм Вам известны, в чем их суть?». В презентации также необходимо привести примеры метапрограмм для доклада по теме публичного выступления «Мониторинг качества питьевой воды в населенных пунктах Томской области». Примеры должны быть для двух аудиторий слушателей: население и специалисты, объясни выбор метапрограмм для этих аудиторий. Объем презентации – не менее 7 слайдов. Также напиши текст выступления для каждого слайда и что должно быть написано на слайде. В конце приведи какие метапрограммы можно использовать на экзамене при ответе студента преподавателю чтобы получить отличную отметку.","output":"# Презентация: Метапрограммы в публичных выступлениях и их роль Слайд 1: Введение в тему метапрограмм - **На слайде:** Определение метапрограмм - **Текст выступления:** Приветствую вас! Сегодня мы поговорим о метапрограммах — внутренних инструкциях нашего мозга, которые управляют нашим восприятием информации. Метапрограммы помогают нам фильтровать опыт и определяют, на что мы обращаем внимание, как мы это интерпретируем и как реагируем. Слайд 2: Цель использования метапрограмм в публичных выступлениях - **На слайде:** Цели использования метапрограмм - **Текст выступления:** Метапрограммы могут стать мощным инструментом в публичных выступлениях. Они позволяют нам настроить нашу речь так, чтобы она лучше resonировала с аудиторией, делая сообщение более понятным, убедительным и запоминающимся. Слайд 3: Виды метапрограмм - **На слайде:** Примеры метапрограмм (Универсальные-Специфичные, Ориентация на Проблему/Решение) - **Текст выступления:** Существует несколько ключевых метапрограмм. Например, метапрограмма универсальности против специфичности определяет, предпочитает ли кто-то говорить о вещах в общем или детально. Метапрограмма ориентации на проблему или решение управляет тем, на что человек концентрируется — на избегании негатива или достижении позитива. Слайд 4: Примеры метапрограмм для населения Томской области - **На слайде:** Примеры метапрограмм: население - **Текст выступления:** Давайте рассмотрим мониторинг качества питьевой воды. Для населения Томской области мы выберем метапрограмму ориентации на решение, подчеркивая, какие шаги предпринимаются для обеспечения чистоты воды. Это позволит снизить беспокойство и повысить доверие к мерам контроля. Слайд 5: Примеры метапрограмм для специалистов - **На слайде:** Примеры метапрограмм: специалисты - **Текст выступления:** При обращении к специалистам мы используем метапрограмму специфичности, детально анализируя данные о качестве воды, исследования и методы очистки. Это позволит специалистам оценить эффективность мер и возможность их применения в своей работе. Слайд 6: Влияние выбора метапрограмм на восприятие информации - **На слайде:** Влияние метапрограмм - **Текст выступления:** Выбор метапрограмм имеет огромное значение. Правильно выбранная метапрограмма позволит точно доставить ваше сообщение до аудитории, будь то население, желающее видеть результаты, или эксперты, ищущие глубину анализа и специфику данных. Слайд 7: Заключение и примеры метапрограмм на экзаменах - **На слайде:** Метапрограммы на экзаменах - **Текст выступления:** В конце хочется затронуть, как метапрограммы могут помочь и на экзаменах. Использование метапрограммы специфичности при ответе поможет продемонстрировать глубокие знания предмета, в то время как ориентация на решение даст понять, что вы способны применить теоретические знания на практике. Комбинируя эти подходы, вы сможете грамотно и всесторонне ответить на вопросы и произвести впечатление на экзаменатора. Вывод В презентации было рассмотрено, что такое метапрограммы, какова их цель при публичных выступлениях, а также как их использование может быть адаптировано для различных аудиторий и ситуаций, включая стрессовые, как экзамены. Важно помнить, что использование метапрограмм не только улучшает доставку вашего сообщения, но и помогает в более глубоком соединении с вашей аудиторией, будь то население, специалисты или студенты."},{"instruction":"Приведи пример ответа студента","output":"Давайте представим, что студенту задан вопрос на экзамене по экологии о важности сохранения биоразнообразия. Вот пример ответа студента, использующего метапрограммы для улучшения оценки. --- **Экзаменатор:** \\"Расскажите, пожалуйста, о важности сохранения биоразнообразия на примере конкретного экосистемы.\\" **Студент:** \\"Сначала хочется подчеркнуть, что биоразнообразие играет ключевую роль в поддержании устойчивости экосистем. Ориентируясь на решение (метапрограмма ориентации на решение), можно сказать, что сохранение биоразнообразия обеспечивает функционирование экосистем, которое в свою очередь, поддерживает чистоту воды, плодородие почвы, и регулирует климат, что непосредственно влияет на качество жизни человечества. Перейдя к более специфичному примеру (метапрограмма специфичности), можно рассмотреть тропические леса Амазонки. Эти леса являются домом для более чем 10 млн видов растений и животных, что составляет около 10% всего мирового биоразнообразия. Экосистемы Амазонки участвуют в глобальном углеродном цикле и являются ключевым фактором в снижении уровня углерода в атмосфере, борясь таким образом с изменением климата. Возвращаясь к широкому контексту (метапрограмма универсализации), важно осознавать, что потеря одного вида может привести к домино-эффекту, в результате которого дестабилизируется вся экосистема. Таким образом, сохранение биоразнообразия необходимо не только для поддержания экологического баланса, но и для обеспечения продовольственной и экономической безопасности человечества.\\" --- В этом ответе студент использует метапрограмму ориентации на решение, чтобы подчеркнуть позитивные аспекты сохранения биоразнообразия. Метапрограмму специфичности он использует, приводя конкретный пример Амазонских тропических лесов. Также студент переключается между универсализацией и специфичностью, чтобы показать общую картину и дать детальное объяснение. Такой подход позволяет студенту не просто ответить на вопрос, но и продемонстрировать свою способность мыслить критически, сочетая теоретические знания с практическим применением."},{"instruction":"in tv shows, comics, whatever…a villain says, “…you can’t do everything here!..you’re only just ONE man…” and then the hero chuckling, “….well obviously I can't clone myself..\\" is this a good retort?","output":"The retort, \\"…well obviously I can't clone myself,\\" from a hero in response to a villain's taunt, \\"…you can’t do everything here!..you’re only just ONE man…,\\" functions as a light-hearted, somewhat self-deprecating acknowledgment of the hero's limitations while also subtly mocking the villain's attempt to undermine their capabilities. Whether it's a good retort depends on several factors: 1. **Character and Tone:** It fits well if the hero's character is known for humor, wit, or a nonchalant attitude towards danger or criticism. It also works if the overall tone of the work (TV show, comic, movie, etc.) supports this kind of exchange, balancing tension with levity. 2. **Context:** In a situation where the hero is seemingly outnumbered or outmatched, it can underscore their resilience or defiance. If the setting is one where cloning or similar technologies/sciences are part of the universe, the retort gains an additional layer of cleverness. 3. **Audience Expectation:** Fans of the genre (superhero tales, action-adventure, sci-fi) might appreciate this as a classic moment of hero-villain banter that adds to the entertainment value. It aligns with expectations for dialogue that isn’t just about advancing plot but also about character development and providing moments of relief amid tension. 4. **Delivery:** The effectiveness of such a line heavily depends on how it's delivered. Tone, timing, and the facial expressions or body language (in visual media) of the actor or character can turn it from potentially flat to memorable. In essence, while this retort might not be groundbreaking, its appropriateness and effectiveness rely greatly on execution and context. For the right character in the right scenario, it can be a perfectly good comeback that adds charm to the scene and endears the hero to the audience by showcasing their ability to remain cheeky in the face of danger."},{"instruction":"You are a Python expert who can provide clear, concise, high-quality code. \\" import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns import cv2 import random import tensorflow as tf import tkinter as tk from tkinter import filedialog from PIL import ImageTk, Image from ipywidgets import interact, interactive, fixed, interact_manual import ipywidgets as widgets from IPython.display import display, clear_output from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam, SGD, RMSprop, AdamW, Adadelta, Adagrad, Adamax, Adafactor, Nadam, Ftrl from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator from tensorflow.keras.losses import CategoricalFocalCrossentropy from tqdm import tqdm import os from sklearn.utils import shuffle from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential, Model, load_model from tensorflow.keras.layers import ( GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dropout, Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dropout, BatchNormalization, Activation, concatenate, Conv2DTranspose, Input, Reshape, UpSampling2D, ) from tensorflow.keras.applications import ( EfficientNetV2B0, EfficientNetV2B1, EfficientNetV2B2, EfficientNetV2B3, EfficientNetV2L, EfficientNetV2M, EfficientNetV2S, ) from tensorflow.keras.applications import Xception from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16, VGG19 from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, ResNetRS50, ResNetRS101 from tensorflow.keras.applications import InceptionResNetV2, ConvNeXtXLarge, ConvNeXtBase, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, NASNetLarge, NASNetMobile from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, TensorBoard, ModelCheckpoint from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix import ipywidgets as widgets import io from PIL import Image from IPython.display import display, clear_output from warnings import filterwarnings from google.colab import drive drive.mount(\\"/content/gdrive\\") def load_data(data_folders): X_data = [] #

Let's break it down by sections: # Formation: 4-3-3 - A classic formation that provides a solid balance between defense, midfield, and attack. The formation is flexible, allowing for fluid transitions between defense and attack. # Style of Play: Skibidi Toilet - This playful, fictitious term suggests a strategy that is unconventional and surprising. Translated into a football tactic, it implies high energy, unpredictability, and constant movement, similar to the unexpected and unusual nature of the \\"Skibidi\\" dance challenge combined with the humor suggested by \\"Toilet.\\" The approach emphasizes creativity, pressing, and possession. # Player Roles - **GK: Sweeper Keeper (Defend)** - Engages in play, providing an extra passing option and covering space behind the defense. - **DR/DL: Complete Wing-Backs** - Vital for width and attacking support, with one set to support (DR) and the other to attack (DL), creating an asymmetrical threat. - **DCR: Ball-Playing Defender (Defend)** and **DCL: Central Defender (Defend)** - One is more involved in building play from the back, while the other focuses on traditional defensive duties. - **MCR: Mezzala (Support)** - Roams from position, linking play and creating overloads. - **MC: Deep Lying Playmaker (Defend)** - Acts as the pivot in midfield, controlling the tempo and distributing the ball. - **MCL: Box to Box Midfielder (Support)** - Provides energy and support in both defensive and attacking phases. - **AMR: Inside Forward (Attack)** and **AML: Winger (Attack)** - Offers asymmetry in attack; one cuts inside while the other provides width, creating varied attacking routes. - **ST: False Nine (Support)** - Drops deep to drag defenders out of position and link play, opening spaces for midfielders and wingers. # Team Instructions - **Mentality:** Positive - Encourages a proactive approach to taking the game to the opponents. - **In Possession:** - The instructions focus on maintaining possession with short passes, playing at a high tempo, and exploiting the width. The team is encouraged to be creative, making use of runs and dribbles to break defensive lines. - **In Transition:** - The strategy emphasizes an immediate reaction to regain possession through counter-pressing, as well as exploiting space quickly through counters. The goalkeeper plays a part in maintaining possession and initiating attacks. - **Out of Possession:** - A high and aggressive press aims to win the ball back quickly. The high defensive line and offside trap are risky but can disrupt the opposition's attacking play, fitting the high-energy and high-risk nature of the \\"Skibidi Toilet\\" style. # Summary The key to the \\"Skibidi Toilet\\" tactic is its emphasis on surprise, movement, and flexibility, taking inspiration from the whimsical and unconventional nature the name suggests. It aims to dominate possession, press relentlessly, and use creative attacking movements to unsettle and overpower opponents."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

El cielo estaba lleno de nubarrones, era el inicio de una tormenta que pronto descargaría su furia sobre la ciudad. Las calles, ya solitarias a esa hora, se preparaban para una quietud aún más profunda. Andrés, un joven conductor de autobús nocturno, iniciaba su jornada laboral rutinaria, ignorante del giro que tomarían las próximas horas. La ruta de Andrés recorría por toda de la ciudad, uniendo barrios olvidados con el hirviente corazón metropolitano. A medida que avanzaba, los pasajeros iban descendiendo, uno a uno en cada parada, hasta que el autobús se quedó en un silencio total. La radio, intentaba hacerme compañía, apenas lograba cortar la densidad del ambiente. Fue entonces cuando, a través del espejo retrovisor, Andrés notó una figura que no había visto subir: una mujer, sentada en el último asiento, envuelta en un chal oscuro, el cabello caía en cascada sobre su rostro oculto. Andrés intentó recordar en qué parada pudo haber subido, pero su memoria no ofreció respuestas. La presencia de aquella pasajera hizo que se sintiera incomodo y no podía quitárselo de encima. Decidió ignorarla, enfocándose en el camino. Sin embargo, un escalofrío descendió por su espina dorsal al darse cuenta de que, a pesar de los numerosos baches y curvas, la silueta en el espejo permanecía inmutable, como si estuviera pegada al asiento por una fuerza sobrenatural. Incapaz de resistir la curiosidad mezclada con miedo, Andrés detuvo el autobús bajo la luz parpadeante de una farola, y se armó de valor para confrontar a su misteriosa pasajera. Avanzó lentamente por el pasillo, cada paso amplificado por el eco del autobús vacío. Al llegar hasta la mitad el pasillo miró hacia el asiento trasero, no vió… nada. La mujer había desaparecido sin dejar rastro. Aterrado, pero obligado por las responsabilidades de su ruta, Andrés continuó, aunque el ambiente dentro del autobús se había vuelto palpablemente más frío. Las paradas pasaban, una tras otra, sin incidentes, hasta que finalmente arribó a su destino final, la terminal central que estaba totalmente desierta. Al revisar el autobús por última vez, asegurándose de que estaba vacío antes de cerrar, su radio se encendió, emitiendo un mensaje que heló su sangre: un anuncio de la policía sobre una mujer desaparecida, vista por última vez subiendo a un autobús nocturno, coincidiendo con la descripción exacta de la pasajera fantasmal. Ante el temor de encontrarse con lo inexplicable, Andrés informó a sus superiores y a la policía sobre el incidente, pero ninguna investigación arrojó luz sobre el misterio. ¿cómo había entrado y salido aquella mujer del autobús sin dejar rastro?, era un completo enigma. En las semanas siguientes, Andrés intentó convencerse de que había sido víctima de su imaginación, fatigada por las largas noches en soledad. Sin embargo, la historia de la mujer sentada en la parte trasera del autobús pasó a formar parte de una leyenda urbana, susurrada entre colegas y pasajeros como advertencia y fascinación. Nunca más volvió a ver a la figura enigmática, pero en las noches de tormenta, cuando la oscuridad parece devorar todo rastro de luz, Andrés siente un inquebrantable escalofrío, recordándole que algunas historias, aunque demasiado terribles para ser ciertas, pueden ser demasiado reales para ser ignoradas.","output":"Para acompañar cada escena de esta historia con videos, podremos utilizar distintos tipos de contenido audiovisual que enriquezcan la experiencia y permitan al espectador sumergirse completamente en la atmósfera que se describe. A continuación, sugiero varios tipos de videos que podrían corresponder a las partes clave de la narración: 1. **Introducción y escena del inicio de tormenta:** - **Video recomendado:** Imágenes time-lapse de nubes tormentosas acumulándose y relámpagos destellantes en el horizonte nocturno. Esto proporcionaría un fuerte impacto visual inicial y establecería el tono ominoso. 2. **Andrés iniciando su jornada laboral:** - **Video recomendado:** Un corto video que muestre a un conductor preparándose para su ruta nocturna, encendiendo el autobús, ajustando los espejos y saliendo de la terminal. 3. **El autobús recorriendo la ciudad y pasajeros descendiendo:** - **Video recomendado:** Clips de un autobús transitando por diferentes partes de la ciudad de noche, desde calles solitarias hasta la parte más vibrante del centro, intercalados con personas bajando del autobús en diversas paradas. 4. **Descubrimiento de la misteriosa pasajera:** - **Video recomendado:** Una grabación desde el punto de vista del conductor mirando en el espejo retrovisor donde, a través de un efecto especial, la figura de la mujer podría aparecer y desaparecer sutilmente para añadir un elemento sobrenatural. 5. **Confrontación y la desaparición de la mujer:** - **Video recomendado:** Un metraje tenso desde el punto de vista de Andrés caminando por el pasillo del autobús, combinando luz y sombras para crear suspense, seguido de un plano que muestre el asiento vacío, enfatizando la desaparición de la mujer. 6. **Final de la ruta y mensaje de la radio:** - **Video recomendado:** Escenas de la terminal desierta con el sonido de una transmisión policial distorsionada de fondo, con un enfoque en el rostro preocupado de Andrés mientras escucha. 7. **Conclusión y leyenda urbana:** - **Video recomendado:** Una combinación de clips que muestren a Andrés reflexionando en diversos momentos, interspersados con escenas de la ciudad de noche bajo la lluvia, mientras voces susurrantes (posibles efectos de audio) narran fragmentos de la leyenda urbana que ahora rodea la historia. Cada uno de estos videos debería ser cuidadosamente editado y mezclado con una banda sonora que evoque las emociones adecuadas para cada escena, desde la inquietud y el misterio hasta el temor y la melancolía. Los efectos de sonido, como truenos, pasos en el autobús vacío y la voz distante de la radio, son elementos clave que ayudarían a sumergir aún más al espectador en la historia."},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

Заказчик вносит гарантийный депозит в размере [___]% от предполагаемой стоимости услуг перед началом исполнения обязанностей. Данный депозит служит гарантией выполнения обязательств Заказчика перед Исполнителем и подлежит возврату после успешного исполнения Заказчиком своих обязанностей. 2. **Право требования** 2.1. В случае нарушения Заказчиком условий соглашения, Исполнитель имеет право требовать исполнения обязательств в судебном порядке, включая полную оплату услуг и компенсацию убытков. 3. **Штрафные санкции** 3.1. За неисполнение или несвоевременное исполнение обязанностей Заказчика перед Исполнителем, Заказчик обязуется уплатить штраф в размере [___]% от стоимости неисполненных услуг за каждый день просрочки платежа. 4. **Предоставление информации** 4.1. Заказчик обязуется предоставлять Исполнителю всю требуемую информацию и документы в сроки, согласованные сторонами.

Важно помнить, что все условия должны быть согласованы обеими сторонами и сформулированы таким образом, чтобы не нарушать действующее законодательство. Рекомендуется обратиться за профессиональной юридической помощью для корректного формулирования и включения этих или других пунктов в договор."},{"instruction":"Можно ли добавить что то ещё для того чтобы заказчик не отказался оплачивать услуги исполнителя?","output":"Для предотвращения ситуации, при которой Заказчик может отказаться оплачивать услуги Исполнителя, помимо вышеуказанных пунктов, можно рассмотреть внесение в договор следующих дополнительных механизмов и гарантий: 1. **Подтверждение результатов**: Указать, что оплата услуг Исполнителя производится на основании подтвержденного отчета об оказанных услугах, который Исполнитель предоставляет Заказчику. Отчет должен включать все выполненные работы, необходимую документацию и результаты этих работ. 2. **Эскроу-счет**: Добавить условие о том, что средства на оплату услуг Исполнителя могут быть заранее переведены на эскроу-счет (специальный тип банковского счета, контролируемый третьей стороной), который будет использован для выплаты после успешного выполнения условий договора. 3. **График оплаты и частичная предоплата**: Включить положение о графике оплаты с частичной предоплатой за выполнение определенных этапов работы. Это обеспечит Исполнителю частичную оплату и стимул для выполнения дальнейшей работы. 4. **Залог или Банковская гарантия**: Если Заказчик является крупной компанией или обладает значимыми активами, можно предусмотреть залог или банковскую гарантию в качестве обеспечения исполнения обязательств по оплате. 5. **Штраф за отказ от оплаты**: Установить штрафные санкции за отказ от оплаты или за несвоевременную оплату услуг после выполнения Исполнителем своих обязательств. 6. **Предусмотреть условие медиации**: В случае споров о качестве или объеме оказанных услуг перед обращением в суд стороны могут договориться о процедуре медиации, чтобы найти взаимоприемлемое решение. Добавление этих элементов увеличивает шансы на то, что Исполнитель получит своевременную и полную оплату за свои услуги. Однако следует учесть, что все дополнения в договор должны быть сформулированы юридически корректно и соответствовать действующему законодательству. Рекомендуется проконсультироваться с юристом для того, чтобы обеспечить правильность и законность внесенных условий."},{"instruction":"Что за медиация?","output":"Медиация — это процедура разрешения конфликтов и споров с помощью третьей нейтральной стороны (медиатора), без обращения в суд. Медиация направлена на достижение сторонами взаимоприемлемого решения через переговоры под руководством медиатора. Это конфиденциальная процедура, которая позволяет участникам сохранять контроль над результатом разрешения спора. **Основные принципы медиации:** 1. **Добровольность** - стороны приходят к медиации по собственному желанию и могут в любой момент отказаться от продолжения, если чувствуют, что это не приводит к решению. 2. **Конфиденциальность** - все обсуждения в рамках медиации являются конфиденциальными. Это означает, что информация, полученная в ходе медиации, не может быть использована в суде, если медиация не приводит к решению. 3. **Нейтральность и беспристрастность медиатора** - медиатор не выносит решений и не имеет интересов в исходе спора. Его задача - помогать сторонам находить общие точки согласия и формулировать условия решения. 4. **Управление процессом сторонами** - медиация дает сторонам возможность самим контролировать процесс решения проблемы и исход переговоров, что часто приводит к более устойчивым и приемлемым для обеих сторон результатам. Медиация может применяться в различных сферах, включая семейные споры, гражданские дела (например, в ситуациях неуплаты долгов, решения споров по договорам), трудовые споры, а также в коммерческих и международных вопросах. Основное преимущество медиации — это возможность для сторон найти компромиссное решение, минимизировать негативные последствия конфликта, сохранить или даже улучшить отношения между сторонами, а также значительно сократить время и средства на разрешение спора по сравнению с судебным разбирательством."},{"instruction":"Можно ли добавить или изменить какие-то пункты этого договора чтобы в случае если дело дойдёт до суда, суд с большей вероятностью удволетворит претензии исполнителя и обязал заказчика выплатить ему всю сумму по этому договору?","output":"Для усиления позиций Исполнителя в случае судебного разбирательства и повышения вероятности удовлетворения его требований к Заказчику, можно внести или изменить следующие пункты в договоре: 1. **Детализация услуг**: Четко и подробно описать перечень услуг, которые должен выполнить Исполнитель, включая сроки выполнения, этапы работ, критерии качества и любые конкретные требования. Это поможет суду определить, были ли услуги исполнителя выполнены в соответствии с договором. 2. **Условия и порядок приемки услуг**: Определить конкретные условия и процедуру, по которой Заказчик признает выполнение услуг Исполнителем, включая сроки и форму подтверждения (например, подпись акта выполненных работ). 3. **Штрафы и пени за неисполнение или просрочку исполнения**: Включить в договор пункты о штрафах и пени, предусмотренных за неисполнение или задержку выполнения обязательств Заказчиком, что создает дополнительные стимулы для своевременного исполнения договорных обязательств. 4. **Подтверждение обязательств**: Определить, что любые изменения в обязательствах сторон по договору должны быть согласованы в письменной форме, что предотвратит возможность Заказчика ссылаться на устные договоренности. 5. **Механизм разрешения споров**: Включить обязательный претензионный порядок разрешения споров, который предполагает обязательство сторон пытаться решить спор путем переговоров в срок, например, 30 дней перед обращением в суд. Это может помочь Исполнителю продемонстрировать суду, что были предприняты все усилия для мирного урегулирования вопроса. 6. **Арбитражная оговорка**: Возможность включения в договор оговорки о разрешении споров в арбитражном суде, если это приемлемо для сторон. Арбитражные решения обычно выполнимы и процесс может быть более предсказуемым, чем в общей юрисдикции. 7. **Условия об оплате юридических расходов**: Указать, что в случае судебного разбирательства проигравшая сторона обязуется возместить победившей стороне расходы на юридическое сопровождение, что может мотивировать Заказчика к исполнению обязательств без доведения дела до суда. Добавление подобных пунктов может повысить юридическую защищенность Исполнителя и обеспечить более эффективное разрешение возможных споров. Важно помнить, что любые изменения и дополнения в договор должны быть сформулированы корректно с юридической точки зрения и не противоречить законодательству.

Таким образом, в пунктах обязанностей Исполнителя мы напрямую ссылаемся на раздел «Предмет договора», делая акцент на том, что выполнение конкретных услуг является обязательным и они связаны с целями и задачами, зафиксированными в первом разделе договора. Описанные действия уточняют обязанности Обязанностей Исполнителя и таким образом обеспечивают лучшее понимание обеими сторонами объема работы и ожидаемых результатов сотрудничества. Важно, чтобы каждое упоминание о задаче или обязанности в договоре было подкреплено конкретными условиями в других связанных разделах, что обеспечивает логическую и юридическую связь между всеми элементами договора. ---"},{"instruction":"Можно ли прописать пункт по которому исполнитель может требовать от заказчика компенсации за разграшение его персоональных данных и факта того что он оказывал услуги заказчику?","output":"Да, можно добавить пункт о компенсации за разглашение персональных данных и оказанных услуг. Такой пункт помогает обеспечить защиту конфиденциальной информации и предусматривает ответственность за её разглашение. Вот примерный текст для такого пункта: --- **Конфиденциальность и компенсация за разглашение информации** 8.1. Заказчик обязуется сохранять в строгой тайне и не разглашать третьим лицам персональные данные Исполнителя, а также информацию о факте оказания услуг по настоящему Договору без предварительного письменного согласия Исполнителя. К персональным данным относятся любые сведения, относящиеся к конкретному лицу, включая, но не ограничиваясь, имя, фамилию, адрес, контактную информацию, а также любые другие данные, позволяющие идентифицировать личность Исполнителя. 8.2. В случае несанкционированного разглашения Заказчиком информации, указанной в п.8.1, Исполнитель вправе требовать компенсацию ущерба, включая моральный вред и потерю дохода, вызванных таким разглашением. Размер компенсации определяется в соответствии с фактическим ущербом, понесенным Исполнителем, но не может быть меньше [указать сумму] и предусмотрен в соответствии с действующим законодательством. 8.3. Ответственность за несанкционированное разглашение информации не применяется в случаях, когда разглашение информации произошло в результате действий или бездействий Исполнителя, а также в случаях, когда информация стала общедоступной не в результате нарушения Заказчиком условий конфиденциальности. --- Этот пункт подчёркивает важность сохранения конфиденциальности обеими сторонами и устанавливает чёткие рамки ответственности за их нарушение. Однако перед включением таких условий в договор рекомендуется консультация с юристом, чтобы убедиться в их соответствии действующему законодательству и в правильности формулировок."},{"instruction":"Спасибо.","output":"Пожалуйста, всегда рад помочь! Если у вас возникнут еще вопросы или вам потребуется дополнительная информация, не стесняйтесь обращаться. Удачи в ваших начинаниях!"},{"instruction":"Если листов договора несколько, нужно ли расписываться на каждом,","output":"Да, обычно рекомендуется расписываться на каждом листе договора. Такая мера помогает убедиться в том, что все страницы документа были приняты и признаны обеими сторонами, исключая возможность подмены или исключения отдельных листов договора после его подписания. Подписи на каждой странице свидетельствуют о том, что стороны ознакомились с каждым пунктом договора и согласны с его условиями. Кроме того, в некоторых юрисдикциях или для определенных типов договоров подписание каждой страницы может быть обязательным требованием. В таком случае неподписание каждой страницы договора может привести к юридическим проблемам при попытке привлечь к ответственности по условиям договора. Также, для дополнительной юридической надежности, на последней странице договора, где размещаются подписи сторон, может быть указано общее количество страниц документа, которое подтверждается подписями. Это еще один способ защиты от возможных попыток манипуляции текстом договора после его подписания. В любом случае, рекомендуется консультироваться с юридическим специалистом, так как правила и требования к оформлению договоров могут существенно различаться в зависимости от юрисдикции и конкретного случая."},{"instruction":"Может ли номер договора быть произвольным? нужно ли его печатать на каждой странице договора вместе с номером его страницы?","output":"Да, номер договора может быть произвольным, но он должен быть уникальным в рамках системы учета одной из сторон, обычно у Исполнителя, который ведет документооборот с заказчиками. Этот номер служит для идентификации и упорядочивания договоров внутри организации, облегчая поиск конкретного документа среди других. Что касается печати номера договора и номера страницы на каждой странице документа, то это не обязательно, но является хорошей практикой. Пометка номера договора на каждой странице помогает поддерживать порядок документов и обеспечивает легкость сопоставления страниц с конкретным договором, особенно когда документы хранятся в электронном виде или когда отдельные страницы документа не скреплены между собой. Наличие указания номера страницы, например, в формате \\"Страница X из Y\\", дополнительно помогает обеспечить целостность договора, свидетельствуя о том, что все страницы на месте и позволяет легко заметить, если какая-либо страница потеряется или будет умышленно удалена. В итоге, принятие решения о проставлении номера договора и номера страниц на каждой странице документа зависит от внутренних правил организации, требований к документообороту и личных предпочтений сторон. Важно, чтобы выбранный подход способствовал повышению уровня организации и обеспечивал удобство последующего использования и хранения документации."},{"instruction":"как правильно писать банки альфа банк, сбербанк, втб?","output":"При написании названий банков в текстах на русском языке следует придерживаться официального написания и использовать их полные наименования или общепринятые сокращения. Вот как правильно: 1. **Альфа-Банк** - официальное название \\"Альфа-Банк\\". В официальных документах и контекстах предпочтительно использовать полное название. 2. **Сбербанк** - для Сберегательного банка Российской Федерации общепринятое сокращение - \\"Сбербанк\\". Полное официальное название - Публичное акционерное общество \\"Сбербанк России\\" или ПАО \\"Сбербанк\\". 3. **ВТБ** - краткое название для Банка ВТБ (Публичное акционерное общество). Полное официальное название - Публичное акционерное общество \\"Банк ВТБ\\". При использовании названий в официальных документах, коммерческих предложениях или иных серьезных контекстах рекомендуется отдавать предпочтение полным официальным названиям. В более неформальных ситуациях можно использовать общепринятые сокращения или названия, устоявшиеся среди широкой публики."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},B={class:"card-container"},N={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],z={key:0},F={key:1};function E(i,e,h,p,n,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",B,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",N,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
