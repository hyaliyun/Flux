Consequently, Skylar would likely opt for an alternative recreational activity that could be completed within her remaining available time. In this situation, Skylar might be interested in exploring these following options: A. Head to a party: If there's a party nearby and Skylar is interested in attending, this could be a viable option. Going to a party would provide Skylar with an opportunity to socialize, dance, and enjoy herself while staying within her time constraints. She could make a brief appearance, have some fun, and still be home before her curfew. B. Engage in a shorter activity: Since watching the movie is off the table, Skylar may want to engage in a different recreational activity that requires less time. This could include going to a nearby coffee shop or café, taking a walk in the park, browsing a book shop, or even just spending some time chatting with Aubrey. These activities would still allow Skylar to enjoy her time without fretting about her curfew. C. Head home early to avoid problems: Considering the potential consequences of breaking her curfew, Skylar might choose to spend the rest of her available time completing personal tasks or chores before heading home. This choice demonstrates responsibility and respect for her parents' rules, which could result in a more lenient curfew in the future or fewer restrictions on her social life. D. Reschedule the movie outing: Circumstances permitting, Skylar could suggest rescheduling the movie outing with Aubrey to a time when her curfew would not be an issue. This way, they can both enjoy the movie without worrying about the time constraints and make plans for a future date that works for both of them. Given the available options, Skylar's next course of action would depend on her personal interests, preferences, and priorities. She might want to make the most out of her remaining time by choosing a leisure activity, like heading to a party, or opt for a more responsible approach by heading home early.

Journey is an American rock band that formed in San Francisco in 1973, composed of former members of Santana and Frumious Bandersnatch. The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\". With Cain on board, the band began writing material that would eventually lead up to Journey's biggest studio album, \\"Escape\\". Recording sessions began in April 1981, and lasted until the middle of June. Escape was released on July 31, 1981, and immediately the album became a mainstream success. The album, which has thus far sold nine times platinum, went to number one on the album charts later that year, and included three top-ten hits: \\"Who's Cryin' Now\\", \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" and \\"Open Arms\\". The last is Journey's highest-charting single to date, staying at No. 2 for six consecutive weeks and ranking at No.34 on Billboard's 1982 year-end Hot 100. MTV videotaped one of their two sold-out shows in Houston on November 6, 1981, in front of over 20,000 fans. Capitalizing on their success, the band recorded radio commercials for Budweiser and sold rights to their likenesses and music for use in two video games: the Journey arcade game by Bally/Midway and Journey Escape by Data Age for the Atari 2600. This success was met with criticism. The 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide gave each of the band's albums only one star, with Dave Marsh writing that \\"Journey was a dead end for San Francisco area rock.\\" Marsh later would anoint Escape as one of the worst number-one albums of all time. Journey's next album, Frontiers (1983), continued their commercial success, reaching No. 2 on the album charts, selling nearly six million copies. The album generated four Top 40 hits, \\"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\\", which reached No. 8, \\"Faithfully\\", which reached No. 12, \\"Send Her My Love\\" and \\"After the Fall\\", both of which reached No. 23. By this time, Journey had become one of the top touring and recording bands in the world.

The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820. Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on Rügen—painted after his honeymoon—display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that \\"the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art.\\"Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist.

The volcano is one part of a range that was formed as part of the same process that formed the floor of the Atlantic, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The top of the seamount has gone through periods of complete submergence, during which its limestone cap was formed by marine organisms, and during the Ice Ages the entire caldera was above sea level, forming an island of approximately two hundred square miles.\\" Answer: A:","output":"The bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and a volcano are comparable in several significant ways, particularly when examining the formation of the archipelago mentioned within the given context. Both geological features have their origins in dynamic and complex processes, which involve tectonic plate movements, volcanic activities, and material exchange between the Earth's mantle and crust. In the following analysis, we will discuss the similarities between the two in terms of their formation processes, structures, and the role of natural forces in shaping their characteristics. 1. Formation processes: Both the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and the volcano found beneath the archipelago are products of tectonic plate movements. The floor of the Atlantic was formed through the process of seafloor spreading, mainly driven by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This is an extensive underwater mountain range that runs along the center of the Atlantic Ocean, where new oceanic crust is formed. On the other hand, the submarine volcano responsible for forming the archipelago is also a result of tectonic activity, particularly as the volcano is part of a range that shares the same formation process with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. 2. Structures: The bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and the volcano display similar structural elements. They are both characterized by an elevated underwater terrain comprised of basaltic rock formations. Additionally, both geological features contain a combination of magma chambers, fissures, and hydrothermal vents where molten materials and gases escape from the Earth's mantle. The caldera of the submarine volcano and the ocean floor are both places where new crust is created and spread outwards. 3. Natural forces and geological changes: Both the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and the volcano are affected by various natural forces that contribute to their evolution and transformation. For instance, sea level fluctuations, as well as the action of glaciers and ice, have impacted the visibility and overall landscape of the archipelago's caldera. During periods of submergence, the caldera of the volcano would be covered by water, enabling the formation of a limestone cap due to marine organisms. However, during Ice Ages, the entire caldera would be above sea level, forming an island with an area of approximately two hundred square miles. These events showcase the continuous change and adaptation experienced by both the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and the underlying submarine volcano. In summary, similarities between the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and the volcano beneath the archipelago include their origins in tectonic plate movements, shared structural elements, and their susceptibility to geological modifications induced by natural forces. These features highlight the intertwined nature of Earth's geological processes and reaffirm the astounding dynamics of our planet's continuously evolving landscape."},{"instruction":"The Fairmont Copley Plaza - pictures, photos, facts and information on The Fairmont Copley Plaza (Boston, Ma) - 960x1280 Make this lower case.","output":"To convert the given text \\"The Fairmont Copley Plaza - pictures, photos, facts and information on The Fairmont Copley Plaza (Boston, Ma) - 960x1280\\" into lowercase, follow these steps: 1.

Kayla grew their nails longer than Jennifer, because","output":"Kayla had always admired the elegance of long nails. She noticed how they seemed to make every gesture more graceful, adding a touch of sophistication to even the simplest tasks. Therefore, she decided to embark on her own journey of growing her nails to achieve this mystifying beauty. Split ends, snags, and the occasional chip no longer bothered Kayla, as she diligently cared for her nails. She kept a meticulous maintenance schedule: moisturizing her cuticles with nourishing oils and hand creams, filing them regularly to avoid any rough edges, and applying protective nail polishes and treatments that promoted nail strength and growth. Kayla's goal was not only to outgrow Jennifer but to achieve a certain grace and elegance that she perceived was linked to the length of one’s nails. Jennifer, on the other hand, had a more pragmatic view of long nails. She appreciated their appearance but understood that her choice of career and lifestyle limited her own ability to grow her nails too long—lest they be more trouble than they were worth. Jennifer's job as a veterinarian often involved hands-on tasks such as handling animals and performing medical procedures that were difficult with long nails. As such, she prioritized the practicality and hygiene concerns over the aesthetics of having lengthy nails. Kayla's persistence and dedication started to pay off, and her nails gradually grew longer, surpassing Jennifer's relatively short and more manageable nails. Every time they met for lunch or a casual chat, the topic of nails inevitably came up, and Kayla would proudly flaunt her progress. Jennifer would playfully roll her eyes, secretly impressed by her friend's determination in pursuit of her goal. As Kayla's nails grew longer, people around her began to notice and comment on her unique style. Some admired her for her dedication, while others viewed her nails as an expression of vanity and a testament to the importance she placed on her appearance. Yet, Kayla was unperturbed by these various opinions, as she continued to refine her nail care regimen in an attempt to bring them to the absolute pinnacle of elegance. Finally, Kayla reached a point where she was undeniably proud of her nails. They were glossy, well-manicured, and significantly longer than Jennifer's. However, Kayla had noticed that the longer her nails got, the more challenging it became for her to engage in many everyday tasks. Things like typing on her laptop and phone, fastening a necklace or a bracelet, and even preparing a meal had become considerably more difficult. Nevertheless, the sense of accomplishment from achieving her goal was gratifying, but she now understood Jennifer's perspective better. Kayla started to recognize that growing out her nails beyond their current length would be impractical and so she resolved to maintain her nails at a length that balanced elegance and functionality. Jennifer and Kayla's friendship flourished through these shared experiences, their bond strengthening in spite of their slightly competitive nature. They both realized that long nails are a matter of personal preference and priorities. While Kayla grew her nails out for elegance, she came to acknowledge the importance of functionality. Jennifer found an admiration in Kayla's dedication and artistic pursuit, which made her appreciate the beauty of long nails even more. In the end, their quest for the perfect nail length taught them that it was not about outdoing each other, but finding a balance that suited each woman's unique lifestyle and desires."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to ride public transportation in los angeles Plan ahead.

The amount spent per household rose from £501 in 2012, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. But average household spending stood at £539.80 in 2006, after taking the rising cost of living into account. The Family Spending Survey is compiled every year by the ONS. It shows that £74.40 a week was spent on average on housing, fuel and power in 2013. This equates to 14% of household spending. However, this figure excludes mortgage interest payments, British council tax or domestic rates in Northern Ireland. A rise in gas and electricity prices pushed this category to the top of the household spending list in 2013, the ONS said. A previous big hit for family finances was transport, which was second on the list last year at £70.40. Nearly half of this was the cost of running a car, namely petrol, diesel, repairs and servicing. Transport remained a significant expense for families in rural areas of the UK. In these areas, it cost £85.50 a week. Overall, average weekly household spending for households in rural areas was £550.50, compared with £481.70 in urban areas from 2011 to 2013. There was also evidence in the ONS figures of a north-south divide in spending. In 2011 to 2013, families in the South East of England spent the most per week (£585.40), followed by households in London (£579.60), the East of England (£523.40) and the South West of England (£518.20). All four were above the UK average. Families in the the North East of England spent the least at £424.60 per week, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber (£431.10) and Wales (£438.80). The divide between rich and poor is also clear, with the lowest-earning 10% of households spending an average of £189.80 a week. This compared with an average of £1,119.50 a week for the 10% of highest-earning households in the UK. £58.80 a week on average £15.60 on meat and fish £4.30 on fresh veg £3.30 on fresh fruit £4.90 on non-alcoholic drinks Major areas of spending for households in general were recreation and culture (£63.90 a week). This category includes spending on TVs, computers, newspapers, books and package holidays. The figures suggest that recreation takes a bigger chunk of family income than grocery bills. Average weekly spending on food and non-alcoholic drinks in 2013 stood at £58.80, of which £15.60 a week was spent on meat and fish.

Follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine the terms with h on the right side of the equation. -840*h + 456*h = -384*h This is because -840 + 456 equals -384. So our equation becomes: -489*h - 10043 = -384*h - 1328 Step 2: Add 384*h to both sides of the equation to move the h terms to the left side. -489*h + 384*h - 10043 = -1328 This simplifies to: -105*h - 10043 = -1328 Step 3: Add 10043 to both sides of the equation to isolate the h term. -105*h = 8715 This is because -1328 + 10043 equals 8715. Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by -105 to solve for h. h = 8715 / -105 h = -83 So the solution to the equation -489*h - 10043 = -840*h + 456*h - 1328 is h = -83."},{"instruction":"Then Ciara and I decided to go see Tropic Thunder at the movie theater while Nicole and Monica were going to stay behind and do karoake .

To understand this, let's analyze each sentence and their relationship to each other. Sentence 1: 'Well then.' This sentence typically serves as a transitional phrase in conversation, indicating that the speaker is acknowledging a statement or situation before proceeding to the next point. It does not convey any specific or definitive information about the speaker's opinions or intentions. As a standalone sentence, it leaves the topic or context open for interpretation. Sentence 2: 'Absolutely not.' This statement expresses a clear and emphatic rejection, disagreement, or denial of something. It involves a strong conviction or belief, suggesting that a particular option or idea has been considered and rejected. The relationship between the two sentences is unclear. They may be part of a larger conversation or address different topics entirely. An entailment occurs when the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another sentence, given the content and logical structure of both sentences. In this case, the first sentence ('Well then.') does not provide any information, affirmation, or negation that would guarantee the truth of the second sentence ('Absolutely not.'). There is no clear logical connection or causality between the two statements. To put it simply, just because someone says 'Well then,' it does not directly imply that their next statement would be 'Absolutely not,' or vice versa."},{"instruction":"Translate to German: We design goods and make devices which are used in production.

There is little doubt the orders — issued by federal judges in New York, Boston, Alexandria, Virginia, and Seattle — helped bolster the resolve of anti-Trump protesters who flooded airports over the weekend and turned up by the thousands at the White House Sunday. The rulings may also sour public perceptions of Trump’s directive. Story Continued Below However, lawyers pressing the cases acknowledged that their courtroom wins so far may directly benefit no more than a couple of hundred people essentially caught in limbo when Trump signed his order Friday afternoon limiting travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The flurry of legal rulings Saturday and early Sunday do not appear to have disturbed the central thrust of Trump’s order. The directive suspends immigration and tourism from nationals of the seven countries and halts refugee admissions while stricter vetting protocols are implemented. Tens or perhaps even hundreds of thousands of people could be affected by those changes. “Obviously, this initial litigation is not on behalf of everyone who will be ultimately affected by the executive order, but it’s the first step in challenging the executive order,” said Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union, who argued and won an order in New York Saturday night blocking deportations of those held at airports nationwide. “By sheer numbers it doesn’t affect as many people as would be affected by a lawsuit for people overseas, but I think it’s critically important because it’s the first challenge to the executive order. I think there will be broader challenges,” Gelernt added. A Trump administration official who briefed reporters on the executive order Sunday night minimized the impact of the early court rulings. “The executive order is prospective not retroactive. The purpose of the executive order is to prevent the issuance of new visas until such time as responsible vetting measures can be put in place,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “The specific issue of travelers who were in transit during the EO’s [issuance] is by and large a one-time situation. ... It’s a non-sequitur.” One Muslim-rights group, the Council on American Islamic Relations, said it planned a new federal lawsuit Monday charging that Trump’s order is unconstitutional because it amounts to thinly veiled discrimination against Muslims. That suit could face an uphill battle because courts have rarely accorded constitutional rights to foreigners outside the U.S. However, foreign citizens who are permanent U.S. residents generally have a stronger claim to recourse in the courts. In addition, legal experts say U.S. citizen relatives of foreigners could have legal standing to pursue a case charging religious discrimination. Still, presidents have broad discretion over the nation's immigration and refugee policy. A 1952 immigration law gives the chief executive the power to bar \\"any class\\" of immigrants from the country if allowing them is deemed \\"detrimental to the interests of the United States.\\" For his part, Trump insisted in a new statement Sunday that he was not discriminating against those of the Islam faith. “To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,” Trump said. “This is not about religion — this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days.” The administration also made clear for the first time Sunday night that green card holders would be presumptively exempt from the new policy, unless there was specific reason to suspect them of terrorist links. Carving out U.S. permanent residents could strengthen Trump’s legal hand to defend the policy in the courts. While broad challenges to the Trump orders could take months or even years to play out in the courts, immigration advocates involved in the legal challenges already underway had differing views about the immediate impact of the various injunctions judges issued over the weekend. While the New York judge’s order barred deportation of people held at airports following Trump’s directive, the order issued by two judges in Boston appeared to go further, requiring them to be released if they would have been under the policies in place prior to the new president’s executive action. The discrepancies between different court orders were notable enough for some lawyers to advise green-card holders flying back to the United States to reroute their flights to Boston’s Logan Airport, since the federal ruling there was the most expansive of the injunctions issued Saturday. “It’s broader in substance because it’s a prohibition on relying solely on the Trump executive order as the basis to detain or remove anyone who’s otherwise lawfully entitled to enter the U.S. The detention piece is new and the range of people is a little bit broader than in New York,” said Matthew Segal, a lawyer with the ACLU’s Massachusetts chapter. He said he believes the order issued there against detentions under the Trump order was nationwide in scope. However, the broad federal injunction issued in Boston raised questions about whether airlines would have to allow immigrants, even from the affected countries, to board an airplane to the United States. “Customs and Border Protection shall notify airlines that have flights arriving at Logan Airport of this order and the fact that individuals on these flights will not be detained or returned based solely on the basis of the Executive Order,” District Judge Allison Burroughs and Magistrate Judith Dein wrote. Segal said lawyers arguing on behalf of immigrants urged that language as part of an effort to try to limit the disruption to travelers already on flights, as well as those trying to come to the U.S. “There was some discussion in the hearing last night of making sure this order would be meaningful, so people could not only get off planes, but also get onto the plane in the first place,” Segal said. “We had been hearing from people throughout the day, folks who were essentially turned away at airports around the world … We wanted to make sure people could get onto these planes.” Normally, airlines are reluctant to allow individuals to board flights if they’re likely to be rejected by immigration authorities at the other end. Large fines are sometimes assessed. It was unclear whether the Boston judges’ order would persuade airlines to allow, for example, the boarding of a green-card holder from one of the seven countries listed in the Trump order, even if that person had not gone to a U.S. Embassy or consulate for special additional screening. Department of Homeland Security officials issued a statement Sunday night asserting that they were complying with the court orders and that they were instructing airlines to deny boarding to affected travelers. “Upon issuance of the court orders yesterday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) immediately began taking steps to comply with the orders,” the DHS statement said. “We are also working closely with airline partners to prevent travelers who would not be granted entry under the executive orders from boarding international flights to the U.S. Therefore, we do not anticipate that further individuals traveling by air to the United States will be affected.” Two narrower injunctions were also issued Saturday. One order from a judge in Seattle appeared to affect just two immigrants being held at the airport there, barring their removal from the U.S. at least through Friday. The other order, issued by a judge in Alexandria, Virginia, Saturday night, blocked the deportation of green-card holders from Dulles Airport outside Washington. That order also required that Customs officials allow green-card holders to consult with lawyers. Immigration lawyers, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and others complained that the access-to-counsel requirement was being ignored. At Dulles Sunday, attorney Sara Dill said lawyers have been barred from meeting with detainees and that Customs agents refused to confirm whether anyone is being held. She said several attorneys have discussed filing a contempt order to compel cooperation. Most green-card holders in detention at Dulles appeared to be released by late Saturday, although there were reports at least one was deported sometime over the weekend. Attorneys said Sunday afternoon that CBP had pledged to give green-card holders a list of pro bono lawyers and an opportunity to contact them. But attorneys and advocates fanned out at airports across the country complained that CBP agents were not complying with the court injunctions — reporting instances of foreigners in San Francisco and New York who faced “imminent deportation.\\" In some cases, Customs reversed course and said it would not remove the travelers from the United States. Top administration and White House officials indicated to lawmakers and reporters that the immigrants ensnared by the executive order were all being properly processed and would be released. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said during a news conference in New York that DHS Secretary John Kelly assured him that 42 foreigners stuck at airports across the country would be processed and allowed to enter the United States. But advocates said those instructions weren’t being translated to officers on the ground. “The last 48 hours has been really full of chaos and the sense of the federal government completely deciding to not comply with the Constitution and on top of that, not providing guidance to the field with respect to arriving immigrants and refugees,” said Marielena Hincapie, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. Kyle Cheney contributed to this report from Chantilly, Virginia, and Tony Romm from New York. Authors: ||||| The judge who blocked part of President Trump’s controversial immigration ban is a former Manhattan prosecutor who favors pearls for herself — and tough punishments for criminals. Brooklyn Federal Judge Ann Donnelly, who wears trademark pearls in her ears and around her neck, has handled hundreds of cases in her career, including the one against former Tyco chief Dennis Kozlowski, who was convicted of grand larceny, conspiracy and securities fraud in 2005. On Sunday, Donnelly’s former boss, Robert Morgenthau, hailed her ruling that Trump’s order would cause “irreparable injury” to some immigrants if they were forced to return to their home countries. “I think her decision was typical of her sense of justness and fairness,” the retired Manhattan district attorney told the Daily News. “I was so honored to see that decision. I think she’s a credit to the bar. We are proud of her.” Protesters rally in lower Manhattan against Trump’s travel ban Donnelly’s Saturday decision against the executive order reverberated across the country Sunday. Judges in Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington State also signed orders halting parts of the executive order that brought chaos, confusion and protests to airports nationwide. Brooklyn federal Judge Ann Donnelly has handled hundreds of cases in her career and issued tough punishments for criminals. (New York Daily News) Donnelly, 57, a graduate of the University of Michigan and Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law, was nominated to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama upon the recommendation of Sen. Chuck Schumer. The Senate confirmed her by a 95-2 vote in 2015. The Michigan native began her legal career in New York, working for Morgenthau from 1984 to 2009. In that office, she rose from an assistant to a senior trial attorney to head of the office’s family child abuse unit. During her tenure, she prosecuted the case of Sante Kimes, half of the grifter team found guilty of killing a rich Manhattan widow to steal her townhouse. The case was challenging because victim Irene Silverman’s body was never found. The convictions inspired former Westchester District Attorney Jeanine Pirro and the New York State Police to reopen their investigation into the case of real estate scion Robert Durst, the prime suspect in the 1982 disappearance and presumed murder of his wife, Kathy. ||||| Ann M. Donnelly waited half a year for her chance to convince the Senate that she would make a good federal judge. When the day finally came, she packed as many relatives as she could into the benches. In her opening comments, she named every single one of them. Donnelly introduced the senators to her husband, Michael. Her sister Sarah and brother Thomas. And then their spouses and their four children. And to her mother and late father — “I know he is watching,” she told the Judiciary Committee in the spring of 2015. And her two daughters, and their boyfriends. And then Saturday night, after a year and a week on the federal bench, Donnelly sat in her own courtroom in Brooklyn while families shouted and cried in airports nationwide. ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt announces to a crowd outside a Brooklyn courthouse that a federal judge had stayed deportations nationwide of those detained on entry to the United States following an executive order from President Trump that targeted citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries. (ACLU Nationwide/Facebook) President Trump’s sudden ban on refugees and visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries had interrupted reunions midflight, leaving aunts, nephews, fathers and daughters stranded on opposite sides of security cordons, while federal officials decided who would be deported by presidential decree. That’s the night the daughter of Mary and Jack Donnelly — whose speeches and rulings had rarely traveled beyond courthouse walls — became known across the world as the first judge to block Trump’s order. Never before in her long legal career had Donnelly gained such attention. Nowhere close. Her old college roommate, Darcy Gibson Berglund, remembers the Ohio-raised English major starring in a campus rendition of “Pippin” in the late 1970s but then quickly leaving the stage for the law. “She’s an intellectual, she was not going to pursue theater,” Berglund said. But she said her friend retained “a facility with language” after graduating from law school in 1984. Donnelly spent the next quarter-century as a New York prosecutor. Her most famous case was against two executives who looted their company — a trial that the New York Times described as “six months of sometimes tedious testimony.” The paper recounted Donnelly’s closing arguments in the Tyco International case, when she “at times seemed like a schoolteacher lecturing her students.” The executives “believed they were above the law, and they believe the rules that apply to other people do not apply to them,” Donnelly told the jury in 2004. The men were convicted. This week, some of Donnelly’s old colleagues praised her demeanor during that trial — one telling the Times she was “the calm center of the spinning wheel,” even then. She made state judge a few years after her victory in the Tyco trial, in 2009, and for years handled mostly criminal trials. [Trump official appears to walk back inclusion of green-card holders in travel ban] Donnelly would later tell senators that sentencing someone to prison “is one of the most difficult tasks a judge faces.” Some of her cases, however, were so horrific it didn’t seem hard. “Not only did you strangle this woman, you then chopped her up,” she told a man in 2010, according to the New York Daily News, before sentencing him to 19 years to life for killing his ex-girlfriend and burying her in concrete. If the killer were ever released, the paper noted, he would be deported because he had come to the United States illegally. Several years later, a populist Republican would begin crafting campaign speeches around violent immigrants. But first, Donnelly had to wait. And wait, and wait, and wait after President Barack Obama nominated her to the federal court in November 2014, promising she would “serve the American people with integrity and an unwavering commitment to justice.” The Senate Judiciary Committee did not hold hearings to approve her for months, a common theme in an era when White House and Congress stood divided. [McConnell: We don’t have religious tests in this country] “I’m thrilled the committee is finally moving forward,” Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in May 2015. “I know Ann well.” He spoke of her parents in Ohio, and her work prosecuting sex crimes. He told his colleagues of an office Donnelly had left long ago, where “her reputation is legendary.” “She is at her core a kind, thoughtful, compassionate person,” Schumer said. He asked her family to stand. “You’ll see, it’s a great sight.” Donnelly’s mother and a dozen-some siblings, children, spouses, nieces and friends all rose in the chamber. One woman wiped tears from her eyes after Donnelly took the table at the front of the room. The senators asked her only two questions, and only about criminal law. “It’s a certain risk a judge takes,” Donnelly told Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), speaking of times she had tried to rehabilitate rather than punish a young offender, in hopes to “save someone from what is bound to be a life of crime.” But mostly, Donnelly spoke of her family before ceding the table and waiting for the Senate’s decision. Another half a year passed until the Senate confirmed her, nearly unanimously, with only two nays. [Senate Democrats vow legislation to block Trump’s travel ban] Yet more months went by before Donnelly was sworn in, quoting Abraham Lincoln in Brooklyn, and speaking once again about her family. She made no great news for a full year on the federal bench — until Saturday evening, when protesters thronged major U.S. airports and an executive with the American Civil Liberties Union tweeted directions to Donnelly’s courthouse. “Go right now if you can,” he wrote. It had by then been a full day since Trump signed an executive order he said would “keep radical Islamic terrorists” out of the country — but which turned out to instantly bar people who had spent weeks or years planning journeys to the United States, and in some cases were already here.

And Binto Adan, who The Post reported had flown thousands of miles with her 8- and 9-year-old children expecting to see her husband but who ended up being detained all day at Dulles International Airport because her family is Somali. “I am looking for my parents! They are elderly!” a crying woman shouted in the same airport that night. And in cities from Dallas to Seattle, bewildered families sought missing members, and the ACLU’s emergency request to stop the deportations found its way to Donnelly’s courtroom in New York. She had once been a government lawyer, but that night, she showed little patience for their arguments, The Post reported. “Our own government presumably approved their entry to the country,” Donnelly said, weighing the risks of sending unknown numbers of people back across the oceans. An ACLU lawyer interrupted the hearing to warn Donnelly that a flier was about to be deported to war-torn Syria unless she acted immediately. Donnelly asked whether the government could guarantee that person’s safety and, unconvinced by the answer, issued her order just before 9 p.m. Sending travelers back could cause “irreparable harm,” she ruled. She’d turned more eloquent phrases, but this time her written words were photographed and immediately shared across the world. Stay of ban removals pic.twitter.com/jZjtidm2IF — Omar C. Jadwat (@OmarJadwat) January 29, 2017 “Stay is granted,” the executive director of the ACLU Voting Rights Project wrote on Twitter. “Stay is national.” By early Sunday morning, tearful and exhausted people were emerging from security areas across the United States. They had no guarantee for their future in the United States, but they had a reprieve from immediate deportation. And as families filtered out into the cities, the name of a federal judge they’d never heard of was in headlines across the globe. An earlier version of this post referred incorrectly to the “federal circuit.” Donnelly is a federal judge for the Eastern District of New York. 1 of 40 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × How people reacted to Trump’s immigration ban View Photos Thousands protested the president’s executive order outside the White House, at Trump International Hotel and at Dulles International Airport.

Hypothesis: The hats are black. .Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Choices: * yes. * it is not possible to tell. * no.","output":"Based on the information provided in the premise, we can analyze and provide a detailed answer to the multi-select problem concerning the hypothesis about the black hats. The premise states that two priests are wearing white robes and black hats, are clasping their hands, and appear to be leading a church service. Our task is to determine whether we can conclude that the hypothesis (the hats are black) is true if the premise is true. The hypothesis clearly states that the hats are black. According to the premise, the two priests are indeed wearing black hats. Since the hypothesis is derived directly from the information provided in the premise, we can safely ascertain the following: Yes - We can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The reasoning behind this conclusion is based on the fact that both the premise and the hypothesis indicate that the priests are wearing black hats. There is a clear consistency between the premise and the hypothesis in terms of the details about the hats' color. As a result, if the premise is deemed to be true, the hypothesis stating that the hats are black would be true as well. It is important to note that the answer is derived specifically from the premise being true and may not apply if the premise were to be altered or proven false. The other choices can be disregarded in this instance because: * It is not possible to tell - This choice can be dismissed as we have sufficient evidence and a clear connection between the premise and the hypothesis that allows us to reach a conclusion. * No - This choice can also be dismissed, as there is no contradiction or discrepancy between the premise and the hypothesis. The information given about the hats' color in both the premise and the hypothesis aligns accurately, leading to a consistent and definitive answer. In conclusion, based on the provided premise, we can ascertain that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The correlation between the premise and the hypothesis concerning the color of the priests' hats allows us to reach this result with confidence."},{"instruction":"Background: Specific humidity (or moisture content) is the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total mass of the moist air parcel.[13] Specific humidity is approximately equal to the mixing ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor in an air parcel to the mass of dry air for the same parcel. As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass.

The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded.

By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.

However, some research suggests that there may be a correlation between birth month and birth weight. A study published in the journal \\"Heliyon\\" in 2019 analyzed data from over 1,400,000 births in the United States between January 1994 and December 2016. This extensive study found that babies born in late summer and early fall months, particularly in August and September, tend to have slightly higher birth weights on average compared to those born in other months. There are a few theories as to why this trend may occur. One theory is related to maternal vitamin D exposure during pregnancy. Vitamin D is crucial for the development of the baby and has been linked to birth weight. Sunlight is a vital source of vitamin D, and mothers who are pregnant during the warmer months are more likely to be exposed to sunlight and maintain higher levels of vitamin D. This could potentially lead to babies born in late summer and early fall having higher birth weights. Another theory is that cold and flu season, which typically peaks in the winter months, could have an impact on maternal health and, consequently, the baby's birth weight. Pregnant women who fall ill during this period may experience challenges to their immune systems, leading to possible differences in nutrient transfer or placental function. This could result in slightly smaller babies being born in the months that follow, which coincide with late winter and early spring. It is essential to note that while these studies may suggest a correlation between birth month and birth weight, many factors can influence a baby's size at birth. An individual baby's weight at birth is determined by various factors such as genetics, maternal health, and the quality of prenatal care, which can all operate independently of the baby's month of birth. So, while the studies provide interesting insight into possible trends, it is important not to overgeneralize or misinterpret this information. Each baby's development is unique, and a baby's birth weight will not necessarily determine their overall health or future outcomes."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to German: Is your IT landscape in keeping with your business processes?

Or, how about bollo*ks. This is truly awful, more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise. Julia Roberts is a skilled actress, and usually her work is of the highest standard. This movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient. Normally she is the consummate professional, yet I swear that in her eyes, there were signs of bewilderment and despair. The one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director (Chris Walken) turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors. Unfortunately, that theme wasn't explored to it's full potential. Too little, too late. Zeta Jones was wooden, Cusack was Cusack, and Crystal should stick to acting.

It is a good design idea, and this should be an easy fix. I'd like to buy a pair that were actually correctly calibrated. The teaspoon police slipped up on this one! Answer: Options: (1). No; (2). Yes; Answer:","output":"Based on the review, it appears that the user has mixed feelings about the product. They appreciate the design, finding it convenient for getting into spice jar lids, and have expressed an interest in buying a pair that were accurately calibrated. However, the user clearly states that the measurements of the spoons are off by 25-50%, except for the teaspoon measure. This is a serious flaw, particularly for a product whose primary function is to give accurate measurements for cooking or baking purposes. Taking this into consideration, it can be inferred that the user would likely not recommend this product in its current state to other potential consumers, as the inaccuracies present may lead to potential issues in recipes that require precise measurement. However, the user appears to be open to the possibility of recommending a future version of the product, should the manufacturer rectify the issue mentioned. So to answer your question, the most suitable selection from the options (1).No and (2).Yes, would be (1).No because the user sees a serious flaw in the incorrect calibration which results in poor performance of the product.

The lyrics for \\"My Happiness\\" were written by Bernard Fanning, Powderfinger's lead singer and songwriter. The rest of the band are co-credited with Fanning for composing the track. The song describes feelings of love and separation; Sain's Pennie Dennison said it described \\"the pining feeling you experience when you spend time away from the one you love\\". Fanning called it \\"a sad story of touring and the absence loneliness that comes with it\\". The extensive time spent touring took its toll on the band, and it was on the back of this that Fanning wrote \\"My Happiness\\". Thus, he expressed confusion at its being considered a romantic song. \\"My Happiness\\" was attacked by some fans as being \\"like Lauryn Hill, bland and boring Top 40 bullshit\\"; guitarist Ian Haug rebutted by pointing out that the song was an example of the new emotional level on which Powderfinger made music, while Fanning was more aggressive in his defence of the song. In response to being dubbed \\"Mr Miserable\\" by The Sun-Herald's Peter Holmes for the lyrics of \\"My Happiness\\" and \\"These Days\\", Fanning pointed out that the songs could be construed either as melancholy, or as part of \\"the most hopeful record ... in a long time\\". Much of Fanning's writing is inspired by non-rock music, and \\"My Happiness\\" is no exception. Gospel and soul music that is \\"unashamedly about love and how good it makes you feel\\" was common during the Odyssey Number Five recording sessions. Powderfinger worked hard in those sessions to ensure a more polished work than Internationalist; guitarist Darren Middleton concluded that \\"My Happiness\\", \\"The Metre\\", and \\"Up & Down & Back Again\\" were more \\"complete\\" because of the band's efforts. The lighter elements of \\"My Happiness\\" in comparison to some of the band's earlier work saw Fanning reveal his passion for several other musicians, such as James Taylor--something that \\"five years ago ... would have been an embarrassing thing to say\\". Answer this question \\"Besides music any other sources of inspiration for \\"My Happiness\\"?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Besides music, another source of inspiration for \\"My Happiness\\" was the extensive time spent touring by the band, which took its toll on them and led to feelings of absence and loneliness. This inspired Bernard Fanning to write the song capturing these emotions."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text. Rachel, unlike Katrina, tries to avoid confrontation as they get very upset.","output":"Rachel, unlike Katrina, tries to avoid confrontation as they get very upset. This stems from Rachel's inherent aversion to conflict and her highly empathetic nature. Whenever faced with a potential confrontation, Rachel's first step is to assess the situation carefully and identify the root of the issue. She believes that by understanding the source of the disagreement, she is better equipped to address it in a calm and non-aggressive manner. After identifying the root issue, Rachel's second step is to put herself in the other person's shoes and try to understand their perspective. She finds that by empathizing with others and validating their feelings, she can amicably resolve issues without causing further emotional distress. This approach not only enables Rachel to defuse tense situations but also helps in maintaining positive relationships with others, something she deeply cherishes. One of Rachel's key tactics in avoiding confrontation is active listening. Instead of trying to impose her point of view, she focuses on listening to others and finding common ground. This allows Rachel to facilitate a more productive conversation and work towards a mutually agreeable solution. In situations where confrontation seems inevitable, Rachel's strategy is to take a step back and give herself time to process and reflect on the situation. By doing this, she can approach the issue with a clearer mind and renewed emotional reserves. Consequently, this enables her to communicate her thoughts and feelings assertively, yet respectfully, helping her maintain a healthy balance between self-preservation and conflict resolution. Overall, Rachel's approach to avoiding confrontation demonstrates her commitment to fostering dialogue and understanding in her interactions with others, prioritizing harmony and empathy over aggression and discord."},{"instruction":"Instructions: The provided files include famous book titles and sentences in the English language, and we ask you to translate those to the Spanish Language.

We will follow these simple steps: 1. Understand what the problem is asking: We need to find the remainder of a number raised to a power and divided by 10. The number is (6^(4n+3)) * (6^n). 2. Identify the given options: The options provided are a) 7, b) 2, c) 4, d) 6, and e) 8. We need to find which option is the correct remainder. 3. Simplify the equation: We will first simplify the given expression before working with the remainder. (6^(4n+3)) * (6^n) = 6^(4n+3+n) = 6^(5n+3) 4. Find the pattern of remainders: Notice that the remainder of a number raised to a power and divided by 10 follows a pattern. Let's find the pattern for 6 raised to different power values and divided by 10: 6^1 = 6; remainder = 6 6^2 = 36; remainder = 6 6^3 = 216; remainder = 6 6^4 = 1296; remainder = 6 We can see that the remainder is always 6 when 6 is raised to any positive integer power and divided by 10. 5. Apply the pattern to our expression: Since our simplified expression is 6^(5n+3), and the remainder is always 6 when 6 is raised to any positive integer power and divided by 10, the remainder for the given expression must be 6 as well. 6.

Here are the step-by-step justifications: Step 1: Analyzing the question The question asks, \\"What is generally stored in a container can?\\" This means we need to select the option that best describes the typical content of a container can. Step 2: Eliminating irrelevant or incorrect options - \\"Garage\\" is not a suitable answer, as it is not something stored in a container can. It is a place for parking vehicles. - \\"Container\\" is also not suitable, as it merely repeats the term without answering the question. - \\"Pantry\\" is not a suitable answer because it is a storage room for food and items, not the contents of a container can. Step 3: Comparing the remaining choices Now we are left with two options: - Contain food - Liquid Step 4: Identifying the most appropriate answer - \\"Contain food\\" could be a suitable choice, as container cans are often used to store and preserve food items. However, the wording of the choice is a bit awkward, as it should say \\"containing food\\" or \\"food.\\" - \\"Liquid\\" is also a suitable answer since container cans are used to store liquids, such as beverages, motor oil, paint, etc. Step 5: Decision Since \\"liquid\\" is grammatically correct and a common content of container cans, it is the most appropriate answer to the question.

Think slowly and carefully, before giving your answer.","output":"While it is theoretically possible for someone to fish for largemouth bass in the Canary Islands, it is unlikely they would find them there. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) are a freshwater fish species native to North America. They have been introduced in other parts of the world, such as Europe, South Africa, and Japan, with varying degrees of success. However, there is no record of largemouth bass being introduced or established in the Canary Islands' freshwater ecosystems. The Canary Islands, an archipelago located off the northwest coast of Africa, are primarily known for their saltwater fishing opportunities. The waters surrounding the islands boast a wide range of marine species, including marlin, tuna, dorado, amberjack, and various types of sharks. If someone in the Canary Islands were determined to fish for largemouth bass, they would likely need to travel to mainland Europe or another location where the species has been introduced and established.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities.

Two teams studied two types of animals: team A studied predators, while team B studied grazers. They learned a lot from this experience. Hint: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase.

He served as the head football coach at Western Reserve University, Vanderbilt University and Wittenberg University in a career lasting more than 30 years, compiling a win-loss-tie record of 168-45-8. Edwards also coached the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL) from 1941 to 1942, tallying a 4-9-1 record, and served as an assistant coach for the NFL's Cleveland Browns in the late 1940s. Raised near Massillon, Ohio, Edwards was the son of an immigrant from Wales who worked in the area's coal mines. Context: Edwards resigned from coaching in 1969, when he was 63 years old, although he continued to work at Wittenberg as the school's athletic director. Dave Maurer, his long-time assistant, took over as the school's coach. By the end of his career, Edwards's 168-45-8 overall college record gave him the second-best winning percentage in the country among active coaches with at least 100 wins. Edwards was given a commendation by President Richard Nixon for his achievements as a coach and won a Football Writers Association of America award for contributions to the game. \\"His retirement is Wittenberg's loss, but more than that, it is college football's loss,\\" University of Alabama coach Bear Bryant said at the time. Edwards retired in February 1973 after 39 years as a coach and administrator and said he would concentrate on hunting and fishing. He was inducted into the Ohio Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1979, Wittenberg's Athletics Hall of Honor in 1985 and into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1986. He was also inducted into the Western Reserve Hall of Fame and the Vanderbilt Hall of Fame in 1986. Edwards died in 1987. He and his wife Dorothy had three children. The tough but compassionate approach to coaching Edwards espoused influenced many men who worked under him, including Maurer, who led Wittenberg to a 129-23-3 record between 1969 and 1983. Wittenberg's football stadium is named Edwards-Maurer Field in honor of both head coaches. The winner of the Wittenberg-Case Western Reserve football game receives the Bill Edwards Trophy. Edwards was also close with Steve Belichick, who played for him at Western Reserve and for the Detroit Lions and later served as an assistant under him at Vanderbilt and North Carolina. Belichick's son Bill was named after Edwards, who was also Bill's godfather. Bill Belichick later became an assistant coach in the NFL and is the head coach of the New England Patriots as of 2018.

The Midwest is a region in the United States that includes 12 states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Out of the possible answers provided: 1. Strip mall and shopping mall are places where a clothing store might be located, but they don't refer to where Billy lives. 2. Heaven is a concept related to afterlife or paradise in various religions, and it is not a place where someone would reside while owning a store. 3.

A: Pick your answer from: [i] habitat; [ii] air; [iii] water; [iv] ecosystem; Answer:","output":"A: The interactions between plants and other organisms result in the cycling of chemical nutrients within an ecosystem (iv). An ecosystem is a community of living organisms, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, interacting with one another and their non-living physical environment, which includes air, water, and soil. The cycling of nutrients in an ecosystem is essential for various processes, such as growth, reproduction, and decomposition. In an ecosystem, plants play a crucial role in nutrient cycling as they convert inorganic nutrients, like carbon dioxide and water, into organic compounds through the process of photosynthesis. These organic compounds are then used by plants to grow and produce energy. When plants die and decompose, they release nutrients back into the environment, which are then taken up by other organisms. Additionally, plant roots absorb nutrients from the soil, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and use them to support their growth. This process is also part of nutrient cycling in an ecosystem. Similarly, other organisms, such as herbivores, consume plant matter and acquire nutrients essential for their own growth and survival. The waste products and remains of these herbivores, as well as other organisms in an ecosystem, eventually decompose and release nutrients back into the environment. Moreover, there are various interactions between plants and other organisms, such as mutualistic relationships, where both organisms benefit. For example, plants can form symbiotic associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria or mycorrhizal fungi, which enable the plants to obtain important nutrients from the environment more efficiently, while the microorganisms benefit from the sugars produced by the plants. In conclusion, the interactions between plants and other organisms help in cycling chemical nutrients within an ecosystem. This cycling is essential to maintaining the stability of the ecosystem and ensuring the continuous growth, reproduction, and decomposition of organisms that reside within it."},{"instruction":"Some question: The speed of a car is 120 km in the first hour and 60 km in the second hour.

Associated Press. and Daily Mail Reporter. The mommy blogger who is accused of fatally poisoning her 5-year-old son with salt is on suicide watch in a New York jail while she awaits trial. At a hearing on Wednesday, Lacey Spears' lawyer asked the public to 'keep and open mind' about the charges. Spears 'looks forward to her day in court and the opportunity to challenge the allegations,' attorney Stephen Riebling said after a brief court session. 'We continue to trust the people will keep an open mind and not judge Lacey or the facts of this case based on what's been reported,' he said. 'The defense of this case will be focused on the relevant facts, not fiction.' Scroll down for video. Lacey Spears (pictured here in May) is 'devastated' by her son's death and is currently on suicide watch, her lawyer revealed. He would not elaborate. Spears, 26, was not in court on Wednesday. Riebling would not comment on how she is doing behind bars except to say that she is 'devastated' by her son's death. A sister, Rebecca Spears, was in court but would not comment afterward. Lacey Spears, of Scottsville, Kentucky, pleaded not guilty last month on charges of depraved murder and manslaughter in the death of Garnett-Paul Spears. The boy died in January at the Westchester Medical Center when, prosecutors say, his sodium levels rose to an extremely dangerous level with no medical explanation. Spears, then living in Chestnut Ridge, New York, was sharing her son's hospital room - he had been brought there after suffering seizures - and doctors thought she might be harming him. Prosecutors believe she administered sodium through a feeding tube in his stomach. Garnett-Paul Spears died in a New York hospital from unexplained sodium poisoning. Prosecutors say his mother slipped it into his feeding tube. Spears, who is originally from Decatur, Alabama, for years had chronicled on social media what she said were the boy's various medical crises. The depraved murder charge alleges extreme recklessness rather than intentional killing. It carries the same maximum sentence, 25 years to life in prison. Spears' lawyers have not yet filed the paperwork that would be required if they plan to offer a psychiatric defense. They would not comment Wednesday on whether that was being contemplated.

While social media offers many benefits like instant communication and connectivity with people all around the world, there has also been increasing concern about its potential impact on the mental health of users, specifically in adolescents. Adolescents, defined as individuals between the ages of 10 and 19, are in a critical stage of development, during which time they are particularly susceptible to external influences. Many adolescents are spending a significant amount of time immersed in social media, possibly leading to consequences on their mental health. This situation raises important questions about whether or not interventions should be implemented to better understand, address, and potentially mitigate these potential negative effects. In order to assess the relationship between social media usage and mental health in adolescents, it is essential to explore the various factors involved, such as the type of content being consumed, the frequency and duration of usage, and the potential repercussions on overall well-being. Hypothesis: Frequent and prolonged use of social media has a negative impact on adolescents' mental health, leading to increased risks of depression, anxiety, and other psychological issues. Given the context of the potential impact of social media on adolescents' mental health, the hypothesis states that frequent and prolonged use of social media platforms negatively impacts the mental health of users in this age group, leading to a higher risk of depression, anxiety, and other psychological issues. To test this hypothesis, one could perform a longitudinal study, tracking a large sample of adolescents over an extended period of time. This study would measure social media usage in terms of time spent and frequency of use, while also assessing the participants' psychological well-being through standardized instruments such as surveys and questionnaires. Furthermore, other factors contributing to the participants' mental health, such as family dynamics, social environment, and personal factors, would also need to be taken into account to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between social media use and mental health in adolescents. If the hypothesis is confirmed, preventive and intervention measures may be taken to limit the risks associated with excessive social media use in adolescents. Such measures could include promoting digital detox programs, educating adolescents on healthy social media habits, and encouraging parents to monitor their children's online activity and foster open discussions about their experiences on social media. Additionally, policymakers may consider implementing regulations to minimize the potentially harmful effects of social media on the mental health of adolescents, such as limiting the amount of targeted advertisements, regulating harmful content, and promoting digital literacy."},{"instruction":"Read this: Al-Azhar University, founded in Cairo, Egypt in 975 by the Ismaʻīlī Shīʻī Fatimid dynasty as a jāmiʻah, had individual faculties for a theological seminary, Islamic law and jurisprudence, Arabic grammar, Islamic astronomy, early Islamic philosophy and logic in Islamic philosophy.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"He went to a party last night and drank too much.\\" - Sentence B: \\"He went to a party last night and studied too much.\\" Let me think hard. Detailed solution:","output":"Upon careful analysis, it can be discerned that both sentences are grammatically and syntactically correct. However, from a logical or contextual perspective, one of them seems less likely to happen. Sentence A: \\"He went to a party last night and drank too much.\\" This sentence is plausible as parties are often associated with social drinking. It is not uncommon for people to consume a substantial amount of alcoholic beverages and end up drinking too much at parties. Sentence B: \\"He went to a party last night and studied too much.\\" In this case, although the sentence is grammatically correct, the context is what makes it nonsensical. Parties are typically social events attended for entertainment and relaxation, not for studying. It would be unusual for someone to go to a party with the intention of studying excessively, making this sentence illogical in its context. Therefore, \\"Sentence B\\" is the more nonsensical option when compared to \\"Sentence A.\\""},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Great app..

He also buys 50 in pants. How much does he spend? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"To find out how much John spends, we'll break this problem down step by step. Step 1: Calculate the total cost of t-shirts. John buys 3 t-shirts, each costing 20. To find the total cost of the t-shirts, we multiply the number of t-shirts by the cost of each t-shirt. 3 t-shirts * 20/t-shirt = 60 So, John spends 60 on t-shirts. Step 2: Calculate the total cost of pants. John also buys pants, which cost 50. There's no additional calculation needed for the pants, as the total cost has been provided. Step 3: Add the total cost of t-shirts and pants to find John's total spending. Now, we add the cost of the t-shirts and the cost of the pants to find out how much John spends in total. 60 (t-shirts) + 50 (pants) = 110 Therefore, John spends a total of 110 on t-shirts and pants."},{"instruction":"Select from options: Continue writing the next sentence.

It is more than just a side dish; it can transform a meal's flavor and texture profile. Nevertheless, the secret to a flawlessly cooked rice begins with the right saucepan and accurate measuring techniques. In this article, we will discuss the crucial steps to meticulously choose the perfect saucepan, properly measure rice, and guide you through the fundamental steps to elevate your meals by cooking impeccable, irresistible rice. Section 1: Selecting the Right Saucepan 1.1 Saucepan Material When selecting a saucepan to cook rice, consider the material and how evenly it distributes heat. The ideal choices are those made from stainless steel, aluminum, or non-stick materials. Stainless steel, with its even heat distribution, is a popular choice. Aluminum, while lightweight, can conduct heat well, while non-stick pans provide the convenience of hassle-free cleaning. Enamel-coated cast iron saucepans are also a suitable option to maintain consistent heat throughout the cooking process. 1.2 Size Matters Rice expands as it cooks, so make sure that your saucepan has enough space to accommodate this expansion. A three quart saucepan with a capacity of around 12 cups is a wise choice for most situations. This size will enable you to cook various types of rice in varying amounts without worrying about it overflowing during the cooking process. 1.3 The Lid The saucepan lid plays an essential role in rice cooking. A tight-fitting lid will keep the steam trapped inside the saucepan, which is crucial for perfectly steamed rice. Glass lids offer the advantage of monitoring the rice's progress without lifting the lid and releasing steam, but well-fitted stainless steel or aluminum lids will also do the job. Section 2: Measuring Rice 2.1 Rice-to-Water Ratio The rice-to-water ratio is essential in ensuring well-cooked rice. Different types of rice generally require varying amounts of water: - White Rice (Short or Medium-Grain): 1 cup of rice to 1.5 cups of water. - White Rice (Long-Grain): 1 cup of rice to 1.75 cups of water. - Brown Rice (Short or Medium-Grain): 1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water. - Brown Rice (Long-Grain): 1 cup of rice to 2.25 cups of water. - Basmati or Jasmine Rice: 1 cup of rice to 1.5 cups of water. 2.2 Techniques for Measuring To measure rice, use a standard measuring cup to scoop the rice from its container. Level the rice in the measuring cup by sliding a straight-edged utensil, such as a butter knife or a flat spatula, over the top. This method will ensure that you have precisely the intended amount for your recipe. Make sure to adjust the amount according to your desired serving sizes. Section 3: Cooking Rice Perfectly 3.1 Rinsing Rice Prior to cooking, rinse the rice under cold running water in a fine-mesh sieve or strainer to remove excess starch and debris. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear to avoid clumped or gummy rice. 3.2 Proper Cooking Methods Once you've selected the proper saucepan, measured your rice and water, and rinsed the rice, you can proceed with the actual cooking process: - Start by heating your saucepan on medium and add some butter or oil if desired, then add the rice and cook for a few minutes. - Pour the measured amount of water into the saucepan, stirring to ensure the rice is evenly distributed along the bottom. - Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan with its tight-fitting lid. - Allow the rice to steam, avoiding opening the lid, until it absorbs the water and becomes tender. The cooking time varies depending on the type of rice (White Rice: 15-20 minutes, Brown Rice: 45-50 minutes, Basmati or Jasmine Rice: 15-20 minutes). - Let the rice sit, covered, for at least 5 minutes after being removed from heat. This additional resting time will make the rice fluffier. - Finally, use a fork to fluff the rice, gently separating the grains before serving. Conclusion Rice is a beloved part of countless dishes around the world. By selecting the right saucepan, measuring your rice accurately, and employing proper cooking methods, you'll be well on your way to perfecting the art of rice cookery. Follow these simple steps to elevate your dishes and satisfy your palate each and every time."},{"instruction":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: One year, a college in the Unites States announced that it would offer a lot of money for the pure white marigold . The high reward attracted so many people, but in the nature, besides golden, the marigold is brown, and it is not easy to get the white one. So after they were excited for a time, many people had forgotten the announcement. One normal day after 20 years, the college received a letter and 100 seeds of pure white marigold. It turned out to be an old woman of over 70 years old. Some experts in the college doubted it , but in order not to let her down, those seeds finally took root in the earth. The miracle appeared after one year: the field was covered by pure white marigold. Therefore, the old woman who was always unknown to the public became a new _ . The old woman was a flower-lover.

Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): Ancient hunter-gatherer cultures lived where?","output":"Ancient hunter-gatherer cultures lived in diverse environments across the globe, inhabiting various landscapes that were rich in food resources, offered protection from predators, and supported their nomadic way of life. As human populations grew and agriculture was developed, these early societies occupied places where they could take advantage of local plant and animal populations. Some key types of environments where ancient hunter-gatherer cultures lived include: 1. Forests and Woodlands: Dense forests and woodlands provided an abundance of resources for ancient hunter-gatherers. These areas supported a diverse array of plant and animal life, which facilitated the gathering of edible plants, nuts, fruits, and fungi, as well as the hunting of animals and birds. Examples of these cultures include the Aka people of central Africa and the Pygmies of the Congo Basin. 2. Grasslands and Savannahs: Ancient hunter-gatherers living in the open grasslands and savannahs relied heavily on the hunting of game animals such as deer, bison, or antelope. Vegetation in these regions was relatively sparse, which necessitated a greater focus on animal-based subsistence strategies. Examples of these cultures include the !Kung people of the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa and the traditional Aboriginal Australians. 3. Coastal and Riverine Environments: Coastal and riverine environments provided ancient hunter-gatherers with a diverse array of food resources, such as fish, shellfish, and waterfowl. These areas also offered easy transportation routes and access to a wider range of habitats, which contributed to the success of these communities. Examples of these cultures include the Native American tribes of the Pacific Northwest Coast, such as the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian, and the Ainu people of northern Japan. 4. Mountainous Regions: Ancient hunter-gatherer societies living in mountainous regions adapted to a rugged environment with colder and more unpredictable weather. They focused on hunting game animals, such as deer, elk, and mountain goats, and gathering available plant resources. Examples of these cultures include the Andean Quechua people and the nomadic tribes of the Himalayas, such as the Sherpa. 5. Arctic Regions: Hunter-gatherers living in the harsh, cold environment of the Arctic relied predominantly on the hunting of large marine mammals, such as seals, walruses, and whales, as well as caribou and fish. These societies developed specialized tools and strategies for survival in these extreme conditions. Examples of these cultures include the Inuit people of Greenland and the Yupik and Inupiat peoples of Alaska. In conclusion, ancient hunter-gatherer cultures lived in a wide variety of environments, from dense forests to open grasslands, and from coastal regions to mountainous and even Arctic areas. Their choice of habitation often depended on the availability of abundant food sources, the presence of suitable shelter, and other resources that allowed them to maintain a nomadic lifestyle."},{"instruction":"Question: Pick which sentence is not logical.

Don't worry, the police have caught the bad people, and they are in big trouble now. Now, let me explain what happened more clearly. A meat cleaver is a big knife made for cutting meat, and a hammer is a tool used for hitting nails into wood. Both of these things are not meant to hurt people, but sadly, the bad people used them in a wrong way. They attacked the father and son, but luckily, they were not badly hurt and are now safe. After the attack, the people who saw what happened quickly called the police, and they started looking for the bad people. I am sure you have seen the police – they are the good guys who protect us from danger and catch the bad guys. The police worked really hard and found the three people who attacked the father and son, and now they are arrested. That means they can't do any more bad things, and they might have to go to a place called jail. There, they will learn how to behave like good people and not to harm others again. Everyone is happy that the police were able to catch the bad people so quickly, and people are glad that the father and son are safe. It is important to remember that there are always people around us who will help when bad things happen, like the police, our friends, and neighbors. So kiddo, we should always be kind to one another. We should never use things like meat cleavers and hammers to hurt others. Instead, let's use them for the right reasons – like cooking delicious food or building a treehouse!

It's nothing for a big, strong schoolboy to elbow an elderly woman aside in the dash for the last remaining seat on the tube or bus, much less stand up and offer his seat to her. This question of giving up seats in public transport is much argued by young men, who say that, since women have claimed equality, they no longer deserve to be treated with courtesy and that those who go out to work should take their turn in _ like anyone else. Women have never claimed to be physically as strong as men. Even if it's not agreed, however, that young men should stand up for older women, the fact remains that courtesy should be shown to the old, the sick and the burdened. Are we really so lost to all ideals of unselfishness that we can sit there indifferently reading the paper or a book, saying to ourselves \\" First come, first served\\", while a gray-haired woman, a mother with a young child or a cripple stands?

One cannot commend this, of course, but one does feel there is just a little more excuse. If cities are to remain pleasant places to live in at all, however, it seems necessary, not only that communication in transport should be improved, but also that communication between human beings should be kept smooth and polite.

During their escape, they find themselves on an airfield, where they hide the rocket pack, ending in an auto-airplane accident while escaping, with the police in hot pursuit. Stunt pilot Cliff Secord, whose Gee Bee racer was totaled during the accident, and airplane mechanic Peevy later find the rocket pack hidden in a bi-plane cockpit. Meanwhile, well-known actor Neville Sinclair, who hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket pack, sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that the rocket pack is at the airfield. Cliff's aspiring actress girlfriend, Jenny Blake, has a bit part in the latest Neville Sinclair film. On the set, Sinclair overhears Cliff attempting to tell Jenny about the rocket pack, so he invites her to dinner. Afterward, at a local air show, Cliff uses the rocket pack (and Peevy's newly designed face-hiding finned helmet) to rescue his friend Malcolm, who is drunkenly piloting a bi-plane. Having been seen by the newsreel press in the airshow audience (and Valentine's gangsters), \\"The Rocketeer\\" becomes a media sensation. Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to find the rocket pack. The FBI arrives, but Cliff and Peevy escape, while Lothar steals its detailed schematics drawn up by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy, trapped by several Valentine mobsters, learn that Jenny had a date with Sinclair, and of the actor's involvement in the hunt for the rocket pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum.[Note 1] At Sinclair's home, Jenny discovers that he is a Nazi secret agent, and Jenny knocks him out.

John, upon seeing the ad, comments that he really should go and get a new pair since he is nearsighted and hasn't gotten a new pair of glasses in a couple years. Rick says he is glad that he doesn't need to wear glasses because it seems like such a pain to have to always have something on your face. John nods in agreement and then both men turn to see a woman at the other side of the break room waving at them and trying to get their attention. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person's parents are less likely to wear glasses? Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Answer:","output":"Rick's parents are less likely to wear glasses. The hint suggests that there is an increased chance of needing glasses if one or both parents need them, as myopia may be inherited. Since John is nearsighted and needs glasses, it is more likely that his parents also wear glasses.

First, let's look at the left side of the equation. We have two terms with n: 81*n and 45*n. Let's add those together. When we do that, we get (81-45)*n = 36*n. Now our equation looks like this: 36*n = 35*n - 2. Next, let's look at the right side of the equation. We have: 35*n - 2. To make it easier, we want to get rid of the 35*n. To do that, we subtract 35*n from both sides of the equation. When we do that, we get: (36*n - 35*n) = (35*n - 35*n) - 2. On the left side, we have: (36-35)*n = 1*n, which is just the same as \\"n\\". On the right side, the 35*n terms cancel out, and we are left with just -2. So now our equation says: n = -2.

They also had no doubt that \\"vast stockpiles\\" of chemical weapons had been amassed in Syria, the ISC said. Al-Qaeda and \\"individual jihadists\\" were both seen as threats, it added. \\"There is a risk of extremist elements in Syria taking advantage of the permissive environment to develop external attack plans, including against Western targets,\\" the ISC, which oversees the work of the intelligence agencies, said in its annual report. Protests in Syria, inspired by the Arab Spring which saw changes of government in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, were brutally suppressed by security forces in 2011. The stand-off has since escalated into a civil war which has claimed tens of thousands of lives so far, according to UN estimates. By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The annual ISC report provides a unique insight into the work of Britain's intelligence agencies - but it has its limits. It makes clear that cyber is moving up the agenda, although terrorism remains the biggest concern thanks to the impact of Syria and the danger of chemical weapons getting into the wrong hands. More is being done in conjunction with allies to the point where the committee was told that, in the recent campaign in Libya, Britain \\"went to war on German maps\\". There is also the intriguing fact that MI6 is questioned over a payment of several million pounds \\"relating to an operation with a foreign intelligence service which was not adequately documented\\". No more detail on this, nor on two of the most controversial issues of recent months: the killing in Woolwich of Lee Rigby and revelations by Edward Snowden about GCHQ. Those issues are being looked at separately. After hearing evidence from senior members of the intelligence agencies and the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), the committee highlighted \\"serious concern\\" among its witnesses that Syria's weapons stockpiles might be compromised. Assessments of their contents \\"vary considerably\\", the report said, but suggest they include sarin, ricin, mustard gas and VX, which the committee described as \\"the deadliest nerve agent ever created\\". \\"There has to be a significant risk that some of the country's chemical weapons stockpile could fall into the hands of those with links to terrorism, in Syria or elsewhere in the region,\\" the committee concluded. \\"If this happens, the consequences could be catastrophic.\\" The ISC also warned: \\"Large numbers of radicalised individuals have been attracted to the country, including significant numbers from the UK and Europe. \\"They are likely to acquire expertise and experience which could significantly increase the threat posed when they return home.\\" The report said there was a growing threat of attacks by \\"lone actors\\", like the assailant who stabbed Labour MP Stephen Timms while he was holding a surgery in his east London constituency in 2010. By their nature, lone actors are much harder for intelligence agencies to detect, it added. One Home Office official reportedly told the committee: \\"There is no doubt that the more sophisticated people in al-Qaeda recognise that groups are, in some ways, a thing of the past; and that encouraging lone acts of terror is exactly the way forward.\\" The ISC expressed concern that the agencies were struggling to make projected efficiency savings, due to be completed by 2014-15. It highlighted a forecast Â£59m shortfall in the Â£220m savings that the agencies - MI5, MI6 and GCHQ - were supposed to have achieved through more collaborative working. While the agencies said they were \\"fairly confident\\" that the targets set by the Treasury would be met, the committee said it \\"does not fully share that confidence\\". The committee said: \\"It is essential that real and sustainable efficiencies are delivered if frontline capabilities are to be protected. More needs to be done urgently.\\"","output":"The big bosses of the UK's intelligence agencies are worried about some really bad people getting their hands on dangerous weapons in a country called Syria. They think these bad people could use these weapons to hurt people in other countries, including the UK.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which place would see less nitrification, Mississippi Delta or Mojave Desert? Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.","output":"Based on the information provided in the text, the Mississippi Delta would see less nitrification due to hypoxia caused by frequent flooding.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown and justification of the process: 1. A butterfly starts as an egg - This is the first stage in the life cycle of a butterfly, where the female lays eggs on a suitable host plant for the caterpillars to feed on once they hatch. 2. The egg hatches - After a period of time, the eggs hatch, marking the beginning of the next stage of the life cycle. 3. A larva emerges - The larva, also known as a caterpillar, emerges from the eggshell, beginning its life outside the egg. 4. The larva eats and grows - The caterpillar feeds on the host plant, consuming enough nutrients to go through a series of growth stages called instars. 5. The larva sheds its skin - As the caterpillar grows, it sheds its skin to accommodate its increasing size, a process called molting. 6. The larva enters a chrysalis - Once the caterpillar reaches its final instar, it forms a protective casing called a chrysalis, within which it undergoes a transformation into a pupa. 7. The pupa grows inside the chrysalis - During this stage, the pupa undergoes metamorphosis, changing its body structure and developing the necessary features to become an adult butterfly. 8. The adult butterfly exits the chrysalis - After the metamorphosis is complete, the adult butterfly breaks free from the chrysalis, beginning its life as a fully formed adult. 9.

In this case, let's pick \\"climate change\\" as it is an important and relevant issue. Step 2: Develop a context To develop a context, I'll consider the various dimensions of the climate change issue, such as causes, effects, and potential solutions. This will help me create a meaningful and comprehensive context for the hypothesis. Context: In recent decades, global temperatures have been rising, with scientific consensus attributing a significant portion of this increase to human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These activities release large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere, which contribute to the greenhouse effect and the trapping of heat. This increase in temperature has led to a variety of negative effects, including more frequent and severe weather events, melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture. Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis To generate a hypothesis, I'll think about a specific aspect of the context that can be investigated, focusing on potential relationships or outcomes that can be empirically tested. Hypothesis: Implementing a global carbon tax on fossil fuel usage will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus slowing the pace of climate change and mitigating its adverse effects. Here, the hypothesis suggests a relationship between a specific policy intervention (carbon tax) and the desired outcome (reduction in greenhouse gas emissions). This hypothesis can be tested through empirical analysis, modeling, and comparison with other policy interventions, providing a basis for future research and discussion on climate change mitigation strategies."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: \\"Ae Dil Hai Mushkil\\" (English: \\"This Heart is Complicated\\") is a Hindi song from the soundtrack of the Indian film \\"Ae Dil Hai Mushkil\\".

When you exercise, your muscles experience stress, and in response, they adapt and become stronger. If you cease exercising, this stimulus is removed, and the muscles will gradually revert to their pre-exercise state. This process is called muscle atrophy, which refers to the gradual decline in muscle mass and strength due to inactivity or disuse.

Article: There are two ways to save money traveling. The first way is to get _ on the specific things you want. There is a limitation to this type of approach (,) though. If you find the lowest price on the best hotel in Honolulu at the height of the season, you will save money, but still have a very expensive vacation. Trying to get exactly what you want will generally be an expensive proposition, in travel and in life. The other approach is to be a true opportunist. This will be difficult for some of you, and entirely unacceptable to others. Nonetheless ,the travelers who get to travel the most, go to the widest variety of places, learn the most and do the most, are the opportunists. This will be true until you are so wealthy that you have no monetary (;)limits. The first time I went to Ecuador, I went there because it was cheap. If it wasn't, I would have had a great time--somewhere else. The trip lasted a month, and cost 1045, which included airfare and even the 130 fee for a guide to take me to the top or glacier covered Mount Chimborazo. I cut the cost by taking a bus from my home in Michigan to Miami, and back again when I returned from Ecuador. The round-trip ticket cost 158. The round-trip flight to Quito from Miami was only 256, because it was a courier (,) flight, which meant I signed for some luggage(car parts), and could only take carry-on luggage. Never did I feel deprived, or bored. I had a great time, eating wherever it was cheap and clean, doing all sorts of inexpensive, but interesting things, and traveling across the country to climb Chimborazo. I also met and fell in love with my wife Ana. Being an opportunist means you'll have just as much variety, and probably almost everything you want--eventually. You just have to stop trying to get exactly what you want exactly when you want it.

Based on this reasoning, the answer is \\"no.\\""},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The address I had been given was a flophouse called Casa Salvador in the scummy side of downtown, the part where the city's redevelopment (read: \\"gentrification\\") efforts hadn't yet managed to drive out the sundry undesirable elements. I walked inside past the front lobby. I could tell the desk manager wanted to hassle me, but he was too busy arguing with a middle-aged peroxide-blonde woman in a leopard-print top. Her skin was leathery and weather beaten, and I guessed she was the type who was actually a good ten years younger than she looked. I made my way up the narrow staircase that smelled of urine and bleach, going all the way to the third floor. I continued down the dimly lit hallway, past a series of closed doors that muffled the sounds of women faking moans of pleasure. Room 313 was down at the far end of the hall, and its door was already slightly ajar. I knocked anyways, but there was no answer. Pushing the door open just enough to poke my head in, I called, \\"Hello? Is anybody in there?\\" There was no response, so I went in and felt along the wall for the light switch. A single weak bulb came on, lighting up the tiny, sparse room with a dim yellow glow. The room was about 8 feet by 8 feet, and the only furniture was a dingy, unmade bed and a metal foot locker. There were no windows, no closet, and no bathroom. As I stepped all the way in, I noticed a wooden baseball bat propped up beside the door. My watch said 6:20 - twenty minutes late for the interview. I sat on the edge of the bed to wait, hoping that maybe my contact had just stepped out momentarily. After a few minutes, a phone started ringing out in the hallway. I let it ring six times with no one answering before I decided to get it - partly in the off chance it was my contact, but mostly out of morbid curiosity as to what kind of business someone would have calling this dump. Question: How did he feel when he saw the bat? Options: - Disgusted. - not enough information - Concerned. - Curious. === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"Concerned. As the narrator entered room 313, they noticed a wooden baseball bat propped up beside the door. Given the already unsettling location and atmosphere of Casa Salvador, as well as the fact that they were there for an interview that they were twenty minutes late to, the presence of a baseball bat likely added to their growing concern about the situation. The bat could suggest violence or danger, and in combination with the other aspects of the scene – the dim lighting, the sparse and uninviting room, and the lack of response from anyone inside – it becomes increasingly worrisome. This is reinforced by the description of the sundry undesirable elements in the area and the noises of the women in the other rooms. Therefore, when the narrator saw the baseball bat, they most likely felt concerned about their safety and the nature of the environment they found themselves in."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What would help the Ottomans reach their ultimate goal?\\" Context: \\"The Ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the Middle East in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler's power, and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous. The ultimate aim was to increase the state revenues without damaging the prosperity of subjects to prevent the emergence of social disorder and to keep the traditional organization of the society intact.\\" Answer: A:","output":"In order to help the Ottomans reach their ultimate goal of consolidating and extending the ruler's power, while maintaining the prosperity of the productive classes and preventing social disorder, several strategies and policies can be implemented: 1. Efficient tax system: Developing and implementing a fair and efficient tax system would ensure that revenues can be increased without causing undue burden on the productive classes. This would encourage economic growth and provide the necessary resources for the state to expand its power. 2. Promoting trade and commerce: Facilitating international and domestic trade through the establishment of trade routes, encouraging innovation, and reducing barriers to commerce would help increase the prosperity of the productive classes and state revenues. This could include ensuring the security and maintenance of trade routes, as well as fostering diplomatic relations with potential trading partners. 3. Investment in infrastructure: The state needs to invest in the development and maintenance of infrastructure to support economic growth. This may include projects such as building roads, bridges, ports, and irrigation systems to facilitate trade and improve agricultural productivity. A well-developed infrastructure would enable the productive classes to flourish and contribute to the overall prosperity of the society. 4. Education and skill development: Investing in the education and training of the population would enable the Ottomans to develop a skilled workforce capable of supporting economic growth and stability. This could be achieved through offering scholarships, establishing educational institutions, and promoting technical and vocational training programs. 5. Supporting agricultural and industrial growth: Encouraging innovation and the adoption of modern agricultural and industrial practices would ensure the consistent growth of the productive classes, contributing to the stability and prosperity of the society. State support for new technologies and best practices would help improve productivity and output, further increasing revenues. 6. Maintaining social order and stability: One of the key aspects of Ottoman society was its hierarchical structure. Maintaining this structure and ensuring social stability would involve balancing the interests of various social groups, resolving disputes fairly, and enforcing laws consistently. A stable and well-functioning society would be more conducive to economic growth and revenue generation. 7. Effective administration and governance: To achieve the ultimate goal of consolidating and extending the ruler's power, the Ottomans need to have an effective and organized administration, which can manage state affairs and revenues efficiently. This would include the establishment of institutions, appointment of capable officials, and implementation of laws and regulations. By implementing these strategies, the Ottomans could achieve their ultimate goal of consolidating and extending the ruler's power while keeping the traditional organization of society intact and maintaining the prosperity and well-being of their subjects."},{"instruction":"Continue the following story.

They signed to Tragic Hero Records in 2009. The band's current lineup is front man Schuylar Croom, guitarists Adam Tanbouz and Denis Desloge, bassist Matt Williams, and drummer Sam Huff. - The Famine was an American heavy metal band that formed in 2007 in Arlington, Texas. The band was signed to Solid State Records. - Post-hardcore is a punk rock music genre that derives from hardcore punk, maintaining hardcore's aggression and intensity, but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression initially inspired by post-punk and noise rock. Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots. - Act of Depression is the debut album by Underoath. Released July 4, 1999, through Takehold Records, the album was out of print for some time as there were only 2,000 copies originally released. Solid State reissued this album alongside \\"Cries of the Past\\" on August 20, 2013. - Underoath (stylized as Underøath or UnderOath) is an American Christian post-hardcore band from Tampa, Florida. Founded by Dallas Taylor and Luke Morton on November 30, 1997, in Ocala, Florida, subsequently its additional members were from Tampa, Florida. - Stretch Arm Strong (Also known as Stretch Armstrong) is a hardcore punk band from Irmo, South Carolina, and the flagship band for We Put Out Records. They have been active since 1992. Several of the band members are outspoken Christians, but they prefer not to be classified as a Christian band in some cases. They do prefer to be known as Christian with influences, but not as a band that \\"preaches\\". Vocalist Chris McLane appears on Zao's \\"The Lesser Lights of Heaven\\" DVD. - Training for Utopia, also stylized as TFU, was a metalcore band which existed from 19962000. - The Almost was an American Christian rock band from Clearwater, Florida, best known for being fronted by Underoath drummer and vocalist Aaron Gillespie. Formed in 2005, the band's current lineup consists of Gillespie on vocals, lead guitarist Dusty Redmon, rhythm guitarist Jay Vilardi, bassist Jon Thompson, and drummer Joe Musten. The band has released three albums and two EPs on Tooth & Nail Records, with 2009's \\"Monster Monster\\" peaking at No. 67 on the \\"Billboard\\" 200 and the most recent \\"Fear Inside Our Bones\\" released June 2013. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Paramore is an American rock band from Franklin, Tennessee, formed in 2004. The band currently consists of lead vocalist Hayley Williams and guitarist Taylor York. The group released its debut album \\"All We Know Is Falling\\" in 2005, with the album reaching number eight on the UK Rock Chart and number thirty on \\"Billboard\\"s Heatseekers Chart. While it only had a minimal commercial performance initially, the album and its lead single \\"Pressure\\" were eventually certified Gold by the RIAA after the success of the band's later material. - The Agony Scene is an American metal band from Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States. On October 8, 2008, frontman Mike Williams confirmed that the band had broken up in the spring of that year. Although The Agony Scene was known for blending several corrosive elements from genres including thrash metal, black metal and hardcore punk, the band was also generally considered to be a part of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Aaron Roderick Gillespie (born July 18, 1983) is an American musician, best known for being the original drummer and clean vocalist for the metalcore band Underoath, and was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist for the alternative rock band The Almost. Gillespie also maintains his own solo project, and released his debut full-length album, \\"Anthem Song\\" on March 8, 2011. As of August 26, 2013, he is the touring drummer for Paramore. - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - Cries of the Past is the second album by Underoath , released on July 4 , 2000 , through Takehold Records . Only 3,000 copies of the album were pressed , and , like Act of Depression , it was out of print for years .

(Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) The United Nations Population Division, which tracks demographic data from around the world, has dramatically revised its projections for what will happen in the next 90 years. The new statistics, based on in-depth survey data from sub-Saharan Africa, tell the story of a world poised to change drastically over the next several decades. Most rich countries will shrink and age (with a couple of important exceptions), poorer countries will expand rapidly and, maybe most significant of all, Africa will see a population explosion nearly unprecedented in human history. If these numbers turn out to be right – they're just projections and could change significantly under unforeseen circumstances – the world of 2100 will look very different than the world of today, with implications for everyone. It will be a place where today's dominant, developed economies are increasingly focused on supporting the elderly, where the least developed countries are transformed by population booms and where Africa, for better or worse, is more important than ever. Here is the story of the next 90 years as predicted by UN demographic data and explained in nine charts. The charts are interactive; move your cursor over them to track and compare the data. (1) The big story will be Africa Right now, with a couple of exceptions, Africa's population density is relatively low; it's a very big continent more sparsely populated than, say, Europe or East Asia. That's changing very quickly. The continent's overall population is expected to more than quadruple over just 90 years, an astonishingly rapid growth that will make Africa more important than ever. And it's not just that there will four times the workforce, four times the resource burden, four times as many voters. The rapid growth itself will likely transform political and social dynamics within African countries and thus their relationship with the rest of the world. (More on this further down.) Asia will continue to grow but its population growth, already slowing, is expected to peak about 50 years from now then start declining. As has happened in the West, rising economies will lead to declining birth rates. And that downturned curve could represent some problematic demographic issues; more also on this further down. The story in those three little lines at the bottom is less promising. Europe will continue to shrink, which is worsening its economic problems. South America's population will rise until about 2050, at which point it will begin its own gradual population decline. North America is the least ambiguous success story: it will continue to grow at a slow, sustainable rate, surpassing South America's overall population around 2070. (2) China shrinks, India plateaus; Nigeria is a very big deal This chart shows the futures of what are, today, the world's five most populous nations. The two big stories here are China and Nigeria, the latter of which will have almost a billion people by 2100 and will be within range of surpassing China in population. Given that Nigeria is about the area of Texas, that's a truly astounding possibility. Nigeria, currently Africa's most populous country, is poised for one of the world's most rapid population booms ever. In just 100 years, maybe two or three generations, the population is expected to increase by a mind-boggling factor of eight. The country is already troubled by corruption, poverty and religious conflict. It's difficult to imagine how a government that can barely serve its population right now will respond when the demand on resources, social services, schools and roads increases by a factor of eight. Still, if they pull it off – the country's vast oil reserves could certainly help – the rapidly growing workforce could theoretically deliver an African miracle akin to, say, China's. Chinese leaders know their demographic crisis is coming. It's not a mystery: the country's massive working-age population is only allowed to have one child per couple, which means that when the current generation retires, there will be a rapidly growing pool of retirees just as the workforce starts to shrink. Those aging retirees will be an enormous burden on the Chinese economy, which is just beginning to slow down. As China ages and shrinks, its workforce will get smaller at precisely the moment that it needs them most. Make no mistake, China will continue to be an enormous, important and most likely very successful country, but its demographics are going to quickly shift from a big help to a major hindrance. Keep this in mind the next time someone tells you that China is about to take over the world. As for the other three: India's rapidly growing population, which the country has somewhat harnessed but in many ways failed to serve, will finally plateau around 2065. Indonesia will grow moderately. The United States will grow as well, a bit more quickly than Indonesia but not a boom like India's. Again, that's good news for the U.S. (3) Africa is the next Asia, maybe This chart shows Asian and African populations from 1950 through today and projected ahead to 2100. This isn't just a big deal because Africa will be almost as populous as Asia by 2100, after a very long time of being just a fraction of Asia's size. It's a big deal because it's a reminder that growth this rapid changes everything. Pause for a moment to consider Asia's boom over the last 50 years – the rise of first Japan, then South Korea, now China and maybe next India – and the degree to which it's already changed the world and will continue to change it. Africa is expected to grow even more than Asia. Between 1950 and 2050, Asia's population will have grown by a factor of 3.7, almost quadrupling in just a hundred years. Africa's population, over its own century of growth from 2000 to 2100, will grow by a factor of 5.18 – significantly faster than Asia. In demographic terms, it seems, the Asian century could be followed by the African century. That's an amazing thing. But Asia's remarkable economic, cultural, political and social progress had to do with more than just demographics. And even that growth could end up being a curse for Africa if it doesn't have two things that have been crucial to Asian successes: good governance and careful resource management. Right now, many African countries aren't particularly adept at either governance or resource management. If they don't improve, exploding population growth could only worsen resource competition – and we're talking here about basics like food, water and electricity – which in turn makes political instability and conflict more likely. The fact that there will be a \\"youth bulge\\" of young people makes that instability and conflict more likely. It's a big, entirely foreseeable danger. Whether Africa is able to prepare for its coming population boom may well be one of the most important long-term challenges the world faces right now. (4) Africa's boom will be sub-Saharan Digging in to the data on African population growth finds that it's mostly in the continent's sub-Saharan region. These are the five most populous African countries today (excluding Nigeria, which grows so large that it made the other chart lines unreadably small). The growth looks even more eyebrow-raising when it becomes clear that it will mostly leave culturally distinct North Africa behind: it's all focused in the sub-Saharan countries. South Africa also will grow more slowly. Take a look at Tanzania, which is today one of the poorest countries in the world. As of 2000, it had 34 million people; California's population was the same that year. Today, Tanzania has about 45 million people. By 2100, its population is projected to be 276 million – almost the size of the entire United States today, and by then one of the largest countries in the world. The stories of other African countries may be similar: Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo are projected to be almost as large. Even if this demographic prediction does turn out to be accurate, we have no way of knowing what a massively populous Tanzania of 2100 would look like. If it remains as poor and troubled as it is today, it doesn't bode well: water and food resources will only get scarcer as it's divided among more and more people, as will whatever money the government makes exporting natural resources. That typically leads to instability and a higher risk of conflict. But, as in Asia, there's also a real opportunity for the future Tanzania to put its growing population to work building the economy. The question of how to get there, though, is not an easy one. (5) Systemic shift to developing and least-developed countries First, the definitions: the \\"developed\\" countries, the blue line, include Europe, the United States, Japan, South Korea and other Western countries. The \\"developing countries,\\" the green line, includes countries such as Mexico or Russia or Brazil; China and India would normally be in this category but I've pulled them out. The \\"least developed,\\" in purple, includes, for example, Haiti, Bangladesh and much of Africa. What's clear looking at this chart is that for all the rapid growth seen in India and China, both countries are about to be outpaced by the rest of the developing world. The poorest countries will grow especially rapidly, from 663 million people to almost 3 billion; if those countries stay stuck in their current state of development, many may be unable to handle the population booms. The biggest question may be that green line: do those developing countries continue to develop, following earlier success stories like South Korea and Taiwan? What happens when Southeast Asian or Middle Eastern or Latin American countries see South Korea-style success stories? Look at how much Korea's successes have already changed the world. We may be seeing a lot more of that in the next century. (6) The future of the developed world is American Whether or not you believe that the U.S.'s global dominance will be challenged by \\"the rise of the rest,\\" as Fareed Zakaria describes the coming global development, the demographics strongly suggest that U.S. leadership within the developed world will only strengthen. In Europe, Northeast Asia and the broader Anglosphere, most countries will be seeing demographic stagnation or outright decline, which in turn will make those countries less competitive, especially as the rest of the world booms. Populations will continue aging and shrinking or will stay, at best, basically level. The one really hopeful case is the United States, which, as you can see, expects pretty healthy, sustained growth. Immigration to the U.S. is the big factor here, the thing that helps inure the U.S. to the demographic decline haunting the rest of the developed world. Usually, countries see their populations decline as soon as they get rich, making their success almost self-defeating. Immigration helps the U.S. to do what very few other countries, including China, has yet figured out: how to be a rich country with a growing population. (7) Immigration slows Western stagnation If you take the U.S. out of the above chart, that makes it a little easier to see the distinction between developed countries that have robust immigration and those that don't. Germany, Japan and South Korea – which, like most of the developed world, tightly restrict immigration – all see declines. But the United Kingdom and France, which allow some immigration from their former colonies, are projected to enjoy modest but healthy population growth. It's not quite as pronounced as in the United States, but it will likely help them avoid some of the demographic-led economic decline projected in the rest of Europe. It's an irony that more than 150 years after the end of colonialism, its two widest practitioners will continue to benefit. (8) Narrowing, but not closing, the life expectancy gap This is one of two major factors in Asia's ongoing population boom and Africa's coming boom. The average lifespan on both continents is going way, way up. In Africa, it will increase by 50 percent over just a century. That's a remarkable accomplishment. By the end of this century, African life expectancy is expected to approximate the North American average today – but it will still be the lowest in the world. Europe's average life span is projected to be 87.6 and North America's will be 89. That's an amazing medical accomplishment, but gives economists panic attacks: how do you sustain your economy if the average worker spends a third of his or her life on retirement? The second factor driving Africa's population boom is birth rates. Here is the big number that the UN's new population data uncovered: the average African fertility rate between 2005 and 2010 was 4.9 children per woman. That's an extremely high number and will cause the sort of youth bulge that developmental economists warn can be economically and politically destabilizing. But it's tough for policymakers to slow this down, for cultural and religious reasons as well as because, even if too-high fertility might be bad for the region, individual families have every economic incentive to have lots of children. (9) This is the most important chart on this page Don't close the page yet! This is a big one. The \\"dependency ratio\\" is the ratio of people under age 15 or over age 64 to the number of people age 15 to 64. The idea is that people who are very young or very old are dependent on others to provide for them. If the \\"dependency ratio\\" is 40 percent, that means that there are 40 children or elderly to every 100 working age people. Another way of putting it is that 40 out of every 140 people is a child or elderly person. The higher this ratio, the more people depend on the government, the higher the rest of society's burden for supporting them. Right now, Africa's dependency ratio is high. Really high: about 80 percent. This means that only 56 percent of Africans are working-age. That's a huge burden on society and a big contributor to poverty. And most of those \\"dependent age\\" Africans are very young. (If you've ever wondered about the proliferation of child soldiers in Africa, this is part of why: there just aren't enough 20-something men, but there are lots of children.) But as the birth rate slows and those young dependents enter the work force, the dependency ratio is going to fall, dropping to 60 percent by 2055. That's huge. It increases the share of the population that can contribute and lowers the share that uses resources without contributing. The flip side, though, is that having a lot of young people – specifically, young men – can worsen any political instability and can create instability if resources are scarce. Look, for example, at the Arab world today, where a youth bulge contributed to the protests that became revolutions in some cases and civil wars in others. It's chancy. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is going to see the opposite trend, and that's bad news. As birth rates fall, people age and life expectancy rises, we're going to see dependency ratios increase not just across the developed world but across, save for Africa, basically all of it. Europe will get the worst of it, with the average dependency ratio hitting an Africa-style 76 percent in 2055. A generation later, South America's is expected to reach a deeply worrying 82 percent by 2100. Asia has a few decades to prepare: its dependency ratio, currently low, will stay low until it starts to rise around 2050. And that's the story of the world's demographic future, nine decades of population booms and declines that will have unforeseeable but surely transformative political and economic consequences. These numbers aren't destiny, of course, and lots of people are already trying to change them: developmental economist warning Africa it's not prepared for the coming boom, European leaders trying to spur population growth, Chinese officials who may overturn the one-child policy and lots of others. But this is the direction the data points today. Whatever happens, it should be quite a century. ||||| Nigeria's population is expected to surpass that of the US by 2050, according to new UN projections that predict the west African country could be the world's third most populous by the end of this century. The UN report World population prospects: the 2012 revision, published on Thursday, predicts the world's population, now at 7.2 billion, will reach 8.1 billion in 2025. By mid-century, the world's population is expected to top 9.5 billion, reaching nearly 11 billion by 2100. More than half of the growth predicted between now and 2050 is expected in Africa, where the number of people is set to more than double, from 1.1 billion to 2.4 billion. Africa's population will continue to rise even if there is a future drop in the average number of children each woman has, says the report, which predicts the number of people living on the continent could reach 4.2 billion (or more than 35% of total global population) by 2100. Several other countries, including India, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines, are also set for significant population increases. Shrinking population India, currently the world's second-largest country by population, is expected to rival China in size by 2028, when both nations will each have about 1.45 billion citizens. After 2030, China is expected to shrink in numbers, reaching an estimated 1.1 billion by the end of this century, when India's population is projected to reach about 1.5 billion. Some of the most rapid increases are expected in the world's 49 least-developed countries. The populations of Mali, Niger, Somalia, Tanzania and Zambia are expected to increase at least fivefold by 2100. In contrast, the populations of 43 countries are expected to decrease over the next few decades. Belarus, Bulgaria, Cuba, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine are among the countries where populations are expected to drop by more than 15% by 2050. \\"These future trends are not guaranteed,\\" stressed John Wilmoth, director of the population division at the UN's department of economic and social affairs. Wilmoth, who said the future shape of the world will depend largely on what happens to fertility rates, underlined the continued unmet need for family planning in many countries. \\"Demography is not destiny, [but] these new population projections highlight the pressures facing governments … population growth in some cases, and population ageing and decline in others,\\" Wilmoth said. Migration from developing to developed countries is projected to average roughly 2.4 million people each year from 2013-2050 before dropping to 1 million each year from 2050-2100. Without this, the populations of many European and other developed countries would be expected to decline significantly. The report also anticipates a rise in the number of old people, with life expectancy projected to rise to 76 globally by 2050 and 82 by 2100. Today, the average person is 29 years old. This is expected to increase to 36 by 2050, and to 41 by 2100. By the end of the century, the average person in Europe, the region with the oldest average age, will be 47. Globally, the number of over-60s is expected to rise from 841 million in 2013 to nearly 3 billion by the end of the century. Two-thirds of the world's over-60s already live in developing countries. By 2050, this share is expected to reach nearly 80%. \\"These figures are a wake-up call for all countries, including developing countries with young populations,\\" said Silvia Stefanoni, interim head of HelpAge International. \\"The generation that will retire in 2050 is the current youth bulge and, given the limited employment opportunities available to young people [now], many of them will not be able to retire [in the future]. Young and old depend on each other – our shared future for all people on our planetdepends on recognising and investing in all our age groups.\\" The number of people between 25 and 59 in developing countries is at an all-time high, and is projected to increase by more than 400 million over the next decade. \\"These population trends point to the urgency of supporting employment creation in developing countries as part of any strategy to address the slow economic recovery that the world is experiencing,\\" the report warns. The figures are based on a comprehensive review of recent data on population, including a 2010 round of national censuses. They are higher than previous estimates, which put the world's population at 9.3 billion in 2050 and 10.1 billion in 2100, in part because UN demographers have found higher fertility rates in some countries than previously predicted. Beyond providing new estimates of how the world will change over the next century, the figures also provide the basis for a number of key UN indicators to assess progress towards the millennium development goals. Fertility rates The figures are based on the UN's \\"medium-variant\\" projections, which assume a decline in the number of children born per woman in many countries with high fertility rates. Under different assumptions, estimates of the world's population in 2050 range from 8.3 billion to 10.9 billion. Average family sizes have dropped significantly over the past few decades. An estimated 48% of the world's people now live in countries where the average number of children per woman is fewer than 2.1. Another 43% live in countries where that figure is between 2.1 and five children. Only 9% of the world's people live in the 31 countries where the average woman has more than five children. Twenty-nine of these are in Africa and two are in Asia (Afghanistan and Timor-Leste). ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The United Nations projects that the world's population will undergo significant changes in the next 90 years. Africa's population is expected to grow very rapidly, making it more important than ever. This rapid growth will have political and social effects within African countries and in their relationships with the rest of the world. Many poor countries will expand, while most rich countries will shrink and age. Asia's growth will also slow down and eventually start to decline. These changes will have implications for everyone, including issues such as supporting the elderly, managing population booms in least developed countries, and handling the political and social changes brought about by these shifts."},{"instruction":"Reuters Holdings PLC said Michael Reupke resigned as general manager to pursue unspecified interests, a move the news organization termed an \\"amicable separation.\\" Mr. Reupke, 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran, had been the information-services company's general manager for only six months. His appointment to that post, which has senior administrative, staff and policy responsibilities, followed a several-year tenure as Reuters's editor in chief. No successor was named, and Mr. Reupke's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives, the company said. In a telephone interview, Mr. Reupke said his departure was for \\"personal reasons,\\" which he declined to specify. \\"There is no business reason for my departure,\\" nor any disagreement over policy, he added. He also rejected reports that his departure stemmed from disappointment the general manager's post hadn't also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization. Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters's eight-person executive committee who didn't also serve on the company's board of directors. \\"If I were choosing the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen the people who are now on the board,\\" he said. A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects \\"no change in strategy or profits.\\" Mark Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Philips & Drew in London, said, \\"I suspect (the departure) will be fairly irrelevant for the company. I would be very surprised if his departure signals any change in strategy or change in profit expectations.\\" On London's Stock Exchange, Reuters shares rose five pence to 913 pence (14.43).

Today, he has three samples of molecule in front of him, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a straight-chain molecule; sample B is a branched-chain molecule; and sample C is a cyclic molecule. Mark's job is to determine the characteristics of each sample. But I can use this background: A) In a straight-chain molecule, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train. The carbon atoms form the “backbone” of the molecule. B) In a branched-chain molecule, at least one of the carbon atoms branches off from the backbone. C) In a cyclic molecule, the chain of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring. Each ring usually contains just five or six carbon atoms, but rings can join together to form larger molecules. A cyclic molecule generally has higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain molecules. What is an answer for this question: Which sample would have higher boiling point, sample A or sample C? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, sample C, which is a cyclic molecule, would generally have a higher boiling point than sample A, a straight-chain molecule. This can be attributed to the structure and properties of cyclic molecules in comparison to straight-chain molecules. Cyclic molecules have carbon atoms arranged in rings, which often contain five or six carbon atoms. These rings can also join together to form larger molecules, resulting in more compact and rigid structures. On the other hand, straight-chain molecules consist of carbon atoms that form a linear \\"backbone,\\" resulting in a more flexible and less compact structure. The structural differences between these types of molecules impact their boiling points. In cyclic molecules, the compact and rigid arrangement of carbon atoms typically creates stronger intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals interactions and, in some cases, aromatic stacking interactions. These stronger forces generally require more energy to break, leading to a higher boiling point for cyclic molecules. In contrast, straight-chain molecules have weaker intermolecular forces due to their more flexible and less compact structures. As a result, these molecules generally require less energy to overcome the forces holding them together, resulting in lower boiling points compared to cyclic molecules. Therefore, in this case, sample C (cyclic molecule) is expected to have a higher boiling point than sample A (straight-chain molecule)."},{"instruction":"Q:M: Yes. Sometimes. I've got to be honest.

Using a battery tester 2. Testing with a multimeter Solution 1: Using a battery tester Battery testers are devices specifically designed to measure the charge remaining in a battery. They are user-friendly and often come in portable designs. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using a battery tester: Advantages: - Simple to use: Battery testers usually have a slot to insert the battery and a display that indicates the remaining battery power. No prior technical knowledge is needed. - Accurate: Battery testers are designed specifically to test batteries and will typically provide accurate results. - Portable: They are often small and lightweight, making them easy to carry and store. - Works for various sizes and types: Many battery testers can accommodate different battery sizes (AA, AAA, 9V, etc.) and types (alkaline, NiMH, lithium). Disadvantages: - Limited functionality: Battery testers are designed solely for testing batteries and cannot be used to check electrical circuits or the voltage of other electronic devices. - Additional cost: Purchasing a battery tester may represent an extra expense for those who do not regularly need to test batteries. Solution 2: Testing with a multimeter A multimeter is an electronic measuring instrument that can measure voltage, current, and resistance, making it a versatile and useful tool. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using a multimeter to test batteries: Advantages: - Multipurpose: Multimeters can measure voltage, current, and resistance, making them suitable for various electrical applications beyond battery testing. - Accurate: When operated by individuals with knowledge of how multimeters work, they can produce accurate measurements. - Availability: Many households, workshops, and labs already have multimeters, eliminating the need to purchase an additional device. Disadvantages: - Requires technical knowledge: One must know how to use a multimeter to obtain accurate results, including selecting the appropriate measuring range and understanding how to interpret readings. - More complex: Using a multimeter can be more time-consuming and complicated than using a battery tester, especially for individuals who don’t regularly work with electronics. - Not specifically designed for battery testing: Multimeters are not explicitly designed for battery testing, so results may vary depending on factors such as battery contact points and the selected measuring range. Conclusion: Ultimately, the choice between a battery tester and a multimeter depends on the user's needs, budget, and technical familiarity. If battery testing is the primary goal and ease of use is the most important factor, a battery tester would be the better solution. It is more user-friendly and offers a straightforward approach to determining battery life. However, if the user has access to a multimeter or is involved in various electrical projects beyond battery testing, a multimeter may be the better choice. It offers the versatility to measure voltage, current, and resistance in various electrical settings. Some initial learning may be required, but the user will benefit from having a more comprehensive tool to handle different electrical tasks."},{"instruction":"Can the ESPD be used again and again from one procurement to another Can you repeat this sentence, but add in punctuation?","output":"Yes, the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) can be used again and again from one procurement procedure to another.

Answer:","output":"No, the suggested answer is not accurate or comprehensive. Whole grain oats consist of several nutritional elements that are beneficial to our health. Here is a more accurate description of the elements in whole grain oats: 1. Bran: The outer layer of the grain, rich in fiber, antioxidants, and various B vitamins (including thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin B6). It also contains minerals such as iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorus. 2. Germ: The small, nutrient-dense core of the oat, packed with protein, healthy fats (including polyunsaturated fatty acids and some monounsaturated fatty acids), vitamin E, B vitamins, and other essential nutrients such as magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc. 3. Endosperm: The largest part of the grain, which primarily comprises starchy carbohydrates and also contains some proteins, vitamins, and minerals. 4. Fiber: Whole grain oats are an excellent source of both soluble and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber, mainly found in the form of beta-glucans, has been associated with reduced cholesterol levels and improved blood sugar control. Insoluble fiber contributes to better digestion and gut health. 5. Proteins: Whole grain oats contain a good amount of plant-based protein, including essential amino acids. They are particularly rich in proteins called avenins, which are similar to gluten but do not have the same adverse effects on people with gluten sensitivities. 6. Micronutrients: Whole grain oats contain essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, E, and K, along with folate, iron, zinc, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and copper. 7.

The most important factor to consider for picking a spot is to observe your surroundings. Always approach holding your breath underwater with caution, especially in a crowded public pool where people are engaged in many different activities and not paying attention to others. If you want to sink to the bottom of a pool, you may think choosing a spot near the wall is safest. But, remember that people will be entering the water around all edges of a pool. It may be better to find a relatively isolated place, away from where people may be entering the water and away from large groups. Also, keep your distance from the pool drain, which can exert hundreds of pounds of suction and can cause injury and death.Have a friend keep an eye out for you while you’re below the surface. If you’re swimming underwater, keep an eye out for traffic and remember that other swimmers will not necessarily be looking out for you. Ideally you can chart a clear path ahead of you to the other side, one that will stay clear until you get there. If you're in the shallow side of the pool, you will likely be standing. If you're in a part of the pool where the water is higher than you are tall, your body will assume a vertical position with ease as, generally, your lower body will be heavier than your upper body. Do not hyperventilate. Taking several fast breaths in a row before submerging yourself is known as DUBB, \\"dangerous underwater breath-holding behaviors\\" and can cause hypoxic blackout, which can lead to brain damage, fainting, and death. Pull your knees in and hold them close to your chest by wrapping your arms around them. This tucked position changes the amount of space you're taking up in the water and will allow you to fall deeper into the water and to more easily remain underwater. Objects, and bodies, sink in water if they have a higher density than the body of water. An object's density depends on its mass and volume--the amount of space it takes up. As such, taking up less space in the water will help you sink. Release air bubbles slowly through your nose. You can let them out of your mouth as well and they can be bigger, but you'll sink faster. You may also do both and let out small bits of air, puffing your cheeks between blowing air out. Let your head and body sink into the water. When your feet hit the bottom of the pool, sit in a comfortable position, such as cross-legged or holding on to your knees in front of you. When you’re ready or running out of breath, look up to make sure nothing and no one is in your way to the pool’s surface. Whether seated or standing, press firmly into your feet and stretch your arms skyward to shoot or swim upwards. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is as follows: When submerging yourself in water, choose a safe and isolated spot away from people and pool drains.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. Question: Why did Trump file an annual financial disclosure form with the Office of Government Ethics? Options: A. to stop false accusations against him for his financial dealings B. it is prerequisite to running for the office of President C. not enough information D. it is required of all top government officials under US law A:","output":"D. it is required of all top government officials under US law"},{"instruction":"Information: - The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year. - Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. Bears are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails. - Claudius Ptolemy (\\"Klaúdios Ptolemaîos\\", ; ) was a Greek writer, known as a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship. Beyond that, few reliable details of his life are known. His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes. This is a very late attestation, however, and there is no other reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria, where he died around AD 168. - Ursa Major (also known as the Great Bear) is a constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. One of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy (second century AD), it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It can be visible throughout the year in most of the northern hemisphere. Its name, Latin for \\"the greater (or larger) she-bear\\", stands as a reference to and in direct contrast with Ursa Minor, \\"the lesser she-bear\\", with which it is frequently associated in mythology and amateur astronomy. The constellation's most recognizable asterism, a group of seven relatively bright stars commonly known as the \\"Big Dipper\\", \\"the Wagon\\" or \\"the Plough\\" (among others), both mimics the shape of the lesser bear (the \\"Little Dipper\\") and is commonly used as a navigational pointer towards the current northern pole star, Polaris in Ursa Minor. The Big Dipper and the constellation as a whole have mythological significance in numerous world cultures, usually as a symbol of the north. - Polaris, designated Alpha Ursae Minoris (Ursae Minoris, abbreviated Alpha UMi, UMi), commonly the North Star or Pole Star, is the brightest star in the constellation of Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Ursa Minor (Latin: \\"lesser-Bear\\", contrasting with Ursa Major), also known as the Little Bear, is a constellation in the Northern Sky. Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the North Star. - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant. - In modern astronomy, the sky (celestial sphere) is divided into 88 regions called constellations, generally based on the asterisms (which are also called \\"constellations\\") of Greek and Roman mythology. Those along the ecliptic are the constellations of the zodiac. - Amateur astronomy is a hobby whose participants enjoy watching the sky, and the abundance of objects found in it with the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes. Even though scientific research is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars, tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects, such as comets and novae. - The International Astronomical Union (IAU UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them. - NGC 4194 , the Medusa merger , is a pair of interacting galaxies in the constellation Ursa Major . A region of extreme star formation 500 ly ( 150 pc ) across exists in the center of the Eye of Medusa , the central gas - rich region . - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names. - The Big Dipper (US) or Plough (UK) is an asterism consisting of the seven brightest stars of the constellation Ursa Major; six of them are of second magnitude and one, Megrez (), of third magnitude. Four define a \\"bowl\\" or \\"body\\" and three define a \\"handle\\" or \\"head\\". It is recognized as a distinct grouping in many cultures.

As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music....

As the arrow is released, the bow releases its stored energy and puts the arrow into motion. Can you think of some other ways to store energy using position? What question would one ask from this paragraph?","output":"Mechanical energy is indeed a combination of an object's kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (energy due to position). Many examples in our daily life showcase mechanical energy, such as: 1. A swinging pendulum: The pendulum possesses kinetic energy while in motion and potential energy at its highest points. 2. A compressed spring: When a spring is compressed, it stores potential energy, which is released as kinetic energy when the spring is allowed to expand. 3. A roller coaster: At the peak of a roller coaster hill, the coaster has the greatest potential energy, which is converted into kinetic energy as it descends. 4. Bouncing ball: As the ball bounces, it experiences a transfer between kinetic and potential energy as it moves through the air and hits the surface. 5. Water in a dam: The water stored in a dam contains potential energy, which can be transformed into kinetic energy to drive turbines for hydroelectric power generation. Energy of motion (kinetic energy) comes from the conversion of potential energy, which is stored energy due to an object's position. An object at rest possesses potential energy because of the forces acting upon it. When these forces change the object's position, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, causing the object to move. Storing energy using position can be achieved in several ways, for example: 1. Gravitational force: The energy required to lift an object against gravity is stored in the object as potential energy and can be converted back into kinetic energy as the object falls back to the ground. 2. Elastic force: In the case of a rubber band or a spring, when the material is stretched or compressed, the deformation in its structure stores potential energy, which is then released as kinetic energy to regain its original shape. One question that could be asked from the given paragraph is: How does the conservation of mechanical energy play a role in the transfer of potential and kinetic energy in various circumstances?"},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I heard that Carson was throwing his baseball in the yard.

Elizabeth discovers a golden pirate medallion around his neck, keeping it so as to protect him. Elizabeth sees a ghost ship vanish into the fog. Eight years later, Norrington is promoted to Commodore and proposes to Elizabeth, but her corset makes her faint and fall into the sea. Captain Jack Sparrow comes to Port Royal to commandeer a ship, and rescues her. Norrington identifies Jack, and a chase ensues. Jack encounters Will, now a blacksmith and swordsman. They duel, and Jack is captured and imprisoned. That night, the Black Pearl, which Elizabeth saw as a child, attacks Port Royal searching for the medallion. Pirates capture Elizabeth, taking her to meet Captain Barbossa for negotiations. Elizabeth claims her last name is Turner, to conceal her identity as the governor's daughter, but Barbossa takes her prisoner. Elizabeth learns that after Barbossa's crew took the treasure of CortÃ©s from Isla de Muerta, they were cursed as immortals; they appear as heavily decomposed corpses in moonlight.

'' Dilboy is buried in Section 18 of Arlington National Cemetery . - Arlington National Cemetery is a United States military cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., in whose the dead of the nation's conflicts have been buried, beginning with the American Civil War, as well as reinterred dead from earlier wars. The United States Department of the Army, a component of the United States Department of Defense, controls the cemetery. - A battle rifle is a military service rifle that fires a full-power rifle cartridge, such as 7.62×51mm NATO, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92x57mm Mauser, .303 British, or .30-06 Springfield. Compared to assault rifles and their intermediate cartridges, the higher-caliber rounds provide greater power and range, though they have greater weight and produce stronger recoil, making them less than ideal for fully automatic fire. - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags - Genocide is intentional action to destroy a people (usually defined as an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group) in whole or in part. The hybrid word \\"genocide\\" is a combination of the Greek word \\"génos\\" (\\"race, people\\") and the Latin suffix \\"-cide\\" (\\"act of killing\\"). The United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as \\"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group\\". - The Department of the Army (DA) is one of the three military departments within the Department of Defense of the United States of America. The Department of the Army is the Federal Government agency within which the United States Army is organized, and it is led by the Secretary of the Army who has statutory authority to conduct its affairs and to prescribe regulations for its government, subject to the limits of the law, and the directions of the Secretary of Defense and the President. - A machine gun is a fully automatic mounted or portable firearm, designed to fire bullets in quick succession from an ammunition belt or magazine, typically at a rate of 300 to 1800 rounds per minute. Fully automatic firearms are generally categorized as submachine guns, assault rifles, battle rifles, automatic shotguns, machine guns, or autocannons. Machine guns with multiple rotating barrels are referred to as \\"rotary machine guns\\". - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - An autocannon or automatic cannon is a large, fully automatic, rapid-fire projectile weapon that fires armour-piercing or explosive shells, as opposed to the bullet fired by a machine gun. Autocannons often have a larger calibre than a machine gun (e.g., 20 mm or greater), but are usually smaller than a field gun or other artillery. When used on its own, the word \\"autocannon\\" indicates a single-barrel weapon. When multiple rotating barrels are involved, the word \\"rotary\\" is added, and such a weapon is referred to as a \\"rotary autocannon.\\" Modern autocannons are typically not single soldier-portable or stand-alone units, rather they are usually vehicle-mounted, aircraft-mounted, or boat-mounted, or even remote-operated as in some naval applications. As such, ammunition is typically fed from a belt to reduce reloading or for a faster rate of fire, but a magazine remains an option. They can use a variety of ammunition: common shells include high-explosive dual-purpose types (HEDP), any variety of armour-piercing (AP) types, such as composite rigid (APCR) or discarding sabot types (APDS). - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - A submachine gun (SMG) is an air-cooled, magazine-fed, automatic carbine designed to fire pistol cartridges. The term \\"submachine gun\\" was coined by John T. Thompson, the inventor of the Thompson submachine gun. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - The word bullet is a firearm term. A bullet is a projectile expelled from the barrel of a firearm. The term is from Middle French and originated as the diminutive of the word boulle (boullet) which means \\"small ball.\\" Bullets are made of a variety of materials. They are available singly as they would be used in muzzle loading and cap and ball firearms, as part of a paper cartridge, and much more commonly as a component of metallic cartridges. Bullets are made in a large numbers of styles and constructions depending on how they will be used. Many bullets have specialized functions, such as hunting, target shooting, training, defense, and warfare. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names.

Select from the following. * no; * yes;","output":"Yes, both questions essentially ask if green tea can lead to teeth staining. To explain the cause of teeth staining due to green tea, let us first understand the components of green tea and the process of staining. Green tea is derived from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. It has gained popularity in recent years due to its numerous health benefits, which include antioxidant properties, weight loss assistance, and reduced risk of heart disease, among others. However, one lesser-known side effect of regularly consuming green tea is teeth staining. The main cause of green tea stains on teeth is the presence of natural compounds called tannins. Tannins are a type of polyphenol that is found in varying concentrations in many types of plants, including tea leaves. They possess antioxidant properties and play a significant role in determining the taste and color of the tea. In green tea, the tannin content is slightly lower than in black tea, but it's still enough to cause stain on teeth. When you drink green tea, the tannins come into contact with your teeth and can lead to two main issues: 1. Tannins bind to the proteins present in your saliva and on the surface of your teeth. This binding process forms a sticky layer on the enamel of your teeth, causing pigments from the tea to adhere more easily. Over time and with regular consumption of green tea, these pigments build up and result in a yellowish or brownish discoloration of the tooth enamel. 2. The acidic nature of green tea can contribute to the weakening of tooth enamel. Although green tea is less acidic than many other beverages, such as fruit juices and carbonated drinks, it still has the potential to erode the enamel, especially when consumed in excessive amounts. Weakened tooth enamel is more susceptible to staining from various sources, including the tannins in green tea. To minimize teeth staining from green tea, consider the following tips: 1. Drink green tea in moderation and be mindful of the overall acidity of your diet. 2. Rinse your mouth with water or brush your teeth after consuming green tea to reduce the time that the tannins are in contact with your teeth. 3. Use a straw when drinking green tea to limit direct contact with your teeth. 4. Consider drinking green tea varieties with lower tannin content, such as lighter or less oxidized teas. 5. Regular dental check-ups and cleanings can help remove stains and ensure good oral hygiene. In conclusion, green tea does indeed cause teeth staining as a result of the presence of tannins and the acidic nature of the beverage. By following the steps mentioned above, you can minimize teeth staining and still enjoy the numerous health benefits of green tea."},{"instruction":"Paragraph: The Albanians first appear in the historical record in Byzantine sources of the late 11th century. At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990. Question: \\"Historically, Albania enjoyed a general freedom of religion for how many centuries prior to Communism?\\" Answer: \\"9\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, the answer is correct. The Albanians first appear in the historical record in Byzantine sources of the late 11th century, which implies that they have had freedom of religion for around 9 centuries (from the late 11th century to the rise of communism in the mid-20th century)."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive?

In the sentence \\"open road through a forest towards mountains,\\" the keywords are: 1. Open road: This refers to the main subject of the sentence - a road that is open or not obstructed and possibly allows for easy passage. It sets the scene for where the action is taking place. 2. Forest: The forest is an important element in the sentence as it describes the specific environment or setting through which the open road passes. The concept of a forest brings to mind images of trees, foliage, and natural surroundings. 3. Mountains: The mountains mentioned in the description represent the destination or point of interest of the open road.

During Sean Hannity's show on Tuesday, when asked about the matter before the Supreme Court, Carson said, \\"Marriage is between a man and a woman. No group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality, it doesn't matter what they are. They don't get to change the definition.\\" The comparison of gays to members of the North American Boy/Man Love Association and those who engage in bestiality set off a backlash of criticism in the media, online and on campus. There is now a petition circulating at Johns Hopkins Medical to have Carson removed as commencement speaker in May at the School of Medicine. \\"I think people have completely taken the wrong meaning out of what I was saying,\\" the 61-year-old surgeon said in a telephone interview Friday. \\"First of all, I certainly believe gay people should have all the rights that anybody else has. What I was basically saying is that as far as marriage is concerned that has traditionally been between a man and a woman and nobody should be able to change that.\\" \\"Now perhaps the examples were not the best choice of words, and I certainly apologize if I offended anyone,\\" he added. \\"But the point that I was making was that no group of individuals, whoever they are, whatever their belief systems, gets to change traditional definitions. The reason I believe the way I do, I will readily confess, is because I am a Christian who believes in The Bible.\\" The Bible, he explained, \\"...says we have an obligation to love our fellow man as ourselves, and I love everybody the same -- all homosexuals. Everybody who knows me knows I would never say anything to intentionally hurt someone.\\" Given the \\"if I offended anyone\\" tone and language of the apology, it will be interesting to see how it's received. I hope readers will weigh in here. The Sun has also obtained a copy of the petition aimed at getting Carson, who is on the eve of retirement this spring, removed as a speaker at the School of Medicine graduation ceremonies in May. \\"At the time of his nomination, Dr. Carson was known to most of us as a world-class neurosurgeon and passionate advocate for education,\\" the petition says. \\"Many of us had read his books and looked up to him as a role model in our careers. Since then, however, several public events have cast serious doubt on the appropriateness of having Dr. Carson speak at our graduation. If you believe he is an inappropriate choice of speaker at a ceremony intended to celebrate the achievements of our class please complete the petition below.\\" When asked about the petition Friday, Carson told the Sun, \\"I've caught wind of it and I've sent back a message that this is their graduation, their big day, and if they think me being there is going to be a problem, I am happy to withdraw.\\" Speaking of his retirement plans, Carson said he has been speaking with several TV outlets about a career in media. In response to a direct question as to whether he is in discussions with Fox News, where he has been regularly featured since his appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast in February, he said, \\"I would simply say that there is more than one station that has asked if I would have any interest, and I am in the process of considering these things.\\" Carson expressed a \\"hope\\" that \\"we can get to a level where we can actually have an intelligent discussion without hysteria\\" on such issues as gay marriage. Good luck with that on highly partisan cable TV channels like Fox News and MSNBC. ||||| Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Ever since I joined the bonfire around Ben Carson's interview on Hannity—the one with the NAMBLA gaffe, you remember it—the occasional critic has told me to look back at the substance of the comment. Carson was making a typical slippery slope argument, asking where people would stop once they started redefining marriage. And, yes, Justice Sotomayor asked a question about this at Tuesday's oral argument. It's probably worth it to excerpt that exchange. David Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, the bottom line that you're being asked -- and -- and it is one that I'm interested in the answer: If you say that marriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions could ever exist? Meaning, what State restrictions with respect to the number of people, with respect to -- that could get married -- the incest laws, the mother and child, assuming that they are the age -- I can -- I can accept that the State has probably an overbearing interest on -- on protecting a child until they're of age to marry, but what's left? MR. OLSON: Well, you've said -- you've said in the cases decided by this Court that the polygamy issue, multiple marriages raises questions about exploitation, abuse, patriarchy, issues with respect to taxes, inheritance, child custody, it is an entirely different thing. And if you -- if a State prohibits polygamy, it's prohibiting conduct. If it prohibits gay and lesbian citizens from getting married, it is prohibiting their exercise of a right based upon their status. It's selecting them as a class, as you described in the Romer case and as you described in the Lawrence case and in other cases, you're picking out a group of individuals to deny them the freedom that you've said is fundamental, important and vital in this society, and it has status and stature, as you pointed out in the VMI case. Advertisement Right: The question is whether you accept some social science. One difference between a guy who wants to have six sister wives and a guy who's always been attracted to guys? The available research suggests that the second couple will raise well-adjusted children. The current thinking on pedophilia (to get back to Carson's NAMBLA) rereference is that, like homosexuality, it's innate. But that leads you to the question of child-rearing and other norms, and the homosexuality-pedophilia comparison withers away. Sotomayor and Olson tried to reason this out. Carson just sort of assumes the worst. In his book—which is actually competing with Sotomayor's on the bestseller list—he suggests that the effort to \\"redefine marriage as between two men or two women or any other way based on social pressures\\" played a part in the \\"dramatic fall of the Roman Empire.\\" That's just ahistorical: gay marriage was a legal deviance in the pagan era, banned by Constantius and Constans more than 100 years before the fall. Look: Being very good, world-historically good, at one thing does not make you a cross-platform expert. Donald Trump is very good at hosting TV shows in which celebrities humiliate themselves, but doesn't seem to know much about public policy. Carson's a brilliant neurosurgeon and a political dilletente. And that's okay! But this fact hurt him after one too many soft-focus Fox News interviews. ||||| Neurosurgeon Ben Carson apologized Friday for comments he made about gay marriage on Sean Hannity’s TV show earlier this week. “I think in terms of what was said on Sean Hannity’s show, that was taken completely out of context and completely misunderstood in terms of what I was trying to say,” Carson told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell. “As a Christian, I have a duty to love all people and that includes people who have other sexual orientations, and I certainly do, and never had any intention of offending anyone… If anyone was offended, I apologize to you.” Text Size - + reset TOP 5 ways to apologize in politics The John Hopkins doctor came under scrutiny when he appeared to liken homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality, sparking the outrage of the LGBT community. “My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It’s a well-established fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality, it doesn’t matter what they are, they don’t get to change the definition,” the doctor, who is the director of pediatric neurosurgery, said on Hannity’s show Tuesday. His comments also led to a petition by students at Johns Hopkins University, who want him to be removed as commencement speaker, as was initially planned. Students, colleagues and the media alike have harshly criticized Carson for his choice of words. (Also on POLITICO: Ben Carson '16? Incredibly slim chance) “They make him look nasty, petty, and ill-informed. It doesn’t tell us anything about his amazing abilities as a surgeon,” Professor Todd Shepard, co-director of the university’s Program for the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, said in a statement to Media Matters. “It does remind us, however, that those abilities do not mean we should listen to what he says in any other domain.” Carson said that he would “absolutely” withdraw as commencement speaker if necessary, saying the “last thing” he would want to do is “rain on their parade.” However, the doctor remained firmly rooted in his belief that the term “marriage” should not be extended to same-sex couples, although he said the couples should be treated “kindly” and have whatever legal agreements they desire in order to transfer property and have visitation rights, among other rights. (Also on POLITICO: Conservative pundits split on gay marriage) “Marriage is a very sacred thing and we need to maintain it as a sacred thing. When I say we don’t want to change it or degrade it by calling everything marriage, that’s not aimed at any particular group,” he said. “But the fact of the matter is, the Bible and God have set very specific standards. It’s very clear what’s being said. God doesn’t change, man changes. Our duty is to allow for that change and to still love them and in terms of what happens with them, that’s a decision that’s up to God, that’s not our decision.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Dr. Benjamin Carson, a renowned Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon, has apologized for his choice of words and examples while discussing gay marriage on Fox News.

Rescuers were battling to reach the 11 miners still trapped underground, but chances for them to survive were very slim, said Du Bo, deputy chief of the rescue headquarters. \\"Based upon past experience, the remaining 11 miners could be buried in coal dust, so the survival chances are frail,\\" Du said. More than 2,500 tons of coal dust smothered the pit after the gas leak , which hampered the rescue, said Du. The gas outburst happened at 6:03 a.m. Saturday when 276 miners were working underground in the mine in Yuzhou City. A total of 239 workers escaped but 21 were found dead and 16 trapped. An initial investigation showed that 173,500 cubic meters of gas leaked out in the accident. Liu Wenbin, a deputy chief engineer of the company that owns the mine, was in the pit when the accident happened. He organized the escape. \\"At around 6 a.m., I felt there was something wrong with the airflow in the shaft, and one of the team captains told me he also felt it and had already reported the problem,\\" said Liu The mine is owned by Pingyu Coal & Electric Co.

Title: Sick Girl Movie plot: Ida Teeter (Angela Bettis) is a shy entomologist who has a wide variety of insects all over her home, which caused her girlfriend to break up with her. Ida is introduced to the beautiful and strange girl Misty Falls (Erin Brown a.k.a. Misty Mundae), and is drawn to her. A mysterious package arrives for Ida one day, containing a large unidentifiable mantis-like insect. Landlady Lana Beasley is concerned with Ida's âpetsâ and the effect that may be laid upon her ten-year-old granddaughter Betty, who likes to disguise herself as a ladybug. Betty in turn looks up to Ida, much to Beasleyâs dismay, and Ida promises to keep the insects under check. Later that night, she examines the new insect, which she fondly names âMickâ, and informs her friend Max of the creature. Meanwhile, âMickâ escapes from his tank and attacks Beasleyâs pet dog, consuming the animal. The next day, Ida asks Misty out. They go on a date, and Misty asks if they can watch a movie about âTexas Pixiesâ on Ida's DVD player, which Ida accepts. Misty is introduced to Betty and the apartment, though Ida keeps her away from the bedroom where all her insects are hidden. The two get closer until interrupted by Max. Ida returns to find Misty asleep on the couch. She returns with a pillow (that has Mick inside) to give to Misty. In gratitude for Ida allowing her to stay, Misty returns the favor by seducing Ida. Unknowingly, Mickâs proboscis nips Misty's ear, which Misty dismisses. The next morning, Ida awakens to find that Misty has discovered her secret bug stash and has a great interest in bugs. They spend more time together, although Misty becomes weak and begins displaying unusual tendencies. Misty later comes across the pillow with Mick in it, and discovers that she has strange urges to lie next to it; the insect invades her much-chewed and saliva-doused ear with its proboscis.

The term Belorussia (Russian: Белору́ссия, the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, Russia) first rose in the days of the Russian Empire, and the Russian Tsar was usually styled \\"the Tsar of All the Russias\\", as Russia or the Russian Empire was formed by three parts of Russia—the Great, Little, and White. This asserted that the territories are all Russian and all the peoples are also Russian; in the case of the Belarusians, they were variants of the Russian people.After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the term \\"White Russia\\" caused some confusion, as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks. During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term Byelorussia was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, Byelorussia became commonly used in the regions of Białystok and Grodno during the interwar period.The term Byelorussia (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called Republic of Belarus (Республика Беларусь spelled in Russian), and that its abridged form should be \\"Belarus\\". The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their Belarusian language forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993. Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus.Accordingly, the name Byelorussia was replaced by Belarus in English. Likewise, the adjective Belorussian or Byelorussian was replaced by Belarusian in English. Belarusian is closer to the original Belarusian term of bielaruski. Belarusian intelligentsia in the Stalin era attempted to change the name from Byelorussia to a form of Krivia because of the supposed connection...

The modern pulp and paper industry is global, with China leading its production and the United States right behind it. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): From where do the earliest Han court fragments derive?","output":"The statement about the earliest Han court fragments deriving from an unspecified source seems unclear and vague, which makes it impossible to confidently answer your question. However, I can provide you with some information about the Han court's connection to the development of papermaking. The early papermaking process, credited to the Han court eunuch Cai Lun, is considered to be a significant milestone in the history of paper production. While archaeological evidence of paper fragments dates back to the 2nd century BC in China, the advanced papermaking technique that Cai Lun developed in the early 2nd century AD was a crucial innovation. During the Han dynasty, the spread of paper production across China and beyond led to its increased use for writing and documentation purposes, replacing more cumbersome materials such as bamboo and silk. That said, it is essential to mention that the earliest archaeological fragments of paper from the 2nd century BC in China were discovered at various sites, such as those in the Tarim Basin and the Gansu Province. Numerous tombs, caves, and other historical sites have yielded paper artifacts that reveal insight into ancient Chinese culture, beliefs, and day-to-day activities. These fragments encompass diverse forms of paper, including manuscripts, official documents, letters, and even Buddhist sutras, highlighting the significance of paper for communication, record-keeping, and artistic expression throughout ancient China. In summary, while the precise origin of the earliest Han court paper fragments remains unclear, we do know that Cai Lun's invention during the Han dynasty revolutionized papermaking and played a crucial role in spreading the technique across China and the world. Additionally, archaeological findings across China imply an extensive use of paper in various aspects of ancient Chinese society."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Newspapers are not nearly as popular today as they were in the past. There are not very many people who seriously read a newspaper every day. Most people read only the sports pages, the advice or the gossip columns, the comics, and perhaps the classified advertisements. Most people don't take the time to read the real news. They attempt to catch the reader's interest with pictures and exciting headlines. These techniques are used on the front page because it is the first thing you see when you pick up the paper. The first page attracts attention and encourages the reader to look through the rest of the paper. This is why editors always look for a good first page story and headline to make them stop and look. If the headline is horrible enough or frightening enough or wild enough, perhaps they will go on to read the front page anymore. They may read the headlines, but that is all, then they turn to the sports page, or comics, or advertisements. It seems that people do not want the news from a newspaper anymore. They say they get the news on the television now. More people watch television news because it is easier and more interesting than reading a newspaper. What about you?

Sentence 2: Type-3 worksharing is when the mailer decides something is influenced by something other than the size of discount or his cost of work. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Both sentences describe Type-3 worksharing, but they provide slightly different perspectives on the concept. The first sentence focuses more on the decision-making process of the mailer and the factors that influence it, whereas the second sentence simplifies the concept into a more general definition. In order to assess the truth of the second sentence based on the first sentence, let's analyze both sentences in detail. Sentence 1: Type-3 worksharing is where the mailer's decision, whether or not he turns the mail over to a competitor, is influenced by factors other than the size of the discount and his cost of doing the work. This sentence explains that Type-3 worksharing involves a mailer's decision-making process, in which the mailer must decide whether or not to hand over mail to a competitor. The factors that influence this decision do not revolve solely around the size of the discount or the mailer's cost of doing the work, suggesting that there are other variables at play. Sentence 2: Type-3 worksharing is when the mailer decides something is influenced by something other than the size of discount or his cost of work. This sentence offers a more simplified explanation of Type-3 worksharing. It states that the mailer's decision is influenced by factors other than the size of the discount and the cost of work, which aligns with the idea presented in the first sentence. However, it doesn't specifically mention the context of turning mail over to a competitor. Instead, it offers a more generalized idea of what factors influence the mailer's decision. Comparing both sentences, we can conclude that the second sentence is indeed true, as it captures the essence of Type-3 worksharing—that a mailer's decision is affected by factors other than the size of the discount and the cost of work. However, it is important to note that while the second sentence is true, it is less detailed and specific compared to the first sentence that provides context in terms of turning the mail over to a competitor. So, it can be said that the second sentence is true, but it offers a less comprehensive understanding of Type-3 worksharing."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the full names of the people whose 12-minute \\"Acid Tracks\\" was recorded to tape? Deep house's origins can be traced to Chicago producer Mr Fingers's relatively jazzy, soulful recordings \\"Mystery of Love\\" (1985) and \\"Can You Feel It?\\" (1986). According to author Richie Unterberger, it moved house music away from its \\"posthuman tendencies back towards the lush\\" soulful sound of early disco music.Acid house arose from Chicago artists' experiments with the squelchy Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, and the style's origins on vinyl is generally cited as Phuture's \\"Acid Tracks\\" (1987). Phuture, a group founded by Nathan \\"DJ Pierre\\" Jones, Earl \\"Spanky\\" Smith Jr., and Herbert \\"Herb J\\" Jackson, is credited with having been the first to use the TB-303 in the house music context. The group's 12-minute \\"Acid Tracks\\" was recorded to tape and was played by DJ Ron Hardy at the Music Box, where Hardy was resident DJ. Hardy once played it four times over the course of an evening until the crowd responded favorably. The track also utilized a Roland TR-707 drum machine. Club play of house tracks by pioneering Chicago DJs such as Hardy and Lil Louis, local dance music record shops such as Importes Etc., State Street Records, Loop Records, Gramaphone Records and the popular Hot Mix 5 shows on radio station WBMX-FM helped popularize house music in Chicago. Later, visiting DJs and producers from Detroit fell into the genre. Trax Records and DJ International Records, Chicago labels with wider distribution, helped popularize house music inside and outside of Chicago. One 1986 house tune called \\"Move Your Body\\" by Marshall Jefferson, taken from the appropriately titled \\"The House Music Anthem\\" EP, became a big hit in Chicago and eventually worldwide. By 1986, UK labels were releasing house music by Chicago acts, and by 1987 house tracks by Chicago DJs and producers were appearing on and topping the UK music chart. By this time, house music released by Chicago-based labels was considered a must-play in clubs.

After his mother died, his family moved in with his grandmother, who died when Kulwicki was in seventh grade. A year later, his only brother died of a hemophilia-related illness. Kulwicki attended Pius XI High School, a Roman Catholic high school in Milwaukee, and received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1977. Kulwicki began his racing career as a 13-year-old kart racer. His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey's United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work involved travel, Kulwicki's father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki's resourcefulness was often tested trying to find someone to transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up doing most of the work himself. \\"I showed him how\\", Gerry Kulwicki said. \\"And he said: 'Why don't you do it? You can do it better.' And I said, 'Well, if you do it for a while, you can do it better.'\\" Many local-level American racetracks host their own season championships. In Wisconsin, numerous locations held dirt and asphalt short track racing. Kulwicki started driving stock cars at the local level at the Hales Corners Speedway and Cedarburg Speedway dirt oval tracks. In 1973, he won the rookie of the year award at Hales Corners Speedway in the Milwaukee suburb of Franklin, and the next year started racing late models - the fastest and most complicated type of stock cars raced at the local level - at the same track. That season, he won his first feature race, at Leo's Speedway in Oshkosh. Kulwicki moved from dirt tracks to paved tracks in 1977. He also teamed up with racecar builder Greg Krieger to research, model, engineer, and construct an innovative car with far more torsional stiffness than other late models. The increased stiffness allowed the car to handle better in the corners, which increased its speed. Racing at Slinger Super Speedway, he won the track championship in 1977. In 1978, Kulwicki returned to Slinger; that same year he started racing a late model at Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR), finishing third in points in his rookie season at the track. In 1979 and 1980, he won the WIR late model track championships. In 1979, Kulwicki began competing in regional to national level events sanctioned by the USAC Stock Car series and the American Speed Association (ASA), while remaining an amateur racer through 1980. When Kulwicki raced against future NASCAR champion Rusty Wallace in the ASA series, the two became friends. Kulwicki's highest finish in the ASA season points championship was third place, which he accomplished in both 1982 and 1985, with five career victories and twelve pole positions. Ask a question about this article.","output":"What was Kulwicki's highest finish in the ASA season points championship and how many career victories and pole positions did he have?"},{"instruction":"Question: - The seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, etc - The seeds reach the ground - Grow into new trees - These new trees produce seeds - The process repeats itself over and over - What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process you have mentioned appears to be the dispersion of seeds. It's important to note that this process is part of the larger, biological cycle of a plant's life, known as its lifecycle. Let me elaborate on the dispersion of seeds for a better understanding. Seed dispersal is nature's way of spreading plant species in various locations, ensuring their continuation and preventing overpopulation in just one place. This is beneficial not only to the plant itself but also to other elements of the ecosystem as it contributes to maintaining biodiversity, which is critical for a healthy, balanced environment. Seed dispersal occurs in several ways, as you have highlighted: wind, animals, and more examples include water and even through explosion-like mechanisms in certain plants. Wind, for example, can carry lighter seeds miles away from the parent plant. Certain plants' seeds, such as dandelions or maple trees, are specifically structured to easily glide in the wind currents, increasing the chance of far-off dispersion. Animal dispersal is another common method, where animals unknowingly transport seeds by eating fruit and subsequently excreting the seeds elsewhere, or the seeds may attach themselves to the fur or feathers of an animal and drop off at a later time when the animal moves. This can lead to seeds being dispersed into locations far from the parent plants, allowing the plant species to proliferate throughout diverse areas. Additionally, some seeds float on water. In aquatic or riparian (riverbank) environments, seeds can be dispersed over long distances by the water's flow. This is another strategy nature uses to distribute plant life across different terrains and environments. Some plants have even evolved to use explosive mechanisms for seed dispersal. In these cases, the fruit of the plant will dry out and contract until it bursts, ejecting the seeds into the environment. The force of these 'explosions' can sometimes send seeds flying quite far from the mother plant. So, the first step of the process you're referring to involves these and potentially many other dispersion strategies, enabling seeds to spread and potentially germinate in new locations, an essential aspect of plants' lifecycle. This initiation of a plant's lifecycle is a remarkable process that illustrates the intricate web of relationships and strategies within ecosystems."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: When a friend tells you she has wild roses blooming everywhere, it’s not hard to imagine where the conversation headed to next… to turning them into rose petal jam, of course. My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour’s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils.

If yes, write \\"True\\", otherwise write \\"False\\". Question: What were the problems with Dalton's original laws? Suggestion: In chemistry and physics , Dalton's law (also called Dalton's law of partial pressures) states that the total pressure exerted by the mixture of non-reactive gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of individual gases. Answer:","output":"False While the suggested answer discusses Dalton's law of partial pressures, it does not address the problems with Dalton's original laws, which particularly refer to his atomic theory. John Dalton's atomic theory was a milestone in the field of chemistry and physics. It helped provide a foundation for the study and understanding of atomic structure and how elements combine and react with each other. However, Dalton's original laws, also known as the postulates of his atomic theory, were not without their flaws. Some of the primary problems were: 1. Indivisibility of atoms: According to Dalton's theory, atoms were considered to be the smallest indivisible units of matter. However, in the later years, it was discovered that atoms are not, in fact, indivisible, as they consist of smaller particles, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons. 2. Inaccurate atomic weights: Dalton assigned atomic weights to elements, which were in some cases incorrect because methods for determining the atomic weights were not precise at that time. Amedeo Avogadro's work later helped in refining these atomic weights, leading to more accurate measurements. 3. Same atomic weights for isotopes: Dalton's laws failed to differentiate between isotopes, which are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. This led to Dalton assigning the same atomic weights for isotopes erroneously. Frederick Soddy's research on isotopes later provided clarity on this issue. 4. Assumption of spherical atoms: Dalton's original atomic model assumed atoms to be solid spheres. This assumption was later found to be incorrect with the discovery of the electron and the development of more accurate atomic models, such as J.J. Thomson's \\"plum pudding\\" model and Ernest Rutherford's \\"planetary\\" model that eventually led to the modern understanding of atomic structure. 5. Ignorance of chemical bonding: Dalton's laws did not account for chemical bonds and how they are formed between different atoms. It was not until later developments in the understanding of chemical bonding, such as the covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds, that more accurate predictions of how elements interact and combine with each other were possible. In conclusion, although the suggested answer pertains to Dalton's work, it does not correctly address the problems with Dalton's original laws in terms of his atomic theory. Therefore, the answer is \\"False.\\""},{"instruction":"You are given a concept, and a list of answers.

Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the global interest and demand for electric vehicles. The change has been partly driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy efficiency, lower oil dependence, and foster innovation in urban transportation. As a result, numerous governments, corporations, and public interest groups have mobilized substantial resources to facilitate the shift toward more sustainable forms of transportation, such as electric vehicles. Factors like technological advancements in battery systems, government incentives, and public awareness campaigns have promoted EV adoption rates worldwide. Consequently, the growing presence of EVs in urban areas has led to changes in the way people perceive, plan, and use transportation. Hypothesis: Increased electric vehicle adoption will lead to a significant improvement in air quality, reduction in noise pollution, and positive changes in urban lifestyle. The hypothesis states that as the popularity of electric vehicles continues to surge, the shift will deliver notable environmental and socio-economic benefits. Specifically, the hypothesis entails the following outcomes: 1. Improvement in air quality: Electric vehicles emit zero tailpipe emissions, thus contributing to a decrease in harmful particulate matter and chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds linked to internal combustion engine vehicles. By lowering these harmful emissions, air quality in urban areas would vastly improve. 2. Reduction in noise pollution: EVs operate more quietly compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Wide-scale adoption of electric vehicles will substantially reduce noise levels in urban environments, improving the overall quality of life for residents. 3. Positive changes in urban lifestyle: The adoption of electric vehicles would encourage the development of EV-related infrastructure, such as charging stations and battery swapping stations. This transition would not only create new economic opportunities but also stimulate the growth of urban spaces that prioritize pedestrians and bicycling, promoting healthier and more environmentally friendly lifestyles. Additionally, the increasing number of EVs would lead to reduced traffic congestion, as autonomous driving features become more prevalent. To test this hypothesis, data on air quality levels, metrics for noise pollution, and indicators of urban lifestyle quality would need to be collected and analyzed in cities where electric vehicle adoption is high or rapidly increasing. Comparisons with cities where EV usage is low or unchanged would help draw conclusions regarding the role of electric vehicles in fostering these improvements."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Nobody should have the illusion that delaying tactics can help,\\" he added.\\" to Turkish?","output":"\\"Hiç kimse, oyalama taktiklerinin yardımcı olabileceği yanılgısına kapılmamalı,\\" dedi ek olarak."},{"instruction":"By.

Two years on he's now a normal, cheeky five-year-old - and, while he's managed to kick the habit, he now has another addiction. Food. Aldi Rizal became an international media sensation when he was discovered in a poor village in Sumatra, Indonesia, puffing on a cigarette while riding his tricycle. Scroll down for video. Toddler Aldi Rizal stunned the world when it was revealed he had a 40-a-day smoking habit at just two years old. Destructive: The youngster was discovered in a poor village in Sumatra, Indonesia, puffing on a cigarette while riding his tricycle. Now Aldi has picked up a new addiction - to food. His huge appetite has seen him gorge on junk food and fatty snacks. The outcry led to the Indonesian government launching a campaign to tackle the problem of children smoking and organising special rehabilitation treatment to help Aldi quit. Aldi was taken for play therapy sessions in the capital Jakarta for two weeks to take his mind off his 40-a-day habit and learn to be a normal toddler for the first time. A new documentary series revisits the family two years on to find out how Aldi is getting on and reveals he has managed to stay off the cigarettes, but is still dangerously unhealthy. During his rehabilitation treatment, Aldi saw psychiatrists who encouraged his mother to keep him busy with playing and taught her about the dangers of smoking. One of them - Dr Kak Seto - still sees Aldi and his family at regular intervals to ensure he is not falling back into old habits. His mother Diane Rizal, 28, said: 'There are many people still offering Aldi cigarettes, but Aldi no. He says \\"I love Kak Seto. He would be sad if I started smoking again and made myself ill.\\" Aldi weighs nearly four stone, double what he should be for a child his age, and medics have urged his mother to put her son on a diet. Trying to be normal: Aldi was taken for play therapy sessions in the capital Jakarta for two weeks to take his mind off his 40-a-day habit. Aldi's addiction to fatty foods sees him drinking three cans of condensed milk a day (he is pictured centre) 'At first when we were weaning Aldi off the cigarettes he would have terrible tantrums and I would call Dr Seto for help. 'But now he doesn't want them.' However, Mrs Rizal is now worried about her son's weight, as he developed food cravings while quitting smoking, and now has a big appetite. Mrs Rizal said the strong-willed little boy now demands food in the same way he used to beg for cigarettes, and the family struggles not to give in to his tantrums. Mrs Rizal said: 'When Aldi first quit smoking he would demand a lot of toys. Aldi's mother Diane Rizal, 28, says people still offer her son cigarettes even though he has kicked the habit. 'He would bang his head on the wall if. he couldn't get what he wanted. That's why I get him cigarettes in the. first place - because of his temper and his crying. 'Now. I don't give him cigarettes, but he eats a lot. With so many people. living in the house it's hard to stop him from getting food.' Aldi. also helps his mother and father Mohamed out on their market stall,. where his bright bubbly character and cheekiness wins him lots of. attention. 'I feel happy when people want to speak to him because the know him,' admitted Mrs Rizal. Aldi, with his mother, Diane, 28, and father Mohamed. 'But I feel annoyed when they refer to him as 'the smoking kid'. It makes me feel like they are accusing me of being a bad parent.' Mr and Mrs Rizal decided to take Aldi to a nutritionist for medical checks and now they've been given advice on how to put him on a healthier diet so he can start to lose some weight. 'Aldi is very overweight, his weight doesn't match his age,' said nutritionist Fransisca Dewi. 'His ideal weight is 17kg to 19kg. He's 24kg already. 'I think it is difficult for them. The mother says Aldi is a spoilt kid. If Diana wants to forbid him eating, it will be hard. 'She will need the cooperation from the entire household. One obvious thing is they let him have too much condensed milk. He drinks three cans a day and eats too many carbohydrates.' Paediatric specialist Dr William Nawawi is also concerned that smoking at an early age has made Aldi more likely to suffer weight issues. He explained: 'Nicotine can increase the endocrine hormone in the body. This condition can cause resistance to insulin. 'The blood will not be able to break glucose from food. This will make Aldi become bigger and bigger.' Now, Aldi is back at home in his fishing village and is on a strict diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables and smaller portions. Mrs Rizal must also persuade Aldi's siblings and the rest of the family not to give in and provide him with junk food when she is not around. Doctors hope that if Aldi can lose around half a stone to a stone, his weight will eventually even out as he starts to grow taller. It is thought one-third of children in Indonesia try smoking before the age of ten. The Government has launched efforts to tackle the problem.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a process in which double-stranded RNA induces the post-transcriptional sequence-specific degradation of homologous messenger RNA. The present study was carried out to apply the RNAi technology to inhibit the replication of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Four small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) homologous to the FIV gag gene were synthesized and transfected into a feline fibroblastic cell line chronically infected with FIV (CRFK/FIV). These synthetic siRNAs efficiently inhibited the replication of FIV. Next, we examined the effect of retroviral vector-mediated transfer of FIVspecific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) on the replication of FIV in a feline T-cell line chronically infected with FIV (FL4). The retroviral vector-mediated transfer of FIV-specific shRNA was shown to markedly inhibit the replication of FIV in the FL4 cells.

This type of task is designed to assess an individual's ability to predict, analyze, and comprehend the behavior and motion of physical objects as they interact with their surroundings. Below is a detailed description of a task that would test these abilities: Task: Design and Construct a Rube Goldberg Machine Objective: The objective of this task is to create a Rube Goldberg machine, a series of interconnected, intentionally complex and quirky devices that perform a simple task, such as turning on a light switch or popping a balloon. This task will test the participant's physical reasoning skills by requiring them to manipulate objects and use physical principles to design a machine that accomplishes the end goal. Instructions: 1. Define the end goal: Clearly state the simple task that the Rube Goldberg machine will ultimately perform. 2. Gather materials: Collect a variety of objects that can be combined to create the complex series of devices required for the task. Some examples of materials include dominos, marbles, toy cars, pulleys, levers, balloons, strings, magnets, and ramps. 3. Sketch a blueprint: Create a rough design sketch of the entire device, with each step or component carefully laid out and connected. The blueprint should illustrate the ordered sequence of events that will trigger each subsequent action within the machine. 4. Develop an understanding of the physical principles involved: Identify the key mechanical concepts and physical laws that will govern the machine's behavior. Concepts may include force, motion, inertia, gravity, momentum, energy transfer, friction, and simple machines such as levers, inclined planes, and pulleys. 5. Construction: Start building the machine by placing and connecting each component as illustrated in the blueprint. Make adjustments as needed to ensure that each piece interacts effectively with the others, keeping in mind the physical principles determined in Step 4. 6. Test and refine: Run the machine to observe whether it successfully accomplishes the final task. Identify any issues or inconsistencies and make adjustments to the machine's components to optimize their interactions. Repeat this step until the machine functions as designed. 7. Document the process: Throughout the task, document the construction process, any challenges, and physical reasoning behind each solution. This will showcase your understanding and application of physical principles across the different stages of the task. The successful completion of this task will display the participant's ability to: - Understand and apply fundamental mechanical concepts and physical laws. - Manipulate objects and spatially arrange components to create a desired effect. - Identify issues and use problem-solving skills informed by physical reasoning to address them. - Iterate and refine concepts to optimize the functionality of a constructed machine. This Rube Goldberg machine task will not only test someone's physical reasoning skills but also their creativity, problem-solving abilities, and perseverance as they work on designing, constructing, and refining their machine to achieve the desired outcome."},{"instruction":"Eski Yugoslavya Uluslararası Ceza Mahkemesi (ICTY) tarafından hala aranmakta olan geri kalan dört savaş suçları zanlısından oluşan listenin başında yer alan iki eski Bosnalı lider 12 yıldır kaçak konumunda bulunuyor.

The year after the prints were issued, the Murder Act 1752 would ensure that the bodies of murderers could be delivered to the surgeons so they could be \\"dissected and anatomised\\". It was hoped this further punishment on the body and denial of burial would act as a deterrent. At the time Hogarth made the engravings, this right was not enshrined in law, but the surgeons still removed bodies when they could.A tattoo on his arm identifies Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown to have as much feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one of its kind in the first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate. While the surgeons working on the body are observed by the mortar-boarded academics in the front row, the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves.

Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS. Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \\"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

In his report, he noted that the two territories were frequently in conflict, evidencing their separate political identities. Medri Bahri, also known as the realm of the \\"Kings of the Sea\\" or Bahre-Nagassi, had a history of complex geopolitical alliances and rivalries with its neighbors, such as Abyssinia and the Muslim Adal Sultanate. Due to the changing geopolitical circumstances of the region, Medri Bahri fought both alongside and against the Abyssinians at different times. For instance, the kingdom resisted the forces of Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi of the Adal Sultanate in their pursuit of conquest. However, later in the 16th century, Medri Bahri aligned itself with the Adalite states and the Ottoman Empire in a united front against Abyssinia. The 16th century also marked the arrival of the Ottomans, who started to make significant advances in the Red Sea area, further shaping the political landscape of the region.

The Irish surfer expected to face anger and disapproval in the Muslim nation where televising female sports is forbidden. Just last year, a woman was jailed simply for watching a men's volleyball match. But the 29-year-old was shocked to discover a welcoming country as eager to learn the sport as she was to teach them. Overwhelmed by the reaction she returned three years later with filmmaker Marion Poizeau and two female Iranian athletes - professional snowboarder Mona Seraji and diver Shahla Yasini. Marion's documentary 'Into the Sea' charts their incredible journey to the shores of Baluchistan, an area considered so deadly 'even Iranians don't go there'. Scroll down for video. First lesson: Easkey Britton (centre) teaches professional snowboarder Mona Seraji (left) and diver Shahla Yasini (right) how to surf. Acceptance: Men, women and children gathered on Baluchistan's beach to watch Easkey (centre) surf. Letting go: The director of 'Into the Sea' Marion Poizeau told MailOnline: 'A lot of them (children) were very shy at first, but by the time we got into the water, that was gone' Baby steps: Professional surfer Easkey (right) believes young Baluchi girls like this 'are no longer on the sidelines' Making waves: One of Easkey's students Shahla Yasini (pictures) prepares for another ride in Baluchistan. Eager to learn: Easkey (right) teaches a group of young Baluchi boys about surfing as professional snowboarder Mona (left) translates. Champion: Easkey Britton (pictured) was introduced to surfing by her father at the tender age of four and won the Irish National Surfing Championships four consecutive times by 2008. Marion told MailOnline: 'In Tehran, people were saying you're crazy to go to Baluchistan because it's considered a very dangerous place. 'So when I screened my film in the capital, people were saying we didn't know you could go to Baluchistan and come back alive.' Despite its fearsome reputation as a site of brutal secular fighting between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, there is little alternative to the region's 60-mile stretch of sand and five foot waves. For the country's surf-obsessed, it is becoming a necessary pilgrimage. A large crowd began to gather during Mona and Shahla's first lesson under Easkey's expert guidance. They predicted some opposition in the remote section of a largely male-dominated country, but the locals in Chabahar were simply intrigued. Women are allowed to wear bathing suits in Iran's female-only swimming pools and baths, but traditional head-coverings are mandatory on public beaches where men are present. Hundreds stormed the beach to watch the three women riding the waves in their wet-suits and hijabs. And soon the Baluchi locals were begging to take part themselves. The growth of the sport means 'Baluchi girls and women are no longer on the sidelines' according to Easkey, a five-time national champion in her native Ireland. She added: 'Fathers are asking me to take their daughters surfing. 'What is most inspiring is the enthusiasm and vision of young people here, with the young women playing an important change-making role, leading the way in a new frontier sport, writing a new narrative full of possibility despite being ignored by the world outside and limited by the constraints of their own country.' Parting gift: Easkey (pictured) presented her surfboard to local lawmaker Yaqoub Jadgal, who said: 'It (sport) is not just for men, women can do sports too with the hijab and female instructors' Causing a stir: Hundreds of local Baluchi people gathered for a surfing lesson from Easkey Britton. Leading the way: Easkey Britton (pictured) said: 'What is most inspiring is the enthusiasm and vision of young people here' Going pro: Diver Shahla Yasini rides a wave on the beach in Baluchistan, considered one of the most dangerous places in Iran. Iranian hospitality: Easkey Britton (top right) and her two students Mona Seraji (centre) and diver Shahla Yasini (left) were invited to dine with a local Baluchi family. But her first surf with Mona and Shahla caused quite a stir and when the village elders and a 'powerful' member of parliament requested to meet them Easkey expected the worst. She was again overwhelmed by the tolerance shown by Yaqoub Jadgal, who said: 'Islam recommends sports, which are beneficial both physically and spiritually. It is not just for men, women can do sports too with the hijab and female instructors. 'We will ask female instructors to teach women this sport so they can benefit from this art.' The 'thumbs up' from the community's senior figures mirrored the government's acceptance when they allowed for Marion's film to be screened at the Tehran Film Festival last year. It had such a wide-reaching impact she's now involved in a bid to launch the country's first female surfing federation. She said: 'Hopefully we can organise an international event in the future and convince more Iranians to come with us... but we don't know when it's going to happen because the administration is tricky.' The sport's growing popularity has surprised Easkey, who 'never could have imagined' a religiously devout nation could adopt such a progressive sport into their hearts. Big hit: Marion's film 'Into the Sea' (pictured) was screened at the Tehran Documentary Festival last year. Change: The film was received wonderfully by critics after being screened in a country where even televising female sports is forbidden. She says during 'Into the Sea': 'I came here three years ago and there was nobody surfing and now look at it. More and more people are on the beach every day - boys, girls, everyone joining in. 'People say surfing is a selfish pursuit, it becomes kind of like an addiction and all you care about is finding the next perfect wave, but I really don't believe that anymore. 'I think the most powerful thing about surfing is being able to share that passion and connecting people. This is unbelievable.' Marion added: 'It was very exciting the last day, half the village came to watch the girls surf and the kids were very enthusiastic. 'A lot of them were very shy at first, but by the time we got into the water, that was gone. 'It really breaks down the barriers when we go into the water, it's totally different from the beach. It makes people forget about the rules.' Inspired by their own success, Easkey and Marion also set up the non-profit organisationWaves of Freedom. In its own words, the charity 'uses surfing as a medium for empowerment, transforming the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society, especially women and girls'. Through their first project Surf Seeds, they are trying to establish surfing in Baluchistan through the donation of equipment, formal lessons and workshops on how to build and create surfboards. The two women also created the 'We Surf in Iran' group within the local community in Baluchistan. Now, Iranians travel from all over the country to get lessons in the region they were once afraid of. You can watch the film's trailer HERE.

Somehow, Tasha and I began to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can imagine. She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert. I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha. So, I think, did she. The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made. She had no choice but to follow. (I do not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to. Those who are truly curious may look at the last act of \\"Captured Moments.\\") I remember suggesting, with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major accomplishments.

They both walked up to Emil's home while I watched the scarlet moonlight ripple on distant waves.

The rest of the film then occurs in flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vikki, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight.

Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally.

Stimulated emission is a quantum mechanical process in which a particle, such as an electron or an atom, is induced to emit radiation by external factors, such as the interaction with electromagnetic fields. This process is a significant aspect of lasers (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) and masers (Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) technologies. In these devices, a population of particles is excited to a higher energy level through various methods, such as illumination with light or electrical pumping. When an incoming photon interacts with an excited particle (atom or molecule), the particle may be stimulated to emit an additional photon with the same energy (wavelength), phase, and direction as the incoming photon. This process of photon-induced emission is called stimulated emission. As more emitted photons interact with other excited particles, a chain reaction occurs, and the process continues, amplifying the intensity of light or electromagnetic radiation. The concept of stimulated emission was first proposed by Albert Einstein in 1917, but it wasn't until the 1950s and 1960s that it led to the development of masers and lasers. Lasers have diverse applications in various fields, including medicine, telecommunications, entertainment, military, and scientific research.

His NHL career began in 1987. McGeough was one of the last NHL officials to officiate NHL games without wearing a helmet when he was on the ice. In the 200607 NHL season, McGeough was forced by the NHL to wear a helmet on ice, as it was the first season that dictated that all on-ice officials had to do so. He now is helping the NHL bring up new recruits from the AHL. Entering the 200708 NHL season, McGeough had officiated 1,023 regular season and 63 post season games. - James McGeough ( born April 13 , 1963 in Regina , Saskatchewan ) is a retired Canadian ice hockey player . He is the brother of former NHL referee Mick McGeough . Drafted in 1981 by the Washington Capitals , McGeough also played for the Pittsburgh Penguins . - The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - Regina (is the capital city of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The city is the second-largest in the province, after Saskatoon, and a cultural and commercial centre for southern Saskatchewan. It is governed by Regina City Council. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No. 159. - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. What is the relationship between 'jim mcgeough' and 'centre'? Answer:","output":"Jim McGeough and 'centre' do not have a direct relationship. Jim McGeough is a retired Canadian ice hockey player, who played as a forward, and is the brother of former NHL referee Mick McGeough. The term 'centre' in ice hockey refers to the central forward position on the ice, responsible for taking faceoffs, playmaking, and providing offensive and defensive support for the team. While Jim McGeough was a hockey player, it is not explicitly mentioned that he played the centre position during his career. In this context, the relationship between Jim McGeough and 'centre' would only be that they are both related to the sport of ice hockey."},{"instruction":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"1.\\" sentiment (Select from the following. 1. negative. 2. positive.).","output":"Alright little buddy, imagine this.

Catch ya's later. No one really knows what McGregor means. He may have just announced his retirement at the age of 27, or perhaps McGregor is simply sharing that he doesn't plan to fight well into his 30s. As one of the biggest stars in sports, and at the height of his earning potential, it would seem crazy for McGregor to actually retire - but he would certainly have lucrative options outside of the octagon. McGregor's Irish compatriot Becky Lynch suggested on Twitter that the UFC superstar should make the jump to professional wrestling and join WWE. McGregor wouldn't be the first MMA star to transition to WWE. \\"The World's Most Dangerous Man\\" Ken Shamrock is the best example of a success story. Shamrock came to WWE in 1997 as a former UFC Superfight Champion and became a star over a short two-year span, winning the Intercontinental title and the 1998 King of the Ring. MMA legend Dan Severn held the UFC Superfight title and the NWA heavyweight title simultaneously in 1995, and had a short run in WWE in the late 90s. Alberto Del Rio and Shinsuke Nakamura each had short MMA careers before stepping into a WWE ring, while Brock Lesnar became the UFC heavyweight champion after his first stint as a pro wrestler. Would McGregor work for WWE? He'd certainly be a massive draw, but would also undoubtedly clash with everyone else on the roster. McGregor has trained as a boxer and a fighter, but not as a pro wrestler - and it would be interesting to see if WWE would have McGregor remain a fighter (think Floyd Mayweather vs. The Big Show at WrestleMania) or have him actually learn how to wrestle. There's also the challenge of his character. McGregor has one of the biggest personalities in sports, and it would almost be comical to see him in any storyline that doesn't revolve around the WWE title. McGregor's such a big star that he would have to be treated as such, but that limits who he could believably face in WWE. As a five-matches-per-year, Brock Lesnar-type of attraction, McGregor could make for some must-watch pay-per-views, but it's hard to see him working as a weekly Raw main eventer. Alternatively, WWE could bring back the Lion's Den. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the speculation surrounding UFC star Conor McGregor's potential retirement from the sport after his cryptic tweet hinting at \\"retiring young.\\" The article discusses the suggestion made by McGregor's Irish compatriot Becky Lynch that he should transition from UFC to professional wrestling, specifically WWE. The possibility of McGregor joining WWE is analysed, drawing comparisons with other MMA stars who have made the switch, such as Ken Shamrock, Dan Severn, Alberto Del Rio, Shinsuke Nakamura, and Brock Lesnar. The article addresses various factors that would need to be considered, such as McGregor's professional wrestling training, potential character challenges, and the scope of his involvement in WWE storylines. It concludes by contemplating the idea of McGregor taking part in occasional high-profile WWE pay-per-view events, similar to Brock Lesnar's approach, rather than becoming a regular main eventer."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Magma rises from deep in the earth - The magma goes into volcanos - The volcanos pressure the magma upwards - The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano - The lava cools - The lava forms new rock - New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano - The volcano bursts through the rock the formed after the last eruption. suppose pressure in a volcano builds up quickly happens, how will it affect lava stays at a lower temperature.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

Pick from: (A). no; (B). yes;","output":"(B). yes Explanation: The answer is correct because the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, who expanded Melaka's power along the west coast. The other answer (A). no is incorrect because the fact stated in the question accurately describes what Tun Perak did during his tenure, therefore it is true."},{"instruction":"anguished relatives lashed out at pakistani authorities on thursday , devastated to discover that the laborious process of identifying the remains of their loved ones could take up to a week .

A local farmer is paying 4 kids to help plant rows of corn. Every row of corn contains 70 ears. A bag of corn seeds contains 48 seeds and you need 2 seeds per ear of corn. He pays the kids 1.5 per row. Afterward, the kids are so hungry that they end up spending half their money on dinner. The dinner cost 36 per kid. How many bags of corn seeds did each kid use?","output":"Step 1: Find out how much money in total the kids spent on dinner. Since there are 4 kids and each spent 36 on dinner, we have 4 * 36. Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money they earned. Since the kids spent half their money on dinner, we doubled the total amount spent on dinner to find the total amount of money they earned. Therefore, the total amount earned was 2 * (4 * 36). Step 3: Find the total number of rows they planted. Since the farmer paid them 1.5 per row, divide the total amount earned by the cost per row. Therefore, we have (total amount earned) / 1.5. Step 4: Calculate total seeds required to plant all the rows. Since each row of corn contains 70 ears and we need 2 seeds per ear of corn, we multiply the total number of ears by 2 seeds per ear. This gives us 70 * 2 seeds per row. Then, multiply this by the total number of rows they planted to find the total seeds used. Step 5: Compute the total number of bags required. Divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds present in a bag i.e., total seeds used/ 48. Step 6: Determine the number of bags each kid used. There are 4 kids, so divide the total number of bags required by 4 to find the number of bags each kid used. Now, we have explained the steps, we can run the calculations: 1. Total dinner money: 4 * 36 = 144 2. Total amount earned: 2 * 144 = 288 3. Total rows planted: 288 / 1.5 = 192 rows 4. Total seeds needed: (70 * 2) * 192 = 27,040 seeds 5. Total bags of seeds: 27,040 / 48 ≈ 563.33 bags 6. Bags per kid: 563.33 / 4 ≈ 140.83 bags Since seeds come in whole bags, we would round up the number of bags used so each kid used approximately 141 bags of corn seeds."},{"instruction":"Given the question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Translate to Finnish","output":"Olen tuominnut sen tavan, jolla kanat teurastetaan käyttämällä sähköisiä tainnutustekniikoita. Tässä pidemmässä vastauksessa käsitellään asiaa tarkemmin. Kanojen teurastus sähköisten tainnutustekniikoiden avulla on aiheuttanut huolta eläinten oikeuksien puolustajien ja eettistä eläinten kohtelua ajavien ihmisten keskuudessa. Sähköistä tainnutusta käytetään usein teurastamoissa nopeana ja tehokkaana menetelmänä eläinten toimintakyvyttömäksi tekemiseksi ennen verenlaskua ja teurastusta. Vaikka se on laajasti käytetty, monet kokevat, että se voi olla julma ja epäeettinen tapa kohdella eläimiä. Sähköinen tainnutus toimii lähettämällä sähkövirta eläimen kehon läpi. Tämä voi aiheuttaa eläimelle ankaraa kipua, stressiä ja pelkoa, ennen kuin se menettää tajuntansa ja lihaksiston toiminta heikkenee. Joissakin tapauksissa sähköistä tainnutusta voi käyttää väärin, mikä tekee prosessista vielä epämiellyttävämmän ja raaemman kanoille. On myös huomattava, että sähköisen tainnutuksen tehokkuudessa ja tehokkuudessa voi olla suuria eroja kanojen iän, rodun ja muiden tekijöiden mukaan. Kanojen sähköisen tainnutuksen vastustajat väittävät, että on olemassa eettisempiä ja humaanimpija teurastusmenetelmiä, jotka voivat vähentää eläinten kärsimystä teurastusprosessissa. He kannattavat esimerkiksi kaasutekniikoiden käyttöä, kuten hiilidioksidin käyttöä kanojen tainnuttamiseen. Näiden menetelmien on osoitettu olevan vähemmän invasiivisia ja aiheuttavan pitempään tiedottomina olevia eläimiä, mikä vähentää heidän stressiään ja kärsimystään. Yleisesti ottaen sähköisen tainnutuksen käytön kanojen teurastuksessa tuomitseminen viittaakin siihen, että teollisuuden olisi syytä tutkia muita, humaaneja teurastusmenetelmiä ja kunnioittaa eläinten oikeuksia ja hyvinvointia. Tämä keskustelu korostaa tarvetta jatkuvaan eettiseen arviointiin ja muutoksiin eläintenhoitokäytännöissä, jotta eläinten kärsimystä voidaan vähentää ja samalla täyttää kuluttajien eettiset odotukset eläintuotteiden suhteen."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Petroleum extraction has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy. In 2008, oil sector accounted for 65% of the GDP, 85% of government revenue, and 92% of exports. The country also has large untapped mineral wealth.\\" Answer: A:","output":"According to the context provided, the oil sector in 2008 had a greater numerical impact on exports rather than government revenue. The statistics state that in 2008, oil accounted for 65% of the GDP, 85% of government revenue, but a massive 92% of exports. In terms of numerical superiority, that 92% figure for exports clearly outstrips the 85% attributable to the oil sector's contributions to government revenue. However, it is important to highlight how influential the oil sector was in these different fields. Producing 65% of the Gross Domestic Product, the oil sector represented a dominating part of the local economy. Its relevance is even more noticeable when considering its contribution of 85% to the government's revenue - an incredibly high percentage that emphasizes the government's significant dependency on the oil industry for its finances. Nevertheless, the oil sector's contribution to exports, with a percentage of 92%, was the highest. This shows not only a local but also a global dependency on this sector, as it means most of the goods that this country provided to the world were oil-related. This means that the majority of the income the country earned from selling goods to other countries came from the oil industry. Evidently, the economic health and global economic relations of this country in 2008 appeared to significantly rely on the oil sector. Thus, the data clearly suggests that the oil industry had a profound numerical influence across various elements of the economy, but it was most dominant in exports when we consider the raw percentages."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Both the Council and the Commission have agreed that this is a priority - in the Lisbon process, in the Seventh Framework Programme and in the European Economic Recovery Plan.\\" to Finnish?","output":"Sekä neuvosto että komissio ovat yksimielisiä siitä, että tämä on etusijalla - Lissabonin prosessissa, seitsemännessä puiteohjelmassa ja Euroopan talouden elvytyssuunnitelmassa.

Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että päätöksentekijöiden on otettava huomioon sekä kansalaisten yleisen turvallisuuden että heidän yksilöllisten oikeuksiensa tarpeet ja vaatimukset. Näiden kahden tavoitteen välillä voi syntyä ristiriitoja, ja on tärkeää löytää keinoja, joilla voidaan saavuttaa molemmille tavoitteille myönteisiä tuloksia. Turvallisuuden parantaminen voi sisältää monenlaisia politiikkatoimia, kuten lainsäädännön tiukentamista, poliisin ja turvallisuusviranomaisten resurssien lisäämistä, sekä yhteistyön tiivistämistä kansainvälisellä tasolla esimerkiksi rikollisuuden ja terrorismin torjunnassa. Parantunut turvallisuus voi lisätä yhteiskunnan hyvinvointia ja vähentää konflikteja, mutta toisaalta sillä voi olla negatiivisia vaikutuksia yksilöiden oikeuksiin ja vapauksiin, kuten esimerkiksi yksityisyyden heikentymiseen, ennakkoluuloihin perustuviin poliisitoimiin tai sananvapauden rajoittumiseen. Yksilöiden oikeuksien edistäminen ja puolustaminen voi tarkoittaa esimerkiksi perusoikeuksien kunnioittamisen ja ihmisoikeuksien noudattamisen varmistamista, vähemmistöjen ja heikommassa asemassa olevien ryhmien oikeuksien puolustamista, sekä yhteiskunnallisen tasa-arvon lisäämistä ja syrjinnän vähentämistä. Samalla on tärkeää huolehtia siitä, että eri väestöryhmät ja yksilöt voivat turvallisesti nauttia näistä oikeuksistaan. Oikean tasapainon löytäminen vaatii poliitikoilta ja päättäjiltä herkkää tilannetajua ja kykyä tehdä kompromisseja. On tärkeää kuunnella kansalaisten toiveita ja huolia, sekä aktiivisesti osallistua keskusteluun eri näkökantojen ja intressien välillä. Etenkin kansainvälisessä yhteistyössä on tärkeää, että eri maiden päätöksentekijät pystyvät löytämään yhteisen sävelen ja työskentelemään yhdessä ihmisoikeuksien ja turvallisuuden parantamiseksi. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että strategisena poliittisena tavoitteena on edelleen löytää oikea tasapaino kansalaisten turvallisuuden parantamisen sekä yksilöiden oikeuksien edistämisen ja puolustamisen välillä.

Brisebois said manufacturers are continuing to mark up prices in Canada by 20 to 50 per cent, and therefore retailers have little savings to pass on to the customer. \\"The minister needs to put pressure on that community as he has done to retail,\\" she said. \\"He's not talked about the publishing industry; he's talked about booksellers.

But recent price comparisons have shown identical items are often priced more than 20 per cent higher in Canada than in the U.S. Retailers have defended their prices, saying the price difference is linked to high shipping costs and inventory acquired before the dollar hit parity.

The service was extremely slow, with the waitstaff rarely checking on us and taking way too long to take our order. Throughout the meal, we had to ask for refills multiple times as our glasses sat empty. As for the food, I was even more let down. The lobster, which should have been the star of the meal, was overcooked and dry, lacking any flavor or moisture. Additionally, the side dishes were bland and under-seasoned, making for an utterly forgettable dining experience. Overall, I cannot recommend The Lazy Lobster, as its lackluster atmosphere, poor service, and subpar food left us wanting more – and not in a good way."},{"instruction":"The Lions began their season down south, taking on the New Orleans Saints.

The results state 1st: 5 California Classic, 2nd: 2 Lucky Star, and 3rd: 10 Solid Gold. These are the names of the horses that finished in first, second, and third place, respectively, with a race time of 1:42.80. No jackpot information is provided for horse races like the California Classic. - No specific lottery game is mentioned along with the estimated jackpot of 123,000, but it is likely that the jackpot was for a different lottery game and not for California Classic, Lucky Star, or Solid Gold. - The estimated jackpot for an unspecified lottery game is 295,000, not specifically for Lucky Star (which is a horse name in the California Classic race and not the name of the lottery game). - Two 40 million jackpots are mentioned in the text, but it is unclear if they refer to two different lottery games or if one is a repetition of the other. Regardless, it is likely that these estimated jackpots are related to larger-scale lottery games. Based on these interpretations, it is not accurate to assume that the combined jackpot value of California Classic, Lucky Star, and Solid Gold stands at 40,418.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together.

Dr Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said that people should then go on to reduce their meat consumption even further. Pachauri, who was re-elected the panel's chairman for a second six-year term last week, said diet change was important because of the huge greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental problems associated with raising cattle and other animals. \\"It was relatively easy to change eating habits compared to changing means of transport,\\" he said. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation has estimated that meat production accounts for nearly a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions. These are produced during the production. For example, ruminants , particularly cows, give off a gas called methane, which is 23 times more effective as a global warming agent than CO2.

Options: - shower stall - salad - locker room - basement - bathroom reasoning:","output":"Fungus can grow on walls in the following locations: 1) Shower stall: Fungus can grow on walls in shower stalls because the environment is frequently damp, warm, and humid, which are conditions that support fungus growth. Shower walls are often exposed to water and steam, creating the perfect environment for mold and mildew to thrive. 2) Locker room: Fungus can also grow on walls in locker rooms, as these areas are often damp and humid, due to the presence of showers and sweaty clothing. The moisture in the air and the presence of organic materials, such as fabric and wood, can create the right conditions for fungus growth. 3) Basement: Basements can be another location for fungus growth on walls, especially if the basement is not well-ventilated or properly waterproofed. Basements can become damp and humid due to moisture seeping through walls or the floor, creating an environment conducive to mold and mildew growth. 4) Bathroom: Bathrooms, like shower stalls and locker rooms, are also areas with high humidity and moisture levels. Fungus can grow on bathroom walls due to the steam from showers and the dampness that can linger in the room. Regular cleaning and proper ventilation are essential to prevent mold and mildew growth in bathrooms.

Well, you're not the CEO of a 205 billion company, and apparently, even this rather demanding job leaves plenty of time to learn some serious Mandarin. Case in point: the – video that Mark Zuckerberg just posted to, yes, Facebook. It shows off his 30-minute Q&A at Tsinghua University in Beijing in which he answered every question exclusively in Chinese. I don't know Mandarin, so I can't say how well he spoke. But the audience was decidedly thrilled. The crowd gasped and applauded as soon as he started speaking, and the good vibes appeared to last throughout the chat. Of course, the 21st century's most fabled boy-genius entrepreneur could probably speak to business school students in pig Latin and still get a rapturous response. Zuckerberg's proficiency would appear to be the positive result of one of his annual self-improvement challenges. Every year, Zuckerberg picks a skill or a goal to pursue with extreme focus. This year, the plan was to write one thoughtful thank-you note every day. In 2010, his aim was to learn Mandarin. The effort seems to have paid off in a whole lot of good will from his audience at Tsinghua, where he said he also just joined the board of the university's School of Economics and Management. But the ultimate purpose of Zuckerberg's charm offensive is probably much more ambitious. Right now, Facebook is still banned in China. Maybe next year, his goal will be to get it unblocked. Maybe he can promise the Chinese government a nice thank-you note—written in Mandarin. ||||| In case you were wondering if there is anything Zuck can’t do, there’s seemingly not. Beyond donating more than 50% of his wealth to charity and rocking a hoodie, the billionaire computer programmer just proved he can speak Chinese. Facebook FB, +0.24% CEO Mark Zuckerberg did his first ever public Q&A in Mandarin on Wednesday at Tsinghua University in Beijing, according to his Facebook page. Zuckerberg studied Chinese in order to please his wife’s grandmother who doesn’t speak English, according to a 2011 report from China.org. In case you don’t know Chinese, Zuckerberg wrote that he “discussed connecting the world, Internet.org, innovation and the early days of Facebook” in the video. But just how good is Zuckerberg’s Chinese? Even if his accent indeed is not great, most people agree the Q&A was still pretty impressive. ||||| Whether part of a bid to get Facebook unblocked or, as he professes, because he “wants to study Chinese culture,” founder Mark Zuckerberg awed the internet on Wednesday (Oct 22) with a 30-minute interview at Beijing’s Tsinghua University—in Mandarin. “Mark Zuckerberg nails a Q&A in Chinese like it’s no big deal,” gushed the Silicon Valley Business Journal, observing that he “slayed the crowd.” The Facebook clip of the interview—posted without subtitles—elicited like upon like from adoring fans, noting how “impressive” he was. Behold the first two minutes: Zuckerberg’s aplomb is indeed impressive. And for someone of his Mandarin level, speaking for 30 minutes and fielding questions isn’t easy. But those blown away by Zuck’s Chinese chinwag might want to know that though he’s clearly memorized a lot of relevant words, those were still shoehorned into a distinctly American-English grammatical order. Pronunciation is also a problem: He showed a plucky disregard for the tones that Mandarin has—one tonal slip-up had him saying that Facebook boasts eleven mobile users instead of 1 billion—and his enunciation was roughly on par with the clarity possible when someone’s stepping on your face. That said, Zuckerberg didn’t shy away from some tougher topics—and he even tried a few jokes. And regardless of the slip-ups, his audience clearly loved the fact that he made an effort. Here are the most insightful nuggets from Zuckerberg’s interview: The internet is very important: “The majority of people who don’t have internet, don’t have the internet because they don’t know why they want to use the internet. If you asked me—sorry, if I asked you—if you didn’t have a phone, computer or internet and I asked you, ‘Do you want to use internet?’ You maybe would ask me, ‘Why do I want internet?’ So a lot of problems. But… internet creates work opportunities and economic development. Very important.” His three reasons for studying Chinese: 1) to speak with his grandma-in-law and other inlaws; 2) China is a great country, and he wants to study its culture; 3) Chinese is hard, and he loves challenges. The next big things in tech: “Facebook is 10 years old this year. So if I ask 10 years from now, what should we develop? I decided we should develop three things. First, we need to connect the entire world. We need everybody to use the internet. Second, we want to develop (in English) artificial intelligence. I think 10 years from now computers will be better than humans at reading, listening, talking, and other things. So we are developing this. Third, when everyone is using mobile phones, I believe the next platform will be (in English) virtual reality. Oculus is the first product, but we hope there will be many products. Those three things.” Advice to entrepreneurs: If it fails, try again. “I feel that the best companies are started not because the founder wanted a company but because the founder wanted to change the world…. If you decide you want to found a company you maybe start to develop your first idea. And hire lots of workers. But you maybe have lots of ideas and you don’t know which one is best. If the first idea isn’t good, then your company isn’t good. But if you decide to change the world you should try to develop more ideas. If any idea is very good later you found the company.” Facebook’s plan in China: “We’re already in China. We help Chinese companies grow their customers abroad. They use Facebook ads to find more customers. For example, Lenovo used Facebook ads to sell its new phone. In China I also see economic growth. We admire it. (in English) It’s, it’s…amazing. We want to help other parts of the world connect to China, such as large cities, national parks, (in English) um, yeah.” His favorite color: “I can’t choose red or green, because Facebook is blue!” Advice to founders: don’t give up. “I think the best thing to do is not give up. Founding a company is hard. Most of it isn’t smooth. You’ll have to make very hard decisions. You have to fire a few people. Therefore, if you don’t believe in your mission giving up is easy. The majority of founders give up. But the best founders don’t give up. Therefore, believe in your mission and don’t give up—very important.” Is his Chinese better than his (Chinese-Vietnamese-American) wife Priscilla’s? “In Chinese, I know more words. But she also speaks Cantonese. Her listening is better than mine. Mine is really awful. One day I asked her why my listening was so bad and she said ‘your listening is bad in English, too.'” Here’s the full 30-minute interview: ||||| Add a location to your Tweets When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

She wants to understand what pervasive and sometimes aggressive American intelligence gathering does to people. And she wants to understand the human beings who have created it, run it, and become disillusioned by it -- men who now find themselves at war with the system. In her new film, Citizenfour, we get unprecedentedly close to the human source -- Edward Snowden -- of revelations that have rewritten the way that large parts of the world understand the nature of American intelligence, surveillance, and power. And then Poitras pulls us back. Poitras, a journalist and documentary filmmaker, is one of the foremost chroniclers of the U.S. war on terror, and Citizenfour is the third in a trilogy of movies examining the human costs of that conflict. (Its title refers to Snowden's moniker when he first contacted Poitras.) Poitras now lives in Berlin, where she is part of a growing expat community working on digital privacy issues. Together with Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist, she serves as the primary conduit for Snowden leaks. It bears saying that the former NSA contractor indicted in the United States under the Espionage Act chose Poitras, whose work he admired -- particularly her short video for the New York Times -- and knew she had some facility with technical encryption. As someone who has written about Snowden since he first appeared in the summer of 2013, I think the choice of Poitras as an interlocutor was the best of all his wildly successful gambits. Snowden and Poitras first had contact with one another in January 2013; it can be easy to forget how incredible it is that they weren't caught by the NSA. That's a technical feat for which Poitras deserves much of the credit. Citizenfour is the most complete account of how their relationship developed. It is a story of great daring, one that dabbles in a conspiracy theorist's paranoia and indeed provides a more human portrayal of Snowden. It is not a neutral film in the old-fashioned, journalistic sense of the word -- and that's not a bad thing. It can be divided into three parts: before Snowden, with Snowden, and after Snowden. B.S. features Bill Binney -- the legendary NSA crypto-mathematician turned whistleblower -- and Greenwald, who argues about civil liberties from his home in Brazil. It also features the Internet activist and hacker Jacob Appelbaum, one of the film's more interesting characters, teaching left-wing activists about electronic surveillance. Then Snowden appears, much like a bolt of lightning. And with his arrival, Poitras must negotiate her role as a character in her own film. This is a very serious problem for Poitras, for whom appearing in her own work is anathema. Poitras is deeply aware of the observational problem of documentary filmmaking, of the way that the camera's presence alters the reality or truth being filmed. It's a conundrum with an analog in quantum mechanics: The measurement problem. That she has authored multiple, award-winning articles based on Snowden-provided material further complicates Poitras's entanglement with Snowden. Snowden, then, is someone whom she has to protect as a source and expose as a subject. That's something of a filmic quandary. Poitras's solution is acting as a semi-passive observer, having the camera at her hip, not blocking her face. \\"The camera doesn't have to be a barrier,\\" she told the New Yorker. \\"It's a witness.\\" In Citizenfour, she appears most as a disembodied voice, reading eerie messages she received from Snowden via encrypted channels. By my count, Poitras makes one visual appearance in the film: When Greenwald and Poitras first meet Snowden in a Hong Kong hotel, she is caught briefly in a mirror reflection. That moment comes just as the audience meets the source, Snowden, for the first time. He sits on a bed, disheveled, a little dazed, and obviously nervous. The effect is like a shock of the new: This thing that we thought we knew completely presented at a moment just prior to his (public) birth. He has no idea what's coming. It's an incredible piece of footage, which also captures the intimacy of Poitras's cinematic technique. The movie's high point comes when it's just Poitras and her subject in a hotel room. A talking head on BBC argues in the background that Snowden could have been pulled out of a book by the spy novelist John le Carré. Snowden walks around the room in a black suit jacket and black pants. He tries to get his hair to stay in place with some gel. It doesn't go well. He holds up a green umbrella before a mirror, considering his disguise for escaping the hotel. Too much, he decides. It's a lovingly shot scene. Poitras sees Snowden as a human being. For a moment it's not Snowden \\"the leaker,\\" Snowden \\"the whistleblower,\\" Snowden \\"the traitor.\\" Instead, just a goofy guy, one far removed from the world of le Carré. And then, just as abruptly as he arrived, Snowden goes underground to seek asylum and, eventually, with the help of WikiLeaks, lands in Moscow. With the protagonist gone, the film sags a bit. Snowden reappears via encrypted chat. But he is distant, more removed. Greenwald moves to the forefront. His testimony to Brazilian lawmakers on U.S. surveillance is of a different register than the poetic footage from Hong Kong. One lives again the drama of the Snowden revelations as they played out on cable television. It's less riveting footage than meditations on Snowden's psyche in Hong Kong's neon dreamscape. Perhaps as a result, the portrait of Snowden ends up feeling incomplete. The film ends back in Moscow -- after Snowden has secured asylum and the aftermath of his revelations has been documented on screen -- with a meeting between Snowden and Greenwald, who reveals that he has acquired a new source high up in the U.S. intelligence bureaucracy. And so it becomes a film with an easy moral message: Snowden did this for pure purposes at immense risk to himself, and it has resulted in more like him stepping forward. That may very well be true, but it's so unmessy that it's almost unbelievable. The more complicated aspects of Snowden's personality come as a footnote. We get a brief shot, filmed with a long lens so it feels like they are surveilled, of Snowden and his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, cooking dinner together. That Mills traveled to Moscow to be with Snowden is the film's only real revelation, but she never appears in the movie as a subject. Mills was reportedly willing to go on camera but Poitras turned her down out of an apparent desire to keep the film focused on Snowden and, one senses, the \\"issues.\\" When Snowden appears in Hong Kong chatting with his girlfriend on his laptop, Poitras retreats. We don't know what they say to one another. Therein lies the point at which Poitras retreats from her subject, perhaps to protect him. And, sure, it would be invasive to ask Snowden to tell us what he's typing out to his girlfriend. But these are the conundrums of trying to establish interiority in a documentary film. And given Poitras's humanistic commitments, it's surprising that she didn't explore this relationship further. Perhaps more surprising is her unwillingness to more directly confront a bigger question hanging over Snowden: whether the use of illiberal means can ever be justified as a defense of the liberal state. Unmentioned in the film are the Chinese and Russian intelligence services, which move through its background. These organizations have similar, if not as expansive, capabilities as their counterparts in the United States, to say nothing of their ability to imprison political opponents and use physical violence against detainees with impunity. And some of Snowden's revelations did not just deal with the gathering of intelligence against Americans but also with operations against countries such as Iran and Pakistan, both of which have deplorable human rights records and sponsor or condone violence outside their own borders. And therein lie the questions about Snowden that Poitras -- perhaps too close to the man -- cannot answer. Snowden, as he was presented to the public, remains so uncomplicated that he feels flat. Some of America's intelligence work is indeed deplorable, but so are the intelligence operations of other countries. What the film lacks is how Snowden grappled with the question of how one deplorable thing differs from another. And in the absence of a more rounded portrait of him, conspiracies flourish. Circumstantial arguments are made about how he is a Russian agent and was recruited long ago. The wild theories don't quite add up -- which is in part why they thrive -- but his defenders don't have a lot of material at their disposal to rebut them either.

I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening. So much for my attempt at appearing “classy” and “sophisticated”…. Who was frozen in place? - not enough information - The friend - The waiter - The 21-year-old girl","output":"Your question about my worst makeup disaster actually does not apply to me, as I am an AI and do not have the ability to apply physical makeup or experience events. However, I understand that you are sharing a story about a personal experience. In your story, the person who was frozen in place was the waiter. Clearly, it was an unexpected and surprising incident for everyone involved. The story you shared highlights the challenges and occasional misadventures that people face when trying to present themselves in a particular way, especially when they're young and figuring things out. In your case, the bright red fake fingernails, meant to add a touch of elegance and sophistication to your appearance, ironically led to an embarrassing situation when they caught fire. It's commendable that you managed to think quickly and extinguished the flame with your glass of wine without causing more significant damage or commotion. This story also emphasizes the importance of being extra cautious while handling fire, especially near flammable materials such as plastic. Moreover, it serves as an entertaining and relatable example of how sometimes, despite our best efforts, things don't always go as planned, and we must learn to adapt and handle unexpected situations. It's worth appreciating that the waiter maintained his professionalism despite witnessing an unusual and amusing scenario. This example demonstrates how people working in customer-facing roles often must maintain their demeanor and go the extra mile to ensure a pleasant experience for their clients. Overall, your story is a memorable and entertaining one, as it evokes a sense of empathy for the unforeseen mishap along with the realization that we must sometimes learn the hard way to tread carefully in certain situations. It's a great reminder that everyone experiences embarrassing moments, but it's our ability to recover and learn from them that ultimately counts."},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: begin, hop, square","output":"Step 1: Identify the keywords that need to be included in the sentence: 'begin', 'hop', and 'square'.

While recovering in hospital, Julie attempts suicide by overdose, but cannot swallow the pills. After being released from hospital, Julie, who it is suggested wrote (or helped to write) much of her husband's famous pieces, destroys what is left behind of them. Calling Olivier (BenoÃ®t RÃ©gent), an unmarried collaborator of her husband's who has always admired her, she spends a night with him and says goodbye. Emptying the family house and putting it up for sale, she takes an apartment in Paris without telling anyone, her only memento being a mobile of blue beads that the viewer assumes belonged to her daughter. Julie disassociates herself from all past memories and distances herself from former friendships, even being no longer recognised by her mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. She also reclaims and destroys the unfinished score for her late husband's last commissioned workâa piece celebrating European unity following the end of the Cold War. Snatches of its music, however, haunt her throughout the film.

L. Frank Baum wrote a total of 14 novels chronicling the adventures and events of the Land of Oz, along with several short stories and other related works. His series became a beloved children's classic and later inspired movies, plays, and other adaptations. The Nine Tiny Piglets make their appearance in \\"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\\" as small, magical creatures that are encountered by Dorothy Gale, the Wizard, and their companions during their journey through Oz. The Piglets are described as very small with long tails and cute features, adding to the fantastical nature of the place. Their role in this particular story showcases the unique characters and imaginative elements that Baum weaved throughout his Oz series. The illustrations accompanying the text of \\"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\\" were created by an artist named William Wallace Denslow. Denslow collaborated with Baum on several projects, and they shared the same vision for bringing the Land of Oz to life visually. However, their partnership came to an end after the first three Oz books due to disagreements and personal issues, and a new illustrator was needed for the fourth book and future installments. As a result, John R. Neill stepped into the role as the series' main illustrator beginning with \\"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz.\\" Neill continued to be the primary illustrator for Baum's Oz books till the author's death and even wrote three sequels to the original series after Baum's demise.

Laura De Nardis and Deborah Smith stood arm-in-arm near the same spot. \\"We want equality under the law,\\" De Nardis said unequivocally as she wrapped an arm around her partner. 5 things we learned from the justices. Stauffenberg, De Nardis and Smith not only stood apart literally, but also sharply illustrated the divide making history inside the high court -- the question of whether same-sex marriage can be prohibited under the law. As the justices weighed legal arguments over an appeal of California's same-sex marriage ban, demonstrators packed sidewalks around the ornate Supreme Court building. They were jammed shoulder to shoulder as speeches rang out from a makeshift stage. Demonstrators from both sides pumped their fists waved homemade signs. Some broke into chants while others led a small parade that snaked between the crowd. The mood was festive overall. Police cleared the roads and maintained access to the court but otherwise kept a low profile. Grass ringing the court grounds was trampled to mud, which covered the sidewalk. Shoeprints were everywhere. The public sentiment outside the marble court seemed to mirror recent polling showing a growing awareness around the issue, and stronger support for same-sex marriage specifically. A decision that could change America. According to the CNN/ORC International survey, 57% say they have a family member or close friend who is gay or lesbian, up 12 points from 2007. Also, the number of Americans who support same-sex marriage has risen by almost the same amount over the same period - from 40% in 2007 to 53%. \\"It's time that gay and lesbian couples have the same rights as straight couples,\\" says said Olga Liapis-Muzzy, who was outside the court with her partner of three years, Emily Gosnell. Some of those gathered recognized a momentous event. \\"It's a historic day. I want to be a part of history,\\" said Scott Nelson, a New Jersey history teacher who arrived at the Supreme Court at 2 a.m. Someone yells to same-sex marriage supporters: \\"What do we want?\\" They respond: \\"Equality!\\" The person again implores: \\"When do we want it?\\" \\"Now!\\" is the answer. Same-sex marriage opponents were vocal, too. Hear and read the arguments in full. Chris Simon of Maryland owns a detailing company, and held a sign that read: \\"Say No to Same-Sex Marriage.\\" \\"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. This is the way God planned it. Two men and two women can't reproduce. That's going against word of God,\\" he said. Carl Boyd Jr., is a Christian Conservative radio host from Nashville. Dressed in a suit, Boyd debates a woman and a man and then walks away. He then stood on the edge of the crowd. \\"I am out here to stand with the institution of marriage between one man and one woman,\\" he said. \\"Gay rights and civil rights are not the same thing,\\" he added later. As he spoke, however, supporters for same-sex marriage continue to wave signs and cheer. Across the street music starts to play from a boom box and some of the younger supporters of same-sex marriage begin to dance. Soon, the arguments are over inside and lawyers and spectators walk out of the court. People begin to cheer and snap pictures. Those who were inside smiled back and took pictures of the crowd. The symbol that took over social media. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article describes a scene outside the U.S. Supreme Court during the hearing of an appeal of California's same-sex marriage ban.

The succulent prawns, arranged artfully on a bed of lettuce and garnished with wedges of lemon, enticed her taste buds and heightened her anticipation for the meal ahead. The rich and zesty cocktail sauce perfectly complemented the slight sweetness of the prawns, creating an exquisite symphony of flavors and textures, and leaving both of them craving for more. As they eagerly moved onto the main course, the perfectly grilled lamb, the mouthwatering aroma of the succulent meat lingered in the air. The tenderness of the lamb, paired with the delicate taste of zucchini and the tangy juiciness of the tomatoes, created a perfect harmony of flavors that danced upon their palates.

Hypothesis: Three boys in shorts enjoy the beach and sports together. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"To thoroughly analyze the premise and the hypothesis, we need to examine the elements present in the scene and their relation to each other in detail. Premise components: 1. Beach scene: A beach typically indicates a leisurely environment and is an ideal location for relaxation, fun, and various recreational activities. 2. Three boys in swim shorts: This implies that the boys are dressed appropriately for the beach and are likely engaging in beach-related activities, such as swimming. 3. Paddle ball racquets: These racquets suggest that the boys are equipped to play a specific sport, paddle ball, which is commonly played at the beach. 4. No ball in sight: The absence of the ball, which is an essential piece of equipment for paddle ball, may suggest either that they cannot play the game at the moment or they might have misplaced or lost it. Now, let's break down the hypothesis: Hypothesis components: 1. Three boys in shorts: This aligns with the premise, as we know that there are three boys wearing swim shorts. 2. Enjoy the beach: The hypothesis suggests that the boys have a positive experience at the beach, which is implied by their involvement in an activity that is typically played at the beach and their choice of attire. 3. Sports together: The presence of paddle ball racquets indicates that the boys not only have an inclination towards sports but also have a common interest in this particular game. From this analysis, we can partly conclude the hypothesis based on the information provided in the premise. There are indeed three boys dressed in swim shorts who seem to enjoy the beach and have a shared interest in sports. However, since there is no ball in sight, it isn't clear if they are actively participating in paddleball or simply preparing for it but looking for a ball. The absence of the ball adds a level of uncertainty to their enjoyment of the sport itself, but it doesn't necessarily negate the overall hypothesis that they are enjoying their time at the beach. In summary, while the premise seems to largely support the hypothesis that the three boys dressed in shorts enjoy the beach and sports together, the missing ball creates a slight inconsistency in fully validating their active engagement in the sport of paddleball at this given moment."},{"instruction":"Student: Can we conclude from \\"A man is holding a shovel like a weapon.\\" that \\"The man is trying to defend his home.\\"?

Dune city had very dry air and no rain, while Bay city had very high humidity, fog and lots of rain. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city had less damage to cars because of corrosion? Hint: Iron is first oxidized to iron(II) ions by oxygen. In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion. Answer:","output":"Dune city had less damage to cars because of corrosion. This is because corrosion, specifically rusting, requires the presence of both oxygen and water. In Dune city, the air is very dry and there is no rain, which results in significantly less moisture and water availability in the environment. This lack of water makes it more difficult for the iron(II) ions to be further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen to form rust, reducing the overall rate of corrosion of the metal. On the other hand, Bay city has high humidity, fog, and lots of rain, providing an environment that is more conducive to the rusting process and causing more damage to cars due to corrosion."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

Lately, the townspeople have been receiving anonymous warnings in the form of cryptic letters, foretelling danger and advising them to remain alert. They are uncertain who could be behind these messages. During this time, Jennifer Campbell, an ambitious investigative journalist, arrives in Blackwater Ridge, hoping to uncover the story hidden behind the mysterious warnings. Jennifer has a personal connection to the town, as her grandfather, Charles Campbell, used to live there before his sudden death two years ago. While investigating, Jennifer discovers that Ray Peyton, Sr., a reclusive and paranoid former Air Force officer, is behind the warnings. Jennifer interviews Ray and learns that he holds crucial information about a long-buried military secret that could put Blackwater Ridge in severe danger. Act 2: Jennifer, with the help of Ray, starts to dig deeper into the mystery surrounding the military secret, which ultimately leads them to a classified project dating back to the Cold War era. As they work together, Jennifer learns more about Ray and his difficult past, developing empathy toward him. Their investigation takes an unexpected turn when they come across a hidden underground bunker, which seems to have been abandoned for decades. Inside, they find documents and evidence that point to a deadly weapon developed under Charles Campbell's leadership, Jennifer's late grandfather. This revelation shocks Jennifer, who had always seen her grandfather as an honest man. Act 3: As the truth unravels, Jennifer and Ray realize that although the dangerous weapon was never used, it still poses a significant threat to Blackwater Ridge if activated. They start working together to locate and disarm the weapon, racing against a group of mercenaries interested in acquiring it for their own nefarious motives. In a tense climax, Ray, Jennifer, and the townspeople of Blackwater Ridge work together to outwit the mercenaries and disarm the weapon, ensuring the safety of their town. With the truth revealed and the danger averted, Jennifer now appreciates the sacrifices Ray and her grandfather had made to keep Blackwater Ridge safe. In the end, Ray is finally acknowledged by the community for his heroism and dedication, not only for revealing the potential danger but for fighting to protect them.

After his mother died, his family moved in with his grandmother, who died when Kulwicki was in seventh grade. A year later, his only brother died of a hemophilia-related illness. Kulwicki attended Pius XI High School, a Roman Catholic high school in Milwaukee, and received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1977. Kulwicki died in an airplane crash on Thursday April 1, 1993. He was returning from an appearance at the Knoxville Hooters in a Hooters corporate plane on a short flight across Tennessee before the Sunday spring race at Bristol. The plane slowed and crashed just before final approach at Tri-Cities Regional Airport near Blountville. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the crash to the pilot's failure to use the airplane's anti-ice system to clear ice from the engine inlet system. Kulwicki was buried at St. Adalbert's Cemetery in Milwaukee; the funeral was attended by NASCAR President Bill France, Jr. and numerous drivers. Kulwicki's racecar transporter was driven from the rainy track later that Friday morning while other teams and the media watched it travel slowly around the track with a black wreath on its grille. In 2008, Kyle Petty described the slow laps as \\"the saddest thing I've ever seen at a racetrack... We just sat and cried.\\" Kulwicki had competed in five NASCAR races that season with two Top 5 finishes, and was ranked ninth in points at his death. In his career, he had won five NASCAR Winston Cup races, 24 pole positions, 75 Top 10 finishes, and one championship in 207 races. His car was driven by road course specialist Tommy Kendall on road courses and by Jimmy Hensley at the other tracks.

Employers now cannot ask about certain minor or old convictions. Article:","output":"Title: Supreme Court Ruling Supports Privacy of Minor Convictions in Employment Screening Introduction: In a recent Supreme Court case, the justices ruled in favor of a man, identified only as 'T', who was forced to disclose minor cautions to new employers. This decision has significant implications for job seekers and employers, as this ruling now prevents businesses from asking about certain minor or old convictions during the hiring process. Step 1: Present the issue: The issue at the heart of this case involved 'T', who complained that being forced to reveal past cautions to new employers breached his human rights. Before the Supreme Court's ruling, companies could inquire about an applicant's criminal history, regardless of the seriousness or age of the convictions. Step 2: Explain the Supreme Court decision: The Supreme Court's ruling supported a previous Appeal Court decision, backing 'T' in his claim that mandatory disclosure of past offences violated his human rights. Justices acknowledged that while businesses have legitimate reasons to ensure the integrity and safety of their workforce, this should not come at the cost of unfairly stigmatizing individuals with minor offences in their past. Step 3: Detail changes to the employment screening process: As a result of this ruling, employers are now prohibited from inquiring about certain minor or old convictions during the hiring process. This change is driven by the belief that individuals should not be continually punished for past mistakes that have already been paid for, provided they have demonstrated rehabilitation and growth. Step 4: Explain potential benefits for job seekers and employers: This ruling is expected to benefit job seekers who have been held back due to the stigma attached to criminal records, especially among those with minor or old convictions. It also promotes fairness in the job market, as all applicants are now granted an equal opportunity to demonstrate their skills and qualifications without the weight of past mistakes. Moreover, employers can benefit from a more diverse and inclusive workforce. Step 5: Provide a conclusion: In conclusion, the Supreme Court's ruling on the matter of disclosing past offences to new employers has created a more equitable environment in the job market. By preventing companies from asking about minor and old convictions, the court has recognized the importance of granting individuals with criminal records a second chance, protecting their human rights, and demonstrating compassion and understanding for those who have demonstrated personal growth and rehabilitation."},{"instruction":"Objective: To make Spinach Mashed Potato Latkes, Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? OPTIONS: + you need to use hard, steamed cubes of potato. + you need to use soft, steamed cubes of potato.","output":"The more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning would be to use soft, steamed cubes of potato. Here's why: Latkes are essentially shallow-fried pancakes of grated or ground potato, flour, and egg, oftentimes flavored with grated onion or garlic. Traditional latke recipes typically call for raw, grated potatoes. However, as we are considering an alternative with steamed potato here, knowing about the state of the potato before mixing it with the other ingredients makes a big difference. In Option A, where it suggests using hard, steamed cubes of potato, this could result in Latkes that are unevenly cooked. The outside might get cooked and potentially burnt during the frying process before the inside gets fully heated or cooked, as hard cubes of potato take more time and heat to cook fully. Also, it would be difficult to mash these hard cubes into a smooth consistency which is required to make homogeneous latke batter. On the other hand, Option B uses soft, steamed potatoes, which are much more suitable for this recipe. First of all, soft, steamed potatoes can be mashed very easily, resulting in a uniform texture that will cook evenly. Moreover, these potatoes are already pre-cooked, so they will not require much additional heat for internal cooking after being formed into latkes and fried. Being soft and mashable they will mix well with spinach, egg and flour, creating evenly textured latke batter that will result in crisp on the outside and fully cooked on the inside latkes. Therefore, it is more practical and sound to use soft, steamed cubes of potato when making Spinach Mashed Potato Latkes. This ensures the consistency of the mix, reduces the risk of raw or undercooked latkes, and should result in a more pleasant and desirable texture and taste in the final Latkes."},{"instruction":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -7550725 = 67*d - 7553740 for d.","output":"Step 1: Write down the equation -7550725 = 67*d - 7553740 Step 2: Add 7553740 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable d: -7550725 + 7553740 = 67*d - 7553740 + 7553740 Step 3: Simplify both sides of the equation: 3015 = 67*d Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 67 to find the value of d: 3015 / 67 = 67*d / 67 Step 5: Simplify the equation to find the value of d: d = 45 So the solution to the equation is d = 45."},{"instruction":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the is the full name of the character who becomes upset with Mike Waring upon learning that he has informed on Andrews?

While staff at the Colorado Bureau of Investigation continue to track the time manually, the information is no longer readily available to gun dealers. The result is that would-be customers no longer know how long they will have to wait to see if a background check clears. Thousands of customers remain on the wait list at least 100 hours long. And with a major gun show coming to metro Denver this weekend, those expecting to walk away with a new firearm that day may be in for a surprise. The uncharted territory in which the state's gun sellers now find themselves stems from unprecedented interest in guns and CBI's online wait-time clock, which tops out at 99 hours and 59 minutes. Weeks ago, the background-check process took minutes to complete. Now, CBI's processing time has moved beyond that 99-hour-and-59 minute threshold. This news comes as one of Colorado's largest and longest-running gun shows heads into town. The Tanner Gun Show will be held at the Denver Merchandise Mart this weekend. \\"This is new,\\" said Ty Blount, co-owner of the show. \\"The process usually take hours to half a day.\\" Advertisement Blount said the situation means that dealers will either mail a patron's gun or agree to meet them another time once their background check has cleared. While he realizes some may be frustrated by the change, it is important a background check be run on every person attempting to buy a gun, he said. Background checks at gun shows in some other states aren't required — leading to the national call to close the so-called \\"gun show loophole\\" — but in Colorado, that loophole was closed following the Columbine High School shooting. \\"It's the same whether you're going to a gun show or to Cabela's,\\" Blount said. While gun buyers flooded CBI with requests for background checks on Black Friday, the latest surge follows the Dec. 14 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre and an outcry for more stringent gun-control laws. Since that time, the bureau has expanded its hours of operation from 6 a.m. to midnight, said spokeswoman Susan Medina. About 3,000 checks are being submitted a day — \\"these are unprecedented numbers,\\" Medina said on Sunday. For perspective, on Dec. 15, there were 573 background checks for firearm purchases in the CBI queue, Medina said. Wait times were just over 15 minutes. Background checks are cross-referenced through federal and local law-enforcement databases. Checks to be processed will remain in the system until they are approved or denied, Medina said.

Moves Up Its Gun Buyback Program in Wake of the Newtown Shootings Mall parking lots were packed with after-Christmas shoppers. But nowhere were the lines longer than at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and the Van Nuys Masonic Temple, where thousands of people came to exchange their guns for Ralphs gift cards. Cars queued up for blocks at the drive-through events, with the city giving cards worth up to 100 for handguns, shotguns and rifles, and up to 200 for assault weapons. There was a bit of haggling involved, but the guns were all taken. \\"What do you got?\\" an officer in Van Nuys asked a man in his late twenties as he pulled up in a green Mazda. Photos: L.A. gun buyback \\"Just one handgun, I've had it since high school,\\" the man replied. \\"Will you take 50 for this?\\" \\"Sure.\\" Many came bearing more than one gun. They pulled 22 pistols from the trunk of one white Honda, a haul that earned the driver 1,000. Two men in a pickup truck with two children in the back seat handed over a rifle, a pistol and a MAC-12, altered with a silencer. Organizers and some participants credited collective outrage and anguish over the gun rampage in Newtown, Conn., for the turnout. But motivations were often a bit more complicated. \\"That young guy shot up all the kids and they blamed the mama because the mama had the weapons in the house,\\" Valerie Butler said, in explaining why she was waiting in line two hours in South Los Angeles to get rid of an old handgun. Yet Butler, 50, said she was not getting rid of both of her guns. \\"Just one,\\" she said, and laughed. \\"There's a bunch of nuts out here, and they're coming in when you're sleeping. You got to protect yourself.\\" Cities across the nation, grasping for ways to react to a series of mass shootings this year, have organized gun buybacks to get weapons off the street. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa pushed the city's annual event from Mother's Day to Wednesday in reaction to the killing Dec. 14 of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. By the afternoon, the event had already surpassed the 1,673 guns collected last year, and officials were scrambling to get more gift cards, which were donated by Ralphs. Many of the drivers said they were turning in their guns because they rarely used them and were eager to snag grocery cards. \\"If I could get 100 of free groceries, it's worth it,\\" said Charles Edwards, 60, waiting in line next to his old .22 revolver after driving to Los Angeles from Fontana. \\"I wouldn't do it for 40. That's why people are here. They feel bad about all that's happening, but times are tough.\\" He still has a shotgun at home. \\"That's all I need,\\" he said. Edwards said authorities needed to better organize the buyback so the lines weren't so long. He watched numerous people sit in line for a spell, then just drive away, he said. \\"I thought I could just drop this thing off. They need to have this move faster.\\" Most of the weapons recovered were \\"mom and pop guns,\\" police said — hunting rifles, shotguns — but they got a few dozen assault weapons as well. They checked to make sure the guns were empty, and double-checked by pulling the triggers in clearing barrels — metal rubbish containers filled with sand. Then they put them into trash containers like bundles of sticks after a windstorm. \\"I had a question, one after another: 'Do we really need this? Does this really make us safer?' \\" Villaraigosa said at a news conference at the Sports Arena. \\"I say, 'Look, the Police Department is here because they believe in this program.' \\" He said the buyback program had taken in 8,000 guns since it began in 2009 and was just one part of a comprehensive police strategy that has reduced violent crime in recent years. Police Chief Charlie Beck said it was a critical component. One of the first guns collected was a camouflage Bushmaster XM-15, the same kind of gun used at Sandy Hook Elementary. But this was one of the rarities. Loretta, 50, from South Los Angeles was bringing in her great-grandfather's antique rifle — one of them anyway. \\"I got the other well-hidden,\\" she said. Alex Reyes, 47, rode his bike to the Sports Arena from East L.A. with a 68-year-old, six-shot .38 revolver and a .22 target pistol. He said he came in to do \\"a good deed\\" after the Newtown shooting, getting rid of all of his weapons. \\"Just me and Jesus Christ,\\" he said. Sandra Lefall, 38, came to the site with Newtown heavy in her heart. She had been thinking about coming since she first heard the awful news. \\"I'm bringing in a 9-millimeter handgun because I want to get it out of the house because I have teenage children. I would hate for them to do what that guy in Connecticut did.\\" By 2 p.m. in Van Nuys, the police began telling people they were out of gift cards. \\"I'm not giving this away for free,\\" said Sam Ferrell of Reseda as he took a drag of his cigarette in his truck. Ferrell said he was hoping to sell his stepson's handgun. \\"There are too many kids being killed by these things,\\" he said. He said he didn't plan to turn in any of his own guns, but that he was glad his stepson didn't have his. \\"I need my gun, but not everyone who has one needs one,\\" he said. joe.mozingo@latimes.com wesley.lowery@latimes.com ||||| Before 20 small children were massacred at school by a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut, Luke Schuster, 6, was shot to death in New Town, North Dakota.

(Associated Press) Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6, died in a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, while 6-year-old Kammia Perry was slain by her father outside her Cleveland home, according to an Associated Press review of 2012 media reports. Yet there was no gunman on the loose when Julio Segura-McIntosh died in Tacoma, Washington. The 3-year-old accidentally shot himself in the head while playing with a gun he found inside a car. As he mourned with the families of Newtown, President Barack Obama said the U.S. cannot accept such violent deaths of children as routine. But hundreds of young child deaths by gunfire _ whether intentional or accidental _ suggest it might already have. Between 2006 and 2010, 561 children age 12 and under were killed by firearms, according to the FBI's most recent Uniform Crime Reports. The numbers each year are consistent: 120 in 2006; 115 in 2007; 116 in 2008, 114 in 2009 and 96 in 2010. The FBI's count does not include gun-related child deaths that authorities have ruled accidental. \\"This happens on way too regular a basis and it affects families and communities _ not at once, so we don't see it and we don't understand it as part of our national experience,\\" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. The true number of small children who died by gunfire in 2012 will not be known for a couple of years, when official reports are collected and dumped into a database and analyzed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects to release its 2011 count in the spring. In response to what happened in Newtown, the National Rifle Association, the nation's largest gun lobby, suggested shielding children from gun violence by putting an armed police officer in every school by the time classes resume in January. \\"Politicians pass laws for gun-free school zones ... They post signs advertising them and in doing so they tell every insane killer in America that schools are the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk,\\" said NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre. Webster said children are more likely to die by gunfire at home or in the street. They tend to be safer when they are in school, he said. None of the 61 deaths reviewed by The Associated Press happened at school. Children die by many other methods as well: violent stabbings or throat slashings, drowning, beating and strangulation. But the gruesome recounts of gun deaths, sometimes just a few paragraphs in a newspaper or on a website, a few minutes on television or radio, bear witness that firearms too, are cutting short many youngsters' lives. One week before the Newtown slayings, Alyssa Celaya, 8, bled to death after being shot by her father with a .38-caliber gun at the Tule River Indian Reservation in California. Her grandmother and two brothers also were killed, a younger sister and brother were shot and wounded. The father shot and killed himself amid a hail of gunfire from officers. Delric Miller's life ended at 9 months and Angel Mauro Cortez Nava's at 14 months. Delric was in the living room of a home on Detroit's west side Feb. 20 when someone sprayed it with gunfire from an AK-47. Other children in the home at the time were not injured. Angel was cradled in his father's arms on a sidewalk near their home in Los Angeles when a bicyclist rode by on June 4 and opened fire, killing the infant. Most media reports do not include information on the type of gun used, sometimes because police withhold it for investigation purposes. Gun violence and the toll it is taking on children has been an issue raised for years in minority communities. The NAACP, a civil rights group, failed in its attempt to hold gun makers accountable through a lawsuit filed in 1999. Some in the community raised the issue during the campaign and asked Obama after he was re-elected to make reducing gun violence, particularly as a cause of death for young children, part of his second-term agenda. \\"Now that it's clear that no community in this country is invulnerable from gun violence, from its children being stolen ... we can finally have the national conversation we all need to have,\\" said Ben Jealous, president of the NAACP. This year's gun deaths reviewed by the AP show the problem is not confined to the inner city or is simply the result of gang or drug violence, as often is the perception. Faith Ehlen, 22 months, Autumn Cochran, 10, and Alyssa Cochran, 11, all died Sept. 6. Their mother killed them with the shotgun before turning it on herself. Police said she had written a goodbye email to her boyfriend before killing the children in DeSoto, Missouri, a community of about 6,300. In Dundee, Oregon, Randall Engels used a gun to kill his estranged wife Amy Engels and son Jackson, 11, as they ate pizza on the Fourth of July. An older sibling of Jackson's also was killed. Engels then committed suicide. The town of more than 5,000 people boasts on its website that it is a semirural town with \\"the cultural panache of a big city.\\" Many of the children who died in 2012 were shot with guns that belonged to their parents, relatives or baby sitters, or were simply in the home. Webster said children's accidental deaths by guns have fallen since states passed laws requiring that guns be locked away from youths or have safeties to keep them from firing. But even people trained in gun use slip up _ and the mistakes are costly. A Springville, Utah, police officer had a non-service gun in his home that officials said did not have external safeties. His 2-year-old son found the gun and shot himself on Sept. 11. The names of the father and son were not released at the time of the shooting. Obama has tapped Vice President Joe Biden to shape the administration's response to the Newtown massacre. The administration will push to tighten gun laws, many that have faced resistance in Congress for years. The solutions may include reinstating a ban on assault-style rifles, closing gun buying background check loopholes and restricting high-capacity magazines. Those may have limited effect for children like Amari Markel-Purrel Perkins, of Clinton, Maryland. He shot himself in the chest on April 9 with a gun that an adult had stashed inside a Spiderman backpack. Like most of the child victims at Newtown, Amari was 6. ___ Follow Suzanne Gamboa at http://www.twitter.com/APsgamboa Follow Monika Mathur at http://www.twiter.com/@monikamathur ||||| Arizona’s top law enforcement official wants to allow one staffer in each of the state’s schools to carry a gun, a proposal pitched as a “golden mean” between allowing all teachers to carry weapons and doing nothing. Attorney General Tom Horne, a Republican elected in 2010 with the motto “Defending Arizona,” has proposed a voluntary program in which every school could nominate one person to receive free firearms training provided by local sheriffs and the attorney general’s office. The individual would be allowed to keep a weapon in a locked place somewhere on campus. Text Size - + reset “The ideal solution would be to have an armed Police Officer in each school,” Horne said in a statement on Wednesday. “…It may not be possible to afford a Police Officer in every school. In that case, the next best solution is to have one person in the school trained to handle firearms, to handle emergency situations, and possessing a firearm in a secure location. This proposal is analogous to arming pilots on planes.” Republican state lawmakers throughout the country have proposed allowing concealed carry on school grounds or arming some teachers in the wake of the Newtown Massacre, which left 20 children dead at a Connecticut elementary school. But teachers’ unions have aggressively fought such proposals, with two top national unions saying the focus should be on “ways to keep all guns off school property.” The NRA has proposed placing an armed guard in every school in the country. Arizona has some of the nation’s weakest gun laws. It is one of only two states — the other is neighboring Utah — with scores of zero from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. A press release announcing the plan argues it represents a “golden mean” between “doing nothing” and allowing another massacre and arming all teachers, “which could create more dangers than it prevents.” Ariz. House Majority Leader David Gowan will introduce the proposal in the legislature, according to the press release, which also said Horne’s plan had the cooperation of three county sheriffs. Horne previously served as the state’s schools Superintendent from 2003 to 2011. ||||| Classroom teachers could stop school shootings by carrying concealed weapons, say gun-rights advocates who plan to offer the required training Thursday for 200 Utah teachers. The Utah Shooting Sports Council said it would waive its 50 fee for concealed-weapons training for the teachers. Instruction featuring plastic guns is set to begin at noon Thursday inside a conference room at Maverick Center, a hockey arena in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Valley. It's an idea gaining traction in the aftermath of the Connecticut school shooting. In Ohio, the Buckeye Firearms Association said it was launching a test program in tactical firearms training for 24 teachers initially. \\"Schools are some of the safest places in the world, but I think teachers understand that something has changed _ the sanctity of schools has changed,\\" said Clark Aposhian, one of Utah's leading gun instructors. \\"Mass shootings may still be rare, but that doesn't help you when the monster comes in.\\" Gun-rights advocates say teachers can act more quickly than law enforcement in the critical first few minutes to protect children from the kind of shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. In Arizona, Attorney General Tom Horne has proposed amending state law to allow one educator in each school to carry a gun. Educators say Utah legislators left them with no choice but to accept some guns in schools. State law forbids schools, districts or college campuses from trying to impose their own gun restrictions. \\"We're not suggesting that teachers roam the halls\\" for an armed intruder, said Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state's leading gun lobby. \\"They should lock down the classroom. But a gun is one more option if the shooter\\" breaks into a classroom. A major emphasis of the safety training is that people facing deadly threats should announce they have a gun and retreat or take cover before trying to shoot, he said. Utah is among few states that let people carry licensed concealed weapons into public schools without exception, the National Conference of State Legislatures says in a 2012 compendium of state gun laws. Utah educators say they would ban guns if they could and have no way of knowing how many teachers are armed. Gun-rights advocates estimate that 1 percent of Utah teachers or 240 are licensed to carry concealed weapons. It's not known how many pack guns at school. \\"It's a terrible idea,\\" said Carol Lear, a chief lawyer for the Utah Office of Education, who argues teachers could be overpowered for their guns or misfire or cause an accidental shooting. \\"It's a horrible, terrible, no-good, rotten idea.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"The rush to purchase firearms in Colorado has overwhelmed the system used to track background check wait times, leaving thousands of potential gun buyers on wait-lists that are now several days long.

Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

In Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent.

Acting as oral historians, they play a significant role in preserving and conveying the cultural heritage, history, and traditions of their communities through generations. The griot that sings the epic is the individual responsible for narrating significant historical and cultural events, legends, and stories within a West African community, using a unique combination of music, poetry, and oral tradition. Traditionally, griots are highly-trained artists who have devoted their lives to preserving the history and values of their people. They come from families and clans dedicated to the griot tradition, which is passed down through generations. The training begins at an early age, and it may take several years for an aspiring griot to master the complex systems of oral history, song, and musical instruments. The griot who sings the epic employs various instruments to accompany their storytelling. Some of the most common instruments include the kora (a 21-stringed harp-lute), the balafon (a wooden xylophone), and the ngoni (a lute-like stringed instrument). Some griots also use their voice alone, relying on the power of their words and the rhythm and cadence of their speech to keep their listeners engaged. Griots are crucial to the transmission of cultural heritage and help maintain social cohesion in West African societies. Epics are often rooted in historical events, featuring important political and social themes that resonate with the audience. These stories often serve as a reminder of the values and moral code that the society upholds. Among the most famous griots who have sung epics, we can find griots in the Mali Empire, who are responsible for the well-known African epic \\"Sundiata Keita\\" or the \\"Epic of Sundiata.\\" It tells the story of Sundiata Keita, who founded the Mali Empire in the 13th century and is considered one of West Africa's greatest leaders. Griotte Tata Bambara is another popular Malian griot known for her vibrant storytelling. Another example is the Senegalese griot, Ndiaga Mbaye, who not only narrated historical events but also became known as a modern griot who would perform at political events. His story recounts the tale of a young, heroic hunter who eventually becomes the ruler of his people. In conclusion, the griot that sings the epic is a respected oral historian, storyteller, poet, and musician in West African communities. They preserve and pass on important cultural knowledge, historical accounts, and societal values through their storytelling. Many of these epic stories emphasize moral values, courage, and tenacity and serve as a foundation for the communities' cultural identity and social cohesion. The legacy of griots continues, and their narratives remain an essential part of the oral tradition, connecting past and present generations through the power of storytelling and music."},{"instruction":"Single/multi-select question: Is it possible to conclude that \\"Two old men, one in yellow shirt, one in red, on park benches.\\" if \\"Two men at the park\\"?

Little is known about De Ruyter's early life, but he probably became a sailor at the age of 11. It is said that once, when he was a child, he climbed up ladders to get to the roof of his home town's church. Not knowing that De Ruyter was there, some workers then removed the ladders. In July 1655, De Ruyter took command of a squadron of eight (of which the Tijdverdrijf [Pastime] was his flagship) and set out for the Mediterranean with 55 merchantmen in convoy. His orders were to protect Dutch trade. Meeting an English fleet under Robert Blake along the way, he managed to avoid an incident. Operating off the Barbary Coast, he captured several infamous corsairs. After negotiating a peace agreement with Sale, De Ruyter returned home May 1656. The same month, the States General, becoming ever more wary of Swedish King Charles X and his expansion plans, decided to intervene in the Northern Wars by sending a fleet to the Baltic Sea. The Swedes controlled this area after Charles had invaded Poland and made himself king there. De Ruyter once again embarked aboard the Tijdverdrijf, arriving at the Oresund 8 June; there he waited for Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam to arrive. After Obdam had assumed command, De Ruyter and the Dutch fleet sailed to relieve the besieged city of Danzig/Gdansk on 27 July, without any bloodshed. Peace was signed a month later. Before leaving the Baltic, De Ruyter and other flag officers were granted an audience by Frederick III of Denmark. De Ruyter took a liking to the Danish king, who later became a friend. In 1658, the States General, on the advice of a leading member (Cornelis de Graeff, one of the mayors of Amsterdam), decided to once again send a fleet to the Baltic Sea to protect the important Baltic trade and to aid the Danes against Swedish aggression, which continued despite a peace settlement. In accordance with the States' balance-of-power political approach, a fleet under Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam was sent, without De Ruyter, who at the time was blockading Lisbon. On 8 November, a bloody melee took place, the Battle of the Sound, which resulted in a Dutch victory, relieving Copenhagen. Still the Swedes were far from defeated and the States decided to continue their support. De Ruyter took command of a new expeditionary fleet and managed to liberate Nyborg in 1659. For this, he was knighted by King Frederick III of Denmark From 1661 until 1663, de Ruyter did convoy duty in the Mediterranean.

The quality of the finish adds tremendously to the longevity and aesthetic appeal of the wood. Here are some of the commonly used methods: 1. **Sanding the Surface**: Sanding down the surface of the wood before applying finish helps to smooth out any rough spots and opens up the pores of the wood, making it easier for the finish to penetrate evenly. Using multiple grades of sandpaper, from coarse to fine, ensures a smooth surface. After each round of sanding, it's advisable to wipe down the wood with a damp cloth to remove any dust or debris that may affect the finish. 2. **Applying Pre-Stain Wood Conditioner**: A pre-stain conditioner prepares the wood to better accept the stain. It's especially useful when working with soft or porous woods that might otherwise absorb the stain unevenly. The conditioner is applied before the stain, allowed to dry, and then lightly sanded. 3. **Applying the Wood Finish**: There are several types of finishes you can apply including oil-based finishes, water-based finishes, lacquer, shellac, and varnish. Each type has a different method of application like wiping, brushing, or spraying, and requires proper ventilation while applying. 4. **Buffing Between Coats**: Between coats of finish, especially when using a slow-drying oil-based finish, it may be beneficial to lightly buff the surface with very fine steel wool or sandpaper. This helps to remove any dust particles and ensures a smooth surface for the next coat. Be sure to wipe away any residue before applying the next coat. 5. **Maintaining Temperature and Humidity**: The temperature and humidity in the room can affect how well the finish soaks into the wood. Dry, warm conditions are typically better for applying finish, as they help the finish dry more quickly and evenly. However, extremely hot or cold temperatures could affect the drying time and final result. It's important to always be patient when applying finish to wood, allowing each layer to dry fully before applying the next. In order to achieve the best possible result, it may be necessary to apply several coats of finish, buffing the surface between each coat. While all the methods are commonly used and are reasonable depending on the type of wood and the desired result, the best option to ensure the finish soaks into the wood adequately would likely be a combination of them all. That is, starting with a well-sanded surface, using a pre-stain conditioner if the wood is soft or porous, applying the chosen finish correctly, buffing between coats, and controlling the room's temperature and humidity."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A man throws a green frisbee under a tree.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A man is throwing a frisbee to his dog.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

To answer, we'll need to examine the claim and relate it to common human knowledge about the terms given. 3. 'Grilling' and 'roasting' are commonly used as cooking methods, where food is exposed to high heat, resulting in a tasty and browned exterior. 4. In a metaphorical context, people sometimes use these terms to describe harsh criticism or ridicule. For example, someone might say, \\"I was grilled at the meeting,\\" meaning they were intensely questioned or criticized. 5. Common human sense would indicate that the claim is a metaphorical comparison, not intended to be taken literally. 6.

Some random reasoning:","output":"To answer this question, we need to find the number of possible rearrangements of the letters in the word \\"AIM\\". We can do this by calculating the permutations of the word. A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. In this case, we have 3 distinct letters (A, I, and M), so the total number of permutations can be found using the following formula: Permutations = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!) Where: n = total number of objects (in this case, letters) n1, n2, ... , nk = the number of times a specific object (letter) appears ! (factorial) indicates the product of all positive integers up to that number For the word \\"AIM\\", n = 3, since there are 3 different letters. Each of these letters (i.e., A, I, and M) appears only once, so n1 = n2 = n3 = 1, resulting in: Permutations = 3! / (1! * 1! * 1!) Now, let's calculate the factorials: 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 1! = 1 So, substituting the factorials back into the formula gives us: Permutations = 6 / (1 * 1 * 1) = 6 Thus, there are 6 different ways to rearrange the letters of the word \\"AIM\\".

In most cases, this would mean that she would be living with your sibling (i.e., her parent, who is your brother or sister) and their spouse, if applicable. Looking at this from the perspective of the options provided: 1. Family reunion: A family reunion is an event where members of an extended family come together to celebrate their relationships and make lasting memories. Your niece would certainly be a part of family reunions, but this isn't where she would typically live. Family reunions are special occasions, not permanent living arrangements. 2. Adoption: Adoption is a process where a child legally becomes a part of a new family, with parental rights and responsibilities being transferred from the birth parents to the adoptive parents. Unless your niece has been adopted by another family, this isn't directly relevant to her living situation. 3. Family tree: A family tree is a diagram that represents the relationships between members of a family across multiple generations. Your niece would be represented in your family tree as a child of your brother or sister, but this doesn't provide specific information about where she lives. 4. Brother's house: If your niece is the child of your brother, then she would most likely live in her father's (your brother's) house along with her mother and any siblings. In this case, the brother's house would indeed be the place where your niece lives. 5. Family picture book: A family picture book is a collection of photographs that capture memories and moments shared by family members. While your niece may be prominently featured in a family picture book, this does not provide any concrete information about where she would live. In conclusion, the best answer in this case would be the brother's house. If your niece is the child of your brother, she would most likely live with her immediate family – her father (your brother) and her mother – in their home. This provides the most logical and accurate context for her living situation as a child, although various factors such as custody arrangements or unique family dynamics could potentially lead to other living arrangements."},{"instruction":"In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Two countries used different methods to produce their energy. Albania used fossil fuels, while Croatia used Nuclear fission. Which country caused more acid rain?","output":"Based on the information provided, we can determine that Albania, which used fossil fuels to produce energy, likely caused more acid rain than Croatia, which used nuclear fission. Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are known to release various pollutants into the atmosphere when burned to generate electricity. One of the primary pollutants emitted is sulfur dioxide (SO2). When sulfur dioxide combines with water vapor and other substances in the atmosphere, it forms sulfuric acid, a primary component of acid rain. Acid rain can have numerous harmful effects on ecosystems, soil, and water sources. On the other hand, nuclear fission is a relatively clean process in terms of air pollution and acid rain. Nuclear power plants do not emit sulfur dioxide or other harmful substances that would contribute to the formation of acid rain. Instead, they produce electricity by splitting the nucleus of radioactive elements, such as uranium or plutonium. While nuclear fission does produce radioactive waste, which presents its own set of environmental and health concerns, it does not directly contribute to acid rain. As a result, we can deduce that Albania, which relied on fossil fuels to meet its energy needs, likely caused more acid rain than Croatia, which utilized nuclear fission for energy production."},{"instruction":"Q: Internal resistance, or (electrical) resistance in general, involves the resistance of the flow of what?

Here, make sure that the changes are semantically related and syntactically similar to the input. And the generated sentence should have high commonsense plausibility, that is to have reasonable probability of it being true. Problem:Если вы хотите восстановить свою внешность, вам нужно порезать стиль. Solution:","output":"Part #1: Given a sentence in Russian Usage: \\"Если вы хотите восстановить свою внешность, вам нужно порезать стиль.\\" This is a sentence in Russian that discusses the need to change one's style to improve their appearance. It meets the criteria since it is a complete thought expressed in the Russian language. Part #2: Generate a new Russian sentence by performing small changes Usage: \\"Если вы хотите улучшить свою внешность, вам стоит изменить стиль.\\" Here, the input sentence has been slightly altered to convey the same meaning with different words, changing \\"восстановить\\" to \\"улучшить\\" and \\"порезать\\" to \\"изменить\\". These replacements preserve the message of the input sentence while changing its form. Part #3: Changes are semantically related and syntactically similar to the input Usage: In the suggested sentence, \\"улучшить\\" is semantically related to \\"восстановить\\" as both imply improving one's appearance. Similarly, \\"изменить\\" is also related to \\"порезать\\" as both denote change, although in a different context. These changes reflect the original sentence's structure and meaning while ensuring that they are different enough to be considered as a new sentence. Part #4: The generated sentence should have high commonsense plausibility Usage: The generated sentence, \\"Если вы хотите улучшить свою внешность, вам стоит изменить стиль\\", conveys the message that if a person wants to enhance their appearance, they should consider changing their style. This statement is highly plausible, based on common sense, as changing one's style can realistically make a person more attractive or improve their overall appearance."},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: Secondly, the obligation imposed on Ukraine to abolish the death penalty leaves me baffled when we know that in Belgium, for example, capital punishment - recently removed from the penal code - can still be used on innocent children by monsters like Dutroux.","output":"Toiseksi, Ukrainalle asetettu velvoite poistaa kuolemanrangaistus hämmentää minua, sillä tiedämme, että esimerkiksi Belgiassa, pääomaan rangaistus - joka on äskettäin poistettu rikoslaista - voidaan edelleen soveltaa viattomiin lapsiin hirviöiden, kuten Dutrouxin, toimesta. Tässä tekstissä esitetty kanta tuo esiin epäjohdonmukaisuuksia Euroopan unionin sisällä kuolemanrangaistuksen käsittelyssä. Vaikka kuolemanrangaistus on poistettu useimpien EU-maiden lainsäädännöstä, kuten myös Belgialaista rikoslakia, viime aikojen tapahtumat osoittavat, että rikolliset, kuten Dutroux, voivat käyttää tällaisia rangaistuksia viattomille lapsille, jotka ovat heidän uhrejaan. Tämä tuo esiin väistämättömän kysymyksen: miksi kuolemanrangaistuksen poistamista vaaditaan tietyiltä mailta, kuten Ukrainalta, samalla kun on olemassa EU-jäsenmaita, joissa tällainen rangaistus on mahdollista edelleen soveltaa epäsuorasti? Tämä kysymys ja koko tilanne voidaan kokea erityisen hämmentävänä ja paradoksaalisena, koska EU perustana toimii tasa-arvoon ja yleisiin arvoihin pohjautuviin periaatteisiin. Tämän vuoksi voi olla perusteltua kysyä, tulisiko EU:n yhtenäistää sen kuolemanrangaistusta koskeva politiikka koko unionissa, sen sijaan, että se vaatii vain tietyiltä jäseniltä tai uusilta jäseniltä toimia tähän suuntaan. Perustavanlaatuinen haaste kuolemanrangaistuksen käytön poistamiseen liittyen on löytää tasapaino julkisen turvallisuuden ja yhteiskunnan suojelemisen välillä. Keskiössä on myös kysymys: missä tilanteissa, jos koskaan, valtion on oikeutettua ottaa pois ihmisen henki? Tämä kysymys on syvästi moraalinen ja eettinen, ja vastaukset siihen vaihtelevat maittain ja kulttuurien välillä. Yhteenvetona voi todeta, että kysymys kuolemanrangaistuksen käytöstä on monimutkainen ja aiheuttaa epävarmuutta ja hämmennystä eri maissa, kuten esimerkiksi Ukrainassa ja Belgiassa. EU:n tulevaisuuden kannalta saattaa olla tärkeää käsitellä tätä aihetta kattavasti ja pyrkiä ehkä yhteisiin lähestymistapoihin ja linjauksiin kaikkien jäsenmaiden välillä."},{"instruction":"Výbor, pomyslel si Sten.

The reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support. In some places it actually owes more to Death Wish than the original Dirty Harry film. One might argue if that is so- at the end of the day it's a film about guilt, justice and retribution. For me, at the end of the day it's more empathy than sympathy. However, in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film. Forget the \\"Go ahead punk, make my day scene\\", that's iconic but not original. But look at the views of San Fransisco taken from the air, zooming in on the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where Sondra Locke's character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital. Eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces. So all in all Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood is as a director. And if I remember correctly it was actually the first time Eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology. Also, I think this is the first well paced film Eastwood directed. Although Eastwood has enormous talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy etc.) Thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive.

The Commission has rules that everyone needs to follow, so no one can be a big bully and beat up other smaller kids. One of the main rules is to stop companies from working together in secret to hurt others. It's like telling kids not to join hands and block the way so no one else can pass. Another rule is to help smaller kids have a chance to play, even if there are big kids with many toys who want everything for themselves. This is called controlling mergers.

Re-population of the recently vacated Arab dwellings by Jews had been official policy since at least December 1948, but the process began slowly. The Israeli national plan of June 1949 designated al-Majdal as the site for a regional Urban area of 20,000 people. From July 1949, new immigrants and demobilization soldiers moved to the new town, increasing the Jewish population to 2,500 within six months. These early immigrants were mostly from Yemen, North Africa, and Europe. During 1949, the town was renamed Migdal Gaza, and then Migdal Gad. Soon afterwards it became Migdal Ashkelon. The city began to expand as the population grew. In 1951, the neighborhood of Afridar was established for Jewish immigrants from South Africa, and in 1953 it was incorporated into the city. The current name Ashkelon was adopted and the town was granted Local council (Israel) status in 1953. In 1955, Ashkelon had more than 16,000 residents. By 1961, Ashkelon ranked 18th among Israeli urban centers with a population of 24,000. This grew to 43,000 in 1972 and 53,000 in 1983. In 2005, the population was more than 106,000.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Let's break down the information step-by-step and then add their ages together. 1. Beckett is 12 years old and three years younger than Olaf. This means, Olaf is 12 years + 3 years = 15 years old. 2. Shannen is two years younger than Olaf. Since Olaf is 15 years old, Shannen is 15 years - 2 years = 13 years old. 3. Jack is five more than twice as old as Shannen. Shannen is 13 years old, so twice her age is 13 years x 2 = 26 years. Therefore, Jack is 26 years + 5 years = 31 years old. Now, let's sum up the ages of all four people: Beckett (12 years) + Olaf (15 years) + Shannen (13 years) + Jack (31 years) = 71 years So, the sum of the ages of all 4 people is 71 years."},{"instruction":"What is the answer: What country was never defeated during its participation in the FIFA World Cup tournament in South Africa in 2010?","output":"The country that was never defeated during its participation in the FIFA World Cup tournament in South Africa in 2010 is the New Zealand national football team, also known as the \\"All Whites.\\" New Zealand's performance during the 2010 FIFA World Cup was quite remarkable, considering that they were ranked 78th in the world at the time and had only qualified for one previous World Cup in 1982. They were placed in Group F, along with Italy, Paraguay, and Slovakia. New Zealand's first match was against Slovakia on June 15, 2010. The match ended in a 1-1 draw, with Slovakia taking the lead in the 50th minute through a goal by Robert Vittek. However, New Zealand equalized in stoppage time with a goal from Winston Reid. This crucial point on their debut match in the 2010 FIFA World Cup boosted the team's morale for the upcoming games. Their second match was against Italy, the defending world champions at the time, on June 20, 2010. New Zealand managed to secure another draw, tying the match at 1-1. New Zealand's Shane Smeltz scored an early goal in the 7th minute. Italy later equalized through a penalty scored by Vincenzo Iaquinta in the 29th minute. The All Whites were able to withstand Italy's attacks, earning another point in the group stage. Finally, New Zealand faced Paraguay on June 24, 2010, in their last group stage match. The game ended in a 0-0 draw, making New Zealand become the only team to remain unbeaten in the tournament. Despite this great achievement, their three draws were insufficient to help them advance to the Round of 16, as they finished third in their group behind Paraguay and Italy. It is worth noting that the All Whites' undefeated run in the 2010 FIFA World Cup was an exceptional performance by the team, raising their international profile and earning them respect from football fans around the globe. New Zealand's achievement also highlights the unpredictable nature of football, as a team ranked much lower than its opponents managed to hold its own against more celebrated footballing nations."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff.

A plant dies: Increased sediment has no direct or indirect impact on this step. 2. The remains of the plant are buried very fast in sediment: Increased sediment in the environment could potentially lead to faster burial of the plant remains. This is a direct impact on this step of the process. 3. The soft parts of the plant decay: More sediment may slow down the decay of the soft parts as it may limit the access of decomposers to the plant remains, but it also provides an anaerobic environment which slows down decomposition. This is an indirect impact on this step of the process. 4. The hard parts of the plant are replaced with minerals: Increased sediment will not have any impact on this step of the process. 5. The sediment turns into rock: Increased sediment in the environment could lead to the formation of more layers of rock, but it does not directly impact this step of the process. 6. The rock erodes: Increased sediment doesn't impact this step directly; however, more layers of rock could potentially result in a longer time for erosion to occur and reach the fossil within. 7. The fossil appears on the surface of the ground: Increased sediment doesn't directly impact this step, but the changes in erosion and the additional layers of rock would cause the fossil to appear on the surface later.

However, there is no direct information regarding the emotional state (i.e., being livid) of that group. It does mention that a glib-tongued scoundrel comes along, but that doesn't automatically imply that the group the speaker guarded her from was livid.

Follow the lines that you made before you put the mortar on the wall. Rock the tile up and down slightly to help it move into place along the mortar. You may need to use a grout float to flatten the tile. You can purchase this simple tool in many home centers. You are going to have to cut extra tile pieces if there is space left between the top tile row and kitchen cabinets. You don’t want the tiles to sit directly on the countertop. Leave a small gap that you will caulk later. Use plastic tile spacers to create even grout lines by placing them in the corners of the tiles.. If you are left with a gap that is less than an inch, you might want to use moulding to hide it rather than trying to cut tile to fit. You will want to make sure the mortar or mastic and the tile are completely dry before doing anything further to the wall. It can take as long as 24 hours for backsplash tile to dry, depending on the type of mortar or mastic you use and the temperature inside your home. You could use pre-sealer on natural stone. This will help the stone avoid staining. Once dry, wipe the tiles clean with water. Use a soft cloth to do so. You want to clean the tiles in this manner before you move onto applying the grout. It’s time to complete the backsplash by applying grout to the tiles. Many people use poly-blend sanded grout for kitchen backsplashes. You can use caulk or silicone sealant to fill any expansion gaps between the tiles and counter or cabinets. Use a grout float to fill the joints. Push the grout at a 45-degree angle with the grout float. Scrape away extra grout when the joints are filled. Hold the gloat a a nearly 90-degree angle to scrape it off. Shape and firm up the grout by dragging in instrument across every joint. Use the edge of the grout float, a toothbrush handle end, or even a finger. Use a damp sponge to wipe away excess grout. Fill a bucket with the amount of water recommended on the grout packaging. Add the grout powder and mix together. Use unsanded grout if the gaps are less than 1/8 of an inch. Let the mixture stand for 5-10 minutes and then mix again. Apply the grout with a grout float tool at a 45-degree angle, working diagonally and wiping off any excess grout. Work in sections. The grout goes in between the tile. This is the final step in creating a tile backsplash. You will want to seal the tile so that it doesn’t easily stain. Wait until the grout dries completely. This can take over a day and sometimes as much as three days. Apply grout sealant. After the grout has dried, put sealant on the lines and joints. Some sealant comes in a spray-on bottle, and other sealant is applied with a sponge or brush. Start at an end tile, and spread a uniform coating of sealant over all of the grout, including in the corners. Wipe away any excess sealant with a rag. Let the sealant dry for about an hour, and apply a second coat. Let that dry. Put your appliances and cookware back on the counter.

What might be the first step of the process?","output":"The first step of the process would be \\"A person talks\\". Here's why: The steps given seem to represent two different processes - the process of respiration (oxygen moving from the lungs into the bloodstream and air being pushed out of the lungs into the environment) and the process of speech (air pushed through the vocal chords leading to a person talking). However, for a person to talk, respiration needs to occur first to provide the necessary oxygen for the process. This makes it seem like respiration should be the first step, but if we consider that the question is asking about the process of speech specifically and not about the preliminary needs of the body for that process, then \\"A person talks\\" becomes the logical first step. In the context of speech, the process begins when a person decides to talk. This decision triggers the body to push air through the vocal chords, creating vibrations that are transformed into sound and thus, speech happens. Then, as a part of the respiratory process, other air is pushed out of the lungs and into the environment and the cycle repeats. So in this context, the first step of the process is \\"A person talks\\"."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: Greece, capital, Athens.

More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. Paragraph: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B. Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would sample B rocks have more or less chemical reactions? A:","output":"Sample B rocks would have less chemical reactions. This is because the Atacama Desert has one of the lowest rainfall levels in the world, which means less rainwater passes through the soil and reacts chemically with the particles. In contrast, the high rainfall in the Amazon Rainforest increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions."},{"instruction":"Select from the following. (A). excited to be free (B). depressed about losing her father (C). happy about what Jan did Given those answer options, answer the question: I heard that Jan killed Alex's father because he had been having an affair for years. And I was wondering How would Alex feel after? A:","output":"It is important to consider the context and the relationships between the individuals involved to determine a possible reaction from Alex about Jan killing her father due to the affair situation. Given the provided information, I will elaborate on the three suggested emotions. A) Excited to be free: If Alex had been aware of her father's long-standing affair, she might have felt constrained or burdened by the knowledge, especially if it caused tension or unhappiness within the family. In this case, it's possible that Alex feels a sense of relief and excitement because the situation has come to a resolution, albeit a tragic one. She might believe that her father got what he deserved and that her family can now find peace. However, excitement might be tempered by any lingering feelings of guilt or sadness for celebrating what could be perceived as a silver lining in a violent outcome. B) Depressed about losing her father: Regardless of her father's infidelity, Alex might still be devastated by his death. The loss of a parent can be a life-altering event and provoke a deep sense of grief and depression. In this context, Alex could be struggling with conflicting emotions, feeling angry and betrayed by her father's actions while also mourning his death and feeling overwhelmed by the void left in her life. This conflicting emotional state might exacerbate her initial depression, making it very difficult for her to process the situation and come to terms with her loss. C) Happy about what Jan did: Assuming that Alex was close to Jan and was aware of the affair, she could potentially feel a twisted sense of gratitude toward Jan for removing the source of the family's pain and betrayal. Emotionally, this could manifest as happiness, a feeling that justice has been served, and some level of satisfaction that the family's ordeal has come to an end. However, it is important to consider that even if Alex initially feels some happiness about the situation, complex emotions surrounding the loss of her father and the violence could still emerge and affect her in the long term. Overall, Alex's emotions after learning about Jan killing her father would likely be a complex mix of the emotions listed above, along with others specific to her past relationship with her father and how she personally processes the events. It is important to remember that people's emotional reactions to such situations can be highly nuanced, complex, and influenced by numerous factors that may not be immediately apparent."},{"instruction":"Q:I first experienced a loss of sexual desire several years ago, just after I turned 40.

Woods, 37, won the last of his 14 major titles back in 2008, but this year returned to world No.1 after replacing Rory McIlroy at the top of the rankings. There were 14 editions of the video game bearing his name, which was played by millions of golf fans across the world. Writing on EA's official website, the company's vice-president and general manager Daryl Holt commented: \\"EA Sports and Tiger Woods have made a mutual decision to end our partnership, which includes Tiger's named PGA Tour golf game. We've always been big fans of Tiger and we wish him continued success in all his future endeavors. \\"EA Sports golf fans have always loved authentic courses and players, but they've also asked for more choice and customization in how and where they play.\\" EA had previously stuck with Woods through his acrimonious divorce in August 2010 at a time where several other sponsors severed ties with the American. Gatorade, AT&T and Accenture and Tag Heuer all withdrew sponsorship or did not renew their deals following the revelations of Woods' infidelity and subsequent divorce from Elin Nordegren -- costing him 20 million in earnings. From the endorsements he held in 2009, just two remain: Nike, which teamed up with Woods when he turned professional in 1996; and NetJets, a plane ownership-sharing company. \\"For most mortal sportsmen, losing the EA deal would constitute a real body blow. At an estimated 6.2 million a year, it's a very significant chunk of change,\\" Sami McCabe, CEO of Clarity PR, told CNN. \\"However, Tiger Woods is in a unique category in terms of earning potential from sponsorship deals -- particularly from his sportswear sponsor Nike, which ensures he dwarfs the majority of his peers -- in any sport. \\"So I don't see this news being a source of sleepless nights from a financial perspective. However, it might be the cause of concern for the longevity and sustainability of 'Brand Tiger.' \\" According to market tracking company NPD Group, EA sold 771 million worth of games boasting the Tiger Woods name. DFC Intelligence, a consulting firm which deals with the gaming market, states that EA made 3.79 billion last year -- with its Battlefield and Madden NFL games the top sellers. But while the loss of the EA partnership should not cause major damage to the Woods brand, McCabe does believe the move remains significant. \\"Losing a marquee sponsorship deal says two things: first, he's no longer the force he once was on the golf course; and secondly, EA will no doubt be replacing him with someone else,\\" he said. \\"Rory McIlroy would seem the most obvious choice -- assuming his form picks up. So this might be perceived as the first major step in a changing of the guard. \\"Losing EA Games won't make much of a dent on Tiger's bank balance, but it does make a dent on his ubiquity. \\"And that ubiquity is the single biggest reason why he's able to command such astronomical sponsorship deals. \\"That said, a couple of major wins would surely turn the tide back in his favor.\\" EA started making golf simulation games back in 1990, with PGA Tour golf coming out on PC, Amiga and the Sega Megadrive. In 1998 it produced the \\"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 99\\" which became a huge hit on Playstation and blazed the trail for further success. But in recent years EA has begun to take a step back, with the 2010 cover of the game the first to feature another golfer alongside Woods -- Northern Ireland's rising star McIlroy. A few months later on a newer version it simply showed Augusta, home of the Masters, with no trace of Woods on the cover. Rickie Fowler joined Woods on the front of \\"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13\\" in the U.S., while Arnold Palmer was used in the latest version.","output":"1. EA Sports ends its association with golfer Tiger Woods, whose name appeared on 14 editions of PGA Tour golf video games. 2. Woods returned to the world No.1 spot earlier this year while several other sponsors severed ties with him in 2010 due to his infamous divorce scandal. 3. EA Sports remained supportive of Woods during difficult times, making their separation a notable event. 4. The company made 771 million from Tiger Woods-themed games, while Woods reportedly earned 6.2 million a year from the endorsement deal. 5.

She finds a boat and joins the escape. The boat capsizes early on and Pilar is bitten by a snake. Max kills Bowdre and Pilar dies of the snakebite. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose parents deaths were being avenged?, what is it ? A:","output":"The full name of the person whose parents' deaths were being avenged in the article is Max Sand. He embarked on a journey to avenge the death of his white father and Indian mother who were brutally killed by a trio of outlaws. These outlaws were Bill Bowdre, Jesse Coe, and Tom Fitch. After their brutal act, the outlaws also stole the grey horse with a double SS brand belonging to Max's father. This horse served as a major clue to Max in his vengeful journey as he trailed the outlaws who had separated after their crime. During his journey, Max came across an old, rusty gun that was, however, not loaded and thus useless. His path crossed with a traveling gunsmith named Jonas Cord, Sr, whom he initially intended to rob. Cord, quickly noticing the situation with Max's gun, managed to bring Max to reason, and upon hearing Max's turmoil and his vengeful pursuit, took him in and nurtured him back to health, while teaching him how to shoot. Max's journey continued as he tracked down Jesse Coe to Abilene, Texas where he, with the help of a dancehall girl named Neesa from the same tribe as his mother, managed to confront Coe. Even though Coe initially escaped and a knife fight ensued between the two, Max ended up mortally wounding Coe. However, in this fight, Max himself was severely injured but was taken care of by Neesa, and the two developed a romantic relationship. After recovering, Max, in his consistent pursuit of revenge, left Neesa and learned about Bowdre's presence in a prison camp in Louisiana. He strategically committed a bank robbery and got caught on purpose just so he could be sent to the same prison where Bowdre was incarcerated. Bowdre didn't recognize Max and was unaware of Max's plan to escape and kill him in the swamp. In prison, Max found comfort in Pilar, a local Cajun girl. Despite knowing nothing about Max's plans, Pilar helped in their escape attempt that led to Bowdre's death and, unfortunately, her own death due to a snakebite. Max was thus successful in his pursuit to avenge his parents' death by killing the outlaws responsible."},{"instruction":"Q:Process: - Open the Dishwasher - Slide out the bottom rack - Take a dirty plate - Rinse the plate - Place the dish in the rack - Repeat leaving enough space for water to reach all items - Fill the soap cup - Turn on the dishwasher. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less exercise occurs happens, how will it affect Overfilling dish rack with more dishes. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this scenario suggests that if less exercise occurs, it may lead to overfilling the dish rack with more dishes. First, let's analyze the original process and then discuss how the hypothesis affects it, either directly or indirectly. The original process involves the following steps: 1. Open the dishwasher. 2. Slide out the bottom rack. 3. Take a dirty plate. 4. Rinse the plate. 5. Place the dish in the rack. 6. Repeat the process, leaving enough space for water to reach all items. 7. Fill the soap cup. 8. Turn on the dishwasher. Now, let's examine the perturbation hypothesis. If less exercise occurs, it might lead to overfilling the dish rack as people may become lazy or more forgetful about following the proper process and may want to complete the task quickly. Less exercise can also cause a decrease in physical stamina and focus, leading to errors while performing tasks. Direct effects of the perturbation hypothesis on the process may include: - Skipping or not paying attention to step 6 (leaving enough space for water to reach all items), which can result in overfilling the dish rack. - Placing larger or inappropriate items in the dishwasher due to negligence, which can obstruct water from reaching all dishes. Indirect effects of the perturbation hypothesis on the process may include: - Decreased energy levels and mental focus could lead to errors in measuring the right amount of soap in step 7, thereby affecting the cleaning efficiency or even causing damage to the dishwasher. - Increased likelihood of forgetting to turn on the dishwasher in step 8, leading to dishes not being properly cleaned. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggesting that less exercise can lead to overfilling the dish rack has both direct and indirect effects on the dishwashing process. This emphasizes the importance of remaining physically and mentally active to maintain optimal performance while carrying out everyday tasks."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film.

The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), one of the asylum's orderlies, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. At the moment she is lobotomized, Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster.

Answer:","output":"Can't answer"},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: BUtterfield 8 is a 1960 drama film directed by Daniel Mann, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Harvey. Taylor won her first Academy Award for her performance in a leading role. The film was based on a 1935 novel written by John O'Hara in the wake of the success of his critically acclaimed \\"Appointment in Samarra\\". Sentence: BUtterfield 8 has cursing.","output":"To determine the truth of the sentence \\"BUtterfield 8 has cursing,\\" we must first analyze the film's content and context. Since BUtterfield 8 is a 1960 drama film, we need to understand the censorship and filmmaking standards during that era. In the 1960s, the Motion Picture Production Code, also known as the Hays Code, governed the content of American films. This strict code aimed to ensure that movies followed a particular moral and ethical code, avoiding explicit content, including the use of curse words. Considering the era in which BUtterfield 8 was produced, it is less likely that the film contains cursing, as it had to adhere to the Hays Code's regulations. However, it is also crucial to examine the film's plot and themes to gather more context about the possibility of cursing in BUtterfield 8. The movie portrays the complex and morally ambiguous protagonist, Gloria, played by Elizabeth Taylor. It deals with themes like infidelity, alcoholism, and high society. Despite the strict regulations, some films may have found ways to incorporate cursing or provocative language that pushed the boundaries of the Hays Code during that era. After analyzing the film's content, context, and plot, we can conclude that there is a chance that the sentence \\"BUtterfield 8 has cursing\\" might be true, albeit in a subtle or masked form. However, since cursing was generally discouraged and policed under the strict Hays Code in the 1960s, the strong use of provoking curse words would have been unlikely."},{"instruction":"Process: - Air is drawn in through the mouth - The air goes down the esophagus - The air moves into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is removed - The remaining oxygen enters the body - The remaining carbon dioxide is expelled through the mouth. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"the air isnt able to be filtered\\" happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case states that \\"the air isn't able to be filtered.\\" If this scenario were to occur, it could significantly impact the process of oxygen being brought into the body. The filtration of air is crucial for removing harmful particles, allergens, and pathogens, as well as ensuring that adequate levels of oxygen reach the lungs for proper oxygenation of the blood. If the air isn't filtered, several potential issues could arise: 1. Airborne contaminants could enter the respiratory system, leading to respiratory infections, illness, and inflammation. This may, in turn, compromise the lungs' ability to effectively absorb oxygen and remove carbon dioxide, indirectly affecting the overall oxygen availability for the body. 2. The presence of unfiltered air might also interfere with the natural process of gas exchange. If harmful particles and irritants are present due to the lack of filtration, the delicate surfaces of the alveoli in the lungs may be damaged, preventing optimal gas exchange and reducing the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed and delivered to the body. 3. Additionally, the immune system's response to heightened levels of contaminants could lead to inflammation and a reduced ability to take in oxygen, creating further difficulties in oxygenating the body. In summary, the perturbation of \\"the air isn't able to be filtered\\" could have significant indirect effects on the process of bringing more oxygen into the body. The presence of unfiltered air could potentially damage the respiratory system and reduce the effectiveness of gas exchange, ultimately leading to decreased oxygen availability for the body."},{"instruction":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","output":"Certainly! Here's a question related to the field of science, specifically astronomy: Question: What is the diameter of Jupiter, and how does it compare to the size of Earth?

In comparison, Earth has a diameter of roughly 7,917.5 miles (12,742 kilometers). Consequently, Jupiter's diameter is about 11 times larger than Earth's. This immense size also makes Jupiter the most massive planet, with a mass more than 300 times that of Earth. The gaseous nature of Jupiter and its rapid rotation contribute to its equatorial bulging, resulting in a slightly oblate shape.

With it came to an end a deadly and divisive war that lasted almost nine years, its enormous cost calculated in blood and billions. The quiet American exit, shrouded in secrecy until it occurred, closes a war that was contentious from the start and cost the nation more than 800 billion. The decision to invade Iraq was met with both support and opposition, but as the years went on and casualties mounted, the war's true costs became increasingly apparent. The conflict resulted in the deaths of over 4,400 American soldiers, tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians, and the displacement of millions more. The human toll, combined with the financial burden and the region's ongoing instability, has left many questioning whether the sacrifice was worthwhile. Throughout the course of the war, the U.S. faced numerous challenges, including managing a complex and evolving insurgency, addressing serious sectarian strife within the country, and attempting to promote stability and democratic governance in a region plagued by constant upheaval. The training and equipping of Iraqi security forces was often a slow and arduous process. Additionally, strained relations with the Iraqi government and an increasing war-weariness among the American public significantly contributed to the pressure on the U.S. military to withdraw. As the final American convoy exited Iraq, the remaining troops reflected on their experiences and sacrifices. Many expressed mixed emotions about leaving, with some highlighting concerns that the country might not yet be prepared to handle the daunting task of maintaining its own stability and security without international assistance. At the same time, many soldiers expressed a sense of relief and accomplishment, having played a role in toppling a brutal regime and giving the Iraqi people a chance to rebuild their nation. The withdrawal marked the end of an era in American military operations and a contentious period in U.S. foreign policy. The consequences and lasting effects of the war will undoubtedly continue to be debated for years to come. As soldiers return home to reunite with their loved ones, the legacy of the war will remain ever-present in the lives of those who fought, those who lost, and those who were forever changed by the conflict. In the years following the withdrawal, the U.S. has continued to grapple with the repercussions of its actions in Iraq. The rise of ISIS and the continued instability in the region have underscored the ongoing challenges of crafting effective policies in an increasingly interconnected and volatile world. The lessons learned from the conflict in Iraq will undoubtedly continue to inform and shape American foreign policy, with the true consequences of the war still unfolding."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Is Appleton International Airport or Lihue Airport further north?

Since Appleton International Airport has a higher latitude (44.2581° N) than Lihue Airport (21.9770° N), it is further north. Answer: Appleton International Airport is further north than Lihue Airport."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: After eating foods high in salt most of their lives, how are people most likely to be (statistically speaking): === The answer to the above question is - Fans of macaroni and cheese.; - Overweight or obese.; - not enough information; - University researchers.; Answer:","output":"Overweight or obese."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a sentence in the Hindi language and a corresponding English translation of the Hindi sentence.

In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88–73, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0–2 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22–5 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88–86. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112–103, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title.

Article: You may think that sailing is a difficult sport, but it is really not hard to learn it. You do not need to be strong. But you need to be quick. And you need to understand a few basic rules about the wind. First, you must ask yourself, \\"Where is the wind coming from? Is it coming from ahead or behind or from the side?\\" You must think about this all the time on the boat. The wind direction tells you what to do with the sail. Let's start with the wind blowing from the behind. This means the wind and the boat are going in the same direction. Then you must always keep the sail outside the boat. It should be at a 90deg angle to the boat. Then it will catch the wind best. If the wind is blowing from the side, it is blowing across the boat. In this case, you must keep the sail half way outside the boat. It should be at a 45deg angle to the boat. _ needs to be out far enough to catch the wind, but it shouldn't flap . It shouldn't look like on a flagpole. If it is flapping, it is probably out too far, and the boat will slow down. Sailing into the wind is not possible. If you try, the sail will flap and the boat will stop. You may want to go in that direction. It is possible, but you can't go in a straight line. You must go first in one direction and then in another. This is called tacking. When you are tacking, you must always keep the sail inside the boat.

Across Europe, kids in elementary school are racing in gas-powered go-carts that can go up to 60 miles an hour. Their dream: to make it to the Formula One circuit when they grow up. WSJ's Dan Michaels reports from Hoddesdon, England. Harry then racked his brain to remember when he first hit the track. \\"Two years ago,\\" he recalled with a boyish smile. \\"At age 4.\\" Kids everywhere dream of zooming around in fast cars. Across Europe, a growing number actually do—some before they're out of diapers. Many parents egg on the youngsters, nurturing their own dreams of siring the next Grand Prix champion. Welcome to the rugrat race. Go-carts years ago shed the \\"go\\" and became karts, and kids can enter Europe's high-pressure karting circuit at age 8. Recently, though, a new range of smaller \\"Bambino\\" karts has lowered the official bar to age 6 in Britain. Tracks around Europe have started offering classes for 5-year-olds and some allow youngsters behind the wheel at age 3. Kids everywhere dream of zooming around in fast cars. Across Europe, a growing number actually do. The Formula 1 success of former childhood karters, including Germany's Michael Schumacher and Britain's Lewis Hamilton, meanwhile, has inspired many European parents to spend lavishly chasing their racing dreams. Ben Platten, a Rye House karting team manager who tours internationally, says one father he knows spent almost 400,000 on karting for his two adolescent sons in one year. \\"Every parent thinks their kid's going to be a Formula 1 driver,\\" he says. Karting took off in car-crazed California in the 1950s and remains popular across America. But \\"it's more about friends and family than a career move,\\" says Mark Dismore, a former Indy 500 and Daytona driver who has also raced in Europe. \\"Europe is just a whole different mind set,\\" says Mr. Dismore, who owns a karting center outside Indianapolis. Europe's child racers don helmets and safety garb, but karts don't have seatbelts. Bambino karts can hit 32 miles per hour, while other models for kids go even faster. When Britain's Motor Sports Association, which regulates U.K. karting, launched Bambino class one year ago, chief executive Colin Hilton acknowledged in a statement that \\"some may consider 6 years old to be too young for this type of activity.\\" He said the group had \\"taken the pragmatic view that it is better to embrace it and introduce strict regulations\\" than let elementary-schoolers race unregulated. An association spokesman said no accidents have occurred at its Bambino events. At many European tracks, electric \\"fun karts\\" that reach six mph allow tots as young as 3 to take a spin. Others let all kids drive gasoline-powered karts, if they measure up. \\"We just have to be sure they reach the pedals,\\" says Dmitri Kokken, owner of First Kart Inn near Brussels. Serious training usually starts only when kids are more mature. Rye House tried prepping 4-year-olds, but soon shifted gears. \\"We felt they weren't quite ready to take up the instruction and follow through,\\" says John Huff, who handles marketing. \\"At 5, they're ready to use our machines.\\" A one-hour kart rental, with instruction, costs about 80 at the raceway. Some drivers have their own vehicles. Bill Sisley, owner of Buckmore Park Racetrack outside London, says a key is age-appropriate training. To teach track rules, he lets 6-year-olds color in pictures of racing flags. Some tots show promise sooner. Ben Kasperczak, who lives near Rye House, got a toy electric car for Christmas at 2½ and drove in his pajamas around the family garage. For Ben's third birthday, his father, Paul, took him to the raceway and bought a second-hand gasoline-powered kart for around 800. Ben mastered it before he could ride a bike, Mr. Kasperczak says. Now seven, Ben races at almost 60 mph and boasts 13 trophies, including a crystal one with his name engraved. \\"Daddy, is it spelled right?\\" Ben asked, admiring the prize while sitting on his father's lap recently at the track clubhouse. Sipping hot chocolate, Ben said a night race last year was particularly exciting because he got to stay up past his bedtime. Rye House owner Rick Musk says Ben drives so well the track is sponsoring him. Mr. Kasperczak says he and his wife never push Ben to race. \\"I'm only as committed as Ben is,\\" says Mr. Kasperczak, who was previously not a racing fan but now owns a minivan full of karting tires, spare parts and tools. Anthony Haralambous bought his son Alfie an inexpensive kart for his fifth birthday and \\"the bug just sort of took over,\\" Mr. Haralambous says. Alfie, now 9 years old, is winning races against older drivers and has won sponsorship from Rye House that includes a blue-and-orange Honda kart with a four-stroke engine. \\"For a novice, Alfie's frighteningly fast,\\" says Steve Cutting, who coaches young drivers. Harry Thompson wants to go even faster. The 6-year-old driver isn't bashful about sparring with his older friend, Alfie. \\"I remember when I was 5 and you were 7, and I overtook you twice,\\" Harry ribbed Alfie as they waited for a corporate party of karters to clear off the track. Harry glanced at the inexperienced adult racers. \\"Why are they going so slowly?\\" he asked. To kill time, Alfie and Harry chased each other around the clubhouse while Ben played with a plastic Scooby-Doo toy. Alfie's father, a construction worker who was never interested in racing, recalled his son's shyness after winning a race last year. \\"He was most nervous when he got up to get the trophy,\\" he said. Success on the track boosts youngsters' self-esteem, says Mr. Cutting, the coach. Mr. Kasperczak says his son Ben barely spoke at age five, but has shown a mature dedication to his craft. \\"I'm really proud that for someone of his age he has done this so consistently. It's what he wants to do,\\" says Mr. Kasperczak. \\"When he's here, in an adult environment, it's easy to forget he's only a baby.\\" Write to Daniel Michaels at daniel.michaels@wsj.com What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article is about young kids, some even as young as 5 years old, racing in small cars called \\"go-karts\\" in Europe.

A:","output":"A: Roger Waters is credited with writing the majority of Pink Floyd's songs, a prominent British rock band formed in 1965. Initially, the band's primary songwriter was Syd Barrett during the early years of Pink Floyd. He contributed to their first album, \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\\" released in 1967. Barrett's eccentric and experimental songwriting style set the foundation for Pink Floyd's distinct sound. However, due to his mental health issues and drug use, Barrett left the band in 1968, paving the way for Roger Waters to take over as the chief songwriter. Born George Roger Waters on September 6, 1943, in Great Bookham, Surrey, England, Waters was one of the founding members of Pink Floyd, alongside Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright. Roger Waters primarily served as the bassist and vocalist for the band. As he gradually assumed the role of the main lyricist and creative force behind Pink Floyd, Waters became well-known for his complex and thought-provoking songwriting, often exploring themes such as politics, human nature, and personal experiences. Waters significantly contributed to iconic Pink Floyd albums such as: 1. \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" (1968): Although this was Pink Floyd's second album, it was the first to feature Roger Waters' songwriting. 2. \\"Meddle\\" (1971): Waters' songwriting became more prominent on this album, particularly in the 23-minute-long track \\"Echoes.\\" 3. \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" (1973): Considered one of the greatest rock albums of all time, Waters wrote most of the lyrics for this groundbreaking record, exploring themes of life, death, mental illness, and societal pressures. 4. \\"Wish You Were Here\\" (1975): Waters took on the primary songwriting duties for this album, delving into the music industry's dark side and paying tribute to Syd Barrett. 5. \\"Animals\\" (1977): Waters wrote all the lyrics for this concept album, which offers a critical perspective on the social and political climate of the time. 6. \\"The Wall\\" (1979): Perhaps Waters' magnum opus as a songwriter, \\"The Wall\\" is a rock opera that tells the story of a rock star's descent into madness. Waters' personal experiences heavily influenced this album. 7. \\"The Final Cut\\" (1983): The last Pink Floyd album to feature Roger Waters, this anti-war album was primarily written by Waters as a reflection on war and its effects on people's lives. In 1985, Waters left Pink Floyd due to creative differences and pursued a successful solo career. Although David Gilmour took over as the band's primary songwriter after Waters' departure, Roger Waters' contributions to Pink Floyd's music remain an influential and integral part of their legacy."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The poet was being analyzed by younger people, where was this happening?

Determine if the answers to the two questions are the same or different based on the comparison. Step 1: Identify the major highways in California. - I-5 (Interstate 5): This is a major north-south route that runs along the western coast of the United States, connecting the Mexican and Canadian borders. - I-10 (Interstate 10): This is a major east-west route that runs from Santa Monica, California to Jacksonville, Florida. - I-80 (Interstate 80): This is another major east-west route that runs from San Francisco, California to Teaneck, New Jersey. - US-101 (U.S. Route 101): This is a significant north-south route that runs along the Pacific Coast, connecting California, Oregon, and Washington. Step 2: Identify the major highways in Maine and Kansas. - Major highways in Maine: - I-95 (Interstate 95): This is a major north-south route that runs from Miami, Florida to Houlton, Maine near the Canadian border. - I-295 (Interstate 295): This is a shorter auxiliary route that connects Portland and other areas along the coast. - Major highways in Kansas: - I-70 (Interstate 70): This is a major east-west route that runs from Cove Fort, Utah to Baltimore, Maryland. - I-35 (Interstate 35): This is a major north-south route that runs from Laredo, Texas to Duluth, Minnesota. Step 3: Compare the major highways in California with those in Maine and Kansas. - Comparing California and Maine: - California has more major interstate highways (3 vs 1). - California's highways cover larger distances and connect more states compared to Maine's highways. - Both states have a coastal route; California has US-101, while Maine has I-295. - Comparing California and Kansas: - Both states have comparable numbers of major interstates (California has 3 major interstates, while Kansas has 2). - California's highways cover larger distances compared to Kansas's highways. - California has coastal routes (I-5 and US-101), while Kansas does not have any coastal highways. Step 4: Determine if the answers to the two questions are the same or different based on the comparison. - The answers to the two questions are different because the comparisons between California and Maine major highways and California and Kansas major highways have distinct attributes. The number of major interstates and the presence of coastal routes are different between the two comparisons. Therefore, the answers to these two questions would not be the same."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"She met director Guy Ritchie, who would become her second husband, in November 1998 and gave birth to their son Rocco John Ritchie on August 11, 2000 in Los Angeles.

Is Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content.\\" is a good answer to the question. However, to provide a more detailed and long answer, you can add more information on how chromium influences the color, the composition of emeralds, and other factors that can contribute to the green color. Emeralds are a variety of the mineral beryl (Be3Al2Si6O18), which in its pure form is colorless. The green color in emeralds is primarily caused by trace amounts of chromium (Cr) and, in some cases, vanadium (V) ions replacing aluminum (Al) ions in the beryl crystal structure. This substitution causes the absorption of certain wavelengths of light, leading to the characteristic green coloration. When chromium ions replace aluminum, a phenomenon called intervalence charge transfer occurs. In this process, the chromium ions absorb light in the yellow-orange and blue-violet regions of the spectrum, effectively reflecting and transmitting the corresponding complementary color, which in this case is green. This occurs because energy in the form of light is transferred between two different oxidation states, Cr^3+ and Cr^2+, within the crystal structure. Vanadium can also cause a green color in emeralds, although they generally produce a more bluish-green hue compared to chromium-rich emeralds. Similar to chromium, vanadium ions replace aluminum ions in the beryl crystal lattice. The coloration caused by vanadium is due to the d-d electron transitions within the vanadium ions. These transitions lead to the selective absorption of light in the different regions, creating the appearance of green color. Another factor contributing to the green color of emeralds is the presence of iron (Fe) ions. Although iron's influence is usually minimal, it can contribute to the intensity and hue of the green color. Emeralds with higher iron content may appear more bluish-green, while those with lower iron content can exhibit a more saturated and pure green hue. It is important to note that the impurities and the concentration of chromium, vanadium, and iron, as well as the specific crystal lattice structure, will determine the exact shade and intensity of the green in emeralds. This variability in color can be seen in emeralds sourced from different regions across the world. In summary, the primary cause for the green color of emeralds is the presence of chromium ions replacing aluminum in the beryl crystal lattice. In some cases, vanadium ions and iron ions can also play a role in coloration. The specific shade and intensity of the green color depend on the impurity concentrations and crystal structure of an individual emerald."},{"instruction":"Where were you during the surge?

Article: The relations between man and wife are changing. A majority of working women remain in full charge of their home; they come back at night to the cleaning, washing, and cooking that constitute their second career. But more and more husbands are sharing the burden and willingly taking on chores that their fathers would have rejected as unmanly, and as too mysteriously difficult anyway. In such cases, man and wife become equal partners, both working outside, both pushing the vacuum cleaner, actually, the number of husbands who do help that way is much smaller than the number of those who accept the idea in theory. _ . The marriage can be destroyed when the wife is more successful in her profession than her husband in his, particularly when she earns more than he does. Sociologists see in this situation one of the main reasons for the increase in the divorce rate-another reason being the husband's refusal to help with the housework or the care of the children. A third reason could be the growing awareness of the professional woman that she doesn't hare to remain married if she is too unhappy.

Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth. Marlin felt the lines in his own face, the gray in his hair, the chill in his bones. He was too old for this. He set a half dollar on the bar and started for the door. \\"Don't get in a huff,\\" the bartender said. Marlin looked back. \\"Kraamer lives about a mile west of town.

Step by step justification: 1. Marlin enters the saloon and asks for information about Kraamer's whereabouts. 2. The bartender tells Marlin that Kraamer lives about a mile west of town and advises him to follow the railroad and take the first trail south. 3. Since Marlin came to town specifically looking for Kraamer, it is logical that he would follow the directions given by the bartender in order to find him."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Man: Hey, hey, neighbor.

At the top of a Nick Lang billboard Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Skyline Rescue\\" Step 1: Introduce the main characters Moss, an intelligent and skilled programmer, is passionate about using technology for the greater good. Nick, a charming and outgoing advertising executive, possesses a great talent for promoting brands. Susan, a headstrong and independent reporter, is the best friend of both Moss and Nick who utilize their exceptional skills to solve problems and uncover the truth. Step 2: Set up the initial conflict In their latest adventure, Susan breaks a story about a massive corporate scandal involving a powerful tech company engaged in illegal activities. This company was one of Nick's major clients, which puts him in the crosshairs of the organization. Susan goes into hiding to try to protect her friends and complete her investigation independently. Step 3: The desperate search Moss and Nick, worried about Susan's safety, use their skills to track her down. They follow her trail to uncover leads, marking their progress on an interactive map. They discover clues to her location through hidden messages and cryptic puzzles left by Susan along the way. Step 4: Moss and Nick discover Susan's location Having deciphered the coordinates, Moss and Nick realize that Susan is held captive on top of a towering billboard - a cheesy advertisement for Nick Lang's clients. The tech company is keeping Susan captive, as her knowledge of their scandal threatens to bring them down. The billboard becomes a symbol of the danger Nick inadvertently brought to his friend. Step 5: Planning the rescue Moss and Nick devise a plan to infiltrate the location and rescue Susan. Moss uses his programming skills to hack into the systems controlling the billboard's lights and motion, while Nick's knowledge of advertising structures helps them determine a safe way to access the top. They formulate a backup plan should things go awry. Step 6: The daring rescue Under the cover of night, Moss and Nick execute their plan. Moss hacks the billboard's system, causing it to display a series of distractions while Nick climbs up. Complications arise when security spots them, but they manage to outsmart their pursuers using their prepared backup plan. Ultimately, Nick reaches Susan, and they begin to climb back down. Step 7: The climax As the three friends descend the billboard, the tech company's henchmen close in on them. In a dramatic standoff, Moss uses his tech know-how to turn the hacked billboard into a weapon against their pursuers, temporarily stunning them while the trio makes their escape. Step 8: Resolution The scandal goes public, and the tech company is brought down by authorities. Susan writes an article that exposes the corruption and criminal activities of the company, bringing justice to those affected. Moss and Nick learn the importance of loyalty and trust, and the three friends continue their partnership to tackle more problems and mysteries in the future."},{"instruction":"Choose the next sentence.Urfa, Turkey (CNN) -- The petite 25-year-old tentatively opens the door to the hotel room where we've agreed to meet. Her face is covered, but her body language betrays her anxiety. She slowly lifts her niqab, revealing her young, heart-shaped face. Her large brown eyes, filled with guilt and turmoil, are delicately made up under perfectly sculpted brows. She calls herself 'Khadija.' It's not her real name, because she's a marked woman.

Recruited into a fierce and all-female ISIS brigade, Khadija underwent extensive training to become a lethal weapon herself. This included learning how to clean, dismantle, and fire various guns and other weaponry. Through this training, she was indoctrinated into the ideology and tactics that ISIS employs to maintain its power and control. The female ISIS brigade's members were skilled and ruthless, carrying out punishments in line with the group's rigid and brutal interpretation of Islamic law. However, despite her training and commitment to the cause, Khadija could not turn a blind eye to the senseless brutality and destruction that ISIS wreaked upon innocent people. As time went by, she became disillusioned with the group's actions and ideology, causing an internal struggle between her loyalty to the brigade and her own conscience. Her decision to defect from the group was a dangerous one since she was marked as a traitor and would be relentlessly hunted down if found. Defectors from ISIS are often met with gruesome consequences, so choosing this path meant that Khadija was putting her life at risk. Seeking refuge in Urfa, Turkey, she hid her identity with tremendous care, aiming to leave her past behind and start afresh. Her interview with CNN was the first time she had ever opened up about her experiences with the group and her brave decision to leave it all behind. Khadija's story serves as a testament to the extreme lengths that terrorist organizations go in recruiting and training their soldiers, even women who once held a secondary status within these groups. Her journey also highlights the immense courage it takes to leave such a formidable organization and the constant fear of reprisal that she must now live with - all while trying to find a sense of normalcy in a world that is far removed from the one she once knew."},{"instruction":"I read this background article the other day: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation.

By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war. Question: \\"What event allowed the zaibatsu conglomerates to take advantage of an economic upsurge?\\" Answer: \\"The Russian Revolution\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer is not correct. The economic upsurge that the zaibatsu conglomerates took advantage of was not directly related to the Russian Revolution. The zaibatsu conglomerates thrived due to the rapid industrialization and expansion of Japan's economy during the early 20th century, including increased raw-material production, manufactured goods, and heavy industry development. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which spurred a construction boom, also contributed to this economic growth."},{"instruction":"How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet?

A Japanese man traveled to Detroit hoping to sell it to a up and coming car company ran by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately for him the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype. An angry Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras who led the men.

The animals were discovered by a walker late on Saturday, strewn along the beach of Mason Bay. Authorities said half the whales had already died by then, while the other half were put down as it would have been too difficult to save them. In separate incidents, 12 pygmy whales and a sperm whale also beached in New Zealand over the weekend. 'A heart-breaking decision' The pilot whales were beached in two pods about 2km (1.2 miles) apart on a remote beach on Rakiura or Stewart Island off the coast of South Island. \\"Sadly, the likelihood of being able to successfully re-float the remaining whales was extremely low,\\" Ren Leppens of the regional Department of Conservation (DOC) said in a statement. \\"The remote location, lack of nearby personnel and the whales' deteriorating condition meant the most humane thing to do was to euthanise.\\" \\"However, it's always a heart-breaking decision to make.\\" The DOC said in a statement that whale strandings are not uncommon in New Zealand and that there are about 85 incidents a year. In most cases, though, it's just a single animal that is beached, not a whole pod. It's not fully known why whales or dolphins strand, the agency said. Possible reasons might be sickness, navigational errors, falling tides or being chased by a predator. Also over the weekend, 12 pygmy whales were found stranded at the northern tip of North Island. Four of them have died. There are hopes that the remaining eight can still be rescued and efforts are under way by local marine mammal charity Project Jonah. The group said it planned to re-float the whales on Tuesday and has asked for volunteers to help. On another North Island beach, a 15m (50ft) sperm whale died on Saturday morning. ||||| More than 140 pilot whales die in 'heartbreaking' New Zealand stranding More than 140 pilot whales have died on a remote New Zealand beach, the latest in a recent string of whale strandings and deaths in the country. On Saturday night the Department of Conservation [DoC] was informed of a mass whale stranding in Mason Bay on Stewart Island. A hiker camping in the remote location told authorities of the tragedy, with the number of whales equating to two pods. DOC Rakiura operations manager Ren Leppens said at least half of the whales were dead by the time staff arrived at the scene. Indonesia: dead whale had 1,000 pieces of plastic in stomach Read more “Sadly, the likelihood of being able to successfully refloat the remaining whales was extremely low. The remote location, lack of nearby personnel and the whales’ deteriorating condition meant the most humane thing to do was to euthanise,” said Leppens. “However, it’s always a heartbreaking decision to make.” The local Māori, tribe, Ngāi Tahu, is now working with DOC to bless the dead whales and make plans for burial of the bodies. Marine strandings are common in New Zealand, with the country a “hotspot”, according to DOC, who respond to about 85 incidents a year, usually of single animals. Since 1840, more than 5,000 strandings have been recorded around the New Zealand coastline. According to DOC the reasons for whale strandings are not fully understood, but contributing factors can include “sickness, navigational error, geographical features, a rapidly falling tide, being chased by a predator, or extreme weather”. Project Jonah, a whale rescue group says New Zealand has one of the highest rates of whale strandings in the world, with an average of 300 whales and dolphins beaching themselves every year. A series of whale strandings occurred over the weekend in New Zealand, but the incidents are so far thought to be unrelated. Eight pygmy whales remain stranded on 90 mile beach in Northland, with two others from the same pod euthanised over the weekend. A 15-metre male sperm whale beached and died at Doubtful Sound on Saturday, while a female pygmy sperm whale washed up dead at Ohiwa over the weekend. Last year more than 400 pilot whales were stranded in Golden Bay, the largest whale stranding in New Zealand’s history. Although hundreds of locals participated in a mass civilian rescue effort, more than 300 whales died. ||||| Summary:","output":"A lot of whales got stuck on a beach on an island in New Zealand, and sadly, almost 150 of them died. People tried to help, but it was very difficult to save them. Whales sometimes get stuck on beaches, and nobody knows exactly why, but it could be because they are sick or having trouble finding their way. This happened to some other whales in New Zealand too, but these cases might not be related. People are trying their best to help the whales that are still alive."},{"instruction":"Same meaning? In his memoirs , like popular historians such as Vicente Fidel López , he claims that it was exclusively a product of the liberal initiative . Saavedra claims in his memoirs , as do popular historians like Vicente Fidel López , that it was exclusively a product of the liberal initiative .","output":"Yes, both sentences convey the same meaning. Here is a step-by-step analysis of both sentences to show how they have the same meaning: 1. In the first sentence, it starts with \\"In his memoirs,\\" which refers to Saavedra's memoirs, though it does not directly mention Saavedra's name. 2. The first sentence states \\"like popular historians such as Vicente Fidel López,\\" which sets up a comparison between the claim made in Saavedra's memoirs and the claims made by popular historians like Vicente Fidel López. 3. The first sentence concludes with \\"he claims that it was exclusively a product of the liberal initiative,\\" which specifically states the claim that both Saavedra and the popular historians hold. Now, let's examine the second sentence's components: 1. The second sentence begins with \\"Saavedra claims in his memoirs,\\" which also refers to Saavedra's memoirs, but this time directly states Saavedra's name upfront. 2. The second sentence states \\"as do popular historians like Vicente Fidel López,\\" which also sets up a comparison between Saavedra's claim and the claims of popular historians like Vicente Fidel López; however, this time, it uses a different phrasing. 3. The second sentence has the same claim: \\"that it was exclusively a product of the liberal initiative,\\" which matches the concluding statement in the first sentence.

Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life.

Jason did bathroom renovation for Michael, later his house failed inspection when OPT: (i). Jason wanted to sell the house.. (ii). Michael wanted to sell the house..","output":"Jason had been a trusted contractor in the community for years, known greatly for his attention to detail and exceptional craftsmanship. When Michael had approached him about doing a bathroom renovation on his home, Jason was eager to take the project on and deliver exceptional results. Every tile, fixture, and finish was chosen with precision, and Michael was thrilled with the outcome. However, when it came time for Michael to sell the home, things took a turn for the worse. During a routine home inspection, the house failed to pass various requirements, and Michael was mortified. It turned out that there were several issues in the newly renovated bathroom, despite Jason's previous claim of expertise and adherence to codes and regulations. The first issue arose from an improper installation of the bathroom's electrical outlets. The outlets were not equipped with ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), a potentially lethal oversight. This type of outlet is crucial in areas with water and functions to automatically cut off the power when a ground-fault is detected, helping to avoid disastrous outcomes, such as electrocution. Secondly, there appeared to be issues with the renovated bathroom's plumbing system. The inspector discovered improper sloping of the bathroom floor, which led to pooling water and raised concerns about the possibility of water damage and mold growth in the future. In addition to this, the plumbing beneath the sink was not up to code – trap arms were installed at incorrect angles, contributing to slow drainage and the risk of sewer gas infiltrating the house. Thirdly, poor ventilation had been flagged by the inspector as a significant concern in the renovated bathroom. The bathroom's internal humidity needs to be managed efficiently to prevent the development of harmful mold and mildew. Unfortunately, Jason had neglected to install a vent fan during the renovation, despite this being an important aspect of bathroom construction and code requirements. Among these infractions, the inspector also noted that the showerhead installed by Jason was not compliant with water-efficiency standards. As ecological consciousness and sustainability become increasingly integral to contemporary home construction and renovation, the non-compliant showerhead was an unwelcome surprise for Michael. Naturally, Michael was disillusioned and disappointed with Jason's work on his bathroom renovation. He confronted Jason about these shortcomings, feeling extremely betrayed by a man who had provided exceptional service to countless others in the community. Jason, in turn, was shocked that his work had failed inspection and felt tremendous remorse for the predicament he had put Michael in. Taking responsibility for his errors, Jason set out to rectify each issue in Michael's bathroom, ensuring everything is up to code and the house would pass the inspection. In the meantime, Michael had to temporarily postpone the sale of his home and inform potential buyers of the ongoing situation, which resulted in lost opportunities and mounting frustration. Once Jason had completed the necessary adjustments and repairs to the renovated bathroom, Michael was able to proceed with the sale of his house. Though this crisis had put a serious strain on their relationship, their shared experience ultimately led to a stronger understanding of each other's values and the importance of adhering to the highest possible standards in construction. Despite the challenges and setbacks, Michael was grateful for Jason's commitment to fixing the problem and taking responsibility for his actions. In the end, Michael sold his house, surpassing its original market value, and Jason emerged from the experience as a more conscientious and skilled contractor, dedicated to refining his craft and righting the wrongs that had arisen in Michael's bathroom renovation."},{"instruction":"Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms.

Born in Lausanne, Switzerland, Carpentier grew up in Havana, Cuba, and despite his European birthplace, he strongly self-identified as Cuban throughout his life. He traveled extensively, particularly in France, and to South America and Mexico, where he met prominent members of the Latin American cultural and artistic community. Carpentier took a keen interest in Latin American politics and often aligned himself with revolutionary movements, such as Fidel Castro's Communist Revolution in Cuba in the mid-20th century. As a young child Carpentier was exposed to a great deal of music. Carpentier himself played the piano, as did his mother; his father played cello, studying under Pablo Casals, and his grandmother played the organ. Carpentier studied music theory at the Lycee Jeanson de Sailly when he lived in Paris for the first time. Carpentier's own compositions made him an important part of the contemporary Cuban musical landscape, but he also studied the origins and political nuances of Cuban music. His devotion to the adaptations of European artistic styles into Latin American music styles can also be seen in his admiration for Afro-Cuban musical themes. Early in his career Carpentier collaborated with other young musicians eager to explore Cuban musical roots. One such collaborator was Amadeo Roldan, a French musician of Cuban background. They helped to organize the Cuban premiere of popular orchestral music of the era Conciertos de musica nueva (Concerts of New Music), featuring composers such as Stravinsky, Milhaud, Ravel, Malipiero, Poulenc and Erik Satie. In regards to their own music, Carpentier and Roldan were far more interested in integrating African rhythms and melodies into their works and abandoned imitation of European musical styles. \\"!Abajo la lira, arriba el bongo!\\" (Down with the lyre, up with the bongo!) was the popular slogan for their style of music. Carpentier and Roldan collaborated on numerous works, including the 1925 orchestral piece Obertura sobre temas cubanos (Overture on Cuban Themes) which was regarded as scandalous for its betrayal of what was seen as the proper European-style symphony in favor of Afro-Cuban inspired music. Other well-known collaborations between the two included Tres pequenas poemas: Oriente, Pregon, Fiesta negra (Three little poems) produced in 1926, and two Afro-Cuban ballets: La Rebambaramba, a colonial ballet in two parts (1928) and El milagro de Anaquille (1929). Carpentier's interest in music had great influence on his prose writing. Navarro suggests that readers of Carpentier's works are more listeners than they are readers. Lyrical use of colloquial dialects, literary rhythms such as alliteration and assonance and the theme of music within the world of the narrative (drums, footsteps, etc.) are a few examples of music's influence over Carpentier's work. In an interview the author himself was quoted as saying \\"Music is present in all of my work.\\" For Carpentier, analysis of Cuban identity was grounded in the analysis of Cuban music. As such, for Carpentier to better understand Cuban identity through his work, he eagerly integrated music into his writing. Does he come from a cuban background?","output":"Yes, Alejo Carpentier y Valmont comes from a Cuban background.

This place was called a dockyard. Ships are big boats that can travel on water and carry people and things from one place to another. Many people work at dockyards to make sure the ships are built safely and can sail without any problems. One day, there was a group of special people called naval officers. They work for the Indian navy, which is a group of trained people who protect their country on the water. Naval officers are very important and have many responsibilities, like making sure ships are built correctly and being in charge of the people who work on them. Sadly, something went wrong while building a ship at the dockyard in Mumbai. An accident happened, and one of the naval officers was hurt so badly that he didn't survive. An accident is when something unplanned and not good happens, like tripping and falling or a glass breaking on the floor. Sometimes accidents happen even when people are very careful. The people who work at the dockyard and the Indian navy got very sad when they heard about the accident. They talked to each other and tried to find out what caused the accident, so they can prevent more accidents in the future. They also want to make sure the family of the navy officer who passed away is taken care of.

However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] and the situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks.

So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).

With Congress seeking official numbers on immigrant/child separation along the southwest border and officials refusing to provide it, the Times dug up federal data showing that over 700 children (100 of them under age 4) have been separated from adults in the past six months. The Department of Homeland Security eventually acknowledged the numbers but said it was to \\"protect the best interests of minor children crossing our borders\\" and not to deter illegal immigration. Such children torn from families are sheltered by nongovernmental organizations, which try to find a US guardian or relative to take the child—but if none emerge, the child can remain stuck in custody. Last year, as secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly floated the idea of child/guardian separation at borders, telling CNN he was considering it \\"in order to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous network. ... They will be well cared for as we deal with their parents.\\" Indeed there have been fraud cases, with some migrants admitting they brought children only to be admitted into the US more easily. Now the ACLU has filed a lawsuit on behalf of immigrant parents trying to stop such border separations.","output":"Title: Border Agents Separate Immigrant Children Despite Policy Denials: The Continuing Controversy Introduction: Amidst continuing controversies, border agents have been found to separate immigrant children from their families, a strategy previously considered by the Trump administration. Despite officials denying such a policy was in force, federal data revealed over 700 children have been separated from adults in the past six months, raising concerns about the well-being of these children and igniting a legal battle. Background on the policy: Last year, then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly suggested separating children from their guardians at borders as a possible way to discourage further illegal immigration. Kelly assured that children would be cared for, while dealing with the parents in question. However, reports of child/guardian separations have surfaced despite no official policy announcement, leading to questions about the border practices in place. Evidence of child/guardian separations: The New York Times found that over 700 children, 100 of them under age four, have been separated from adults along the southwest border in the past six months. As Congress sought official numbers on immigrant/child separations and faced refusal from officials, the Times' discovery of this federal data exposed the discrepancy between the official narrative and actual border practices. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) later acknowledged these numbers, but argued it was to protect children's best interests. Growing concerns and backlash: Such separated children are sheltered by nongovernmental organizations, which attempt to locate a US guardian or relative to care for the child. In cases where no suitable guardian emerges, children can remain in custody for extended periods. Critics argue that these practices cause unnecessary trauma to children and families, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit on behalf of immigrant parents, seeking to halt further separations. Conclusion: The issue of child/guardian separations at borders remains contentious and underreported. The existing system is challenged by the varying narratives provided by government agencies and the interests of immigrant families. As legal battles ensue, the future of separated children and the policy's influence on immigration remains unpredictable."},{"instruction":"Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Choose your answer from: (a). negative; (b). positive; TEXT:I have never seen the 1973, older highly rated version.

He held so tightly that his knuckles turned white , and his body flickered with a purplish shimmer . He had to stay in control . He had to . What might be true of him ?","output":"Based on the given information from the article, several potential interpretations and truths about the character can be inferred: 1. Emotional turmoil or struggle: The character's grip being described as \\"so tightly that his knuckles turned white\\" suggests that he might be experiencing strong emotions, which could include fear, anger, desperation, or stress. His determination to stay in control speaks to an ongoing struggle within him, heightening the implication that he is dealing with a difficult situation, both emotionally and mentally. 2. Holding onto something of great importance: The tight grip could also imply that the character is holding onto an object or person that is crucial to him at this specific moment. The urgency to stay in control could mean that losing that grip could result in disastrous consequences. 3. Possessing supernatural or extraordinary abilities: The description of the character's body \\"flickering with a purplish shimmer\\" implies that there might be something otherworldly or magical about him. This could mean that he is a supernatural being or a human with extraordinary powers. In this context, staying in control might refer to managing his powers to prevent any unintended harm to himself or others around him. 4. A critical situation: The combined description of his physical grip, the purplish shimmer, and the urgent need to stay in control could indicate that the character is in a high-stakes, potentially life-threatening situation. He may be trying to prevent a disastrous event, protect someone, or overcome a dangerous foe. 5. A pivotal character moment: The intense description of the character's actions and emotions might be highlighting a significant moment in the character's development. The struggle for control might represent his effort to rise above the challenges and problems he has faced up to this point. Overcoming this particular hurdle may ultimately lead to personal growth and transformation, impacting the remainder of his story. In conclusion, it is difficult to pinpoint a single, specific truth about the character based only on the provided excerpt. However, it can be inferred that he is experiencing a significant struggle, be it emotional, situational, or supernatural. The situation seems to be resulting from an intense, perhaps critical event, and his personal stakes are high. The character's actions and emotions indicate that the outcome of this scenario may significantly impact his journey and development throughout the story."},{"instruction":"Consider the question.

It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System. - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth . - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, . - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers. Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground. - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9). - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain. - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space. - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973. - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus. - Mount Olympus (also transliterated as Olympos, and on Greek maps, Oros Olympos) is the highest mountain in Greece and the second highest mountain in the Balkans. It is located in the Olympus Range on the border between Thessaly and Macedonia, between the regional units of Pieria and Larissa, about southwest from Thessaloniki. Mount Olympus has 52 peaks, deep gorges, and exceptional biodiversity. The highest peak \\"Mytikas\\", meaning \\"nose\\", rises to . It is one of the highest peaks in Europe in terms of topographic prominence. - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world. - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva. - Tarshish occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, most frequently as a place (probably a large city or region) far across the sea from the Land of Israel and Phoenicia. Tarshish was said to have supplied vast quantities of important metals to Israel and Phoenicia. The same place-name occurs in the Akkadian inscriptions of Esarhaddon (the Assyrian king, d. 669 BC) and also on the Phoenician inscription on the Nora Stone, indicating that it was a \\"real\\" place; its precise location was never commonly known, and was eventually lost in antiquity. Legends grew up around it over time so that its identity has been the subject of scholarly research and commentary for more than two thousand years. Its importance stems in part from the fact that Hebrew biblical passages tend to understand Tarshish as a source of King Solomon's great wealth in metals - especially silver, but also gold, tin and iron (Ezekiel 27). The metals were reportedly obtained in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre (Isaiah 23), and the fleets of Tarshish-ships. However, Solomon's Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians, thus archaeological evidence has been difficult to uncover.

Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"The community did not accept the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution for several reasons, most notably due to significant scientific objections and alternative theories posed by prominent scientists of the time. These objections challenged the foundation of Darwin's theory and highlighted some gaps in understanding crucial aspects of evolution. One of the primary objections came from Karl von Nägeli, who argued that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed through natural selection. Since Darwin's theory emphasized the importance of advantageous traits being selected and passed on, von Nägeli's objection posed a direct challenge to the theory's validity. In response, Darwin conceded that such characteristics could be linked to adaptive characteristics, indicating that the selection process may be more complex than initially proposed. Another critical challenge came from William Thomson, later known as Lord Kelvin. Thomson calculated that the Earth had cooled in less than 100 million years, disputing Darwin's estimate of the age of the Earth and suggesting that there had not been enough time for gradual evolution to occur. This argument posed a significant challenge to the timeline on which natural selection operated, raising doubts about the entire evolutionary process. Fleeming Jenkin, meanwhile, objected to Darwin's acceptance of blending inheritance. According to Jenkin, blending inheritance would cause traits to mix, making it impossible for natural selection to accumulate and select useful traits. This objection questioned the genetic foundation of Darwin's theory, creating uncertainty around how heredity and the passing on of traits factored into evolution. Some scientists, like St. George Mivart, supported directed evolution instead of natural selection. Mivart compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection, assembling a collection of criticisms that further undermined confidence in Darwin's theory. In response, Darwin made substantial changes to the sixth edition of his work, attempting to address these criticisms and strengthen his argument for natural selection. Ultimately, the problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century, notably through advancements in geology and genetics. The discovery of radioactive dating and the understanding of Mendelian inheritance eventually provided the necessary evidence to support Darwin's theory in both areas. In conclusion, the community did not initially accept the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution due to various scientific objections that raised doubts about the theory's validity and sparked debate around alternative mechanisms. However, as science progressed and our understanding of related fields advanced, these objections were addressed, and natural selection became widely accepted as a fundamental component of evolutionary theory."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a text of the tweet and a corresponding label whether this tweet is 'Offensive', 'Hate Speech' or 'Neither'.

You’ll notice in the Twttr example above, the “y” is clearly visible. Also, the vowels in URLs will be also be free for everyone, forever. You can also Tweet in non-Latin characters based languages, like Japanese, Chinese, Arabic or Korean. These languages will remain unaffected by our service change. Extra room, better Tweets In addition to our normal suite of Promoted Products for advertisers, we are now also offering a single character extension, expanding the length of a Tweet to 141 characters, for those moments when you need just one more character to finish your thought. The price of the extra character is based on a bidding system reflecting the popularity of the character you would like to add. Sorry, only one-letter bidding is allowed. There is no option to purchase a second additional character at this time. Early results We tested this new breakthrough product change with a few key partners in order to get the details right.

Not long after, Alan passed away. Hours after news broke that the Golden Globe-nominated actor had died, Carter, 19, took to social media to pay tribute to the father of three. “Today I lost my best friend and my idol, and the world lost one of it’s finest. You are a legend and I love you Pops. Until next time,” Carter tweeted alongside a photo of him standing next to his dad.

She is the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels. Born in New York City and raised there and in Beverly Hills, California, Hilton began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency Trump Model Management. Her lifestyle and rumored short-lived relationships made her a feature of entertainment news and tabloid magazines, and Hilton was proclaimed \\"New York's leading It girl\\" in 2001. Hilton was born in New York City. Her mother, Kathy Hilton (nee Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino), is a socialite and former actress; her father, Richard Howard \\"Rick\\" Hilton, is a businessman. She was raised in the Catholic faith. Hilton is the oldest of four children; she has one sister, Nicholai Olivia \\"Nicky\\" Hilton (born 1983), and two brothers: Barron Nicholas Hilton II (born 1989) and Conrad Hughes Hilton III (born 1994). Her paternal great-grandfather was Conrad Hilton, who founded Hilton Hotels. Hilton has Norwegian, German, Italian, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. She moved frequently in her youth, living in a suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons. As a child, she was friends with other socialites, including Ivanka Trump, Nicole Richie and Kim Kardashian. Growing up in Los Angeles, Hilton attended the Buckley School and St. Paul the Apostle School, finishing elementary school in 1995. Her freshman year of high school (1995-96) was spent at the Marywood-Palm Valley School in Rancho Mirage, California. In 1996, Hilton and her family left California for the East Coast. At age 16, Hilton spent one year at the Provo Canyon School for emotionally troubled teens. She then attended the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut from fall 1998 to February 1999 (her junior year), where she was a member of the ice hockey team. In February 1999, Hilton was expelled from Canterbury for violating school rules, returning to the Dwight School before dropping out a few months later. She later earned a GED certification. Hilton began modeling as a child, originally at charity events. When she was 19, she signed with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management. Hilton said that she \\"wanted to model\\", Trump wanted her at his agency, and she was \\"loving\\" the work. While modeling, she became a daily feature of entertainment news for her partying; according to Vanity Fair, Cisco Adler (producer of Sweetie Pie, in which Hilton acted) called her \\"a young party girl who gets sucked into the L.A. party scene and grew up a little too fast\\".

I discovered Tracy Rigg via Yelp where a fellow Elite rated her services as 5 stars while I was on a hunt for a natural stylist in Charlotte to prevent from my constant travels back home to Chicago to get my hair done. I made an appointment to see Tracy while she was in the SouthPark location and was pleased with my cut and the product not too much the style as it made me look like a old women with the extreme layers. After I wrapped it and slept on it it fell like I would've liked it to so I LOVED the results as they were due to the products which I purchased (No Parabens - Tracy products) and her process of getting my natural hair straightened for the first time since I went natural. Tracy schedule is pretty tight and after having that personal appointment in an one on one setting was SOLD and expressed my desire to have her as my hair stylist in Charlotte for my straightening twice a year. Let's get to this 1 STAR review: Last year December my daughter and I were heading home for our annual Nutcracker ballet show and I tried scheduling with Tracy as early as October and was unsuccessful as the site is very deceiving as it allow you to choose Tracy and see her schedule and even choose a time however when you click SCHEDULE you get an error that states \\"Tracy Riggs requires you to call in to schedule\\" which I did and left a message and didn't get a call back after 5 days so I emailed and got a response that the days that I saw were available are no longer available and since our flights were booked we had no alternative dates and time so she suggested her new stylist from our hometown of Chicago (Kim) and we accepted. NOTE: This was her way of not accepting us as a client Kim did a great job however it was EXTREMELY overpriced we paid 180 for two wash and blowouts, needless to say we didn't go back afterwards.

Three days later I called again and mentioned my message I left and my issue scheduling, this time I was told FLAT OUT \\" Tracy isn't accepting clients she only accept appointments for regulars\\". My issue with this is 1. The website is deceiving where it allow you to see all the availability of Tracy where her schedule has space 2. How can you become a regular if you are NEVER able to schedule? 3. The unprofessionalism when a potential client leaves a message with contact info and no one returns the call or try to return the call. Needless to say, I will not be trying this place again. The new location is nice as I visited last year and uploaded a photo BUT that's it that's all.

A mystery corpse found at the bottom of a well was seriously assaulted before being put down there, police have revealed. Officers are still trying to identify the victim – who was discovered on Friday. by two gardeners clearing the grounds of a detached house in Surrey. They. found the body, which was partially clothed, at the bottom of an. 11ft-deep well covered with wire mesh and a concrete slab. The male victim could have been killed up to a fortnight ago, according to murder detectives. Scroll down for video. Probe: Police have launched a murder investigation after the body of a man was found down a well in Surrey. Grim task: Officers from the Underwater and Confined Space Search Team during the recovery operation. Results of an initial post-mortem examination did not prove conclusive in providing a cause of death and further tests will be carried out, Scotland Yard said. However, the examination did reveal injuries to the body consistent with an assault, said a police spokesman. One of the padlocks securing the wire mesh had been cut, allowing the culprit to drop the corpse down the well. Rory Mulholland, 21, who was working with 17-year-old Jack Duncan said: ‘There was quite a lot of trash in the garden. Cleaned: A police specialist diver being washed down after leaving the scene. ‘I assumed whoever owned the house was clearing the house out and getting it renovated and it was the end of their tenancy.’ He. added: ‘We spotted a big blue tarpaulin at the bottom of the well and. we were curious to see what it was. 'Jack turned the tarpaulin over with a. length of kitchen drainpipe and then we noticed the outline of a. person. 'You could see the shape of someone’s legs and a bottom. ‘Then. we flipped the tarp over again and I saw someone’s upper thigh. 'It was. definitely a man. I’ve never smelt anything like it.’ The. decomposing corpse was found in the overgrown garden of a property in. Warlingham, Surrey, which is currently the home of a group of Polish car. wash workers. All. seven men – who are aged between 21 and 27 – were arrested on suspicion. of murder over the weekend, but have now been questioned and released on. bail. One said: ‘I want to. clear my name. There has been a big mistake. 'We don’t know nothing. We. just live there. The police said nothing to us.’ And. George Anastasi, who is the owner of both the property and the car. wash, said he was ‘completely shocked’ when he heard of the discovery. Asked. if anyone who lived or worked there could be responsible, he replied:. ‘I would find it very hard to believe it’s one of them.’ Aerial view of the scene: The well was 2ft wide, 7ft deep and the water was approximately 4ft deep. Tents: The body was found in the narrow shaft of a well outside this house on Audley Drive in Warlingham. Gardeners working at the house, set within an acre of land, spotted the body in the well in Surrey. The. men have now all returned to work at the nearby car wash. But they are. staying at a hotel so police can search the property – which neighbours. say could fetch up to £1million if sold to a developer. Detective. Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons, who is leading the inquiry, said a. post-mortem examination was underway to try and identify a cause and. time of death. Specialist divers, pictured, were called to the scene and were assessing how to remove the body without destroying any evidence. Evidence found by the divers at the scene indicated that the body had been placed in the well, police said. And he stressed that officers are working around the clock to identify the victim, adding: ‘This is an unusual case. ‘I. would appeal for anybody who has concerns about a missing person or who. believes they may know something about this individual or incident to. call my officers. ‘Although I. cannot elaborate further at this time, I have reason to believe that. this body was placed into the well and we are treating the incident as a. murder.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.

That's the message for would-be parents, especially in the country's northeast, after officials linked a mosquito-borne virus called Zika to a surge in newborn microcephaly , a neurological disorder that can result in incomplete brain development. \\"It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,\\" Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Brazil's hardest-hit state, told CNN. Behind Brazil's outbreak More than 2,400 suspected cases of microcephaly have been reported this year in 20 Brazilian states, compared with 147 cases last year. Doctors are investigating 29 related infant deaths. Microcephaly results in babies being born with abnormally small heads that cause, often serious, developmental issues and sometimes early death. As a result, six states have declared a state of emergency. In Pernambuco state alone, more than 900 cases have been reported. \\"These are newborns who will require special attention their entire lives. It's an emotional stress that just can't be imagined,\\" Rocha said. \\"Here in Pernambuco, we're talking about a generation of babies that's going to be affected.\\" When the cases of microcephaly started to soar last month, doctors noticed they coincided with the appearance of the Zika virus in Brazil. They soon discovered that most of the affected mothers reported having Zika-like symptoms during early pregnancy -- mild fever, rash and headaches. On November 28, Brazil's Health Ministry announced that during an autopsy it had found the Zika virus in a baby born with microcephaly, establishing a link between the two. \\"This is an unprecedented situation, unprecedented in world scientific research,\\" the ministry said on its website. Research continues to determine if Zika actually causes microcephaly and further establish an association. Initially concentrated in northeastern Brazil, many cases of microcephaly have now been detected in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo to the south, fueling fears across the country. Patricia Compassi , from Sao Paulo state, has received an outpouring of support and sympathy on social media after she opened up on national television about her son Lorenzo, born with microcephaly in November. \\"It's been very difficult because initially the ultrasounds were normal,\\" she told Globo TV in an interview. Early in her pregnancy, she woke up with a rash all over face and achy joints -- symptoms that doctors initially attributed to a food allergy and now associate with Zika. Toward the end of her term, doctors determined her baby would be born with microcephaly. \\"There are days that I cry, but just looking at him gives me strength,\\" she said. Where Zika came from and where it can go Zika fever was first discovered in Uganda in the 1940s and has since become endemic in parts of Africa. It also spread to the South Pacific and areas of Asia, and most recently to Latin America. It was detected in Brazil early this year. Some doctors believe tourists from Asia or the South Pacific introduced it during the 2014 World Cup. There are concerns it could continue to spread north, but at this point, the virus is known to be transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which thrives in tropical climates. In the United States that type of mosquito is only found in small numbers in Texas, Florida and Hawaii. Aedes aegypti is the same mosquito responsible for the spread of yellow fever, dengue and chikungunya Zika is hard to detect, and there often aren't any symptoms. Brazil's Health Ministry says there have been anywhere between a half million and 1.5 million cases in the country in the latest outbreak. Both the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization have issued alerts in relation to the outbreak of Zika in Brazil and other countries in Latin America. Federal and local governments have ramped up efforts to combat the Aedes aegypti mosquito and encouraged people -- especially pregnant women, to lather on insect repellant and stay indoors. In Rio de Janeiro, the host city for the 2016 Olympics, officials said they have already made more than 9 million house visits to eradicate the stagnant pools used as a breeding ground for mosquitoes and are monitoring 391 pregnant women who are suspected of having Zika infections. With the hot, rainy summer just beginning, the concern is Brazil could see a big spike in Zika. And while it could take months or even years before researchers determine if mosquitoes are really to blame, they are encouraging families to avoid risks and hold off on those pregnancies. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Rio de Janeiro, which will be the host of the 2016 Olympic Games, is one of the areas in Brazil where the Zika virus has been found, and local officials have been aggressive about trying to eradicate mosquito breeding grounds. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) Brazilian health authorities are sounding the alarm about a mosquito-borne virus that they believe may be the cause of thousands of infants being born with damaged brains. The pathogen, known as Zika and first discovered in forest monkeys in Africa over 70 years ago, is the new West Nile -- a virus that causes mild symptoms in most but can lead to serious neurological complications or even death in others. Brazil's health ministry said on Nov. 28 that it had found the Zika virus in a baby with microcephaly — a rare condition in which infants are born with shrunken skulls — during an autopsy after the child died. The virus was also found in the amniotic fluid of two mothers whose babies had the condition. \\"This is an unprecedented situation, unprecedented in world scientific research,\\" the ministry said in a statement on its website, according to CNN. [Zika virus: What you need to know] Brazil is investigating more than more than 2,400 suspected cases of microcephaly and 29 deaths of infants that occurred this year. Last year the country saw only 147 cases of microcephaly. The situation in Brazil is so overwhelming that Angela Rocha, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist in Pernambuco, one of the hardest hit states, said in an interview with CNN that women may want to hold off on getting pregnant. \\"These are newborns who will require special attention their entire lives.

Brazil's Health Ministry confirmed the connection between the growing of microcephaly cases in babies born in northeast Brazil and the Zika virus. (Patrice Coppee/AFP/Getty Images) Until a few years ago, human infections with the virus were almost unheard of. Then, for reasons scientists can't explain but think may have to do with the complicated effects of climate change, it began to pop up in far-flung parts of the world. In 2007, it infected nearly three-quarters of Yap Island's 11,000 residents. In 2013, Zika showed up in Tahiti and other parts of French Polynesia and was responsible for making an estimated 28,000 people so ill they sought medical care. It arrived in Brazil in May, where tens of thousands have fallen ill. The World Health Organization, which has been monitoring the spread of the virus closely and issued an alert about the situation in Brazil, reported this month that it had popped up for the first time in the West African nation of Cape Verde and that it had led to additional illnesses in Panama and Honduras. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found the virus in a few travelers returning from overseas, but says there have not come across any cases of people being infected by mosquitoes in the country. Brazil has been struggling to contain the virus for months through both public education campaigns --which urge residents to use insect repelant and limit their time outdoors -- as well as by sending mosquito eradication teams house to house to treat places where aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the virus might breed.

Brazil In May 2015, the public health authorities of Brazil confirmed autochthonous transmission of Zika virus in the northeastern part of the country. As of 8 October, autochthonous cases of Zika virus had been detected in 14 states: Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará, Maranhão, Mato Grosso, Pará, Paraná, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Norte, Roraima, and São Paulo. Public health measures implemented by national and state authorities include the development and dissemination of sentinel protocol for Zika virus surveillance, development and validation of protocol for surveillance of neurological syndromes, and vector control activities. Colombia As of 16 October, 9 samples were laboratory-confirmed as Zika virus infections out of 98 samples from the Bolívar department (13 from Cartagena and 85 from Turbaco). These are the first cases of Zika virus infection detected in the country. Background Zika fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by Zika virus, consisting of mild fever, rash (mostly maculo-papular), headaches, arthralgia, myalgia, asthenia, and non-purulent conjunctivitis, occurring about three to twelve days after the mosquito vector bite. One out of four people may not develop symptoms, but in those who are affected the disease is usually mild with symptoms that can last between two and seven days. Its clinical manifestation is often similar to dengue, also a mosquito-borne illness. Since 2014, indigenous circulation of Zika virus has been detected in the Americas. In February 2014, the public health authorities of Chile confirmed the first case of indigenous transmission of Zika virus infection on Easter Island, and cases were reported until June 2014. Recent outbreaks of Zika virus fever in different regions of the world demonstrate the potential for the arbovirus to spread through territories where the (Aedes) vector is found. WHO advice Given the increased transmission of Zika virus in the Region of the Americas, PAHO/WHO recommends that its Member States establish and maintain the capacity to detect and confirm cases of Zika virus infection, prepare their health services for a potential additional burden at all levels of health care, and implement an effective public communications strategy to reduce the mosquitoes that transmit this disease, particularly in areas where this vector is present. The complete set of recommendations is available in the latest Epidemiological Update (see related links) ||||| Definition By Mayo Clinic Staff Microcephaly (my-kroh-SEF-uh-lee) is a rare neurological condition in which an infant's head is significantly smaller than the heads of other children of the same age and sex. Sometimes detected at birth, microcephaly usually is the result of the brain developing abnormally in the womb or not growing as it should after birth. Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors. Children with microcephaly often have developmental issues. Generally there's no treatment for microcephaly, but early intervention with supportive therapies, such as speech and occupational therapies, may help enhance your child's development and improve quality of life. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In Brazil, there is a mosquito called Aedes aegypti that can spread a virus called Zika. This virus can cause babies to be born with very small heads, which is a condition called microcephaly. This can lead to serious problems for these babies and sometimes even early death.

Let the shoes cure for a day. Set your design with waterproof acrylic spray. Article:","output":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your Perfect Custom Shoes Introduction Customizing shoes can be an absolute joy and a great way to showcase your personality, creativity, and style. Knowing the proper techniques to apply your design will ensure the end result is long-lasting and visually appealing. Whether you are just starting out in your artistic journey or an experienced designer, preparing and following this step-by-step guide will set you up for success in creating your perfect custom shoes. Step 1: Plan Your Design Carefully The first and most important step in creating custom shoes is to plan your design carefully. Visualize how you want the final design to look, and consider colors, patterns, fonts, and images that best represent your vision and style. While planning, take into consideration the shoe's model and surface area. Reflect on the placement of each design element to maintain balance and aesthetic flow across the shoe. It may be helpful to sketch out your ideas on paper or use a digital design tool. Once you have a solid plan in place, you're ready to move on to the next step. Step 2: Trace Your Design with Pencil Before starting with any permanent additions to the shoe, it is essential to lightly trace your design onto the shoe's surface with a pencil. Begin by ensuring the shoe is clean and free of any debris. Next, trace your planned design onto the shoe in pencil, following your sketch or digital template. While tracing, pay close attention to detail and perfect the design placement on the shoe to avoid any mistakes in subsequent steps. Make sure to create light pencil marks, as they will be easier to fix or erase if needed. This step plays a significant role in ensuring the final design is both accurate and aesthetically pleasing. Step 3: Use Thin-Tip Permanent Marker Once you have traced your design with a pencil, it is time to go over the pencil markings to finalize the design using a thin-tip permanent marker. Opt for high-quality, waterproof, and UV-resistant markers as they provide better longevity to your custom shoes. Carefully follow the pencil lines, taking your time and breathing steadily to maintain a steady hand and precise lines. If needed, make use of masking tape to provide straight outlines and crisp edges. To avoid smudging, start from one end of the shoe and work your way to the other end, so you are less likely to smudge completed parts of your design. Step 4: Let the Shoes Cure for a Day Now that you have completed drawing on the design, it is important to give the shoes time to cure before moving on to the next step. This ensures the marker's ink sets properly into the fabric or surface of the shoe. Leave the shoe to dry and cure for at least 24 hours in a well-ventilated, dry area. Avoid touching the design during this time or exposing it to any moist or damp conditions. Giving shoes ample time to dry and cure will provide the foundation for a durable, long-lasting custom design. Step 5: Set your Design with Waterproof Acrylic Spray To guarantee that your beautiful custom design is protected from wear and tear and remains vibrant over time, set the design with a waterproof acrylic spray. Use a clear, high-quality spray to maintain the appearance of your design. Before spraying, ensure the shoe is positioned in a well-ventilated area, preferably outdoors. Cover any areas you do not want to be coated with the spray using masking tape or a protective cloth. Hold the spray can at a distance of about 12 inches from the shoe, working in light, even strokes to cover the entire design. Multiple light layers are preferred over a single heavy layer to avoid paint drips or excess coating. Allow the shoes to completely dry between layers, following the acrylic spray’s recommended drying time. Once you’ve applied multiple layers of the spray, allow the shoes to dry for an additional 24 hours before wearing or exposing them to any harsh conditions. This will ensure that the coating is completely set and ready to protect the custom design. Conclusion Through careful planning, tracing, application, and preservation, creating custom shoes can be an enjoyable and rewarding project. Show off your artistic skills and unique style with your perfect custom shoes, made all the more special by following this step-by-step guide."},{"instruction":"Q:Article: Sometimes the best advice doesn't come from a book, a microphone, from behind a desk in Washington or even from the people who are the leaders in their fields. Sometimes the best life lessons are found deep in the roots of where we came from. My father passed away years ago, but I always remember the lessons he taught me. Three of them particularly shape my perspective day after day. The first one is that little things make big things happen. To the best of my memory, when I was young, we needed to build a new shed. Those were the days when stores like Home Depot and Lowes didn't exist. Brand-new timber was expensive, so folks often reused the materials that others in the community didn't need. That summer, Dad and I used the boards from an old abandoned barn. We pulled them down one by one, drew the nails out and took off the tin and straightened it in order to reuse it. We got our supplies back to our yard and got to work. I don't know how much of a help I really was, but I chose to stay beside Dad the entire period, working along with him. The sun was hot that day, and sweat formed and ran down our faces. I stood there and handed him the nails one by one, which were hammered into that shed. Dad made me feel proud of my work. Even though I just handed him the nails, he repeatedly emphasized how we built the new shed \\"together\\". He taught me that when you're willing to do hard work, even in little things, big things come together. The second one is that we should honor our promises. As a young man, my father always carried a pocket-sized Bible in his chest pocket. Shortly before the invasion of Normandy in 1944, he prayed for God's protection and promised God that if he made it home, he would make sure his family attended church every Sunday. Well, he made it home and he kept that promise. I cannot remember a Sunday when Dad did not take my mother, my siblings and me to church -- even when we were away on vacation. I now have my Dad's pocket Bible. It is one of my most treasured possessions, and it serves... Question: While building the new shed with his father, the author_.

A:","output":"The last step of the process involves the metamorphic rocks melting and returning to their initial state as magma. This cycle is known as the rock cycle, a fascinating and continuous series of events that illustrate the complex interactions and changes that rocks undergo over time. Here's a detailed explanation of the final step and a brief recap of the entire rock cycle: 1. Metamorphic rocks melting: As metamorphic rocks are subjected to extreme temperatures and pressures, they eventually reach their melting point. This occurs when they are either forced deeper into the Earth's crust or come in contact with molten materials like magma from a nearby volcanic eruption. Once the metamorphic rocks melt, they transform back into magma or molten rock. 2. Magma formation and rise: The now molten rock, or magma, starts to move towards the Earth's surface due to buoyancy forces, as it is less dense than the surrounding solid rock. Magma tends to collect in magma chambers beneath the Earth's crust, where it remains until external forces like tectonic movements or volcanic eruptions cause it to rise further. 3. Volcanic eruptions and cooling: Volcanic eruptions occur when magma reaches the Earth's surface, sometimes in an explosive manner and sometimes by slowly oozing out as lava. As the molten rock is exposed to the cooler temperatures of the Earth's atmosphere, it begins to cool and solidify. This process helps in forming various types of igneous rocks based on their mineral composition and cooling rate. 4. Weathering and erosion: Over time, the newly formed igneous rocks undergo physical and chemical weathering, breaking them down into smaller pieces or sediments. Natural agents like water, wind, ice, and temperature changes contribute to the weathering process. The eroded sediments are transported and deposited in different environments, such as riverbeds, lakes, or seabeds. 5. Sediment accumulation and compaction: The sediments accumulate and, over time, become buried beneath more layers of sediment. As the layers deepen, pressure from the overlying sediments compacts and solidifies them, ultimately forming sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, shale, or limestone. 6. Metamorphism: Under certain conditions of high pressure and/or temperature within the Earth's crust (due to converging tectonic plates, subduction, or deep burial), the sedimentary rocks transform into metamorphic rocks, such as slate, gneiss, or marble. The structure, texture, and/or mineral composition of the rocks will change during this process, but they do not melt. 7. Back to step 1 (melting): The cycle continues as the metamorphic rocks are subjected to even more extreme conditions, eventually melting and returning to their original state as magma, thus completing the rock cycle. The rock cycle demonstrates the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the Earth's crust, with rocks continuously being formed, transformed, and recycled throughout geologic time. This cycle plays a crucial role in shaping the Earth's surface, forming valuable mineral resources, and providing a foundation for understanding geological processes and history."},{"instruction":"Translate from English to Spanish: The family, in conclusion, is not a subject of debate or a terrain for ideological skirmishes.

The town is an important tourist destination known as Zell am See-Kaprun and is a transportation hub for the region. - A ski is a narrow strip of semi-rigid material worn underfoot to glide over snow. Substantially longer than wide and characteristically employed in pairs, skis are attached to ski boots with ski bindings, with either a free, lockable, or partially secured heel. For climbing slopes, ski skins (originally made of seal fur, but now made of synthetic materials) can be attached at the base of the ski. - Snow pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when it precipitates from clouds and accumulates on surfaces, then metamorphoses in place, and ultimately melts, slides or sublimates away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts, seasonally, and causes runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater. - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - A piste is a marked ski run or path down a mountain for snow skiing, snowboarding, or other mountain sports. - The Ski Amadé region of Austria is a network of 28 ski areas and towns that combined, make up the second largest ski area in Europe. It is named after the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who was born in the city of Salzburg. - Skiing is a mode of transport, recreational activity and competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS). - A ski resort is a resort developed for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. In Europe, most ski resorts are towns or villages in or adjacent to a ski area a mountainous area with pistes, ski trails and a ski lift system. In North America, it is more common for ski areas to exist well away from towns, so ski resorts usually are destination resorts, often purpose-built and self-contained, where skiing is the main activity. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district.

The band achieved success in the mid-1980s and are best remembered for their hit single, \\"Your Love\\". The band's lineup consisted of guitarist John Spinks, vocalist and bassist Tony Lewis, and drummer Alan Jackman. They had an unusual experience for a British band in that they enjoyed commercial success in the US, but never in their homeland. 1987 saw the release of their second album, Bangin'. This album did not achieve the acclaim of Play Deep, but it did spawn a Top 40 single \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" (not to be confused with the 1970s Rainbow and Head East hit of the same name) and the minor radio/MTV hit \\"No Surrender\\", and the album was certified Gold in the US A US summer tour opening for Night Ranger followed. For the group's third album, 1989's Voices of Babylon, a new producer (David Kahne) and sound was evident. The title track was a Top 25 single and \\"My Paradise\\" was a mid-sized album-rock hit, but overall the group's popularity continued to decline. After the Babylon LP, Alan Jackman parted ways with the band and was replaced for a concert tour by Paul Read. Spinks and Lewis continued as a duo, switched labels and began recording Diamond Days for MCA. Playing drums on the disc was session drummer Simon Dawson. The LP, released in 1990, produced a Top 30 US hit, \\"For You\\". Quick to follow was \\"One Hot Country\\", included on the soundtrack for the 1991 action film If Looks Could Kill. The Outfield returned with 1992's Rockeye. Its leadoff single, \\"Closer to Me\\", was a near Top 40 hit, and a second release, \\"Winning It All\\", gained some notice due to extensive play during NBC's NBA Finals coverage, NBA Superstars series featuring Larry Bird, the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics and the film The Mighty Ducks.

Options: a ) 5 % , b ) 18 % , c ) 33 % , d ) 44 % , e ) 38 % A:","output":"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound percentage growth: Final Value = Initial Value * (1 + Percentage Increase)^Years Let P_1995 represent the company's profit in 1995. In 1996, the profit increased by 20%. Therefore: P_1996 = P_1995 * (1 + 0.20) In 1997, the profit increased by another 20%, based on the 1996 profit: P_1997 = P_1996 * (1 + 0.20) Now, we substitute the 1996 profit formula into the 1997 profit formula. P_1997 = (P_1995 * (1 + 0.20)) * (1 + 0.20) Simplify the equation: P_1997 = P_1995 * (1.20) * (1.20) P_1997 = P_1995 * 1.44 Now we will find the percentage growth of the profit from 1995 to 1997. Percentage Growth = ((Final Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value) * 100 Percentage Growth = ((P_1997 - P_1995) / P_1995 ) * 100 Substitute the P_1997 equation into the percentage growth formula. Percentage Growth = ((1.44 * P_1995 - P_1995) / P_1995) * 100 Factor out P_1995: Percentage Growth = (1.44 - 1) * 100 Percentage Growth = 0.44 * 100 Percentage Growth = 44% So, the company’s profit in 1997 was 44% greater than its profit in 1995.

Research has shown that mildly depressed people’s moods improve when a task diverts attention to something external such as an activity. Being in a better mood can make it easier for you to be able to open up and talk about your feelings. If you're not in the mood to do an activity, don’t feel pressured to plan one. A conversation over a cup of tea at the kitchen table or on the couch can suffice. The best way to start is to tell her that you have something important you want to share, so she knows not to take your conversation lightly. If you don't know how to bring it up or feel uncomfortable, try saying something like, \\"Hey, I’ve been feeling kind of weird/down/upset lately. Do you think we could talk about it?\\" Make it clear from the beginning of the conversation whether you want her to listen and hear what you have to say, or want her opinion or suggestions. Be sure to let your friend know whether what you're telling them is private or if they are permitted to communicate your difficulties to other people on your behalf. Be as specific and direct as possible. Don't dance around what you need or what you're requesting. It's okay if you get a little tongue-tied and shaky as you talk. Just talking is the hardest part! If you’re having a hard time dealing with your emotions during the actual conversation, it’s okay to admit this to your friend. Letting them know how hard the conversation is for you might even be helpful to your friend to understand your state of mind and how serious the situation is. If you begin to feel overwhelmed at any point during the conversation, it’s okay to take a break, take a deep breath and gather your thoughts. If your friend seems uneasy, break the tension by thanking her for being there and listening, or apologizing for taking up her time or having a hard time talking about it (if that is true). Individuals with depression are sometimes prone to feeling guilty. Guilt can be persistent, but it can also be managed and minimized. If you feel guilty during your conversation, one useful way to manage this perceived guilt is to remember that guilty thoughts are not facts. You are not burdening your friend by sharing your feelings. Your friend is more likely to feel grateful that you trusted her with this information and eager to help your recovery than she is to feel the \\"burden\\" you envision. For your conversation to work, your friend needs to be listening to you completely. There are many ways to hold her attention, including making eye contact, using gesturing and body language (e.g., facing the person, not having your arms or legs crossed), speaking clearly, and avoiding outside distractions (e.g., background noise, people passing, cell phones ringing). Look for signs of active listening. When a person is listening closely, they are deeply focused, trying to understand what you're saying. Check for cues like eye contact, nodding, or meaningful responses to what you're saying (even \\"uh-huh\\" can be meaningful!). People also show that they understand a conversation with their contributions to that conversation. They might repeat or paraphrase what was said, ask follow-up questions, and otherwise be working to keep the conversation going. When people stop understanding or are at a loss for words, they may use filler words. Filler words are “go to” words and can vary from person to person. They may use the same phrases over and over again (e.g., “that is interesting”). They may also trail off (i.e., not finish sentences) or not be working to keep the conversation going. Be aware, however, that these responses can vary from person to person. For example, some people think more clearly when they aren't making eye contact and may deliberately avoid it in order to concentrate on what you are saying. Think about how your friend talks and how she acts when she's paying attention. \\" When a person (like your friend) wants to help, she wants to know what actions she can take. This is part of human psychology: we feel good when we do something for others. Helpful actions can also alleviate some of the guilt your friend might feel when she sees you in distress. You should talk about your feelings as much as you need to, but it helps to end the conversation with something concrete or specific your friend can help you with (such as letting you vent about your feelings for half an hour or taking you out to get your mind off your problems). Recall what you had decided to request or hope for when you were preparing for this conversation and tell your friend about that. Pay attention to your friend and how the conversation is going. When you feel it's time to move on, suggest a different topic or move to end the conversation by saying something like, “We should be getting home,” or, “I’ll let you go, I don’t want to take up too much of your time.” This move is mostly likely up to you, as your friend may feel uncomfortable ending the conversation.

How to choose the right mba program Research the program's academic ranking. One of the biggest factors in most students' graduate program evaluation is how each program ranks nationally. These rankings can give you a better idea of how a given program stacks up to other programs across the country, typically broken down into factors like graduation rate, internship opportunities, and cost of tuition. Choices: (1). Most certificates will cover basic analytical reasoning, or just written down in a way that the student can easily memorize. The academic rating rating for each program is very specific, and some programs do not have any assessment standards at all. (2). The most recent graduate on the rankings will usually major in a top-tier program. Since that ranking would be a relatively small percentage of students' success, the designation will be fairly secure. (3). Start by talking to friends, colleagues, and professors to find out what type of reputation a given school's program has. Read objective rankings online that compare programs across the country. (4). Many programs will not require an mba. Most programs in a graduate program will require that you have a 5-year degree, more frequent hours of practice and an experience with mba programs in addition to a brief course of study.","output":"When choosing the right MBA program, it is essential to consider several key factors to ensure that the program aligns with your personal and professional goals. To make an informed decision, follow these steps: 1. Determine your goals and objectives: Clearly identify your short-term and long-term objectives, such as the industry you want to work in, the specific type of job, or whether you plan to start your own business. Your choice of MBA program should be aligned with these goals. 2. Research the program's academic ranking: As mentioned above, academic rankings are crucial when evaluating MBA programs. Utilize trustworthy ranking sources, such as US News & World Report, Financial Times, and Bloomberg Businessweek, to compare programs on factors like graduation rate, faculty credentials, and internship opportunities. 3. Examine the curriculum and specialization options: Ensure that the program offers coursework and areas of focus that align with your interests and career goals. Some MBA programs may have stronger focuses on certain industries, such as technology, healthcare, or finance. 4. Assess the reputation and network: Reaching out to friends, colleagues, and professors for their insights on different schools can provide valuable information about each program's reputation. Additionally, consider the strength and size of each program's alumni network, as connections can be invaluable for career advancement. 5. Calculate the return on investment (ROI): An MBA program is a significant investment, so there needs to be a balance between the cost, potential salary increases, and opportunities that the program will provide. Analyze factors such as tuition fees, living expenses, program duration, and post-graduation salary potential. 6. Consider the program format: MBA programs come in various formats, such as full-time, part-time, and online. Assess which type of program suits your needs based on your availability, work commitments, and personal preferences. 7. Visit the campus and attend information sessions: Touring the physical campus and attending information sessions, either in-person or virtually, can help you gain a better understanding of the learning environment, facilities, and campus culture. This can be an important factor for many students when choosing the right MBA program. 8. Evaluate faculty credentials: Research the backgrounds, educational experiences, and professional achievements of the faculty members. A strong team of professors with industry experience can enhance the learning experience for MBA students. 9. Focus on internship and job placement opportunities: A good MBA program should have strong connections with companies in various industries, providing students with valuable hands-on experience and job placement possibilities. Research the career services and networking events offered by each program. 10. Speak with current students and alumni: Reach out to current students and alumni to gather more insight into their experiences with a particular program. This will help you understand the program from their perspective, which can provide valuable information when making a decision.

Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%.

Police said nothing suspicious was found after officers searched all of the schools in the province. “The minister of public safety just informed me that all of the schools’ children and personnel are safe. The situation is under control,” the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said at a news conference in Ottawa. Sgt Kevin Baillie of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the Prince Edward Island threat came via fax on Wednesday morning, and that schools on the normally sleepy island were notified within 10 minutes. “There’s been no threat found. Everybody is safe,” he told reporters. The threat was faxed to police in Canada’s capital of Ottawa, Baillie said. “The message stated that the bombs had been placed at a number of schools and would be detonated today,” he said. A senior police official said a “swatting”-style computer distributed a threat to jurisdictions across Canada and in the US and authorities were trying to locate the source. Swatting is when someone contacts emergency services to deceive officials and report a bogus threat so that emergency personnel go to a scene. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about the investigation. Police in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in the central part of Canada are also investigating a threat against the city’s largest school division that appears similar to the one on Prince Edward Island. Police say the Winnipeg school division received a faxed message about 8.30am that contained a threat to all schools within its jurisdiction. Schools were not evacuated or placed in lockdown. Students at more than 60 English language and French language schools in Prince Edward Island were taken to safe locations by staff outside the schools, where buses met them. Baillie said bomb threats were hard to evaluate for credibility, but said authorities like to err on the side of caution. “This disrupts a lot of lives,” he said. Parents and guardians were asked to wait for further instructions before picking up their children. Trudeau said he empathized with parents. “As a parent, I know how worrisome this type of situation can be. I know the affected parents must be having a difficult day,” Trudeau said. Parker Grimmer, the island’s director of public schools, said police had contacted the school system on Wednesday morning about “a threat that was of a significant nature” and asked for the evacuation of all schools. He said he expected all students to return to classes on Thursday. “This is new to us, so we are reacting in a new way,” Grimmer said. “But we have plans and procedures and I think we followed them.” At Holland College in the provincial capital of Charlottetown, a woman burst into the classroom to tell everyone to pick up their books and evacuate immediately, student Morgan McNeil said. Outside, everyone was in a panic and helicopters were flying overhead, he said. Baillie said similar threats had been made to schools and colleges in the nearby province of Nova Scotia, where the Nova Scotia Community College Marconi campus, Cape Breton University and the NSCC technology campus in Halifax were evacuated. At least one school in the US was also threatened, he said. It was not immediately clear which one was involved or if it was evacuated. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1. More than 19,000 students were evacuated from schools in Prince Edward Island, Canada, following a bomb threat received via fax by police. No threat was found after all schools in the province were searched by officers. 2. The threat was sent to the police in Ottawa and said that bombs had been placed at several schools to be detonated on the same day. 3. A similar threat was also received by Winnipeg's largest school division, but no evacuations or lockdowns were initiated. 4. Police suspect that this could be a case of \\"swatting\\", where a person falsely alerts the authorities about a non-existent threat.

Article: Some years ago I had a nephew starting college. I decided to write him an email with some study advice. I just wrote about all of my study habits in college that got me earning A's in almost every class that I took. Since then I have forwarded that email to countless friends and s with kids heading off to school. I decided to stop cutting and pasting emails and put this advice up on a website to make it easier to send on. Inside this site are some very specific things that you can do to get an A in every college class. No magic. Just a set of college study methods and some common sense behaviors that when consistently followed will increase the likelihood of any student getting an A in any class in college. The beauty is that this is simple, common sense stuff, but it works. For example, one plus one equals two. I believe that most anxiety issues are the result of poor performance, not the cause of it. When kids are successful in college, their stress and anxiety go down and they're happy, well-adjusted and enjoying the challenges that go along with it. They aren't looking for excuses for their failure and a reason to come home. The practices you'll find in here include concrete, practical tips that anyone can apply. They will create successful, happy students who get good grades. This isn't a site that you scan through. If you want to learn how to study in college properly, you need to put down the beer and dedicate the time to read it all from start to finish. Developing good study habits takes some time, but only a fraction of the time you'll waste struggling in a just a single class. My intent is to help you make the transition to a successful, and less stressful, college experience.

Independent thinking is identified: When a person starts to question or express disagreement with the doctrines and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses, they are considered to be engaging in independent thinking. 2. Discouragement: Witness publications aim to suppress independent thinking, discouraging followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body. They emphasize the importance of trusting the organization as a part of \\"God's organization.\\" 3. Warning: Members are warned to avoid independent thinking, as it is said to be introduced by Satan the Devil. The religion teaches that independent thinking will cause division among its members. 4. Labeling dissenters: Those who continue to openly disagree with official teachings are labeled as \\"apostates,\\" which is a term used to describe someone who renounces a religious belief or principle. They are further condemned as being \\"mentally diseased.\\" 5. Expulsion and shunning: Members who refuse to conform and continue to openly challenge the religion's teachings are expelled from the organization. Once expelled, former members are shunned by the remaining members, including friends and family, in accordance with the organization's rules.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step in the process of hurricane formation involves the development of a weather disturbance within a tropical region, characterized by low atmospheric pressure and favorable environmental conditions. This weather disturbance is typically caused by the convergence of warm, moist air that rises from the surface of the ocean. As the warm air ascends, it cools and condenses, forming clouds and releasing latent heat, which in turn warms the surrounding air and encourages further condensation. This cycle of rising air and condensation leads to the development of an area of low pressure, which plays a critical role in initiating the rotation necessary for a hurricane to form. Several factors contribute to the formation of this low-pressure system, including the Earth's rotation, which imparts the Coriolis effect that causes the winds to rotate around the center of the disturbance. Also, the presence of a pre-existing weather system, such as a tropical wave or a low-pressure trough, can help trigger the initial convergence of warm, moist air. Once this area of low pressure and rotation is established, thunderstorms begin to develop and cluster around the central region of the disturbance. As these thunderstorms continue to strengthen and feed off the warm ocean water, they release more heat into the atmosphere, causing the air pressure within the system to drop even further. This drop in pressure intensifies the winds around the storm system, ultimately leading to the development of a tropical cyclone. When the sustained wind speeds within the tropical cyclone reach 74 mph (119 km/h) or higher, the storm is officially classified as a hurricane. These powerful storms pose significant risks to coastal regions due to their capacity for producing heavy rainfall, damaging winds, and storm surges, which can lead to widespread flooding and destruction. In summary, the first step of the hurricane formation process is the development of a tropical weather disturbance, marked by low atmospheric pressure and the convergence of warm, moist air. This disturbance sets the stage for the growth and intensification of the storm system, eventually leading to the formation of a hurricane."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that describes the following data: Bhajji, country, India; Bhajji, ingredient, Vegetable.

First, let's simplify the equation. -64*h and 888*h are both parts of the same thing because they have an \\"h\\" so we add them together. That gives us (888 - 64)*h, or 824*h. 2. On the other side, it is like having three different candies (-55671, 9542, and -42039) and you just take them all. So when you add -55671, 9542 and -42039, you get -88168. So now the equation looks like this: 824*h = -88168 3. If you want to find the value of 'h', you have to get rid of the 824 next to it or imagine giving 824 cookies equally among 'h' number of friends. So, you divide both sides by 824, similar to sharing the cookies evenly among the friends. The solution is h = -88168 / 824. When you do the math, that comes out to h = -107. So, the answer to your problem is h = -107. It's like saying you would need -107 buckets to hold -88168 apples if each bucket could hold 824 apples.

The answer to this question is:","output":"In 2012, the official currency of Croatia was the Croatian Kuna (HRK). The Croatian Kuna has been in use since May 30, 1994, when it replaced the Yugoslav Dinar (YUM) following Croatia's independence from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The name \\"Kuna\\" translates to \\"marten\\" in English, which is a small mammal found in the region. The name originates from medieval times when the pelts of these animals were utilized as a standard unit of value in trading. The Kuna is further divided into 100 smaller units known as \\"lipa,\\" which translates to \\"linden tree\\" in English. This naming was influenced by the use of linden tree leaves for currency in ancient times. Both coins and banknotes are issued for the Croatian Kuna. Coin denominations available are 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 lipa, as well as 1, 2, and 5 Kuna coins. Banknotes are issued in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 Kuna. The design of the currency reflects Croatia's rich history, cultural identity, and pride, featuring images of notable Croatian individuals, landmarks, and animals. In 2013, Croatia became the 28th member of the European Union (EU). As a result, there have been discussions about the possibility of Croatia adopting the Euro (EUR) as its official currency in the future. This would replace the Kuna and place Croatia within the Eurozone, alongside other EU member countries who have adopted the Euro as their official currency. However, requirements such as meeting the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary stability must be fulfilled before Croatia can join the Eurozone. Additionally, public sentiment and potential pre-referendum polls may influence the adoption of the Euro in Croatia. In summary, the Croatian currency in 2012 was the Croatian Kuna (HRK), featuring a range of coins and banknotes that celebrated the country's rich history and cultural identity. The possibility of adopting the Euro as Croatia's official currency remains on the horizon but is subject to various economic criteria, public sentiment, and political decisions."},{"instruction":"Q: Translate from English to Hindi.

Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as \\"usurious\\" loans) between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.","output":"The ethics of Jews were dictated by Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities between Christians, and the need for high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries."},{"instruction":"Question: Title: A Must Have!!!!!

A small group of Sonderkommandos, prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an insurrection that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four crematoria and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured, but they don't reveal the plot. Meanwhile, a Hungarian-Jewish doctor, MiklÃ³s Nyiszli (Allan Corduner), who works for the Nazi scientist Josef Mengele in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele himself to visit his wife and daughter in the womenâs labor camp. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengeleâs orders will keep them from the gas chambers. A new trainload of Hungarian Jewish prisoners arrives, and all are immediately sent to the gas chambers. As the group is given instructions about \\"delousing\\", a fearful, angry man in the group begins shouting questions at one of the Sonderkommandos, Hoffman (Arquette), who has been issuing the instructions. Hoffman beats him to death in an outburst of frustration, in an attempt to make the man stop talking.

Purchase styptic powder or corn starch, if you do not have them already. Select a hand towel. Prepare the area where you will trim your guinea pig's nails. Article:","output":"Title: How to Safely and Effectively Trim Your Guinea Pig's Nails Introduction Guinea pigs, also known as cavies, are small, friendly pets that require regular grooming to maintain their health and well-being. One essential aspect of their grooming routine is nail trimming, which, if neglected, can lead to painful ingrown nails, infections, and difficulty in walking. Trimming your guinea pig's nails can be a challenging task, especially if you're a beginner. However, with proper preparation, tools, and technique, you can quickly master this skill and ensure your furry buddy stays comfortable and healthy. This article will guide you through the steps necessary to safely and effectively trim your guinea pig's nails. Step 1: Gather the Necessary Supplies Before you begin, it's important to have the proper tools and supplies at hand. Here's a list of items you'll need for a successful nail trimming session: 1. Nail clippers: Choose a pair of nail clippers specifically designed for small animals, such as guinea pigs. Human nail clippers may not be suitable due to their size and shape. You can find small animal nail clippers at most pet stores or online. 2. Styptic powder or corn starch: In case you accidentally cut too short and cause the nail to bleed, you'll need a styptic powder or corn starch to stop the bleeding. These products help promote clotting and can be found at pet supply stores or in the first aid section of your local pharmacy. 3. Hand towel: A soft, clean hand towel or small blanket is useful for swaddling your guinea pig during the nail trimming process. This can help reduce stress and keep your pet still for easier nail trimming. 4. Treats: It's a good idea to have some of your guinea pig's favorite treats on hand to reward them after the task is done. This positive reinforcement will help build a good association with the nail trimming experience. Step 2: Prepare the Area for Nail Trimming Setting up a comfortable and secure area for nail trimming is crucial for a smooth experience. Follow these steps to prepare the area: 1. Find a quiet, calm space without any distractions, such as loud noises or other pets. This will help your guinea pig stay relaxed during the process. 2. Clean a flat surface, like a table or countertop, where you can comfortably sit and work with your guinea pig. Ensure the area is dry and slip-free to prevent any accidents. 3. Place the hand towel on the surface, then spread out all the supplies you gathered in step 1 within easy reach. Step 3: Safely Trim Your Guinea Pig's Nails With everything prepared, you are now ready to trim your guinea pig's nails. Follow these steps for a safe and successful nail trimming: 1. Gently wrap your guinea pig in the hand towel, leaving their head exposed for comfort. This swaddling method will help keep them calm and secure. 2. Hold your guinea pig with one hand, supporting their chest and hindquarters. With your other hand, gently extend each of your guinea pig's paws one at a time. 3. Using the small animal nail clippers, carefully trim each nail below the \\"quick,\\" which is the blood vessel that runs through the nail. The quick is easier to see in lighter nails and often appears as a pinkish area. If your guinea pig has dark nails, shine a flashlight on the nail from behind to help locate the quick. 4. Clip only a small portion of the nail tip at a time to avoid cutting the quick. If you happen to accidentally cut the quick, use the styptic powder or corn starch to stop the bleeding promptly. Apply pressure with a clean cloth or gauze to help with clotting. 5. Repeat the process for each nail, ensuring your guinea pig stays comfortable throughout. If they show signs of stress or discomfort, take a break and allow them to rest before continuing. Step 4: Post-Trimming Care and Reward Once you've successfully trimmed all of your guinea pig's nails, it's essential to reward them for their patience and cooperation. Offer their favorite treat as positive reinforcement, and place them back in their habitat to roam freely. In conclusion, trimming your guinea pig's nails is an essential aspect of their overall health and grooming care. With the proper tools, preparation, and attention to detail, you can create a stress-free and successful nail trimming experience for you and your furry companion. Remember to maintain a regular grooming routine and be patient with your guinea pig as they become accustomed to this process.

The report, World's Top Rivers at Risk, released ahead of World Water Day (22 March), lists the top ten rivers that are fast dying as a result of climate change, pollution and dams. \\"All the rivers in the report symbolize the current freshwater crisis, which we have been signalling for years,\\" says WWF Global Freshwater Programme Director Jamie Pittock. \\"Poor planning and inadequate protection of natural areas mean we can no longer assume that water will flow forever. Like the climate change crisis, which now has the attention of business and government, we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later.\\" Five of the ten rivers listed in the report are in Asia alone. They are the Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Ganges and Indus. Europe's Danube, the America'sLa Plataand Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Africa's Nile-Lake Victoria andAustralia's Murray-Darling also make the list. Dams along the Danube River -- one of the longest flowing rivers in Europe -- have already destroyed 80 per cent of the river basin's wetlands and floodplains. Even without warmer temperatures threatening to melt Himalayan glaciers, the IndusRiverfaces scarcity due to over-extraction for agriculture. Fish populations, the main source of protein and overall life support systems for hundreds of thousands of communities worldwide, are also being threatened. The report calls on governments to better protect river flows and water allocations in order to safeguard habitats and people's livelihoods. \\"Conservation of rivers and wetlands must be seen as part and parcel of national security, health and economic success,\\" Pittock adds. \\"Emphasis must be given to exploring ways of using water for crops and products that do not use more water than necessary.\\" In addition, cooperative agreements for managing shared resources, such as the UN Watercourses Convention, must be ratified and given...

Question: suppose the heating system breaks down happens, how will it affect the person does not sweat. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"Let us analyze the situation step by step: 1. The heating system breaks down, resulting in a possible decrease in ambient temperature. 2. A person not sweating has no sweat on their body. 3. Since there is no sweat on their body, the cooling effect caused by sweat evaporation, as mentioned in the process, does not occur for this person. Now, to answer the question, we need to determine how the breakdown of the heating system would affect a person who does not sweat: A. More: The person might be more affected as they don't have the cooling effect of sweat evaporation to counteract a potential drop in temperature. However, given that the heating system has broken down, it's not necessarily the case that the person would be more affected by a decrease in temperature. This option does not seem to be an ideal answer. B. Less: The person might be less affected as they don't have the cooling effect of sweat evaporation taking place, which might have intensified the decrease in temperature due to the broken heating system. However, the broken heating system might still cause a decrease in ambient temperature and, regardless of the absence of sweat, the person may still be affected. This option does not seem to be an ideal answer either. C. No effect: The person's ability to maintain their body temperature will not be affected by the absence of sweat and its cooling effect. The broken heating system might still cause a decrease in ambient temperature, but the effect on the person not sweating may not be much different from someone who does sweat. In this scenario, the absence of sweat does not play a significant role in how the person is affected by the broken heating system.

We can analyze the sentiment by breaking it down into its constituent elements. 1. The phrase's subject is \\"uncle ralph.\\" In this context, it seems to be referring to a specific character in a film, rather than a real-life individual. This, in itself, is neutral. 2. The character is described as \\"evil.\\" This word carries a definite negative connotation. Evil characters typically engage in harmful or morally reprehensible actions, and are often viewed as antagonists or villains in a narrative. 3. The descriptor \\"subtle\\" suggests that the character's evil nature isn't immediately evident or overt. This subtlety can make the character more intriguing and complex, as it adds an element of depth to their portrayal. In this sense, it could be considered positive because it could imply that the character is well-crafted and the actor's performance is nuanced. 4. The word \\"complexly\\" serves to emphasize that the character's evil nature is multifaceted and intricate. This description could also be viewed as a positive aspect, as it suggests a well-developed and engaging character, rather than a one-dimensional portrayal often found in less skillfully crafted films. 5. The phrase \\"I've ever seen in the many film\\" indicates that the speaker has watched multiple movies, and among those, this specific portrayal of \\"uncle ralph\\" stands out as being particularly noteworthy in its subtlety and complexity. This is a positive statement, as it implies that the movie featuring this character has managed to surpass others in terms of quality and impact. In summary, the negative aspect of the phrase stems from the character being described as \\"evil,\\" which usually signifies malicious intent and actions. However, the positive aspect is derived from the intricate, subtle, and complex nature of the character and its portrayal, suggesting a well-developed and engaging narrative. Overall, it's a combination of both negative and positive aspects, depending primarily on which aspect an individual chooses to focus on: the character's malevolent nature or the creator's and actor's ability to present this evil trait in a subtle and complex manner."},{"instruction":"Test for natural language inference.

The premise states, \\"This is the fourth rulemaking action which EPA has undertaken to implement the requirement contained in Section 211(l) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\\" From this statement, we can conclude that, at least, four rulemaking actions have been undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement the requirements of Section 211(l) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. However, the statement does not provide enough information to determine if there are any additional rulemaking actions. It is possible that there are more than four rulemaking actions, and the statement merely confirms the existence of at least four. The statement does not explicitly deny the possibility of there being a fifth rulemaking action. For instance, if we learned in a separate statement, \\"The EPA will be undertaking one more rulemaking action before the end of the year which will be the fifth,\\" it would support the hypothesis that there are five rulemaking actions.

The interviewer asks her why she thinks this happened to her and she says that he's really asking why bad things happen to good people. That she and her family didn't do anything wrong and didn't deserve what happened to them.We then jump to 1987 and Sarah is driving her son Matt (Kyle Gallner) home from the hospital where he has been undergoing cancer treatments. Sarah is praying out loud for his recovery when Matt wakes up and jokes with her that talking to herself is the first sign of madness. Sarah tells him that she is talking to God and he tells her that threatening the creator may not be the best idea. They laugh, and then Matt tells her to pull over, as he is about to be sick. Sarah pulls over and sits in the car as Matt vomits by the side of the road.The next morning Sarah is cooking breakfast amidst the chaos of her family.

My question: Why are Matt's fingers bloody? A:","output":"Matt's fingers are bloody because he has been experiencing supernatural occurrences in the house that his family has moved into, which was previously a funeral home. These occurrences begin to take a physical toll on Matt's body. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the house has a dark and sinister history, with spirits that are not at rest. In \\"The Haunting in Connecticut,\\" Matt and his family move to this house to be closer to the hospital where he's receiving cancer treatments. Unknown to them at the time, the house was once a funeral home where séances were conducted, and the spirits that linger are restless and malevolent. As Matt becomes more entangled with the spirits, he begins to experience various forms of physical and emotional suffering. The bloody fingers are a manifestation of the torment that Matt is undergoing due to the disturbing spiritual activity in the house. Furthermore, the supernatural energies trapped within the house take advantage of Matt's weakened physical state due to his ongoing battle with cancer, making him more susceptible to their influence. Throughout the movie, the spirits become more powerful, causing Matt greater harm. His fingers being bloody symbolize this growing power, as well as the increased suffering he endures as a result of being the main target of the spirits inhabiting the house. This paranormal activity ultimately culminates in a terrifying final confrontation between Matt, his family, and the spirits that threaten to tear them apart."},{"instruction":"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Almost any fabric can work, but consider the purpose of the pillow you want.

With heavyweights Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey, one might be tempted to think, how bad could it be? Well, it's a lot worse than you could possibly imagine. The sad and disturbing fact of \\"Boom\\" is that is seems to signal the decline and fall of the aforementioned heavyweights. It was only director Joseph Losey who having plummeted the depths with \\"Modesty Blaise\\" and \\"Boom\\" (some may wish to add \\"Secret Ceremony\\"), managed to recuperate and in 1970 create his best work, the wonderful \\"Go-Between\\". Saddest of all is the work of Tennesee Williams. From the mid forties until the early sixties, Williams penned a number of plays which have gained classic status, remaining in theater repertory throughout the world, many becoming much praised films. When William's muse deserted him, probably owing to his notorious substance abuse, it deserted him for good. Williams at his best is an actor's dream providing many unforgettable performances. (Were Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr ever better than in \\"Night of the Iguana\\" ? ) Taylor in particular, shone in both \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\" and \\"Suddenly Last Summer\\". There is an anecdote in which supposedly Taylor asks John Gielgud whether he would teach her to play Shakespeare, to which he replied \\"if you will teach me to play Tennessee Williams\\". Had Gielgud seen \\"Boom\\" he would have held his tongue. Taylor simply has never been worse, turning in a cringe inducing performance. Despite her face photographing well, she is decidedly podgy. Besides the physical decline, from this time onwards she would basically lose credibility as a serious actress with a string of completely forgettable (and worse) roles to her credit. Much the same could be said of Burton. Following his short lived theatrical stardom, he won fame and fortune in Hollywood. But the body of his work from this point onwards (1968) would be unremarkable to say the least. Noel Coward had long ceased being a force in the theater where his drawing room comedies had been replaced by the likes of Williams and the British \\"angry young men\\". He seems to be enjoying himself camping it up, but barely manages to amuses, that from the man who claimed such a talent. The only cast member who maintains her dignity is young Joanna Shimkus, who in a few years would forego a promising screen career to become Mrs. Sidney Poitier. \\"Boom\\" reeks of self indulgence; it's simply out of control. A rather sad pointer to careers gone wrong rather than a camp fun fest as some have suggested.","output":"The sentiment of the provided review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction with the movie \\"Boom\\" and its notable cast and crew members. They mention that the film is worse than one could possibly imagine, and it represents a decline in the careers of the involved heavyweights, including Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, and Tennessee Williams. The reviewer also highlights the poor performance of Taylor, describing it as \\"cringe-inducing\\" and the physical decline of the actress, which affected her credibility as a serious actress. Additionally, the reviewer criticizes Burton's unremarkable work after 1968 and Noel Coward's inability to amuse in \\"Boom.\\" On a slightly positive note, the reviewer mentions Joanna Shimkus as the only cast member who maintains her dignity, but overall, the review reflects a strong negative sentiment towards the film. The reviewer describes \\"Boom\\" as a self-indulgent and out-of-control production and concludes that it is a sad pointer to careers gone wrong rather than a camp fun fest, as some have suggested."},{"instruction":"Bowling alley is a long narrow track along which balls are rolled in the games of skittles or tenpin bowling.

Our present concern is with how easily and to what extent this cycle can be modified. The question is no mere academic one. The ease, for example, with which people can change from working in the day to working at night is a question of growing importance in industry where automation calls for round-the-clock working of machines. It normally takes from five days to one week for a person to adapt to a reversed routine of sleep and wakefulness, sleeping during the day and working at night. Unfortunately, it is often the case in industry that shifts are changed every week; a person may work from 12 midnight to 8 a.m. one week, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. the next, and 4 p.m. to 12 midnight the third and so on. This means that no sooner has he got used to one routine than he has to change to another, so that much of his time is spent neither working nor sleeping very efficiently. The only real solution appears to be to hand over the night shift to a number of permanent night workers. An interesting study of the domestic life and health of night-shift workers was carried out by Brown in 1957. She found a high incidence of disturbed sleep and other disorders among those on alternating day and night shifts, but no abnormal occurrence of these phenomena among those on permanent night work. This latter system then appears to be the best long-term policy, but meanwhile something may be done to relieve the pressure of alternate day and night work by selecting those people who can adapt most quickly to the changes of routine. One way of knowing when a person has adapted is by measuring his body temperature. People occupied in normal daytime work will have a high temperature during the hours of wakefulness and a low one at night; when they change to night work the pattern will only gradually go back to match the new routine and the... It is possible to find out if a person has adapted to the changes of routine by measuring his body temperature because _ . A) body temperature is higher when the cycle of sleep and wakefulness alternates B) body temperature changes when he changes to night shift or back C) the temperature reverses when the routine is changed D) people have higher temperatures when they are working efficiently A:","output":"The answer is B) body temperature changes when he changes to night shift or back. This is because a person's body temperature tends to be higher during hours of wakefulness and lower during sleep. When they switch from day work to night work, it takes time for their body temperature pattern to adjust to the new sleep/wake cycle. By measuring body temperature, it's possible to determine if someone has successfully adapted to a change in their routine."},{"instruction":"Write a question about the following article: The class of 2021s admission rate was 14.8% of the 7,716 applicants, the lowest acceptance rate in the institutions history.

Rationale: A baby could be a newborn or a 4 month old. A healthcare worker could be a nurse or a Doctor. They could check something other than reflexes. The question and answer:","output":"Question: What are the differences in developmental milestones between a newborn and a 4-month-old baby, and how do healthcare workers, such as nurses and doctors, assess these milestones through various methods besides checking reflexes? Answer: Developmental milestones vary greatly between a newborn and a 4-month-old baby, as these first months of life involve significant growth and development. Healthcare workers, including nurses and doctors, assess these milestones using a variety of techniques beyond checking reflexes. Newborns primarily exhibit primitive reflexes, such as the Moro reflex, rooting reflex, and grasp reflex. They have limited control over their limbs and can typically only make random movements. Their vision is also limited, with a focus of approximately 8-12 inches. Newborns can typically recognize their caregivers' voices and exhibit very early social behaviors such as looking at faces and responding to voices. By four months of age, babies demonstrate more advanced developmental milestones. They typically have better head control and can hold their heads up independently during \\"tummy time.\\" They might start rolling over, reaching for and grasping things, developing hand-eye coordination, and tracking objects with their eyes. Socially, 4-month-olds smile and babble more, responding to their caregivers with intentional vocalizations and facial expressions. Healthcare workers assess these milestones using various methods, such as: 1. Observing the baby's overall physical growth and measuring weight, length, and head circumference to ensure they are following expected growth patterns. 2. Monitoring fine motor skills, such as reaching and grasping objects. 3. Testing gross motor skills, including head control, rolling over and ability to push up on their arms while lying on their stomach. 4. Evaluating social and emotional development by observing the baby's ability to make eye contact, respond to voices, and display facial expressions, such as smiling or frowning. 5. Assessing cognitive development by monitoring the baby's ability to track moving objects, recognize familiar objects and people, and respond to various stimuli, such as sounds and lights. These methods give healthcare workers a comprehensive view of a baby's developmental progress and help them identify any potential concerns or delays that may require further evaluation or intervention."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"كيف يمكنني مساعدتك اليوم؟ This sentence is in Arabic and translates to \\"How can I help you today?\\" The Arabic language is a Central Semitic language and is spoken by over 420 million people across the world, primarily in the Arab world, but also in many other countries as a minority language.

Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters.

If 5 less than 20 hoots per minute are heard coming out of the barn, how many Barnyard owls would this noise be coming from? Let's be accurate as possible.","output":"Let's break this down step by step. 1. We start by finding out how many hoots per minute are being heard: \\"5 less than 20 hoots per minute.\\" 20 - 5 = 15 hoots per minute heard from the barn. 2. Now we know that one Barnyard owl makes 5 hoots per minute. 3. In order to find out how many Barnyard owls are making this noise, we'll divide the total number of hoots we hear by the number of hoots made by one owl. Total number of hoots per minute / Hoots per minute by one owl = Number of owls 15 hoots/minute / 5 hoots/minute/owl = 3 owls So there are 3 Barnyard owls making the noise we hear coming from the barn."},{"instruction":"Leigh Day failed to disclose evidence its Iraqi clients were members of a \\"murderous\\" militia group when it represented them in compensation cases, a tribunal has heard. The claims caused years of anguish to falsely accused soldiers, it was told. Leigh Day and solicitors Martyn Day and Sapna Malik deny 19 misconduct charges. Fellow solicitor Anna Crowther also denies one allegation of misconduct at the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal in London. Without the firm's failures it was unlikely a £31m public inquiry into claims of murder and torture by UK soldiers would have taken place, the tribunal was told. Representing the Solicitors Regulation Authority, Timothy Dutton QC, said: \\"Over a period of more than seven years, Martyn Day, Sapna Malik and Leigh Day made and maintained allegations that soldiers in the British Army had murdered, tortured and mutilated Iraqi civilians.\\" He said the lawyers had continued to act for their clients despite having a document showing they were members of a militia associated with the Mahdi Army, which had ambushed British troops. Mr Dutton said the OMS (Shia militia group Office of the Martyr Al Sadr) detainee List had been in their possession from 2004 onwards and \\"undermined their clients' claims they were innocent bystanders in the Battle of Danny Boy\\". The battle occurred on 14 May when British soldiers were ambushed near to the city of Al Amara by Iraqi insurgents of the Mahdi Army. The tribunal heard Leigh Day had received some £9.5m for its work on the compensation cases. The firm has always said the failure to disclose the detainee list was caused by \\"human error\\" and not professional wrongdoing. Mr Dutton said if the list had been made available to others, it was unlikely legal aid would have been granted to Public Interest Lawyers and the long-running Al-Sweady inquiry would not have gone ahead. Public Interest Lawyers, which submitted multiple allegations of misconduct by British troops during the Iraq War, has since closed down and its lead lawyer, Phil Shiner, has been struck off for misconduct. Mr Dutton said: \\"If the respondents had discharged their duties, British soldiers and their families would not have had to endure torment and years of worry arising from false allegations endorsed by solicitors and members of the profession, made not just in claims but to the world's media.\\" The Al-Sweady inquiry concluded in its final report that the conduct of some soldiers towards detainees breached the Geneva Convention. But it was highly critical of the claims it was initially set up to investigate - that Iraqi detainees had been murdered, mutilated and tortured following the Battle of Danny Boy. It found that British forces responded to a deadly ambush by insurgents with \\"exemplary courage, resolution and professionalism\\". Among the charges the lawyers face is an allegation of prohibited payments made to a person called Mazin Younis, and of improper conduct at a 2008 press conference involving Mr Shiner, where it was claimed that British soldiers had carried out the abuse. The tribunal, which is scheduled to last seven weeks, is expected to be the longest and most expensive in the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal's history. This article was about:","output":"The article discusses a case in which the law firm Leigh Day is facing allegations that it did not disclose evidence that its Iraqi clients were part of a \\"murderous\\" militia group during compensation cases.

The Apples in Stereo, styled as The Apples in stereo, are an American rock band associated with Elephant Six Collective, a group of bands also including Neutral Milk Hotel and The Olivia Tremor Control. The band is largely a product of lead vocalist/guitarist/producer Robert Schneider, who writes the majority of the band's music and lyrics. Currently, The Apples in Stereo also includes longstanding members John Hill (rhythm guitar) and Eric Allen (bass), as well as more recent members John Dufilho (drums), John Ferguson (keyboards), and Ben Phelan (keyboards/guitar/trumpet). The band's sound draws comparisons to the psychedelic rock of The Beatles and The Beach Boys during the 1960s, as well as to bands such as Electric Light Orchestra and Pavement, and also draws from lo-fi, garage rock, new wave, R&B, bubblegum pop, power pop, punk, electro-pop and experimental music. In late 1991, Robert Schneider met Jim McIntyre on a commuter bus in Denver, Colorado. Schneider had recently moved to Colorado from Ruston, Louisiana, and often initiated conversations with McIntyre. When Schneider asked McIntyre what his music interests were, McIntyre named his favorite band: The Beach Boys -- a band Schneider was particularly fond of. Realizing that they shared many musical interests, McIntyre introduced Schneider to Hilarie Sidney. McIntyre already had a band called Von Hemmling in which McIntyre played bass and Sidney played drums. With Schneider, they discussed the idea of starting a band and perhaps a recording label. Schneider later met Chris Parfitt, who was also already in a band at the time that Schneider unsuccessfully auditioned for on bass. Schneider and Parfitt also became friends, however, and toyed with the idea of having a rock band similar to The Velvet Underground or Black Sabbath, with production qualities similar to that of The Beach Boys. Schneider then spent two weeks in Athens, Georgia recording music and spending time with his childhood friends Will Cullen Hart, Bill Doss and Jeff Mangum. He discussed the idea of starting a record label with them (which soon became The Elephant 6 Recording Company). It was also at this time that the name \\"The Apples\\" came about, inspired by the Pink Floyd song \\"Apples and Oranges\\". The earliest incarnation of the band began to form in 1992 upon Schneider's return to Denver, first between Schneider and Parfitt, both of whom played guitar. The two recruited McIntyre and Sidney during the autumn of that year, practicing material through the winter. Their first few live shows took place the following January, many of which were with the band Felt Pilotes. From February to April 1993, the band recorded their debut 7\\" EP, Tidal Wave, and released it in June as the first record ever to bear the Elephant 6 logo.

Rationale: Doctors save lives through medicine they don't enforce laws. The question and answer:","output":"Question: How are the roles of doctors and law enforcement officers different in terms of their responsibilities and contributions to society? Answer: Doctors and law enforcement officers both play crucial roles in society, but their responsibilities and contributions differ significantly. Doctors primarily focus on saving lives and improving the overall health and well-being of individuals. They achieve this through diagnosing, treating, and preventing various illnesses, injuries, and other health-related conditions. Doctors work in various healthcare settings, including hospitals, clinics, and private practices. On the other hand, law enforcement officers are responsible for maintaining law and order in society. Their primary goal is to ensure public safety and protect citizens from harm by enforcing laws, preventing and solving crimes, and apprehending criminals. Law enforcement officers work in different capacities, such as police officers, detectives, and federal agents. In summary, while both doctors and law enforcement officers contribute significantly to the welfare and safety of society, their roles and responsibilities are distinct.

It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Noise rock is a style of experimental rock rooted in noise music. The genre, which gained prominence in the 1980s, makes use of the traditional instrumentation and iconography of rock music, but incorporates atonality and especially dissonance, and frequently discards typical songwriting conventions. Noise rock developed from early avant-garde music, sound art, and rock songs featuring extremely dissonant sounds and electronic feedback. The New York no wave scene, featuring such artists as Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks in the late 1970s, was an essential development in noise rock. - Memphis is a city in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Tennessee and the county seat of Shelby County. The city is located on the fourth Chickasaw Bluff, south of the confluence of the Wolf and Mississippi rivers. - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - Washing Machine is the ninth studio album by the American experimental rock band Sonic Youth , released on September 26 , 1995 by DGC Records .

Question 2: What is the difference between rankine cycle and modified rankine cycle? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Before diving into answering the questions, let me first clarify the concepts: The Rankine cycle is a thermodynamic cycle that converts heat into work, and it's typically used in power plants and heat engines. The cycle consists of four processes: 1) compression in a pump, 2) heat addition in a boiler, 3) expansion in a turbine, and 4) heat rejection in a condenser. The Carnot cycle is an idealized thermodynamic cycle that represents the most efficient heat engine cycle possible. It consists of four reversible processes: 1) adiabatic expansion, 2) isothermal expansion, 3) adiabatic compression, and 4) isothermal compression. Now, let me answer the questions: Question 1: Why is a Rankine cycle used rather than a Carnot cycle in a standard cycle? Answer: The Rankine cycle is used instead of the Carnot cycle in standard cycles because: 1. Practicality: The Carnot cycle requires isothermal heat transfer in both the boiler and the condenser. In practice, it's difficult to realize an isothermal process, whereas the Rankine cycle uses a more practical constant pressure heat transfer process. 2. Efficiency: The Rankine cycle can achieve a good compromise between efficiency and practicality, striking a balance between the difficulties associated with high-temperature heat transfer and the benefits of higher efficiency. 3. Equipment considerations: The Rankine cycle is better suited for large-scale power plants as it allows for the use of equipment like turbines and compressors designed for high pressure and temperature, making it more practical for industrial applications. Question 2: What is the difference between the Rankine cycle and the modified Rankine cycle? Answer: The modified Rankine cycle is an improvement over the standard Rankine cycle that aims to increase thermal efficiency by incorporating additional components or changing specific process elements. Some common modifications include: 1. Regeneration: Adding a regenerative heat exchange stage between high-pressure feedwater and low-pressure steam exiting the turbine. This increases the overall temperature of the feedwater entering the boiler, resulting in less heat being added during the boiling process and higher overall efficiency. 2. Reheat: Expanding the steam in multiple turbine stages and returning it to the boiler between stages for additional reheating. This provides better utilization of the steam's heat energy and further increases efficiency. 3. Superheating: By increasing the temperature of the steam above its saturation temperature, the Rankine cycle's efficiency can be improved as more heat energy can be utilized in the turbine and less heat is rejected in the condenser. In summary, the two questions are not asking the same thing. Question 1 wants to know why the Rankine cycle is preferred over the Carnot cycle, while Question 2 asks about the differences between the Rankine cycle and its modified versions."},{"instruction":"M: Neither.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Raw chicken can contain harmful bacteria, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, that can cause foodborne illnesses when ingested. These bacteria multiply rapidly if the chicken is not properly handled or cooked. While it is common practice to consume raw fish in dishes like sushi, the same cannot be applied to chicken. Cooking chicken to an internal temperature of at least 165°F (74°C) is the best way to ensure that these bacteria are killed, and it is considered the safe minimum cooking temperature for chicken. Additionally, cross-contamination issues may also arise when handling raw chicken; it's important to wash your hands, utensils, and surfaces thoroughly after coming into contact with raw meat. Consuming undercooked chicken also can cause serious health problems, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. While some cultures practice eating raw chicken, it is generally not advised for the general population due to the potential health risks associated with foodborne illnesses. Answer: No"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - A hedgehog is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the Eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae. There are seventeen species of hedgehog in five genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. There are no hedgehogs native to Australia, and no living species native to the Americas (the extinct genus \\"Amphechinus\\" was once present in North America). Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (family Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years. Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life. Hedgehogs' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated porcupines, which are rodents, and echidnas, a type of monotreme. - The gymnure, also called a hairy hedgehog or moonrat, is a type of mammal belonging to the subfamily Galericinae, in the family Erinaceidae and the order Eulipotyphla. Gymnures resemble rats but are not closely related as they are not rodents: they are instead closely related to hedgehogs. They are thought to have appeared in Eastern Asia before their closest relatives, and changed little from the original ancestor, which is thought to have been also the ancestor of the shrews. - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - The is a third-generation home video game console that was manufactured by Sega. It was originally released in 1985 as the Sega Mark III in Japan. After being redesigned prior to its North American launch, the console was renamed Master System and released in 1986 in North America, 1987 in Europe, and 1989 in Brazil. The redesigned Master System was also released in Japan in 1987. Both the Mark III and the original Master System models could play with both cartridges (or \\"Mega Cartridges\\", as they were officially called) and the credit card-sized Sega Cards, which retailed at lower prices than cartridges but had lower storage capacity; the Master System II and later models did not have the card slot. The Master System also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games. - Pince-nez is a style of glasses, popular in the 19th century, that are supported without earpieces, by pinching the bridge of the nose. The name comes from French \\"pincer\\", \\"to pinch\\", and \\"nez\\", \\"nose\\". - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - Amphechinus is an extinct genus of hedgehog of the family Erinaceidae, which lived in Asia and Europe during the Oligocene and in North America, Africa, Asia, and Europe during the Miocene. - A shrew or shrew mouse (family Soricidae) is a small mole-like mammal classified in the order Eulipotyphla. True shrews are also not to be confused with West Indies shrews, treeshrews, otter shrews, or elephant shrews, which belong to different families or orders. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Development of \\"Sonic 3\\" began shortly after the release of \\"Sonic 2\\" in November 1992. It was developed simultaneously with \\"Sonic & Knuckles\\"; as the games were originally developed as a single title until time constraints and cartridge costs later forced the team to split them in two projects. The \\"Sonic & Knuckles\\" cartridge features \\"lock-on\\" technology that allows it to be physically attached to the \\"Sonic 3\\" cartridge, creating a combined game, \\"Sonic 3 & Knuckles\\". - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Sunglasses or sun glasses are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes. They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened. In the early 20th century, they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters being an American slang term for glasses). - Echidnas , sometimes known as spiny anteaters, belong to the family Tachyglossidae in the monotreme order of egg-laying mammals. The four extant species, together with the platypus, are the only surviving members of the order Monotremata and are the only living mammals that lay eggs. The diet of some species consists of ants and termites, but they are not closely related to the true anteaters of the Americas. Echidnas live in Australia and New Guinea. - The biological family Canidae The cat-like feliforms and dog-like caniforms emerged within the Carnivoramorpha 43 million years before present. The caniforms included the fox-like \\"Leptocyon\\" genus whose various species existed from 34 million years before present before branching 11.9 million YBP into Vulpini (foxes) and Canini (canines). Canids are found on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived independently or accompanied human beings over extended periods of time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6 ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4 in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today remains one of the most widely kept domestic animals. - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. - An egg is the organic vessel containing the zygote in which an animal embryo develops until it can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches. An egg results from fertilization of an ovum. Most arthropods, vertebrates, and mollusks lay eggs, although some do not, such as scorpions and most mammals. - In main line of video games, Dr. Eggman is a rotund mad scientist who plans to conquer the world in order to build his own Eggman Empire. While he has gone through several major and minor appearance changes throughout the series, his in-game designs retain several basic characteristics, such as his egg-shaped body, red-black-yellow clothing, pince-nez sunglasses, and large mustache. Eggman possesses ability of creating machines and robots (including wide variety of Badniks), as notably in early games, he has served as a recurring boss in almost every level for piloting one of his created vehicles. - Foxes are small-to-medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. Foxes are slightly smaller than a medium-size domestic dog, with a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or \\"brush\\"). - Obsessive love is a hypothetical state in which one person feels an overwhelming obsessive desire to possess another person toward whom one feels a strong attraction, with an inability to accept failure or rejection. Although not categorized specifically under any specific mental diagnosis by the DSM-5, some people argue that obsessive love is considered to be a mental illness similar to attachment disorder, borderline personality disorder, and erotomania. Obsessive lovers may feel entirely unable to restrain themselves from extreme behaviors such as acts of violence toward themselves. They may be entirely convinced that their feelings are love, and may reject the idea that their severe obsession is not love. Obsessive love has been frequently used and/or exaggerated in mass media, often with a woman having such affections for a man in either a comical or terrifying fashion. - Mad scientist (also mad doctor or mad professor) is a caricature of a scientist who is described as \\"mad\\" or \\"insane\\" owing to a combination of unusual or unsettling personality traits and the unabashedly ambitious, taboo and/or hubristic nature of their experiments. As a motif in fiction, the mad scientist may be villainous (evil genius) or antagonistic, benign or neutral; may be insane, eccentric, or clumsy; and often works with fictional technology or fails to recognize or value common human objections to attempting to play God. Some may have benevolent or good-spirited intentions, even if their actions are dangerous or questionable, which can make them accidental villains. - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - A snout is the protruding portion of an animal's face, consisting of its nose, mouth, and jaw. In many animals the equivalent structure is called a muzzle, rostrum or proboscis. The wet, naked surface around the nostrils of the nose of some animals is known as the rhinarium (colloquially this is the \\"cold wet nose\\" of some animals). The rhinarium is often associated with a stronger sense of olfaction. The snout is considered a weak point on most animals: because of its structure, an animal can be easily stunned, snapped or even knocked out by applying sufficient force. - Eulipotyphla (\\"truly fat and blind\\") is an order of mammals suggested by molecular methods of phylogenetic reconstruction, and includes the laurasiatherian members of the now-invalid polyphyletic order Lipotyphla, but not the afrotherian members (tenrecs and golden moles, now in their own order Afrosoricida). Lipotyphla in turn had been derived by removing a number of groups from Insectivora, the previously used wastebasket taxon. - The tail is the section at the rear end of an animal's body; in general, the term refers to a distinct, flexible appendage to the torso. It is the part of the body that corresponds roughly to the sacrum and coccyx in mammals, reptiles, and birds. While tails are primarily a feature of vertebrates, some invertebrates including scorpions and springtails, as well as snails and slugs, have tail-like appendages that are sometimes referred to as tails. Tailed objects are sometimes referred to as \\"caudate\\" and the part of the body associated with or proximal to the tail are given the adjective \\"caudal\\". - The Sonic the Hedgehog video game franchise began in 1991 with the game Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis , which pitted a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic against a rotund human man named Doctor Eggman ( or Doctor Ivo Robotnik ) . The sequel , Sonic 2 , gave Sonic a fox friend named Tails . Shortly afterward , Sonic CD introduced Amy Rose , a female hedgehog with a persistent crush on Sonic , and Sonic 3 introduced Knuckles the Echidna , Sonic 's rival and , later , friend . All five of these have remained major characters and appeared in dozens of games . The series has introduced dozens of additional recurring characters over the years . These have ranged from anthropomorphic animal characters like Shadow the Hedgehog and Cream the Rabbit to robots created by Eggman like Metal Sonic and E- 123 Omega , as well as human characters like Eggman 's grandfather Gerald Robotnik . The series also features two fictional species : Chao , which have usually functioned as digital pets and minor gameplay and plot elements , and Wisps , which have been used as power - ups . The Sonic games keep a separate continuity from the Sonic the Hedgehog comics published by Archie Comics and other Sonic media and , as a result , feature a distinct yet overlapping array of characters . - Monotremes are basal mammals that lay eggs (Prototheria) instead of giving birth to live young like marsupials (Metatheria) and placental mammals (Eutheria). The only surviving examples of monotremes are all indigenous to Australia and New Guinea, although there is evidence that they were once more widespread. The existing monotreme species are the platypus and four species of echidnas. There is currently some debate regarding monotreme taxonomy. - , originally nicknamed Rosy the Rascal, is a fictional character in Sega's \\"Sonic the Hedgehog\\" series. She is a pink anthropomorphic hedgehog with a cheerful, competitive personality. Amy is known for her unrequited and obsessive love for the series' main character Sonic. They have saved each other's lives on a number of occasions, however, and are good friends. During the series' early years, her appearance changed several times. - The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and production of anime works in Japan has since continued to increase steadily. The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences. - Porcupines are rodentian mammals with a coat of sharp spines, or quills, that protect against predators. The term covers two families of animals, the Old World porcupines of family Hystricidae, and the New World porcupines of family Erethizontidae. Both families belong to the clade Hystricognathi within the profoundly diverse order Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of quills: despite this, the two groups are distinct from each other and are not closely related to each other within Hystricognathi. - Knuckles debuted as an antagonist in \\"Sonic the Hedgehog 3\\" in 1994; Doctor Eggman tricks him into opposing Sonic and Tails. He first became playable in \\"Sonic & Knuckles\\" later that year; he learns of Eggman's trickery and teams up with Sonic during that game's events. Since then he has appeared in dozens of playable and non-playable roles, as well as in several series of comic books, Western animated television, and Japanese anime. He is one of the series' most popular and recognizable characters. - In biological classification, a subfamily (Latin: ', plural ') is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus. Standard nomenclature rules end subfamily botanical names with \\"-oideae\\", and zoological names with \\"-inae\\". - Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India. - The Sega Genesis, known as the in most regions outside North America, is a 16-bit home video game console which was developed and sold by Sega Enterprises, Ltd. The Genesis was Sega's third console and the successor to the Master System. Sega first released the console as the Mega Drive in Japan in 1988, followed by a North American debut under the Genesis moniker in 1989. In 1990, the console was distributed as the Mega Drive by Virgin Mastertronic in Europe, by Ozisoft in Australasia, and by Tec Toy in Brazil. In South Korea, the systems were distributed by Samsung and were known as the Super Gam*Boy, and later the Super Aladdin Boy.

The search for a missing Alaska family of four has expanded to a densely wooded forest near a jail close to the family's home, but officials said there has been no information to lead them to look in any specific location. Crews are using a helicopter and all-terrain vehicles to search for Rebecca Adams, 22; her daughters, Michelle Hundley, 5, and Jarraca Hundley, 3; and Adams' boyfriend, Brandon Jividen, 37. Investigators also asked the public for information on the family missing for two weeks from their home in Kenai, about 65 miles southwest of Anchorage. A desperate search is underway for Michelle Hundley, five, (pictured left) and her sister, three-year-old Jaracca (right) who went missing from their Alaska home with their mother and her boyfriend last month. 'Don't assume information isn't worthwhile; we want to hear anything that may help,' Police Chief Gus Sandahl said. Adams last had contact with relatives May 27, the day after Memorial Day. The latest physical evidence of a sighting for Adams, Sandahl said, was an appearance with her children on a video surveillance recording May 18 at a Kenai business. Local police received a call. from a neighbor on May 31 who reported that a backyard shed door was. lying open at the family's home. Five. days later on June 5, the same neighbor contacted the police to report. that the family home appeared to have been lying empty for days. Lanell. Adams, who flew to Alaska from Washington state to look for her sister,. said: 'I've called dozens of times. I'm scared more than anything.' Rebecca Adams, 22, (left) vanished last month from her apartment in. Kenai along with her partner Brandon Jividen (right) and her two young. daughters. Adams said the last contact she had with her sister was distressing. The two women talked on the phone on Memorial Day weekend. 'She. sounded very distressed,' Lanell Adams said. 'She just told me: ''Know. that I love you,'' and she had to get off the phone very quickly.' 'Growing. up we always had this thing, we say 'Thou shall not lie' and you. always have to tell the truth,' Lanell Adams said. 'I asked her, ''Thou. shall not lie, Becca, are you ok?' She said, ''Don't ask me that right. now. Just know that I love you.' Police began investigating last weekend, and the FBI joined in the search. The family lives in a four-plex near the Wildwood Correction Facility, but they failed to pay rent this month. Residents tell the Peninsula Clarion the neighborhood is quiet but has a transitory nature. 'We don't know everybody in our building, much less buildings down the street,' said Amy Murrell-Haunold, who lives on the same street as the missing family. The FBI are looking for the two sisters who went missing with their mother and her partner in rural Alaska. Jeff Pfile and Anna Haave manage the building where the family has lived for two years. They said it was unusual for the Adams and Jividen to be late with a rent payment. 'If I felt they were going out of town I would have been the first person they called because they are so responsible (for paying their rent on time),' Haave said. 'For them to not say anything is not normal.' Police say vehicles belonging to Jividen and Adams remain parked at the four-plex, and their cellphones have been turned off. The family's brown and white English springer spaniel named Sparks also is missing. The father of her two girls, Jaramiah Hundley, died in a motorcycle crash in May 2012. Besides local police and the FBI, fire officials, canine units and wilderness search groups from across Alaska have been brought to Kenai to help search. Alaska State Troopers provided a helicopter to help search from the air, and police have used all-terrain vehicles on trails in woods near the home. The search area has expanded to areas north of the correctional facility. Dog teams. and helicopters have been drafted in to search the area surrounding. Kenai. On the lookout: A massive search for a family of four in Alaska is focusing on nearby woods and the behavior of one of the missing, a mother of two young children. The family disappeared from their home in Kenai, Alaska last month after relatives said that the mother, Rebecca Adams was showing signs of distress. Lt. David Cook told ABC: 'At this point it’s not apparent where. they have gone or where they might be. 'The investigation. does not show that is foul play at this point, but we are very deep into. the investigation of the missing persons.' Lt. Cook added: 'The family has expressed some concern. with the behavior of their sister Rebecca and have some concerns within. her relationship [to Brandon].' A Facebook group called Seeking. Alaska's Missing shared a picture of the missing family and urged. anyone with information to contact the Kenai Police Department. The. poster claimed that the family went missing on May 27. Police say they receive new information about the missing family every day, but nothing that would lead to finding them or even a specific location to search. 'We remain optimistic we will be able to reunite them with their family,' Sandahl said. 'We want nothing more at this point and hope they are safe.' Family members have put up fliers of the missing family members in popular fishing areas the family frequented on the Kenai Peninsula, and police statewide have been alerted, Sandahl said. No detail about their possible whereabouts is insignificant, he said. Kenai, a rural fishing port in the Gulf of Alaska, has a population of around 7,000 people and is 160 miles from Anchorage.

(CNN) -- The best chocolate cake I ever ate in Kabul was tucked away on a discreet corner near the city's diplomatic area. Kamal Hamade, the well-known and loved Lebanese owner of Taverna du Liban, made sure every visitor to his restaurant had a piece of gooey cake on the house, and then some. On Saturday, the Taliban attacked the cozy Lebanese restaurant in Afghanistan's capital. One man detonated a suicide vest while two others stormed into the restaurant and fired at those inside, killing 21 people, 13 of them expatriates. One of them was Kamal. Taverna had a decent security routine in place: Visitors drove up and knocked. The Afghan guard slid open the peep hole to take a look. The patron was searched before being let in to the restaurant a short distance away from the metal-door entrance. In January 2011, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a supermarket popular with expatriates and middle-class","output":"Afghan families, marking a shift in the insurgents' tactics toward targeting civilian spaces that were once considered relatively safe. The attack on the Finest supermarket that day shook the international community in Kabul, causing an unprecedented level of fear and uncertainty about the future. Security measures were tightened not just around embassies and official buildings, but also in restaurants, shopping centers, and other places where foreigners and affluent Afghans were known to frequent. Despite these increased security precautions, the attack on Taverna du Liban served as a stark reminder of the unpredictable and brutal nature of the Taliban's insurgency. Those who had once enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and delicious food at Kamal's restaurant now found themselves mourning the loss of a beloved community fixture. Friends and patrons from around the world expressed their heartfelt condolences on social media, sharing stories of their experiences at Taverna and cherishing the memories of Kamal's infectious smile and warm hospitality. The days following the attack saw a city enveloped in shock and grief. Families and friends of the victims held somber memorial services to honor their lost loved ones. Non-governmental organizations and foreign missions considered relocating their staff to safer locations or even leaving the country altogether. For both local residents and the expatriate community, the once-thriving social scene in Kabul had become yet another casualty of the ongoing conflict. But amidst all the pain and sorrow, there were also faint glimmers of hope and resilience. In the wake of the Taverna tragedy, Kabul's residents began to rally together, embracing a spirit of unity and defiance against the terror that had been inflicted upon their city. Vigils were held, and fundraising events were organized to support the families of those who had perished. International and Afghan artists came together to create murals, installations, and other works of art to commemorate the victims and symbolize the city's determination to rise above the violence. As life slowly started to regain some semblance of normalcy, the memories of Kamal and his famous chocolate cake continued to live on in the hearts and minds of those who had been fortunate enough to experience his generosity and warmth. People from all walks of life spoke of their resolve to keep his spirit alive by fostering a culture of camaraderie, openness, and friendship in the face of adversity. And so, while the tragic events of that fateful Saturday night in January 2011 may have cast a long shadow over Kabul, the enduring legacy of Kamal Hamade and Taverna du Liban serves as an inspiring testament to the power of community, compassion, and love in the darkest of times. The best chocolate cake in Kabul and its creator left a bittersweet taste that would forever remind the city and its people of all that they had lost, as well as all that they had gained in the process of healing and rebuilding."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given this review: \\"Its great just wish you didn't need wifi to listen to music.\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

A:","output":"Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say that \\"be tired\\" would be a valid answer to the question \\"What will happen to Skylar?\\". To infer that Skylar will be tired, there would need to be more context or information given about the situation. For example, if it was mentioned that the event is extremely long, occurring late at night, or involves a exhausting activities, then we might be able to more confidently speculate that Skylar will end up being tired. In addition, without more information about who Skylar and Remy are and what their relationship is like, we cannot accurately predict Skylar's experience or state of mind. If Remy is a talkative, energetic, or intense individual, it could be more tiring for Skylar to spend time with him. Conversely, if Remy is quiet or laid-back, or if Skylar is highly social and enjoys meeting new people, it could be less physically exhausting for Skylar. However, it is also important to note that the fatigue Skylar might experience could be either physical or emotional. Spending time with someone who is alone at an event could potentially be emotionally draining, especially if that person is feeling sad, anxious, or socially awkward.

To brown butter","output":"Browning butter is a simple, yet transformative process that unlocks intense nutty and complex flavors from regular unsalted butter. When done right, brown butter can elevate various dishes, from sautés and pasta sauces to cookies and brownies. Here's a detailed guide to help you achieve perfectly browned butter: 1. Choose the right butter: It is essential to start with good-quality unsalted butter since the flavor of the final product greatly depends on it. Lower-quality butter might contain more water, which can affect the browning process. Unsalted butter is preferred as it allows you to control the salt content of your dish. 2. Prepare the tools: For optimal results, you'll need a light-colored pan with a heavy bottom, like stainless steel or enameled cast iron. The lighter color allows you to monitor the color change more easily, avoiding burning. Additionally, the thick bottom conducts heat more evenly, preventing the butter from scorching. You will also need a heat-resistant spatula or a wooden spoon for stirring and a bowl to collect the browned butter. 3. Cut the butter into small pieces: This ensures that the butter melts evenly and more quickly. It'll also help you to monitor the browning more effectively. 4. Heat the pan: Place the pan on the stove over medium heat and let it get warm. 5. Melt the butter: Add the butter to the pan and stir gently to promote even melting. Make sure to scrape the bottom and sides to prevent any butter from sticking and brown spots from forming. 6. Monitor the stages: Keep an eye on the color change and listen to the changes in sizzling sounds. It will go through three main phases: a. Foaming: In this first stage, the butter will foam up as the water content starts to evaporate. The sizzling will get louder and the foam will rise. Keep stirring, watching, and listening. b. Subsiding foam: The foam will begin to subside and the butter will start to smell nutty. At this point, the milk solids will separate and sink to the bottom, so keep stirring to prevent them from burning. c. Browning: The butter will reach a golden brown color, and the milk solids at the bottom will turn brown as well. The sizzling sound will subside, indicating that most of the water content has evaporated. 7. Keep a watchful eye: This is the critical stage when the milk solids can easily go from browned to burned. Make sure not to walk away and pay close attention to the smell, color, and sound. 8. Remove the pan from heat: As soon as the butter reaches a deep golden brown color and has a fragrant nutty smell, remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat will continue to cook the milk solids in the pan, so it is essential to remove it from the heat source at the right time. 9. Pour the browned butter into a bowl: To stop the cooking process and prevent the brown butter from burning, transfer it immediately to a heatproof bowl using the spatula or spoon to scrape every last bit. 10. Cool and store: Let the brown butter cool down before using it in your recipes. You can store it at room temperature for up to a week or refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to a month. If refrigerated, it will solidify and require gentle reheating before using it in your dishes. By following these steps and paying attention to the visual and audible cues, you'll be able to master the art of browning butter, which is sure to indulge your senses and enhance your culinary creations."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Persian.

When the voice in your head sounds like Eeyore, it's pretty hard to get pumped up. But when it's saying things like, \\"9 AM -- BE AWESOME. 10 AM -- Dominate gym class LIKE A BOSS. 11 AM - Rock the chemistry test,\\" it's pretty hard to not feel like the Energizer bunny. So get to training your head for energy. It's here to pump you up, even if it doesn't sound much like Arnold Schwarzenegger. The idea here is to A) talk to yourself in exclamation points -- with enthusiasm, with excitement -- but also B) talk to yourself positively. It's very hard to get enthusiastic about failing or things not going your way. So to energize your thoughts, think brighter. There's a reason we wear black to funerals! Turns out wearing bright colors can make you happier and more energized. In other words, hyper! So if you were thinking of going goth, sorry. You'd be better off going Rainbow Brite. Looking at bright colors can do it, too. It's as if the bright colors cue your brain to get ready for fun and excitement. No wonder adults get tired -- they're constantly around blacks, blues, and tans. They need a little orange in their lives! Okay, that's probably the funniest thing you could do. But really, getting wet at all alerts your system, waking up all your senses. Showers can actually get your metabolism going! So go splash some water on your face or go puddle jumping -- it's all good! It also wipes away stress, almost literally. So if you're feeling worried about something (which can be a total drag), aim for the water. Maybe life should be one giant pool party, huh? If prom were to happen every day, it wouldn't be special. Very few people would get excited and the buzz it cultivates just wouldn't be there. But when dressing up (even if it's not prom) rolls around only once every so often, it creates this intangible excitement that you can't help from feeling energized about. So take this Friday night to get dressed to the nines! You don't have to put on a prom dress or tux to see this effect. Just throwing on nice clothes can put you in a good mood, especially if your friends are doing it too. When it comes to effects like these, there's definite power in numbers! Turns out plopping yourself down in front of the TV is more than just relaxing -- it's energy-zapping and turns you into a vegetable. You end up not wanting to do anything but sit there and the cycle just gets worse. So if there's a show you absolutely have to watch, watch it, but then get up off your butt! Instead, try playing games -- even if it's just Words with Friends on Facebook! It's the same relaxing stuff, but it keeps your brain entertained and just plain going -- instead of zoning out and shutting down like it does when you crawl in front of the tube. We've sort of touched on this already, but let's lay it on the line: it's super hard to be hyper when you're down in the dumps. When you think of a sad person, are they running about, flailing their arms, screaming for the hilltops, and being, well, unstoppable? No. Never. So if you want to get hyper, you'll need to beat those nasty thoughts into submission. There's no room for worry, regret, or sadness here. You need a reason for that pep in your step! So whatever makes you happy, do it. Dance naked in your living room. Spend the night baking 3,197 sugar cookies. Play online chess for 4 hours and then do your homework. If it gets your endorphins going, it's good.

He was the first prime minister and president of Ghana, having led it to independence from Britain in 1957. An influential advocate of Pan-Africanism, Nkrumah was a founding member of the Organization of African Unity and winner of the Lenin Peace Prize in 1962. After twelve years abroad pursuing higher education, developing his political philosophy, and organizing with other diasporic pan-Africanists, Nkrumah returned to Gold Coast to begin his political career as an advocate of national independence. Context: Beginning in April 1949, there was considerable pressure on Nkrumah from his supporters to leave the UGCC and form his own party. On 12 June 1949, he announced the formation of the Convention People's Party (CPP), with the word \\"convention\\" chosen, according to Nkrumah, \\"to carry the masses with us.\\" There were attempts to heal the breach with the UGCC; at one July meeting, it was agreed to reinstate Nkrumah as secretary and disband the CPP. But Nkrumah's supporters would not have it, and persuaded him to refuse the offer and remain at their head. The CPP adopted the red cockerel as its symbol - a familiar icon for local ethnic groups, and a symbol of leadership, alertness, and masculinity. Party symbols and colours (red, white, and green) appeared on clothing, flags, vehicles, and houses. CPP operatives drove red-white-and-green vans across the country, playing music and rallying public support for the party and especially for Nkrumah. These efforts were wildly successful, especially because previous political efforts in the Gold Coast had focused exclusively on the urban intelligentsia. The British convened a selected commission of middle-class Africans, including all of the Big Six except Nkrumah, to draft a new constitution that would give Ghana more self-government. Nkrumah saw, even before the commission reported, that its recommendations would fall short of full dominion status, and began to organise a Positive Action campaign. Nkrumah demanded a constituent assembly to write a constitution. When the governor, Charles Arden-Clarke, would not commit to this, Nkrumah called for Positive Action, with the unions beginning a general strike to begin on 8 January 1950. The strike quickly led to violence, and Nkrumah and other CPP leaders were arrested on 22 January, and the Evening News was banned. Nkrumah was sentenced to a total of three years in prison, and he was incarcerated with common criminals in Accra's Fort James. Nkrumah's assistant, Komla Agbeli Gbedemah, ran the CPP in his absence; the imprisoned leader was able to influence events through smuggled notes written on toilet paper. The British prepared for an election for the Gold Coast under their new constitution, and Nkrumah insisted that the CPP contest all seats. The situation had become calmer once Nkrumah was arrested, and the CPP and the British worked together to prepare electoral rolls. Nkrumah stood, from prison, for a directly-elected Accra seat. Gbedemah worked to set up a nationwide campaign organisation, using vans with loudspeakers to blare the party's message. The UGCC failed to set up a nationwide structure, and proved unable to take advantage of the fact that many of its opponents were in prison. In the February 1951 legislative election, the first general election to be held under universal franchise in colonial Africa, the CPP was elected in a landslide. The CPP secured 34 of the 38 seats contested on a party basis, with Nkrumah elected for his Accra constituency. The UGCC won three seats, and one was taken by an independent. Arden-Clarke saw that the only alternative to Nkrumah's freedom was the end of the constitutional experiment. Nkrumah was released from prison on 12 February, receiving a rapturous reception from his followers. The following day, Arden-Clarke sent for him and asked him to form a government. Question: Who is Kwame Nkrumah? Answer:","output":"Kwame Nkrumah was a Ghanaian politician, revolutionary, and the first Prime Minister and President of Ghana. Born on September 21, 1909, and passing away on April 27, 1972, Nkrumah played a pivotal role in Ghana's independence from British colonial rule in 1957. He was an influential advocate of Pan-Africanism, a founding member of the Organization of African Unity, and a recipient of the Lenin Peace Prize in 1962. Nkrumah spent twelve years abroad, attaining higher education, developing his political philosophy, and organizing with other diasporic Pan-Africanists before returning to Gold Coast (now Ghana) and beginning his political career as an advocate of national independence. In June 1949, Nkrumah formed the Convention People's Party (CPP), which adopted the red cockerel as its symbol. The CPP was instrumental in mobilizing public support for independence from Britain, and its members played a significant role in the quest for national self-governance. In January 1950, Nkrumah called for \\"Positive Action,\\" which included a general strike aimed at achieving a more inclusive constitution for Ghana. However, this led to violence, and Nkrumah was arrested on January 22, 1950. Despite being imprisoned, he remained influential within the CPP, and the party participated in the February 1951 legislative election—the first held under universal franchise in colonial Africa. The CPP won in a landslide, securing 34 of the 38 contested seats, with Nkrumah elected as the representative for his Accra constituency. Following the electoral victory, Nkrumah was released from prison and called upon by Governor Charles Arden-Clarke to form a government. As Prime Minister and later President of Ghana, Nkrumah became a symbol of African independence and an active proponent of Pan-Africanism."},{"instruction":"İvanov'un Mart ayında tutuklanmasından 40 gün sonra baskı altında görevinden istifa eden eski İçişleri Bakanı Rumen Petkov, savcıların bir Devlet Ulusal Güvenlik Dairesi ajanının kimliğini sızdırdığı yönündeki iddialarına rağmen milletvekilliğini sürdürüyor.

He made a living by teaching the piano and publishing songs, piano pieces and orchestral suites, all in the popular style of the day. Prix de Rome winners were sometimes invited by the Opéra-Comique in Paris to compose a work for performance there. At Thomas's instigation, Massenet was commissioned to write a one-act opéra comique, La grand'tante, presented in April 1867. At around the same time he composed a Requiem, which has not survived. In 1868 he met Georges Hartmann, who became his publisher and was his mentor for twenty-five years; Hartmann's journalistic contacts did much to promote his protégé's reputation.In October 1866 Massenet and Ninon were married; their only child, Juliette, was born in 1868. Massenet's musical career was briefly interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, during which he served as a volunteer in the National Guard alongside his friend Bizet. He found the war so \\"utterly terrible\\" that he refused to write about it in his memoirs. He and his family were trapped in the Siege of Paris but managed to get out before the horrors of the Paris Commune began; the family stayed for some months in Bayonne, in southwestern France.After order was restored, Massenet returned to Paris where he completed his first large-scale stage work, an opéra comique in four acts, Don César de Bazan (Paris, 1872). It was a failure, but in 1873 he succeeded with his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle's tragedy Les Érinnyes and with the dramatic oratorio, Marie-Magdeleine, both of which were performed at the Théâtre de l'Odéon.

Then she lets herself in the back of the home in the utility room desperately searching for her father.In the basement of his home, Billy Pilgrim, a balding, bespectacled, mild-mannered, and passive man of 45 years of age is typing a letter to his local daily newspaper of his time travels and how he is uncontrollably traveling from one point of his life to the other, being \\"unstuck in time\\". While he is typing his letter, he finds himself at the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium in January 1945, at the age of 22 alone and running through the snow. He is not dressed as a soldier at all, no weapon, and wearing a stocking cap, overcoat, sweater, and pants that are nothing suggesting Army attire. He is kidnapped by two brash, uncouth, mean, and very stupid men of his age, fellow soldiers named Paul Lazzaro and Roland Weary. They immediately think he's a German, but he denies it and they soon forget about it, since there's an attack going on. The men's Corporal abandons them and Lazzaro swears revenge.Briefly, Billy finds himself back on planet Tralfamadore in the geodesic dome with beautiful, 20-something porn star queen, Montana Wildhack and she suspects he's time traveling again and wants to give him a kiss to help forget about it. Simultaneously, Billy is back at the Battle of the Bulge and Paul Lazzaro hears him say \\"a little kiss\\" and Lazzaro is outraged beyond rationalization and accuses Billy of being homosexual, violently attacking him. Shortly after, two German guards take them at gunpoint tell them to get up and for Weary to give up his bootsIt is the summer of 1946, at Cape Cod,...
