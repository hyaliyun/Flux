Answer the following question: For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

His exit is coming up soon so he let's up on the gas a little and makes a left turn onto the exit. After a short way he pulls into a parking lot reaching his destination.  and a hint : A car’s gas pedal, like the one in Figure below , is sometimes called the accelerator. That’s because it controls the acceleration of the car. Pressing down on the gas pedal gives the car more gas and causes the car to speed up. Letting up on the gas pedal gives the car less gas and causes the car to slow down. Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force.  Please answer this question : Given a car is accelerating, is it being acted upon by a balanced or unbalanced force? Answer:","output":"Given a car is accelerating, it is being acted upon by an unbalanced force.  Justification: Acceleration occurs when there is a change in velocity, which could be due to speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction. In the situation, Eric lets up on the gas pedal, which causes the car to slow down, and then he makes a left turn, changing the car's direction. Both of these actions indicate acceleration, which means an unbalanced force is acting upon the car. A balanced force would result in no change in velocity, meaning the car would maintain its speed and direction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the context: Why did Casey do this? A:","output":"Casey asked about the strange car parked near her home yesterday due to a combination of curiosity, concern, and a sense of responsibility for her surroundings.  1. Curiosity: As human beings are naturally curious creatures, it is normal for people to question anything out of the ordinary. Casey may have observed the unfamiliar car in a place where it did not belong and wanted to know the reason for its presence. This curiosity could stem from a simple desire to learn more about what is happening in her environment and keep herself informed. 2. Concern: Another reason for Casey's inquiry could be her concern for the safety and well-being of herself and those around her. The sudden presence of an unknown vehicle might have raised suspicion that something was amiss or that someone might be trespassing on her property. In this case, Casey would want to identify the owner or purpose of the vehicle to determine if it posed a potential threat, or if it was merely a harmless coincidence. 3. Sense of responsibility: As a member of a community or neighborhood, one often feels a sense of responsibility to stay aware of and involved in the events happening around them – especially when it comes to safety and security. Casey might have felt it was her responsibility to find out about the strange car and address any potential issues it might represent. By doing so, she could contribute to maintaining a secure and peaceful community. 4. Protecting personal property: If the strange car was parked on or near Casey's property, her interest could be driven by a desire to protect her assets. Seeing an unfamiliar vehicle so close to home might have made her worry about potential theft or vandalism. In this case, Casey would be asking the question to ensure her property and belongings are safe, as well as monitor any potential neighborhood threats. 5. Social connection: Finally, Casey might have asked about the strange car to establish or maintain connections with her neighbors or community members. Expressing concern or curiosity about an unusual situation can create opportunities for conversation and strengthen ties among neighbors. By seeking information about the vehicle, she could be engaging with others and solidifying her position within the community as someone who is invested, attentive, and proactive. In conclusion, Casey's decision to ask about the strange car parked near her home can be attributed to several factors. Her desire to satisfy her curiosity, her concern for her safety, and her sense of responsibility towards her community all play a role in prompting her to seek more information about the situation. This shows that she is attentive and proactive in keeping herself and her surroundings safe and secure while maintaining social connections within her community."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Gothic architecture: Increasing military and cultural contacts with the Muslim world, including the Norman conquest of Islamic Sicily in 1090, the Crusades, beginning 1096, and the Islamic presence in Spain, may have influenced Medieval Europe's adoption of the pointed arch, although this hypothesis remains controversial.

However, on the night they are to sign treaties to unite their kingdom, the Irish penetrate the Castle Tantallion, slaughtering all but a few of the English. Among these is young Tristan of Eragon, whose life is saved by Lord Marke, Britain's only promising leader remaining.As Tristan enters his young adult years, having been raised and nurtured by Lord Marke, he uses his sharpened knowledge and cunning battle skills to fight bravely against the Irish when they cross into the Land of Cornwall.

Part of being self-reliant is undertaking certain responsibilities that enable people to experience independence.  Doing simple things such as paying your bills on time, cleaning up after yourself if you make a mess, and going to work or school on time can help you feel more responsible and self-reliant. If you do not have a job, you have the responsibility of looking for a job, seeking education that will lead to employment, or starting your own business. Information is power, so having information will give you the power to make your own decisions and assert your independence.  Try to be well-rounded and keep up with information about what is going on in your place of business or school, your town, your state, your country, and the world. For example, knowing that a local ordinance determining whether backyard chickens can be kept in your area is coming up for a vote can give you the opportunity to lobby and vote for the ability to keep chickens for fresh eggs. You should have a sense of direction.  Something has to drive you.  For example, if you are attending college, you should at least have an idea of what you want to do after college and what you are passionate about studying.  You should also try to set goals for yourself.  Try setting short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals, then be realistic about what you need to do to meet those goals.  Seek out a career counselor if you are not sure what you’d like to do with your life.  Career self-assessments can be found online. Many websites like this one or this one can offer helpful guidance. Most schools have career centers or guidance counselors available to all enrolled students.  These resources can help you shape a vision for your future. Allowing people to make your decisions for you is essentially giving up your independence and self-reliance.  Assert yourself and make decisions for yourself based on your goals and dreams.  While it is important to be considerate towards other people, it is not necessary to give up your ability to make your own decisions.  For example, if you are looking for a place to live with a roommate, be sure you are making decisions based on what is best for you.  If you prefer to rent a house and have a bit more independence than an apartment building, stick to your preference and do not allow your roommate to talk you into something that you don’t want to do. It can also be common for some people to allow their spouses or significant others to make all the decisions in their relationship, from where to go out to eat to where to live and what kind of car to buy.  Changing the dynamic of such a relationship may strain the relationship, but having a part in the decision making at both daily and long-term levels can give you greater control of your life.

Answer the following question: Question: what is phylum cnidaria I found the following answer on Google: Recent analyses have concluded that cnidarians, although considered more \\"primitive\\" than bilaterians, have a wider range of genes. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the statement that cnidarians are considered more \\"primitive\\" than bilaterians and have a wider range of genes is correct, but it does not provide a comprehensive definition of what phylum Cnidaria is. Let me provide a more detailed explanation of the phylum Cnidaria. Phylum Cnidaria is a diverse group of aquatic animals found in both marine and freshwater environments, with over 10,000 known species. The name Cnidaria is derived from the Greek word \\"cnidos,\\" which means \\"stinging nettle,\\" referring to the stinging cells (cnidocytes) present in these animals. Cnidarians include familiar organisms such as jellyfish, sea anemones, corals, and hydrozoans. Characteristics of phylum Cnidaria: 1. Radial symmetry: Cnidarians have radial symmetry, which means their body parts are arranged symmetrically around a central axis. This is in contrast to bilaterians, which have bilateral symmetry (a distinct left and right side). 2. Diploblastic body structure: Cnidarians have a simple body plan with two germ layers, the ectoderm (outer layer) and the endoderm (inner layer), surrounding a jelly-like substance called mesoglea. This diploblastic structure is considered more \\"primitive\\" compared to the triploblastic structure (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) found in bilaterians. 3. Cnidocytes: A major feature of cnidarians is their stinging cells called cnidocytes, which are used for prey capture and defense. Each cnidocyte contains a coiled, thread-like structure called a nematocyst, which can be ejected when the cell is triggered. 4. Nerve net: Cnidarians have a simple nervous system consisting of a diffuse network of nerve cells spread throughout the body. They lack a centralized nervous system or brain. 5. Polyp and medusa life stages: Cnidarians typically exhibit two distinct body forms - the sessile polyp stage and the free-swimming medusa stage. Some species have only one of these forms in their life cycle, while others alternate between the two forms. Regarding the statement about the range of genes, recent molecular and genomic studies have indeed shown that cnidarians possess a diverse array of genes, many of which were previously thought to be unique to bilaterians. This has led to new insights into the early evolution of multicellular animals, and has prompted a reconsideration of the \\"primitive\\" label applied to cnidarians. In summary, phylum Cnidaria is a diverse group of aquatic animals with a diploblastic body plan, radial symmetry, and specialized stinging cells called cnidocytes.

For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B.  Would zone B have less or more oxygen than zone A? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's go through the steps to understand and compare the oxygen levels in both zones: Step 1: Understand the concept of a dead zone A dead zone is an area in a body of water with significantly reduced oxygen levels, which makes it difficult for certain aquatic species to survive. This condition is often caused by nutrient pollution from sources such as agricultural runoff, leading to excessive algae growth that consumes oxygen when it decomposes. Step 2: Examine Zone A Zone A is a lake near agricultural lands that has been declared as a dead zone. This implies that the oxygen levels in this lake are significantly low due to the factors mentioned in Step 1. Step 3: Examine Zone B Zone B is a lake near a national park that has not been declared as a dead zone. This suggests that the oxygen levels in this lake are likely to be higher than those in a dead zone, which means that the lake can support diverse aquatic life. Step 4: Compare the oxygen levels Since Zone A is a dead zone with significantly reduced oxygen levels, and Zone B is a non-dead zone which implies it has comparatively higher oxygen levels, we can conclude: Answer: Zone B would have more oxygen than Zone A."},{"instruction":"Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that helps Reacher escort the young girl to a private school? from the following article ?

Charles 'Chuck' Levine (Who is a chronic womanizer) and Lawrence 'Larry' Valentine (Who is a bachelor and trying to raise his children after his wife passed away some time ago) are two veteran New York City Firefighters. During a routine sweep of a burned building, a segment of floor collapses and Chuck almost dies. Larry rescues Chuck by shielding him from the falling debris. As he and Larry awaken at a hospital later, Chuck vows to repay his debt in any way possible. The incident prompts Larry to realize the fact that death can come for him at any moment, but he has difficulties naming his children as primary beneficiaries in his life insurance policy. Larry was given at least a year to change his beneficiaries but he was profusely mourning his wife, and left it too late. However, One of the ways suggested for him to do so is to get married. Inspired by a newspaper article about domestic partnerships, Larry asks Chuck to enter a civil union with him. Although at first Chuck declines, he is reminded of his debt to Larry and finally agrees.Chuck and Larry become domestic partners and Chuck becomes Larry's primary beneficiary in the event of his death. Soon, New York City investigators arrive to inquire about their partnership.

Some smaller sediments can still be carried by a slow moving stream or river. Smaller sediments are dropped as the slope becomes less steep. Alluvial Fans In arid regions, a mountain stream may flow onto flatter land. The stream comes to a stop rapidly. The deposits form an alluvial fan. Deposition also occurs when a stream or river empties into a large body of still water. In this case, a delta forms. A delta is shaped like a triangle. It spreads out into the body of water.  Question: \\"What type of feature is formed when mountain streams in arid regions flow onto flatter land and the stream comes to a rapid stop?\\" Response: \\"Alluvial fan\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. An alluvial fan is the type of feature formed when mountain streams in arid regions flow onto flatter land and the stream comes to a rapid stop. During this process, sediments are deposited in a fan-shaped pattern as the water slows down and loses its ability to carry those sediments. These alluvial fans are generally found in desert environments at the base of steep mountain ranges, where there is a significant change in slope which causes the fast-flowing water to lose its velocity and spread out. The formation of an alluvial fan is a result of deposition, which is the process through which sediment particles, such as sand, gravel, and silt, are dropped by the running water, as the water's interaction with the mountainous terrain leads to a change in speed and direction. As the slope decreases, sediment sizes gradually reduce, and this leads to the characteristic fan-shaped appearance of an alluvial fan. In the case of deltas, which were mentioned earlier, they are another type of feature associated with deposition. They form when a river empties its sediments into a larger body of water, such as an ocean or a lake, and they are shaped like a triangle. Both delta and alluvial fan formations result from the same physical process: deposition of sediments carried by a flowing water body as it encounters a change in slope or merges with a larger body of standing water. In conclusion, alluvial fans are formed as a result of deposition when mountain streams in arid regions flow onto flatter land and come to a rapid stop, ultimately leading to the dropping of sediments in a fan-shaped pattern. They are significant geological features that can provide valuable insights into the sedimentary history and environmental changes of a particular region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Moisture is what causes cast iron cookware to rust, so it's important you store cast iron pots and pans somewhere dry.","output":"If you live in a humid climate, it's even more crucial to select a storage location with low humidity levels to prolong the life of your cast iron cookware. Once you have identified the ideal dry area in your kitchen or pantry, follow these steps to properly store your cast iron pieces: 1. Clean and dry your cookware: First, thoroughly clean your cast iron cookware with warm water and a gentle scrubber or brush. Avoid using soap, as it can remove the seasoning on your cookware that prevents rust. Dry your pieces with a clean towel or cloth thoroughly and then place them on the stovetop or in a warm oven to ensure they are fully dry before storage. 2. Apply a light layer of oil: After your cast iron is clean and completely dry, apply a very thin layer of oil (such as vegetable oil or flaxseed oil) to the entire surface using a soft cloth or paper towel. This step offers additional protection against rust. 3. Stack and store your cookware: Cast iron cookware is heavy, so store your pots and pans on the bottom shelf to avoid potential damage to cabinets or countertops. For skillets, store them on their own with no other items on top, or nest them inside one another if they are of different sizes, with a layer of parchment paper or a towel in between to prevent scratching. Dutch ovens can be stored with the lids slightly ajar, or use a paper towel, cloth, or silicone trivet to create a small gap between the pot and the lid for adequate air circulation. 4. Be mindful of hooks and wall mounts: While many people like to hang their cast iron cookware on hooks or wall mounts, ensure that the hooks are strong enough to hold the weight of the cookware without bending or breaking. It is also essential to protect the cast iron surfaces from scratching during storage by using a cloth or rubber protector where the hook or mount comes into contact with the cookware. 5. Perform regular maintenance: Periodically inspect your cast iron cookware for any signs of rust or damage. When detected early, small rust spots can often be removed and re-seasoned without major issues. Additionally, make it a habit to occasionally re-oil your cast iron cookware to make sure it stays well protected during storage.

A survivalist suspected of burglarizing Utah cabins and evading law enforcement for years had this to say to police finally caught up with him on Wednesday: 'Good job, you got me.' Troy James Knapp, 45, made the remarks Wednesday as he threw his rifle on the ground, ending a 50-man operation to capture him in the mountains outside of Ferron in central Utah, the Sanpete County Sheriff's Office said. Knapp was finally apprehended after allegedly firing shots at a police helicopter, pointing his gun at a sheriff, and leading authorities on a snowshoe chase, according to ABC News. Trapped: 'Mountain Man' Troy James Knapp is taken into custody by the Emery County Sheriff's Office on April 2 outside of Ferron in central Utah. Tracked down: The elusive survivalist was captured by police on Tuesday after spending five years allegedly robbing cabins in the wilderness and leaving taunts for officers. Knapp has long been suspected of hiding. out in the mountains of southern Utah, shooting up and robbing dozens. of cabins over the past six years. Police say he's been living off the. comfort of cabins in winter and retreating to makeshift summer camps. deep in the forest with stolen guns and supplies. The operation to apprehend him was launched after two hunters ran into him on a trail last Friday. 'He was asking how much snow was up the trail further,' Sevier County Sheriff Nathan Curtis told ABCNews.com.  'Their dog was acting nervous and growling, and he said, \\"Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot you guys.\\"' Knapp didn't identify himself, but called himself a 'mountain man.' After the encounter, the hunters alerted authorities. Finally caught: Troy James Knapp was arrested today, left, after evading cops for years. He was last arrested in 2001, right. Prior to last Friday, the last known. time Knapp was spotted was on October 1 last year by a surveillance. camera in Sanpete County. He had a gun slung over his shoulder and was using binoculars to scope. for an alarm system at a cabin near Gooseberry Reservoir before breaking in. Iron, Kane and Garfield counties have all issued arrest warrants for Knapp on burglary and weapons charges. While there have been no violent confrontations with Knapp, authorities had feared he was a ticking time bomb. In custody: Snow-mobilers pass the sheriff's truck carrying the 45-year-old suspect. In 5th District Court in Iron County,. Knapp is facing four counts of burglary, a second-degree felony; theft,. a second-degree felony; and three counts of theft, a class B. misdemeanor - all charges for incidents spanning June 2009 through. September of 2011. He is suspected of leaving some. cabins riddled with bullet holes, defacing religious icons and writing. taunting notes for cabin owners and authorities. 'Hey Sheriff...Gonna put you in the ground!' one note said, according to court records. Records. indicate Knapp fell off the radar in 2002 when he apparently left. California in violation of his parole for a burglary conviction. He was charged with theft in 2000 in California, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in prison, according to records. Mountain mystery: A man believed to be serial burglar and expert survivalist Troy James Knapp was caught on CCTV last year in Sanpete County, Utah. Roaming: The 'mountain man' was spotted on CCTV in Sanpete County, Utah last week but once again police have failed to track down the expert survivalist. As. a teenager, Knapp was convicted in Michigan of breaking and entering,. passing bad checks and unlawful flight from authorities, according to. court records in Kalamazoo County. His. most serious arrest for felony assault in Michigan was reduced in 1994. to a charge of malicious destruction of property after he agreed to. plead guilty. He has been compared to Davy. Crockett, the 19th century Tennessean known as 'King of. the Wild Frontier', and he remains somewhere in 1,000 sq miles of. wilderness. Knapp has family members in Moscow, Idaho, but they have not commented. One hunter, who is believed to have bumped into Knapp in June, asked him his name and was simply told: 'The Mountain'. Long search: Troy James Knapp, 44, pictured in December 2011. It is believed that he is responsible for a series of burglaries at holiday homes in the Utah wilderness. Mysterious: Investigators have found abandoned camps in the Utah wilderness, like the one pictured, dozens of guns, high-end outdoor gear stolen from the homes and rubbish strewn around the forest floor. ‘This guy is probably about as true a. survivalist as Davy Crockett,’ U.S. Marshal Michael Wingert said at the time. Comparison: Authorities say Knapp is like Davy Crockett, a 19th century survival expert portrayed by Fess Parker in the 1955 Disney film given his name. Anyone with information has been asked to contact authorities. In December 2011, photos were taken of a sandy-haired man in camouflage on snowshoes, a rifle slung over his shoulder, believed to be Knapp. It is thought that the expert woodsman has spent around seven years breaking into cabins in winter, living off hot food,. alcohol and coffee before stealing provisions and vanishing away with guns and supplies. In. February, it took detectives an entire day to reach a remote cabin. after getting a report that lights had been seen on inside overnight. It. turned out they were solar-powered lights on the porch, and the cabin. was empty - another dead-end. But their break came in January 2012 with the. fingerprint match. Early on, investigators thought his. unattended camps they came across during their search were left. behind by ‘doomsday’ believers preparing for some sort of apocalypse. This. was because of the remote locations and supplies like dozens of guns,. radios, batteries, dehydrated food and camping gear. They now have a. name, but the man remains in the mist.

Journey is an American rock band that formed in San Francisco in 1973, composed of former members of Santana and Frumious Bandersnatch. The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\". Journey's album sales did not improve and Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman, with whom keyboardist Gregg Rolie could share lead vocal duties. The band hired Robert Fleischman and transitioned to a more popular style, akin to that of Foreigner and Boston. Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977 and together the new incarnation of the band wrote the hit \\"Wheel in the Sky\\"; however, management differences resulted in Fleischman leaving within the year.  In late 1977, Journey hired Steve Perry as their new lead singer. Herbie Herbert, the band's manager, also hired Roy Thomas Baker as a producer to add a layered sound approach as Baker had done with his previous band, Queen. With their new lead singer and talented new producer, Journey released their fourth album, Infinity (1978). This album set Journey on their road to stardom with their first RIAA-certified platinum album. This album, with their hit song \\"Wheel in the Sky\\" (#57 U.S.), set Journey on a new path with a more mainstream sound to make their highest chart success to date.  In late 1978, manager Herbie Herbert fired drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who joined Bay Area rivals Jefferson Starship shortly thereafter. He was replaced by Berklee-trained jazz drummer Steve Smith. Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith and Valory recorded Evolution (1979), which gave the band their first Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 single, \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\\" (#16); and Departure (1980), which reached No. 8 on the album charts.  Journey's newfound success brought the band an almost entirely new fan base. During the 1980 Departure world tour, the band recorded a live album, Captured.  Keyboardist Gregg Rolie then left the band, the second time in his career he left a successful act. Keyboardist Stevie \\"Keys\\" Roseman was brought in to record the lone studio track for Captured, \\"The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love),\\" but Rolie recommended pianist Jonathan Cain of The Babys as the permanent replacement. With Cain's replacement of Rolie's Hammond B-3 organ with his own synthesizers, the band was poised for a new decade in which they would achieve their greatest musical success.","output":"This text is about Journey, an American rock band formed in San Francisco in 1973.

Cost basis is the original value of an asset, such as stocks, bond, mutual funds. You begin with the original purchase price, and then you adjust it for commissions, stock splits, dividends, return of capital or any other transaction that affects the original value of the asset.","output":"Understanding how to properly calculate cost basis is crucial for investors as it directly impacts the taxable gains or losses on the sale of the asset. A precise cost basis calculation not only ensures accurate tax reporting but also enables investors to make well-informed decisions when it comes to optimizing their investment strategies and minimizing their tax liabilities. The process of determining the cost basis of an asset involves several steps. First and foremost, make a note of the initial purchase price of the asset. This is the amount you paid for the asset including any purchase-related expenses such as commissions or transfer fees. Next, account for any transactions or corporate actions that modify the asset's original value. These events may include: 1. Stock splits: If you own a stock that underwent a split, you would need to adjust the cost basis accordingly. For example, if you purchased 100 shares of a company at 50 per share and experienced a 2-for-1 stock split, you would now own 200 shares with an adjusted cost basis of 25 per share. 2. Dividends and dividend reinvestments: When you receive a dividend, often you have the option to reinvest the dividends, which usually results in purchasing additional shares of the investment. These new shares acquired should be added to your cost basis accordingly. 3. Return of capital: Sometimes, companies return a portion of the invested capital to shareholders. This reduces the investment's cost basis by the amount of the return of capital. 4. Capital improvements: If you made any improvements or additions to the asset, you can adjust the cost basis by the cost of these upgrades. This is particularly relevant for real estate investments. 5. Mergers and acquisitions: When a company undergoes a merger or acquisition, the cost basis of your investment needs to be adjusted to account for any changes in the value of the shares. 6. Inheritance and gifted assets: If you inherit or receive a gift of an investment, the cost basis may need to be adjusted based on the fair market value at the time of inheritance or gifting, respectively. 7. Sale of a portion of your investment: If you sell a portion of your investment, you need to determine the cost basis of the sold shares based on the method you use to track the cost basis (e.g., average cost, specific identification, etc.) Once all relevant adjustments have been made, the final cost basis can be determined by summing up the adjusted purchase price and other amounts across all shares of the investment. Finally, when you decide to sell the asset, you can calculate your taxable gain or loss by subtracting the adjusted cost basis from the sale proceeds. Accurate calculation and record-keeping of your cost basis will ensure you are able to maximize your potential tax benefits and make informed strategic decisions relating to your investment portfolio."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices:  -bored  -great  -have a lot of receipts and bags The answer is:","output":"Others will likely have a lot of receipts and bags. Given the context of Jesse going to the mall to buy expensive but fun gifts, it can be inferred that he intends to purchase numerous items for himself or for others. These gifts may be highly sought-after products or experiences that are indulgent or enjoyable in nature. Consequently, it can be deduced that other recipients of these gifts, or those accompanying Jesse, will reap the benefits of his shopping spree. As Jesse collects various items, there will naturally be an accumulation of receipts and bags from the stores he visits. These receipts may serve as records of transactions for personal finance purposes, or as necessary documentation for warranty or return policies. The bags will serve to carry the fun gifts and represent the outcome of Jesse's shopping undertaking. In addition to the material trappings of the shopping experience, the fun, luxurious, or coveted nature of these gifts will likely generate a sense of enjoyment and excitement amongst those who receive or partake in them. These interactions may foster deeper connections and showcase Jesse's thoughtfulness in selecting the perfect gifts for the recipients. Therefore, the ramifications of Jesse's shopping expedition extend beyond the mere accumulation of receipts and bags — they signify the cultivation and nurturing of relationships through the giving and receiving of special, memorable gifts.

For example :  Aortic valve leak: in the case of an aortic valve leak, the severe leak can also be treated with blood pressure medicines known as vasodilators.","output":"Absolutely, let me explain it to you like a fun story. When our heart has got a tiny leak (like a dripping faucet), our body and its team of fantastic doctors have different methods to fix it. It all depends on how big or small the leak is.

In our story, let's say the leak is from a door called the \\"Aortic Valve.\\" This door is really important because it lets the clean, oxygen-filled blood out of the heart to go on its journey to the rest of the body.  When this door doesn't close properly and starts to leak, sometimes the blood doesn't flow correctly, and this can be a problem.

A synthesizer (often abbreviated as synth, also spelled synthesiser) is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate traditional musical instruments like piano, Hammond organ, flute, vocals; natural sounds like ocean waves, etc.; or generate novel electronic timbres. They are often played with a musical keyboard, but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called sound modules, and are controlled via USB, MIDI or CV/gate using a controller device, often a MIDI keyboard or other controller. A ribbon controller or other violin-like user interface may be used to control synthesizer parameters. The idea dates to Leon Theremin's 1922 first concept and his 1932 Fingerboard Theremin and Keyboard Theremin,  Maurice Martenot's 1928 Ondes Martenot (sliding a metal ring),  Friedrich Trautwein's 1929 Trautonium (finger pressure), and was also later utilized by Robert Moog. The ribbon controller has no moving parts. Instead, a finger pressed down and moved along it creates an electrical contact at some point along a pair of thin, flexible longitudinal strips whose electric potential varies from one end to the other. Older fingerboards used a long wire pressed to a resistive plate. A ribbon controller is similar to a touchpad, but a ribbon controller only registers linear motion. Although it may be used to operate any parameter that is affected by control voltages, a ribbon controller is most commonly associated with pitch bending.  Fingerboard-controlled instruments include the Trautonium (1929), Hellertion (1929) and Heliophon (1936), Electro-Theremin (Tannerin, late 1950s), Persephone (2004), and the Swarmatron (2004). A ribbon controller is used as an additional controller in the Yamaha CS-80 and CS-60, the Korg Prophecy and Korg Trinity series, the Kurzweil synthesizers, Moog synthesizers, and others.  Rock musician Keith Emerson used it with the Moog modular synthesizer from 1970 onward. In the late 1980s, keyboards in the synth lab at Berklee College of Music were equipped with membrane thin ribbon style controllers that output MIDI. They functioned as MIDI managers, with their programming language printed on their surface, and as expression/performance tools. Designed by Jeff Tripp of Perfect Fretworks Co., they were known as Tripp Strips. Such ribbon controllers can serve as a main MIDI controller instead of a keyboard, as with the Continuum instrument.","output":"This text is about synthesizers, electronic musical instruments that generate electric signals to produce sound.

We have this equation: 40 * q - 4788 = 92 * q - 78 * q - 12 * q First, we need to combine the terms with q on the right side of the equation. So, let's add the numbers with q together: 92 * q - 78 * q - 12 * q = (92 - 78 - 12) * q = 2 * q Now our equation looks like this: 40 * q - 4788 = 2 * q Now, we need to move \\"2 * q\\" to the left side of the equation. To do that, we subtract \\"2 * q\\" from both sides: 40 * q - 2 * q - 4788 = 0 Let's combine the terms with q on the left side: (40 - 2) * q - 4788 = 0 38 * q - 4788 = 0 Now, we need to get q by itself. We add 4788 to both sides: 38 * q = 4788 Finally, we need to find out what number q is, so we divide both sides of the equation by 38: q = 4788 / 38 q = 126 So, the answer is that q = 126.

Hypothesis: The trees are all dead. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"No, it is not possible to conclusively affirm the presented hypothesis - \\"The trees are all dead\\" - based solely on the given premise, which states that \\"A logger is cutting down a large tree trunk in barren woods.\\" Let's dissect this further: 1. Description Analysis:  The premise details an action involving a logger who is engaged in the process of cutting down a large tree trunk situated in a barren woods. The term \\"barren\\" typically denotes a lack of vegetation or perhaps the absence of typically expected or prior existing life.  However, \\"barren\\" doesn't necessarily mean that all trees are dead. A forest can become barren due to several reasons such as seasonal change, pest infection or simply because it is a type of forest that does not contain many trees. However, those trees existing, though few, might still be live trees. 2. Action Inferred: The fact that the logger is cutting down a large tree could suggest several things. It could be inferred that the tree is dead, and thus is being removed. However, it could be a healthy tree being logged for wood, a common practice in forest management and wood industry. Let’s not forget that logging of live trees is a regular activity in the wood industry and it does not exclusively deal with dead trees. So, the presence of a logger could mean a healthy tree is being cut down for its wood, rather than it being dead. 3. Definitive Assumption:  The conclusion that all trees are dead is an extreme blanket statement. Assuming that all the trees are dead because a logger is cutting down one tree might be an overreach. Just because a tree in a forest is being cut down does not definitively suggest that all trees in the area are dead. Many healthy forests are sustainably maintained by carefully managing and culling trees. While it's understandable why one might conclude that the observed logging activity could correlate with a preponderance of dead trees, it's necessary to remember that any conclusion must be drawn carefully by taking into account all available data. The current information provided does not support the broad inference that all trees are dead. To establish such a hypothesis irrefutably, more specific information demonstrating the death of all trees would be required, such as visible signs of disease on multiple trees, complete absence of leaves on all trees beyond normal seasonal shedding, or expert commentary on the health of the forest. In summary, the premise does not provide ample evidence to conclude that all trees are dead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Deputies determined that for about four years the children had been living in the box, which is about 20 feet long, 10 feet wide and 4 feet tall.

Mona Kirk & Daniel Panico arrested for willful cruelty to a child after deputies discover the family’s living conditions in Joshua Tree. (Photo: San Bernadino County Sheriff's Department)      Children and Family Services responded to the property and took custody of the children.      The structure where the children were living is on a mostly empty dirt road, two blocks off Highway 62, in the large span of open desert between Joshua Tree and Twentynine Palms.      Satellite imagery of the address shows a single white trailer, a few cars and what appears to be large piles of discarded trash surrounding the home.      Most of the adjacent lots are empty, but it appears that at least one neighbor lives in a house, surrounded by a fence, directly across the street.      The house is about eight miles from the front gate of Joshua Tree National Park and two miles east of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Station.      Neighbor Mike Reynolds said the family moved in about four years ago.      The father owned the land and the trailer and talked about building his dream home on the property, Reynolds said.      “He was a regular retired guy, and an intelligent man,” Reynolds said.      Several of his neighbors live “off the grid” so the family not having electricity or running water didn’t strike Reynolds as odd.      The children seemed healthy and happy, Reynolds added. He noted he never saw any cats wandering around.      He also suggested people wait for more information before passing judgment on the family.      Reynolds believes the father kept the family from being homeless by building their home himself.      “This guy was doing the best he could to raise his family,” Reynolds said. “If I was in his shoes and that’s all I could afford to raise my family and keep them alive — I have seen so much worse.”      Reporter Brett Kelman contributed.

A deputy was patrolling the rural area in the 7000 block of Sun Fair Road in Joshua Tree, saw a travel-trailer on a property that appeared to be abandoned and the rectangular plywood box, and checked it out, according to a San Bernardino County sheriff’s news release.      The three children, ages 11, 13 and 14, reportedly lived in the large rectangular box — which was approximately 20 feet long by 4 feet high by 10 feet wide — for about four years. They didn’t have adequate food and were living in an unsuitable, unsafe environment due to the property conditions, the news release stated.      The mother, Mona Kirk, 51, slept in the box with her children, while the father, Daniel Panico, 73, lived in the trailer or a vehicle, said Cindy Bachman, a Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman, in an email. It’s not known where the children were living prior to living in the box.      The box was a shelter fabricated out of scrap wood and other material, Bachman said. A tarp on top of the wooden structure kept the rain out, but there was no heat, running water, electricity or bathrooms.      Photos of the location show old furniture, broken children’s toys, storage containers and other assorted junk strewn about the property.      Bachman said she doesn’t believe the children were regularly attending school. They were not being locked in or held captive in the box.      Several large holes and mounds of trash and human feces were found on the property, and about 30-40 cats were roaming freely inside the trailer.      Children and Family Service responded to the scene and took custody of the children.      The parents of the children, Kirk and Panico, were arrested on suspicion of willful cruelty to a child and booked into the Morongo Basin Jail in lieu of 100,000 bail each.

Diabetes can reduce blood flow to extremities and cause nerve damage, and sometimes amputations are necessary if serious infection sets in and there is severe damage to the tissue and bone. The neighborhood where Keatley lived, East Harlem, has the highest diabetes rate in Manhattan, according to city health officials.

This lifestyle change has had a tremendous impact on the family. Not only have they been able to support local farmers and sustainable practices, but they have also been able to improve their own health by incorporating more fresh fruits and vegetables into their diets. By visiting the farmers' market, the family is exposed to new and unique produce, giving them an opportunity to try different types of meals and expand their palates.  Additionally, by shopping at their local farmers' market, the family is more aware of where their food comes from, which helps them make more informed choices about what they're consuming. This, in turn, reduces the risk of developing health issues such as diabetes and obesity, as the family is now more proactive about maintaining a balanced and nutritious diet. Not only is this transformation important for the family's health, but it also serves as an example for the broader community. As more and more people notice the positive changes and improvements in the family's overall well-being, they may be motivated to adopt similar lifestyles and dietary habits. This can lead to a ripple effect of better health and wellness throughout the entire neighborhood, ultimately helping to address the high rates of diabetes and obesity in East Harlem. Moreover, the shift to healthier eating habits and supporting local farmers could inspire changes at the policy level in the community. For example, city officials might work to improve the availability and accessibility of fresh, healthy foods in the area, such as by opening more farmers' markets, establishing local gardens, or increasing funding for education and initiatives on nutrition and wellness. In turn, this could gradually lower the rates of diabetes and obesity in East Harlem and make it a healthier community for all of its residents. In conclusion, the simple act of the family frequenting their local farmers' market in East Harlem and transforming the way they eat marked the beginning of a potentially larger and deeper change in the community. By choosing to prioritize fresh, local, and nutritious foods, the family not only took control of their own health and well-being but also became beacons of inspiration for others in the neighborhood to do the same. With time and collective effort, it is possible to address and alleviate the health challenges in East Harlem, turning it into a healthier and thriving community for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The difference between Mark and other climbers is that he lost both his legs when climbing. New Zealand's highest mountain, Mount Cook. He was caught in a big ice hole and he had to have his legs cut below the knees after he was saved. But that couldn't make Mark lose heart, who has become the first person with man-made legs to reach the top of Mount Everest. From the top of the world's highest mountain, Mark called his wife to say he made it. His wife, Anne got the phone when she was sleeping. She couldn't hear him clearly on the phone. She was unable to say when he reached the top but thought it was around mid-day. She also said his \\"legs\\" didn't work well sometimes, so her husband was carrying a spare leg and repair tools.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?  Context: Foaly is a fictional character in the Artemis Fowl series written by Eoin Colfer. He is the technical consultant to the Lower Elements Police (LEP). He is the most intelligent centaur on and under the Earth, considers himself to be an unappreciated genius, and is the inventor of most of the advanced technology possessed by the fairy world, rivaled only by Opal Koboi. Hypothesis: Foaly considers himself overrated.","output":"After examining the given context, we can derive the following detailed answer: It would not be accurate or appropriate to draw the hypothesis that Foaly considers himself overrated. We can identify several reasons for this conclusion. Firstly, it is made clear that Foaly is the most intelligent centaur on and under the Earth. This statement indicates that he possesses a unique and superior intellect in comparison to his counterparts in the Artemis Fowl series. His intelligence would likely justify his high opinion of himself, and therefore, he would not consider himself overrated. Secondly, Foaly is described as an unappreciated genius. This sentiment conveys that he feels he doesn't receive the recognition he deserves for his exceptional abilities and inventions. By portraying Foaly as an unappreciated individual, it implies that he believes his skills and contributions are undervalued rather than overrated. Furthermore, Foaly is the inventor of most of the advanced technology possessed by the fairy world, indicating that he has been responsible for significant technological advancements. This contribution would likely bolster his view of himself as an unappreciated genius rather than overrated since his innovations have had a profound impact on the fairy world. Lastly, the presence of a rival, Opal Koboi, suggests that Foaly's self-perception as an unappreciated genius is challenged by competition. The rivalry between Foaly and Opal Koboi most likely pushes Foaly to maintain his status as a leading figure in the technological world. This competitive dynamic would not support the hypothesis that Foaly considers himself overrated, but instead reinforces his belief in his unique abilities. In conclusion, the context provided does not support the hypothesis that Foaly considers himself overrated. Rather, he is portrayed as an intelligent, unappreciated genius with significant contributions to the fairy world's technology. His self-perception as one of the leading inventors and as the most intelligent centaur counters the idea that he thinks he is overrated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here are a few tips for student accommodations that can help ensure a great experience and build lifelong friendships: Screen your roommates carefully if you are given a choice. Combining the living spaces of several students into one location can be exciting and rewarding experience for the outgoing students. If you are on the shy side, or prefer a quiet group to study with, pick quieter roommates. Divide the bills evenly. Some students are far less responsible than their roommates and tend to let their part of the finance slide. Dissatisfaction is quick to build when everyone has to pay the bill for a fellow student who can't seem to pay his/her share of the money. Carry your part of the load. Everyone has to clean the bathroom and the kitchen sometime. Don't avoid your part of responsibility. Student accommodations can get messy and it involves everyone to keep them tidy and healthy. Think about someone else before you think about yourself. Put your roommates interests above your own. Life will be far enjoyable when everyone is concerned about the feelings property and studies of each other. Be open and honest. Hostilities   and frustrations may cause problems that can't be fixed. Everyone brings different standards and expectations to group living and it's in everyone's best interest to put them into the open.

Option a). Change out or wash a pillowcase every couple of days after using it. Step 1: Determine the importance of a clean pillowcase in preventing acne. Dirty pillowcases can accumulate oil, dirt, and bacteria, which can contribute to acne breakouts. Step 2: Establish a routine to wash or change pillowcases regularly, ideally every couple of days. This will prevent the accumulation of dirt and oils from the face. Step 3: Encourage the use of gentle, hypoallergenic detergent to minimize skin irritation.  Option b). Apply a small coat of olive oil to your cheeks before falling asleep. Step 1: Investigate the benefits of olive oil on skin. While olive oil has antioxidant properties and may be hydrating, it can potentially clog pores and may not be suitable for acne-prone skin. Step 2: Weigh the benefits of olive oil against the risks. In this case, the potential to clog pores and exacerbate acne may outweigh any benefits. Justification: Option A, changing or washing a pillowcase every couple of days, is more likely to help the skin stay clear of acne compared to option B.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. There are two cities, Chien and Marisol, in France that are leaders in the amount of wine they export to the rest of the world. Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation.  Does Chien have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Marisol?  Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. The answer to this question is:","output":"Chien has a higher chance of acid rain than Marisol due to its reliance on coal for electricity generation. Coal is a major source of energy, but its combustion leads to the emission of harmful gases and pollutants in the atmosphere. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are two notable pollutants produced when burning coal. When these gases enter the atmosphere, they react with water vapor, oxygen, and other gases to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). These acidic compounds fall back to the earth's surface as acid rain, causing harm to the environment, water bodies, soil, and living organisms. Marisol, on the other hand, generates electricity using nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plants do not release SO2 and NOx as byproducts during the energy production process. Instead, they rely on nuclear reactions to produce heat, which generates steam to power turbines. This method does not contribute to the formation of acid rain because it does not release air pollutants directly into the atmosphere during electricity generation. It is important to note that both cities are using nonrenewable resources as their primary energy source, and these resources will eventually be depleted. However, in terms of acid rain formation, Chien is at a higher risk due to its reliance on coal for electricity generation, which directly contributes to air pollution and the subsequent formation of acid rain. Marisol, depending on nuclear power plants, does not have the same direct impact on acid rain formation, making it less likely to experience acid rain compared to Chien."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Unicorn is transformed into a human woman with a knee length white hair.  for the following movie plot:  In an enchanted forest, a talking unicorn learns she is the very last of her kind.

Venturing into unfamiliar territory beyond the safety of her home, the Unicorn journeys to find them and bring them all back. Upon her journey the Unicorn is captured by the evil witch Mommy Fortuna, and is put on display in Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival. As most of the attractions are normal animals with a spell of illusion placed on them (to wit, a toothless lion for a Manticore, a crippled chimpanzee for a Satyr, and a mere snake for the \\"Midgard Serpent\\"), Fortuna uses a spell to create another horn on the unicorn's head that the non-magical carnival visitors can see, as they are unable to see her real form. Fortuna keeps the immortal harpy Celaeno captive as well and acknowledges the dangers of caging such a monster, but deems the risk secondary to the deed's recognition and prestige. While held captive, the unicorn is befriended by Schmendrick, an incompetent magician in the service of Mommy Fortuna. With the help of Schmendrick, the Unicorn escapes, in the process freeing Celaeno, who kills Fortuna and her henchman Ruhk.

Q: In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. High-throughput screening (HTS) of large compound libraries has become a commonly used method for the identification of drug leads, and non-physiological reducing agents have been widely used for HTS. However, a comparison of the difference in the HTS results based on the choice of reducing agent used and potency comparisons of selected inhibitors has not been done with the physiological reducing agent, reduced glutathione (GSH). Here, we compared the effects of three reducing agents: dithiothreitol (DTT), β-mercaptoethanol (β-MCE), and tris-(2carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP), in addition to GSH, against three drug target proteins. Approximately 100,000 compounds were computationally screened for each target protein, and experimental testing of high scoring compounds (~560 compounds) with the four reducing agents surprisingly produced many non-overlapping hits. More importantly, we find that various reducing agents alter inhibitor potency (IC 50 ) from ~10 µM with one reducing agent to complete loss (IC 50 > 200 µM) of inhibitory activity with another reducing agent. Therefore, the choice of reducing agent in a HTS is critical as this may lead to the pursuit of falsely identified active compounds or failure to identify the true active compounds. We demonstrate the feasibility of using GSH for in vitro HTS assays with these three target enzymes.

I called out to him \\"Have you got a light?\\" He looked at me and came over to light my cigarette. As he came close and lit the cigarette, his eyes absently locked with mine. At that moment, I smiled. I don't know why I did that. Perhaps it was nervousness, perhaps it was because, when you get very close, one to another, it is very hard not to smile. Anyway, I smiled. I know he didn't want to, but my smile went through the bars and generated a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly in the eyes and continuing to smile.

Answer the following question: \\"I stepped out and was _ ,\\" local journalist Bahram Baloch told the BBC. \\"I could see this gray, dome-shaped   body in the distance, like a giant whale swimming near the surface. Hundreds of people had gathered to watch it in disbelief.\\" This island has become a global curiosity. How was it formed in just a few minutes? As you might already know, many islands in the sea are formed by volcanoes. There are numerous volcanoes under the sea. As the hot lava erupts and cools down, it piles up and forms the shape of a mountain. When the mountain \\"grows\\" to higher than the sea level, the part that's above the water is what we call an \\"island\\". This is how the island was formed after the Pakistan earthquake, except that instead of a regular volcano, it was a \\"mud volcano\\" that brought about this island. Lava is not the only thing that's locked under the Earth's crust -- there is also gas. When an earthquake happens and breaks part of the crust, the gas is released at an extremely high speed, pushing mud up to the surface, according to National Geographic. But only earthquakes that are extremely powerful can cause mud volcanoes to push up enough mud to produce islands -- and this 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Pakistan was strong enough. The island is about 20 meters high, up to about 90 meters wide and 30 meters long, nearly the size of a soccer field. In fact, mud volcano islands aren't new. This is the fourth island of this kind in the region since 1945. But those islands usually didn't last long. \\"It will probably be gone within a couple of months,\\" said Bill Barnhart, a researcher with the US Geological Survey. After all, \\"it's just a big pile of mud that was on the seafloor that got pushed up\\". According to the article, islands formed by mud volcanoes   _  .

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What were the names of the bands who were specifically designated \\"new wave\\"?  In 1976—first in London, then in the United States—\\"New Wave\\" was introduced as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as \\"punk\\"; the two terms were essentially interchangeable. NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context. Over time, \\"new wave\\" acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated \\"new wave\\" and no longer called \\"punk\\". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label in order to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers.Bringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less \\"dangerous\\" styles, new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic. New wave became a catch-all term, encompassing disparate styles such as 2 Tone ska, the mod revival inspired by the Jam, the sophisticated pop-rock of Elvis Costello and XTC, the New Romantic phenomenon typified by Ultravox, synthpop groups like Tubeway Army (which had started out as a straight-ahead punk band) and Human League, and the sui generis subversions of Devo, who had gone \\"beyond punk before punk even properly existed\\". New wave became a pop culture sensation with the debut of the cable television network MTV in 1981, which put many new wave videos into regular rotation. However, the music was often derided at the time as being silly and disposable.

Article:The plight of the double world champion, who some still consider the best driver in the world, was illustrated perfectly over the course of the Belgian Grand Prix weekend - both on track and off. On the circuit, there was evidence of the best and worst of this complex man. Off it, the McLaren driver's future was one of the key topics. Essentially, Alonso has found himself in an awkward catch-22 situation, the core of the issue being whether the 36-year-old will even be in Formula 1 next year. He has lost faith in engine supplier Honda - as the Japanese company's F1 boss admitted to BBC Sport last weekend - but if the team are still using their engines next year, his other options appear limited in the extreme. McLaren are trying to get out of their Honda contract but are finding it difficult to do so. \\"We will see what happens in the next couple of weeks,\\" Alonso said after Sunday's race. \\"I am happy with the team. We are having difficult seasons in the last three years but McLaren is one of the best teams in the world. I would be happy to keep working with them but we need to see how things evolve in the next couple of weeks.\\" Over three days of track action, the Belgian Grand Prix provided a perfect microcosm of the situation in which Alonso and McLaren find themselves. Their other driver, Stoffel Vandoorne, was hit with 55 places of grid penalties over the weekend for using far beyond the permitted number of engine parts this season. The first half of the penalty came when an upgraded engine was fitted before the weekend, the second half when that engine developed a problem on Friday and had to be replaced. Alonso, meanwhile, was surprisingly competitive - in relative terms - at Spa, which is behind only Monza in terms of the influence of engine power on lap time. He was contending for a position in the top-10 qualifying shootout - thanks to help from 'tows' from Vandoorne to minimise the Honda's deficit on the straights - and would have got it had he not suffered a bizarre engine-related issue on his final run in the second knockout session. The Honda failed to deploy its hybrid power boost after the fast Pouhon double left-hander because of a programming error in the electronics. On that lap, Alonso took Pouhon flat out for the first time - something the Ferrari drivers managed but the Mercedes and Red Bull drivers did not, albeit all of them arriving at the corner faster. The problem was the Honda electronics were judging track position - and therefore where to deploy electrical energy - partly by throttle action. As Alonso had not lifted the accelerator, the system did not realise he had taken the corner so did not deploy after it. In the circumstances, his anguished cries of \\"no power, no power\\" were understandable. For the race, Alonso was promoted to 10th on the grid by a five-place penalty for Renault's Jolyon Palmer, and made one of his trademark brilliant starts to be seventh on the first lap. Then the inevitable happened - he started to be picked off on the straight by other cars with much more power than his Honda, which sources say is about 80bhp down on a customer Mercedes engine. This led to a series of grumpy radio messages from Alonso, as he allowed his frustration to show. By lap 24, he was down to 12th, out of the points and with no prospect of scoring any. He asked if any rain was on the horizon to give him hope, was told no, and a lap later reported an engine problem and pulled into the pits to retire. Honda says it has found no evidence of any problems on the data. McLaren are not commenting beyond what they said on Sunday - that Alonso retired because he felt an engine problem. Some believe he 'parked it' - retired a healthy car. This is normally a cardinal sin in F1, where everyone's default position is the driver races as hard as he can until such time as he can no longer, either because the race finishes, he crashes or the car develops a problem. If he did, it may not be the first time this season - some believe he did the same with a couple of laps to go in Bahrain in April, when he was similarly out of the points after a frustrating race. Alonso denied this, and will almost certainly do the same if he is asked about Spa. So people are left to draw their own conclusions. Whether Alonso did or did not 'park it', it has not changed McLaren's desire to keep him in 2018. They continue to refer to persuading Alonso to stay as a \\"priority\\". As such, it seems that whether what happened in Belgium was restricted to a few mardy radio messages, or whether Alonso stopped racing out of sheer frustration and anger, McLaren are regarding it as a reflection of where he is at. If that sounds surprising, it's perhaps because McLaren are in the same place. After three years of terrible performance and awful reliability, the team's leaders are at their wits' end with Honda. Again, they are not commenting directly on the issue publicly, but their attitude to the engine they would like to use next year can best be summed up as ABH - anyone but Honda. This saga started back in March, when the exact scale of the problems Honda had with its new engine first became apparent in pre-season testing. After a redesign over the winter, the new Honda showed dreadful performance and reliability in testing and McLaren began looking around for an alternative. First, they approached Mercedes. Initial signs were encouraging. Sources say there was a gentlemen's agreement between McLaren shareholder Mansour Ojjeh and Daimler chairman Dieter Zetsche. But Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff was never keen and that deal has now collapsed. Ferrari have also said no, so that leaves Renault. On the face of it, swapping the worst engine in F1 for the second worst, and waving goodbye to a net 100m (£77m) in financial contribution to the team in the process seems an odd decision, but McLaren's bosses believe it makes sense. They are finding it difficult to source sponsorship with their current performance, and Honda's failings are also costing them constructors' points. McLaren are ninth in the standings. But they know from GPS traces that their car's cornering ability is one of the best on the grid and they believe that with a Renault engine they would be able to challenge Red Bull for third overall. Even if they finished fourth, the difference between that and ninth is about £15m. If it was third, that number goes up to £30m. A customer Renault engine would cost in the region of £18m. McLaren produced poor cars when they had Mercedes engines in 2013 and '14 so it is especially frustrating to have sorted out their design department only to find themselves handicapped by their engine. The idea is to get themselves into a reasonably competitive position by 2021, when F1's engine formula will be simplified and a number of other options may be available - perhaps even making their own engine. Media playback is not supported on this device Then there is the cost of losing Alonso. Yes, his 40m (£31m) salary is expensive, but if he left and McLaren were forced to stick with Honda engines, the ramifications are large. First of all, there are few alternatives available. McLaren are interested in Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz as a back-up. But he is not contractually free, Red Bull would want money to release him, and he is no Alonso anyway. There are very few appealing alternatives, and none anywhere near Alonso's ability. Look back over the past three years with Honda and it is clear to see that without Alonso, McLaren would look far worse than they already do. He is the one who has scored their best finishes, who does remarkable things like qualifying seventh in Spain, who routinely makes sensational starts and puts the car in places it has no right to be. When he finished sixth in Hungary, Vandoorne was 10th. This year, his average qualifying position is 12.3; Vandoorne's is 14.8. Last year Alonso's was 11.7; Jenson Button's 12.6. He also provides a level for the car - the team always know where it is competitively, because they know he will always find its limit. There are hardly any other drivers - arguably none - about whom you can say that. Without Alonso, despite all his baggage, things would look even less rosy than they do now. And that's without even thinking about how much harder it would be to attract sponsors. McLaren's problem is that dropping Honda is proving difficult. For a start, Honda do not want to go. And F1's senior figures want Honda to stay in the sport. On top of that, the rules forbid manufacturers supplying more than three teams without special dispensation from the FIA. So if McLaren are going to get Renault engines, they either have to force Honda into a position where it wants to quit - whereby someone else would have to supply them - or cut a deal. McLaren's current plan is for Toro Rosso to take the Hondas, and McLaren to get the Renaults used by Red Bull's junior team. Red Bull and Renault are open to this. Red Bull's strategy is to run the Honda with Toro Rosso, then if Honda gets its act together, switch the supply to Red Bull as well and become their works partner. On the face of it, that's a win-win for Honda - they end a fractured relationship with McLaren, move to a team where the pressure and focus is not anywhere near as great, remove the difficulties created by Alonso's status and personality, and get the chance long-term to move to a team that will offer them at least as much potential as McLaren do. But it seems Honda does not see it that way, and is proving intransigent. And, right now, the most likely scenario appears to be McLaren continuing with Honda. Time is running out. There is a new development Honda engine being introduced for this weekend's Italian Grand Prix, which will mean more grid penalties and another frustrating weekend. On past history, it is unlikely to be a major step forward and so is equally unlikely to change Alonso's mind on Honda. But he has few other options. The top three teams are locked up and not interested in him. Williams have talked to him, but they are badly struggling at the moment and that would surely be out of the frying pan into the fire. Renault? There is a seat there alongside Nico Hulkenberg but it would require Alonso to climb down massively on his salary demands and for what? They are nowhere near ready to win either. IndyCar? Alonso's enthusiasm for a full season there is probably well under control, but he would love to win the Indy 500, after his stellar debut there this year. And there is a seat open at the Andretti team, whom he drove for in May. Or what about swallowing his pride and sticking with McLaren, even if they are still with Honda, hope Honda can improve in the second year of this engine design, and do a deal whereby he could at least do the Indy 500 if the car was uncompetitive again? \\"We will consider all the options,\\" he said on Sunday. \\"But we did a fantastic qualifying and a fantastic start. \\"We won a lot of grands prix, a lot of things in our career and we should not be that far back.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The relationship between McLaren and their driver Fernando Alonso is under strain due to the poor reliability and performance of McLaren's Honda-supplied engines. Alonso, a two-time Formula 1 world champion, has lost faith in Honda, and McLaren is reportedly trying to end their current contract with the manufacturer. The team wants to keep Alonso, but finding a viable alternative to Honda has proven difficult, raising questions about the driver's future and the attractiveness of the team to potential sponsors. Alonso's options for alternative teams are also limited, with Renault and the U.S. Indy 500 the most likely potential prospects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The GazeGroup has been developing eye-controlled computer technology   for nearly 20 years. But those devices   have been mainly designed to aid those with disabilities, and are very expensive. \\"After a while, we figured out that probably the best way is to go for a mass-market approach,\\" says Gaze's Sune Alstrup Johansen, \\"where everybody would have this available.\\" Johansen and some of his colleagues have formed a new company, The Eye Tribe, which is hoping to develop the technology on a mass commercial level. The technology works by sending an infrared   light from the computing device toward the user's face. After measuring the user's eye movements, the technology is then able to easily know where a person's eyes are moving, allowing the eyes to control a cursor  . A software can determine the location of the eyes and tell where the user is looking on the screen. It even knows which image he is looking at. There has been a gradual change toward hands-free technology in recent years, particularly in the gaming world. Following Nintendo's popular Wii system, Xbox released the Kinect device, which lets users control their Xbox and play certain games using only their hands, legs and voices.  Since most smartphones and other mobile devices can't come standard with an infrared device, Johansen said a replaceable filter   would be an inexpensive, convenient choice for most consumers. And even as companies like The Eye Tribe work to create a commercially practical product for the average user, making the eye-controlled technology more accessible and less expensive will have similar benefits for disabled users. \\"Then I can go to any computer, and then I can control it and I can use it, instead of just bringing my own,\\" said Stig Langvad, who heads up Denmark's umbrella organization for people with disabilities. \\"So I'll be a part of society on an equal foot, instead of...

Does the word \\"ulteriority\\" mean the same thing in \\"His stories were too susceptible to ulteriority.\\" and \\"A terrible feeling of ulteriority.\\"?","output":"Yes, the word \\"ulteriority\\" has the same fundamental meaning in both instances, but its specific nuances and implications differ according to the context in which it is used. \\"Ulteriority\\" essentially refers to the state or quality of having underlying or hidden intentions, motives, or meanings. The term is derived from the adjective \\"ulterior,\\" which means lying beyond what is openly or directly expressed, something concealed or underlying. In the first sentence, \\"His stories were too susceptible to ulteriority,\\" the use of \\"ulteriority\\" signifies that the stories in question may be prone to having hidden or indirect meanings that may not be easily discernible to the reader or listener. This usage suggests that the author of the stories might have intentionally or inadvertently included underlying messages or motives that are not apparent on the surface. In the second sentence, \\"A terrible feeling of ulteriority,\\" the term \\"ulteriority\\" is used to denote an unexplained sense of suspicion or mistrust. This typically arises from a belief that there might be concealed intentions or motives that have not been made explicit, which could lead to negative consequences or outcomes. This usage highlights a more emotional response to a situation, indicating that the person experiencing this feeling might be uneasy or wary due to a perception that something hidden is at play. While the core meaning of \\"ulteriority\\" remains the same in both instances, the way it is employed within each context shifts how it should be interpreted. In the first sentence, it alludes to the presence of concealed meanings within stories, whereas, in the second sentence, it describes an unsettling feeling arising from the notion that some underlying motives are at work. By understanding the subtle differences in how \\"ulteriority\\" is utilized, we can better appreciate its meaning in diverse circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's Not So Simple There was an awkward silence when Terry Rhodes introduced himself to a group of government officials in a West African capital recently. He had called the meeting to discuss the license his company, Celtel International, needed to set up mobile phone service there. Rhodes and his partner, Mo Ibrahim, had founded Celtel in 1998 determined to do business in sub-Saharan Africa by playing it clean. Thanks to persistence and an understanding of local politics, they had already set up phone service in a few neighboring countries without paying a single bribe. Rhodes hoped this meeting would clear the way to securing a license for which they had already paid the statutory fee of 750,000. Instead, the government officials said almost nothing. Only later did Rhodes learn why. One of them had sent a fax that morning to Celtel's Amsterdam headquarters listing the government representatives who would attend the meeting with monetary amounts next to them totaling about 50,000. These were payments just for attendance at the meeting. Further bribes would be needed to close the deal. Because of poor telephone service, Rhodes hadn't learned about the fax when he met the officials. They looked like they were expecting something, but with nothing forthcoming the meeting reached a deadlock. The corruption in that situation is obvious enough. Yet when you look at how business is practiced around the world, it's often not so clear what is corrupt and what is not. We typically identify corruption with side payments, cronyism and nepotism, but all those activities can be entirely legitimate when practiced responsibly in the right cultural context. Corruption is activity that corrupts. It undermines the system in which it occurs. Because business systems can work very differently, different kinds of activity corrupt them. Lee Kam Sheung started the Chinese food products firm Lee Kum Kee as a small oyster sauce business in 1888. By 2005 the family-owned company employed 3,900 workers and was selling its products in 80 countries. Lee's grandson Man Tat was group chairman and had appointed his four sons to serve as chairmen and/or chief executives of various divisions. Man Tat was aware of the importance of bringing managerial expertise into his growing company. He addressed that need partly by sending his sons to business schools in the U.S. before persuading them to join the company. He also set out to recruit non-family professionals as board members and high-level managers. He sought persons who, in his words, were \\"culturally attuned to the firm, and to family as CEOs of its divisions.\\" That is, he wanted professional managers who were comfortable with nepotism. Westerners tend to associate nepotism with lazy and incompetent relatives of bosses. Yet it can have definite advantages in a Confucian culture, where loyalty to the family is paramount. Where a Western grandfather may go easy on his grandson, a Chinese grandfather has authority. He may be able to extract more work from family members than from anyone else. They may not be the most talented possible candidates for a job, but the grandfather knows their strengths and weaknesses intimately and can assign them duties that take advantage of their particular skills. Nepotism becomes corruption when elders don't exercise enough care in placing their relatives. Responsible nepotism, however, can be perfectly legitimate for a company in the right cultural setting, as Lee Kum Kee illustrates. The same goes for cronyism. A purchasing agent in Taiwan may award a contract to an old friend rather than the lowest bidder because the friend can be trusted to deliver a good product. That kind of responsible cronyism (known as guanxi) has been a foundation of business in Taiwan for centuries. It becomes corrupt only when the agent favors friends simply because they are friends, rather than because they can be trusted to do the job right. Many such cultural differences arise from the fact that Western cultures are built on rules and transparency, while most of the world's other cultures are relationship-based. Westerners trust rule-based institutions; others trust their friends and family far more and are therefore especially keen to cultivate strong relationships. Gifts to officials can play an important role in relationship building. For example, Korean businessmen granted a meeting with an important official may bring an envelope full of cash as a token of gratitude. They may send the official a generous gift in observance of a wedding, or in condolence after a death in the family. Within limits, these gifts merely signal a commitment to the relationship. Personal connections of this kind have historically helped to align the powerful chaebol--family-owned firms--with government policies, and thus they have been a key to Korea's economic success. Culturally appropriate gift-giving can, of course, easily slip into quid-pro-quo bribery, as frequently happens in Korea. Side payments are a constant temptation in a relationship-based system, because they are a shortcut past the slow and laborious process of building relationships based on trust. The West has its own temptations. With our increasing reliance on rules and transparency, the power of relationships and personal authority in our culture has weakened over the years. With legal supervision relatively light, the system relies largely on voluntary compliance with ethical and legal norms. This makes for an efficient economy, but there is constant temptation to cheat or take shortcuts. That is corruption, no less than is bribery. Its effects are amply illustrated by the recent crisis in the Western financial system, when a few irresponsible players precipitated a global credit freeze. Even bribery in West Africa can be seen as a responsible practice gone awry. In a traditional village context, African leaders earned respect by judiciously bestowing gifts and favors on their subjects. That wasn't simply a patronage system; it was also a form of rational redistribution. The chief channeled wealth where it was most needed, increasing the community's survival advantage. With the coming of colonialism and Western-style institutions, men frequently left villages to take government jobs in the capital. They continued to use gifts to obtain influence, but they left behind the social context that had structured and guided the practice. Responsible generosity became irresponsible influence peddling. Business executives operating in Africa today should try to earn the influence they need through responsible generosity. They might build infrastructure or schools instead of paying off officials or political parties. There--and in general--the key to avoiding corruption is to understand what makes the local business culture work, and to stick to practices that reinforce the system, not ones that tear it apart. John Hooker is a professor at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. For a more detailed discussion of this topic, see his \\"Corruption from a Cross-cultural Perspective,\\" in Vol. 16, Issue 3 of Cross-Cultural Management: An International Journal (2009). The Celtel experience is further described in the 2008 London Business School case study \\"Terry Rhodes,\\" by A. Karim, T. Putimahtama, and J. Mullins. The LKK story is told in the 2005 IMD case study \\"Lee Kum Kee Co. Ltd.: The Family Recipe,\\" by C. Lief and J. L. Ward. What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the complex nature of corruption and how cultural differences can make certain practices seem corrupt when they may not be in a specific context.

While both questions focus on a negative event involving the individual, the context and the actions being referred to are different. 1. What is the worst thing someone has pressured you to do? This question is asking about a situation in which the individual was pressured, influenced, or coerced by someone else to engage in an activity or decision against their will or better judgment. It focuses on the negative consequences that may have resulted from succumbing to that pressure, and the person's feelings or experiences as they navigated that situation. This question acknowledges the external force and implies a certain level of manipulation, persuasion, or control by the other person. The emphasis is on the act of being pressured by someone else and the resulting action that the individual took. 2. What is the worst thing that someone did to you?

However, the sentence did not provide any details regarding the man's age.  In other words, the original sentence makes no explicit indication of whether this man is young, old, or somewhere in between.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"While the two questions might seem related, they are not the same and address different aspects of the genetics and reasoning behind blue eyes in wolves. 1. Can wolves have blue eyes? Yes, wolves can have blue eyes. Blue-eyed wolves are rare but possible due to the variation in eye color among these animals. Eye color in wolves is determined by various genetic factors and typically ranges from yellow to amber, with some rare cases of blue eyes. Studies have found that multiple genes, rather than a single gene mutation, might affect the eye color in wolves. Blue-eyed wolves are most frequently seen in Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes and occur less frequently in other breeds. In newborn wolf pups, blue eyes are a common phenomenon. The reason behind this is that the melanin, responsible for the eye color, is not fully developed at birth, leading to the bluish tint. As the wolf pups grow older, the melanin production increases, and their eyes generally turn into a more common color found in adult wolves, such as amber or yellow. Blue eyes in adult wolves are relatively rare occurrences and can be attributed to specific genetic combinations. 2. Why do wolves have blue eyes? The reason wolves have blue eyes is due to variations in their genetic makeup. Eye color in wolves is influenced by the specific combination of genes that they inherit from their parents. Wolves can possess both dominant and recessive genes, which determine several traits, including eye color. The possession of a unique combination of genes can result in a wolf having blue eyes. In the case of blue eyes, it is believed to be a result of the complex interplay of multiple genes that regulate melanin's distribution in the iris, which could lead to less melanin in the front layer of the iris. The phenomenon is marked by a particular scattering of light in the stroma, which is the fibrous, connective tissue of the iris, contributing to the blue color. Because blue eyes are determined by a specific interaction of multiple genes, wolves that have this trait are less common compared to those with the more prevalent eye colors. In summary, the first question, \\"Can wolves have blue eyes?\\", is aimed at establishing whether wolves can possess blue eyes or not. Meanwhile, the second question, \\"Why do wolves have blue eyes?\\", explores the process and genetic factors behind the blue eye color in those wolves that do have it. These two questions address different aspects of the blue-eyed phenomenon in wolves, and thus, while related, they are not the same."},{"instruction":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: My main comment is, if you want to be reading about tracing wood grains, you'll enjoy this book.

By the time I realized the mistake I couldn't send it back because it was too close to Christmas. So I would not recommend ordering from this company! Is this product review negative?","output":"Yes, this product review is negative. The main reason this review is considered negative is due to the various issues and dissatisfaction experienced by the customer. Below is the explanation as to why this review has a negative tone and points out several issues with the product and company: 1. Wrong product received: The customer states that they received a different product than the one they ordered. Receiving the wrong product is a significant inconvenience for the customer, as it implies one or more issues with the fulfilment and shipping process. In this case, the customer received a foosball tabletop game, which was not their original choice. 2. Lesser value product: The review also highlights that the received product had a lower price compared to the one initially ordered. This further adds to the frustration, as not only was the wrong product sent, but the customer also paid a higher price and did not receive the corresponding value. 3. Inability to return the item: The timing of their realization of the mistake made it impossible for the customer to return the item due to the impending Christmas season. As a result, the customer was unable to correct this unfortunate situation. 4. Lack of recommendation: The negative experience has made the customer not want to recommend the company to others. This shows the customer's loss of faith in the company's ability to deliver the right product promptly and accurately. Consequently, it contributes to the negative tone of the review. In summary, the product review is negative primarily because the customer received the wrong item, was charged the higher price, could not send back the product in time due to the holiday season, and ultimately does not recommend ordering from the company. These factors combined portray a disappointed and dissatisfied customer, characterizing the overall review as negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Q: Multiple sclerosis, huntington’s disease, parkinson’s disease, and alzheimer’s disease are example of diseases of which body system?    Choices:  - muscular system  - lymphatic system  - circulatory system  - nervous system  A: The answer is:","output":"The answer is: Nervous System. Multiple sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease are all examples of diseases that affect the nervous system. The nervous system is responsible for transmitting signals between different parts of the body and is made up of two primary components: the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which connects the central nervous system to the rest of the body. Here is a brief overview of each of these diseases: 1. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system attacks the protective covering of nerve fibers, called myelin. This causes communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body, eventually leading to nerve damage. 2. Huntington's disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the HTT gene. The disease affects motor control, cognitive abilities, and psychiatric symptoms. As the disease progresses, it leads to a gradual decline in physical and mental abilities. 3. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the brain's motor system. The disease is caused by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in a region of the brain called the substantia nigra. Symptoms include tremors, stiffness, and balance problems. 4. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, which is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting memory, thinking, and behavior. Alzheimer's is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles in the brain, leading to the loss of brain cells and impairment of cognitive functions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fernando Alonso, the double world champion who recently left Ferrari, will rejoin McLaren for the 2015 season, which gets underway in March. The Spaniard, who won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006, joins the British team after ending his four-year association with Ferrari. He will be partnered by Jenson Button, whose services were retained above Kevin Magnussen, who stays on as a test and reserve driver.

It was all but certain that Alonso would re-sign with McLaren for the 2015 season, but the announcement was not made official until several months later. The news came as a welcome relief to fans who had eagerly been anticipating the confirmation. Fernando Alonso, a Spanish driver who secured back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006, ended his four-year stint with the prestigious Ferrari team before rejoining McLaren for the season that was scheduled to begin in March 2015. The confirmation of his decision to partner with Jenson Button, an experienced British driver who has won numerous titles and accolades over the course of his career. Between Alonso and Button, they have amassed three world titles, 47 Grand Prix wins, and 147 podium finishes from a combined total of 500 races. The decision to hold off on announcing Alonso's signing with McLaren until they had managed to secure Button as his teammate was a strategic one on behalf of the team. This allowed them to maintain an air of mystery and intrigue around their lineup until they were confident in sharing the news. Jenson Button, a highly accomplished driver in his own right, was ultimately chosen to partner with Alonso for the 2015 season, beating out the talented Danish driver Kevin Magnussen. Magnussen, who enjoyed a successful career with McLaren before this decision was made, was retained as a test and reserve driver for the team. The combination of the formidable talents of Alonso and Button made for an exciting partnership and a promising future for McLaren. Alonso's return to McLaren marked a new chapter in an already storied career. His previous success with Renault, which included titles in 2005 and 2006, had solidified his status as one of the top drivers in the Formula One world. His move to Ferrari, one of the most iconic and successful teams in the sport, garnered him even more recognition and respect. However, it seemed that the union between Alonso and Ferrari was not destined to endure, and the split led to his eventual return to McLaren. The 2015 season offered plenty of opportunities for this dynamic duo to prove their worth on the track. With experienced team leaders and skilled engineers at the helm, the McLaren-Button-Alonso combination held great potential for success. As the team embarked on what was sure to be an exciting season, fans eagerly awaited the chance to see these two accomplished drivers work together, with the aim of achieving further glory and adding to McLaren's storied history in the world of Formula One racing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Molly has just moved to a new city for a job she was just hired for. She used to live in a city up in the mountains named Midgar. She liked living there due to the hikes she could go on and seeing the beautiful nature of the hills and mountains. The town she lives in now, Treno, is closer to sea level and is mostly flat plains and farm land. It's a change of scenery, and she hopes she starts to enjoy it more.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which city has an atmosphere with less depth?  Hint: Like water in the ocean, air in the atmosphere exerts pressure that increases with depth. Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s surface by gravity. As a result, air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes. This is illustrated in Figure below . Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest. At higher altitudes, the pressure is less because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. At such high altitudes, low air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health. A:","output":"Midgar B: Treno To determine which city has an atmosphere with less depth, we need to consider the information provided in the hint. It mentions that air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and more slowly at higher altitudes. Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest, and it is less at higher altitudes, where the depth is less. Based on the information provided in the paragraph about Molly: - Midgar is a city up in the mountains with hills and mountains. - Treno is closer to sea level and consists mostly of flat plains and farm land. Given this, we can infer that Midgar is at a higher altitude than Treno. Since the depth of the atmosphere is less at higher altitudes, the city with an atmosphere with less depth is: A: Midgar"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does \\"Sinhalese Buddhist reformers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the Pali Canon as the original version of scripture.\\" correctly answer the question of Sinhalese buddhist reformer portrayed what Canon as the original version of scripture?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Sinhalese Buddhist reformers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the Pali Canon as the original version of scripture\\" accurately answers the question of what Canon was portrayed by Sinhalese Buddhist reformers as the original version of scripture. To provide more context and information, let us delve deeper into the background of the Sinhalese Buddhist reform movement and the significance of the Pali Canon. Sinhalese Buddhism refers to the Theravada Buddhist tradition practiced in Sri Lanka, which has a rich historical and cultural legacy. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Sri Lanka experienced a revival of Buddhism, spurred by a combination of factors including the impact of British colonial rule, the emergence of a national consciousness, and the need to reassert the religious and cultural heritage of the island. In this period, several Sinhalese Buddhist reformers emerged, including Anagarika Dharmapala, Ratmalane Sri Dharmaloka Thera, Waskaduwe Subhūti Maha Thera, and Walane Siri Siddhartha Maha Thera. These reformers played pivotal roles in the Buddhist revival movement by emphasizing the importance of study, practice, and dissemination of Buddhist teachings in their original form. The Pali Canon, also known as the Tipitaka or Three Baskets, is considered the most ancient and comprehensive collection of Theravada Buddhist teachings. The Canon consists of three divisions: the Vinaya Pitaka (rules and discipline for monastics), the Sutta Pitaka (sermons and discourses), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (philosophical and psychological analysis). The teachings contained in the Pali Canon are believed to have been recorded in Pali, the lingua franca of the ancient Indian subcontinent during the time of the Buddha. This collection of texts serves as the foundation for modern Theravada Buddhism. Sinhalese Buddhist reformers stressed the importance of the Pali Canon, which they believed represents the true and original form of the Buddha's teachings. By portraying the Pali Canon as the authentic and authoritative source of Buddhist scripture, the reformers established a clear link between Sinhalese Buddhism and the earliest teachings of the historical Buddha. This emphasis on the primacy of the Pali Canon also served to differentiate Theravada Buddhism from other forms of Buddhism, such as Mahayana and Vajrayana, which employ additional texts and interpretations of the teachings. In conclusion, the statement that \\"Sinhalese Buddhist reformers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the Pali Canon as the original version of scripture\\" accurately answers the question about the Canon that these reformers focused on. These reformers aimed to preserve the purity and authenticity of Buddhist teachings by promoting the study and practice of the Pali Canon as the definitive source of the Buddha's teachings. This focus on the Pali Canon played a crucial role in the revival and establishment of the unique identity of Sinhalese Buddhism in Sri Lanka during this period."},{"instruction":"Fact 1: Blood pressure is highest in arteries and lowest in veins.

The observation that old windows are sometimes found to be thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another. This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The reason for the observation is that in the past, when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the crown glass process, described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun. When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames at the bottom of the window. Occasionally such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or right. The thickness at the bottom of glass panes was once taken as evidence that glass had features of what state of matter?","output":"The thickness at the bottom of glass panes was once taken as evidence that glass had features of a liquid state of matter.

Question: Process:  - A bird hatches from an egg - The bird is nurtured by its parents - And is fed food for growth - The bird grows - Begins to learn how to fly - The bird matures - The bird leaves its nest - The bird makes its own nest.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose baby bird stays with parents happens, how will it affect MORE birds.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if a baby bird stays with its parents, it will affect the overall population dynamics and behavior of birds. The suggested perturbation underlies the premise that the baby bird does not follow the conventional process of growth and independence. It is important to understand the implications of this perturbation at various levels, such as individual birds, family units, species, and ecosystems. Direct effects of baby birds staying with their parents: 1. Competition for resources: If the offspring continues to stay with its parents, they might end up competing for the same resources, such as food, nesting sites, and mates. This increased competition may lead to higher stress levels in the birds and decrease the overall availability of resources for all birds in the area. 2. Maturity delays: The baby bird's prolonged stay with its parents could result in slowed development or delayed maturity. A delay in maturity could impact the bird's ability to reproduce and maintain population levels within its species. Indirect effects of baby birds staying with their parents: 1. Social structure: If, in general, baby birds stay with their parents for longer periods, it will alter the social structure of the bird species. An increased number of family units with multiple generations living together would change the way they communicate, defend territories, and forage for food. 2. Population dynamics: The prolonged stay of offspring may cause the reproduction rate of the bird species to decrease due to delayed maturity and reduced availability of resources. The altered population dynamics could lead to fluctuations in their population size, including a potential reduction of population growth. 3. Interspecies interactions: With less room for new nests, the affected species may encroach upon the territories of other species or find it challenging to create their own. This could lead to an increase in interspecies competition and disruptions in the ecological balance among the bird communities, affecting the overall ecosystem. 4. Evolutionary implications: If the trend of staying with parents becomes widespread among a particular species, it may create a selection pressure over time. Birds that are more inclined to remain with their parents could be less fit for survival or reproduction, potentially driving an evolutionary change in their social behaviors. 5. Impact on ecosystems: Changes in bird populations and behaviors could have cascading consequences on the ecosystem. Birds play a vital role as pollinators, seed dispersers, and predators of insects. Therefore, any shift in their populations could impact the functioning of the entire ecosystem. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of baby birds staying with their parents has both direct and indirect effects on the process of bird growth and maturation and can impact individual birds, family units, species, and ecosystems. A sustained trend of staying with parents could lead to notable changes in the dynamics of bird populations and have far-reaching implications on overall ecosystem health and species interactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The water levels were high enough in the fall so they proceeded in lowering the water level by 10 feet..  and a hint : The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year.  Please answer this question : Which season were the lake water levels lower this spring or last spring? A:","output":"The lake water levels were lower this spring compared to last spring. According to the provided information, last year was characterized by ample precipitation and a very wet season, which led to higher water levels. As a result, the rangers had to let water out of the lake in the fall to lower the water level by 10 feet to prevent potential ice damage to docks and other structures around the lake. On the other hand, this spring, the Alpine lake experienced low water levels, although it is usually at full level by late spring. This might be attributed to occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, as mentioned in the hint. Therefore, the water levels were lower this spring compared to last spring."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Contrary to how the Protestant Reformers were often characterized, the concept of a catholic or universal Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation. On the contrary, the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation. The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted. Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them. In order to justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants often posited a new argument, saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority, only a spiritual, invisible, and hidden church—this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation.

He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

In the paragraph, it is mentioned that Sayyid Qutb, an influential thinker for Osama Bin Laden, described the world as being divided into two conditions: Islam and jahiliyya (ignorance and unbelief). According to Qutb's view, which Bin Laden shares, humans can only choose between these two conditions, and there is no middle ground.  Qutb also believed that many people, including Muslims, were being drawn to jahiliyya because of its material comforts, and as a result, they were seen as a threat to the pure version of Islam that Qutb and Bin Laden advocate. It is within this context that they both rationalize mass murder and hatred toward nonbelievers, including Americans, as a necessary defense of their interpretation of the Islamic faith. In their perspective, Muslims who do not accept their views are considered nonbelievers and are also worthy of destruction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries.  But I can use this background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  What is an answer for this question: Which fruit retained their quality longer peaches or cherries?","output":"In order to answer the question \\"Which fruit retained their quality longer, peaches or cherries?\\" we will take the following steps: 1. Analyze the data provided: Mary candied her peaches, while Ann ate her cherries fresh. 2. Review the information about the preservation method: According to the background information given, the process of candying fruit allows it to retain its quality for a year due to the saturation of sugar preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms.  Given the information provided, we can deduce that: Since Mary candied her peaches, they would have retained their quality for up to a year.

In 1996, Lindsay McDougall joined the line-up on lead guitar and backing vocals. Three of the group's albums have entered the top 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart: A Man's Not a Camel (1999), Frenzal Rhomb's Whalley and McDougall worked as Jay and the Doctor on Triple J's breakfast show from January 2005 through to November 2007. Prior to their employment at Triple J, the group's music had been banned after they had earlier criticised the station on air for playing the \\"same 40 songs\\". In 2004, they were asked to perform occasional late night shifts and request segments, which developed into the breakfast show slot. Their format includes banter where they provide \\"quips, one-liners, slagging off each other, other bands, other breakfast announcers, listeners, Triple J, Australian Idol and St Ives. It's verbal ping pong but more discursive.\\"  The band released Forever Malcolm Young in October 2006 - the title is a conflated reference to the 2005 song \\"Forever Young\\" by Youth Group and the name of AC/DC's guitarist, Malcolm Young - which peaked in the top 40. It provided a minor radio hit with the title track. Some controversy was expressed over the profanity in the title and lyrics of \\"Johnny Ramone was in a Fucking Good Band, but He Was a Cunt\\" (see Johnny Ramone, Ramones). Whalley's attitude to profanity and obscenity is \\"I often get amazed how offended people get by language, especially in Australia when its nothing you wouldn't hear in your local office or schoolyard. But we do make a point of shaking things up\\". Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll described them \\"[their] history is littered with legendary stories, perhaps true, perhaps exaggerations, but stories which fuel and match their song and album titles. Their songs are often profane, likely to poke fun at someone including themselves, hint at a social conscience, and inside all the tough talk and body jokes be hopelessly romantic.\\"  National touring followed the album's release, along with the announcement that from November 2007 Whalley would be leaving both Frenzal Rhomb and his job at Triple J to go on a world trip with his girlfriend. Some later copies of Forever Malcolm Young contained a bonus DVD covering the band's tours from 2002 up until 2005. It is titled Sucking All Over the World.

OPTIONS: [i] no. [ii] yes.","output":"[i] no. The questions you asked have different meanings. I will explain them to you one by one. 1. Why does yellow mustard relieve a burn? Yellow mustard can sometimes help with a burn because it has ingredients like vinegar and cold temperature that can cool down and soothe the burn area.

Today's story is about a lady named Dana Holmes and how she is taking a stand against some police officers who didn't follow the rules. Dana believes they did a search on her that was not needed and against the law. Let's find out more! One day, Dana Holmes was arrested because she was driving her car after drinking alcohol, which is known as a DUI arrest. When the police officers caught her, they took her to a place called a jail, where people who break the rules stay for some time.  However, the story doesn't end there! Dana says that the four officers in the jail did something very wrong. They searched her in a way that she thought was not needed and against the law. In fact, Dana feels so strongly about this that she has decided to sue, or take legal action, against these officers and the police station. To help her with this problem, Dana has a lawyer, which is a person who knows the law very well and can help others when they have problems with it. The lawyer wants to make sure this doesn't happen to more women. He has found out that other women may have been searched in an illegal way too! Because of this, the lawyer is trying to protect everyone by asking the jail to keep all the video recordings taken inside the building. These recordings can show what the police officers and people in the jail are doing. If they have done something wrong, the videos can help to prove it. In conclusion, Dana Holmes is standing up for her rights and other women who may have been treated unfairly.

The fifth, the likely frontrunner, is a full-size S.U.V. that weighs almost three tons and is only affordable if you make a six-figure income. Saturn Aura Hybrid — This Green Line Hybrid was introduced at the Los Angeles show a year ago and is now on sale, although Saturn says availability is limited. The Green Line system shuts the four-cylinder gas engine off at stoplights, resulting in a savings of a couple of miles per gallon in city driving. This model costs 2,300 more than the base, gas-only 20,395 Aura XE. Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid — This vehicle features the same mild-hybrid system that General Motors introduced in the Green Line, but this model has a base price about 14 percent — 2,795 — more than a base 19,995 Malibu LS. The marketing pitch here is that the Malibu and Aura hybrids cost fractionally less than a Toyota Prius, but only because the timing of G.M.âs release of these two vehicles more or less coincided with the expiration of federal hybrid tax credits for the Prius. But the Prius is still far more economical than any of G.M.âs mild hybrids. Mazda Tribute Hybrid — Have you seen the Ford Escape Hybrid? Then youâve seen what powers this vehicle. The Mazda Tribute, which is just a re-badged Escape, is another way that Ford is trying to help amortize the development costs of its hybrid system (and the costs of Toyotaâs help in making the software to run it work). I like the Escape Hybrid, but the technology, having been introduced years ago, is now old news. Nissan Altima Hybrid — This is a very nice vehicle that Nissan seems to have thrown in a closet, with a “do not resuscitate” tag on it. It is only sold in a few states, where Nissan has determined the highest word-of-mouth interest in hybrids is. It is supported by little or nothing in the way of marketing or advertising campaigns. Nissan licensed the hybrid technology from Toyota because it didnât have the expertise or money to develop a serious hybrid of its own — at least not quickly enough. If the Altima wins, Nissan should send the trophy to Toyota — or bury it in the backyard. Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid — Hereâs your frontrunner; it is most likely to win, but should it? General Motors tells me I am missing the boat if I am not wowed by the hybrid technology in this vehicle. Well, it is pretty impressive. It was developed in conjunction with BMW and the old DaimlerChrysler. In fact, Chrysler is unveiling two hybrid vehicles, an Aspen S.U.V. and a Durango S.U.V., with the same technology, at this yearâs L.A. show. But I have two issues: The Two-Mode transmission system at work here is expensive and significantly drives up the cost of an already pricey vehicle. And G.M. insists, so far at least, on putting it only in the vehicles where it will do G.M. (and its Corporate Average Fuel Economy numbers) the most good. I suppose G.M. would argue that the world would be a better place if the public all bought massive S.U.V.’s from General Motors. But I donât think people interested in hybrids would buy that argument, or this vehicle. I think those buyers want truly economical, small-footprint vehicles that get 50-70 miles a gallon. (And, so far, they arenât getting them.) The Two-Mode hybrid system boosts the Tahoeâs city mileage to more than 20 m.p.g. If the technology is so good, why not just put it on all S.U.V.’s from General Motors? Or all G.M. vehicles for that matter? That would shake things up. That, of course, isn’t likely to happen. So that leaves me wondering where are the green cars worthy of a tree-hugger’s love, not to mention this award? Where are the game-changing sustainable mobility models, the visionary designs that will excite buyers and truly make a difference in our world? Still orbiting out there, I suppose, somewhere in Tomorrowland. Update, 7:19 p.m. — In comments, some readers have asked about mileage figures. Here they are: 2008 Chevrolet Malibu LS 4 - 22 city, 30 highway; the hybrid version - 24/32 2008 Saturn Aura XE 4 - 22/30; hybrid - 24/32 2008 Chevy Tahoe LS 2WD - 15/20 (4WD 14/19); hybrid 2WD - 21/22 (4WD 20/20) 2007 Nissan Altima CVT - 23/29; hybrid - 42/36 2008 Mazda Tribute - 19/24; hybrid - 34/30 Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Green Car of the Year Award Finals Disappoint with Outdated and Expensive Hybrid Technologies\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This casual fashion choice has been popular in Shanghai for years, with people sporting colorful and boldly-printed pajamas while going about their daily routines. The trend has even caught the attention of photographers and been featured in National Geographic. However, the city's upcoming hosting of the 2010 World Expo has prompted officials to launch an attack on this unconventional style choice, citing concerns with public etiquette. The South China Morning Post has reported that authorities in the Qiba neighborhood have been enlisting officials and volunteers since July in an effort to dissuade people from wearing their sleepwear outside the home. According to Chinese sociologist Zhang Jiehai, the custom of wearing pajamas in public first started as a practical solution to the city's cramped living conditions, which resulted in a blurred distinction between public and private spaces. While some residents may be unhappy with this crackdown on their personal fashion preferences, the effort to clean up the city's image in time for the World Expo highlights the importance of maintaining a certain standard of appearance in public settings.

Resigned: Sir Norman Bettison will step down next year. The head of West Yorkshire Police will stand down after being accused of smearing fans in the wake of the Hillsborough tragedy. Sir Norman Bettison said the move will allow independent officials to fully investigate the devastating allegations about his integrity. The chief constable said the recent uproar made him 'reflect' on 'what is best for the future of policing' in his force area. Two weeks ago he was accused of being involved in a South Yorkshire Police 'black propaganda' campaign set up to smear fans in the days after Hillsborough. The top officer was also forced to issue a humiliating apology after saying Liverpool fans were partly to blame for what happened. He faced calls to resign from the families of victims for criticising fans' behaviour despite an independent panel clearing them of wrongdoing. Sir Norman, 56, said he will retire from his £225,000 post on March 31 next year, despite being recently granted an extension to his contract. It remains to be seen whether he will receive any extra pay off over his gold-plated public sector pension of up to £150,000 a year. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating Sir Norman's conduct in the aftermath of Hillsborough. The damning report on the Hillsborough disaster laid bare a shocking cover-up which attempted to shift the blame on to its 96 victims. The inquiry found that 164 police statements were altered, 116 of them to remove or alter 'unfavourable' comments about the policing of the match and the unfolding disaster. The. watchdog said it is conducting a 'detailed assessment' of a referral. from West Yorkshire Police Authority. It is also examining his comments. last month. Supporters of Sir Norman said he has been the victim of a 'witch-hunt' in the wake of the release of the explosive Hillsborough report. In a statement released last night, he said: 'Recent weeks have caused me to reflect on what is best for the future of policing in West Yorkshire and I have now decided to set a firm date for my retirement of March 31, 2013. Tragic: Liverpool fans tried to get away from the crush in the stadium. Trevor Hicks, who lost his daughters Vicki, 15, and Sarah, 19, in the tragedy wants the chief constable stripped of his knighthood. 'Furthermore, I hope it will enable. the Independent Police Complaints Commission to fully investigate. allegations that have been raised about my integrity. 'They need to be fairly and fully investigated and I welcome this independent and formal scrutiny.' Margaret Aspinall, chairwoman of the. Hillsborough Families Support Group, said: 'Obviously I’m very, very. pleased. I’m absolutely delighted that he’s going. 'But then he’ll be going on his full. pension, and I’d like to know the full reasons why he’s choosing to. retire as soon as this.' Mrs Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son. James died in the tragedy, said: 'Why didn’t he stay, then, until the. IPCC came out with their investigation? 'But he’s decided to leave. I’m not arguing against it, because I’m thrilled that he is going.' Sir Norman, who began his policing career in South Yorkshire, has denied any wrongdoing in relation to the disaster. Anne Williams, whose 15-year-old son. Kevin died on the Leppings Lane terrace, said the findings of the recent. report left Sir Norman with no choice but to retire. She said: 'I think the whole lot of. them who have been involved for these 23 years should all go for the. hurt that they have caused us for 23 years. 'I don’t think he would have retired if it wasn’t for the Hillsborough report.' Trevor Hicks, who lost his two. daughters, 19-year-old Sarah and 15-year-old Victoria, told ITV News:. 'I’m glad he’s realised his position. is untenable, however I’m determined that he does not escape his just. desserts and I will make sure he’s stripped of his knighthood. 'He should leave with nothing, like he tried to leave the families.' Questions about Sir Norman’s role in. the investigation of the tragedy have dogged him as he has risen through. the higher ranks of the police - most notably when there were protests. from the families of those who died when he became Chief Constable of. Merseyside in 1998. Undeterred. by this opposition, Sir Norman stayed on in Liverpool for six years and. was even named an honorary fellow of the city’s John Moores University. Liverpool fans held up a Hillsborough banner before the match between Liverpool and Manchester United after the explosive report. Support: Liverpool fans hold up a mosiac spelling out 'justice' and 'the truth' after report findings. After retiring from the police in 2004 to become the chief executive of Centrex, a firm which offered training to police forces, he was knighted for services to policing in 2006. Returning to an active role in the police and Yorkshire, Sir Norman became West Yorkshire Police’s chief constable in January 2007 and was designated the officer responsible for overseeing policing of domestic extremism. Last month he was singled out as the. most senior serving policeman allegedly involved in a 'black propaganda' campaign that followed the 1989 stadium disaster. He was part of a South Yorkshire. Police unit which tried to ensure the force was exonerated over the. tragedy and fans were put in the spotlight. The report revealed that as a chief. inspector he produced a video for MPs which highlighted how a pitch. invasion was 'thought' to have happened. It added that policing a match was 'reliant on some co-operation' from fans. Liverpool MP Maria Eagle said the unit he was part of was nothing more than a 'black propaganda' campaign. But Sir Norman insisted he had 'nothing to hide' as a clamour for him to resign intensified but sparked fresh fury by placing some blame on fans. He stressed he had played no role in changing officers' accounts of what happened, saying: 'I never altered a statement nor asked for one to be altered.' He pointed out that he had been off-duty and attended the fateful FA Cup semi-final match as a fan, immediately joining the police effort. In 1998, several police authority members quit when Sir Norman was made chief of Merseyside over his role in preparing the police response to Hillsborough. In April 2010, Sir Norman raised eyebrows by saying that he was not worth his bumper pay and pension package. He said huge pay awards were 'untenable' and many employed by the state were following a vocation and would happily do the job for less pay. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1. Sir Norman Bettison, head of West Yorkshire Police, announced his decision to step down after being accused of smearing fans in the wake of the Hillsborough tragedy. 2. His resignation will allow independent officials to fully investigate the devastating allegations made against his integrity. 3. Sir Norman was accused of being involved in a South Yorkshire Police 'black propaganda' campaign set up to smear fans in the aftermath of the tragedy. 4. The chief constable issued a humiliating apology after saying Liverpool fans were partly to blame for the disaster, and faced calls to resign for criticising fans' behaviour despite an independent panel clearing them of wrongdoing. 5. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is conducting a detailed assessment of Sir Norman's conduct in the aftermath of Hillsborough. 6. Sir Norman will retire from his £225,000 post on March 31 next year, despite being recently granted an extension to his contract. 7. It is uncertain whether he will receive any extra payment in addition to his gold-plated public sector pension of up to £150,000 a year. 8. The recent Hillsborough report revealed a cover-up that attempted to shift the blame towards the 96 victims and exposed that 164 police statements were altered to remove or alter 'unfavourable' comments about the policing of the match and the unfolding disaster. 9. Supporters of Sir Norman claim that he has been the victim of a 'witch-hunt' following the release of the explosive Hillsborough report. 10. Families of victims and survivors express mixed reactions towards Sir Norman's resignation, with some celebrating his departure and others demanding further punishment and stripping of honors."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mix water and bleach at a ratio of roughly half a cup of bleach to one gallon of water. Wipe down the counter with the mixture, let it stand for five minutes, and then rinse the counter thoroughly with water. Justification: Option a is a more reasonable method for sanitizing a kitchen counter with bleach because it involves a proper dilution ratio of bleach to water, allowing the solution to effectively sanitize the surface without causing damage. The process of wiping the counter with the mixture, allowing it to stand for an appropriate timeframe (five minutes), and then rinsing with water ensures effective cleaning and removal of bleach residue. This will result in a cleaner and safely sanitized kitchen counter. On the other hand, option b has an improper dilution ratio and uses bleach to rinse the counter, which could lead to surface damage and potential health risks due to excessive exposure to concentrated bleach."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Ron says that he and his family found the island when he was little, and there is no one else there. They immediately start partying. During the party, a drunken Luis decides to go skinny dipping. Ron tells the others the story of Dinoshark, a shark who was implanted with dinosaur DNA in an experiment, but broke free, killed the scientists experimenting on him and entered the ocean. Kirby laughs and dismisses the story as a myth, along with the others. However, Luis is eaten alive by Dinoshark. Ron hits on Ali, but she turns him down, which makes him visibly angry. Dani dumps Pete for not supporting her in her stripper job, despite his pleas for her to forgive him. Dani then leaves the party to have sex with David after he gives her wine. She strips naked and convinces him to try a complicated sex position. However, when the position almost results in David getting injured, he storms off. After he leaves, Dinoshark leaps out of the water and grabs Dani's ankle. She tries holding onto a string of seaweed, but it ends up asphyxiating her and Dinoshark drags her corpse into the bay and eats most of it. David and Pete climb a cliff while Kirby and Mag argue, and Mag insults Kirby for being a virgin. Ron and Ali break up the fight.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which island used more oil?  Two neighboring islands Grey island and Sand island both contributed to global warming by their actions. Grey island contributed way more because they were more careless.  Hint: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.","output":"Based on the provided information, Grey island used more oil. The paragraph states that both Grey island and Sand island contributed to global warming, but Grey island contributed way more because they were more careless. Since the burning of fossil fuels such as oil contributes to global warming, it can be inferred that Grey island used more oil."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This Act may be cited as the \`\`Medical Nutrition Equity Act of  2017''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS.     Congress finds the following:             (1) Specialized food is often medically necessary for the          safe and effective management of many digestive and inherited          metabolic disorders that impact digestion, absorption, and          metabolism of nutrients.             (2) Although medically necessary food is essential for          patients, it is often expensive and not uniformly reimbursed by          health insurance, leaving many families with an insurmountable          financial burden.             (3) As a result, many patients who cannot afford medically          necessary food may experience adverse health consequences from          suboptimal disease management, including hospitalization,          intellectual impairment, behavioral dysfunction, inadequate          growth, nutrient deficiencies, and even death.

I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers. I get a lecture and a warning, the end. What is most likely her job? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. A cook  B. A fast food worker  C. A barista  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"Based on the information given in the situation, the correct answer is likely C. A barista. It is stated that she works in a chain cafe, and she talks about a customer complaining that her coffee took too long. This suggests that her role involves making and serving coffee, which is generally the purview of a barista. In addition, she mentions dealing with a steady stream of customers and her job requiring her to maintain a professional demeanor despite stress, tasks that are typically associated with being a barista. Consequently, her role is unlikely to be that of a cook, as this scenario is more concerned with customer interaction than food preparation. Fast food workers also deal with customers, but the specifics of the situation indicate a setting more specific to a coffee shop or cafe. Lastly, although we can never have 100% certainty in such classifications without more explicit information, the given context strongly supports the conclusion that she is a barista."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Couple split after photographs emerged of him with his hands on her neck. Saatchi has been spotted several times with fashion expert Trinny Woodall. Article:","output":"Title: The Ongoing Saga Between Charles Saatchi and Nigella Lawson: Recent Threats and New Relationships Introduction: There is never a dull moment in the saga between British art collector Charles Saatchi and his ex-wife, the TV chef and food writer Nigella Lawson. Their tumultuous relationship, which ended on bitter terms, seemed to be relatively left alone by the media in recent months as both parties moved on with their lives. However, recent sources have come to light revealing that this former Hollywood couple is still in the spotlight, and their story has continued on a different path. Charles Saatchi Threatens to Sue Nigella Lawson: Sources close to the couple have revealed that Saatchi is threatening legal action against Lawson for a staggering £500,000 sum. The reasons behind this threat remain undisclosed, but it appears that tensions continue to run high between the estranged pair. This development comes as a shock to many, especially considering the circumstances behind the couple's highly-publicized split. In June 2013, photographs emerged of Saatchi with his hands around Nigella Lawson's neck during an argument at an outdoor dining area in London. The images created a media firestorm, and the couple soon separated.  Saatchi later described the incident as a \\"playful tiff,\\" emphasizing that it was not violent in nature. However, Lawson was granted a swift divorce on the grounds of Saatchi's unreasonable behavior. Since that time, the art collector has received public backlash for his actions, and some speculate that the threatened lawsuit might be a means of feeling vindicated or regaining control. Trinny Woodall: Charles Saatchi's New Love Interest In another twist to the story, Charles Saatchi has also been spotted multiple times with fashion expert Trinny Woodall. Woodall, best known for her work on the television series \\"What Not to Wear,\\" seems to be romantically involved with Saatchi, and the pair has attended numerous events together. These public outings have left many wondering about the nature of their relationship. While both Saatchi and Woodall have not publicly commented on their personal lives, they have been seen enjoying each other's company frequently, leading many to believe that a romance is blossoming. The newly found companionship could potentially help Saatchi restore his public image, showing that he has moved past the painful events surrounding his previous marriage. Conclusion: While the whirlwind relationship between Charles Saatchi and Nigella Lawson may have ended, the repercussions are still being felt. With Saatchi's most recent threat of a lawsuit against his former spouse and his emerging relationship with Trinny Woodall, it appears that the story between these two public figures and their tumultuous past is far from over. It remains to be seen whether Saatchi's threatened lawsuit will come to fruition or whether the new relationship will outlast the public's ever-watchful eye. Although both parties have tried to move on after their explosive split, the scars of their past are still raw and visible, reminding us that even prestigious figures cannot elude the darker aspects of human nature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was also briefly a member of the UK Subs in 1991. He joined Rancid in 1993 after the band was searching for a second guitar player and was present on their second album \\"Let's Go\\". He has produced albums for bands such as Agnostic Front, The Business, Dropkick Murphys, Swingin Utters, Marky Ramone and the Intruders, Anti-Heros, Patriot, The Forgotten, Harrington Saints, and Pressure Point. He recently mixed Charged GBH's new album entitled \\"Perfume and Piss\\", as well as Cock Sparrer's album \\"Here We Stand\\" both alongside Michael Rosen.  - The Dropkick Murphys are an American Celtic punk band formed in Quincy, Massachusetts in 1996. The band was initially signed to independent punk record label Hellcat Records, releasing five albums for the label, and making a name for themselves locally through constant touring and yearly St. Patrick's Day week shows, held in and around Boston. The 2004 single \\"Tessie\\" became the band's first mainstream hit and one of their biggest charting singles to date. The band's final Hellcat release, 2005's \\"The Warrior's Code\\", included the song \\"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\\"; the song was featured in the 2006 Academy Award-winning movie \\"The Departed\\", and went on to become the band's only Platinum-selling single to date, and remains one of their best-known songs.

GBH have gone on to influence several punk rock musicians.   - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Proto-punk (or \\"protopunk\\") is the rock music played by garage bands<ref name=\\"Bangs (RS-2nd ed./Garage)\\"></ref> from the 1960s and early 1970s that presaged the punk rock movement. A retroactive label, the musicians involved were not originally associated with each other, coming from a variety of backgrounds and styles, but together they anticipated many of punk's musical and thematic attributes.  - Cock Sparrer is a punk rock band formed in 1972 (but didn't release an album until 78) in the East End of London, England. Although they have never enjoyed commercial success, they are considered one of the most influential street punk bands of all time, helping pave the way for early 80's punk scene and the Oi! subgenre. Their songs have been covered by many punk, Oi!, and hardcore bands.  - Viking is the second and final studio album by the American punk rock band Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards .  - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\")   - Anti-Heros were an American Oi!/street punk band formed in 1984 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.

The original lineup consisted of Mark Noah (vocals), Mike Jones (bass), Phil Solomon (drums) and Joe Winograd (guitar).

Process:  - Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky - Water droplets are in clouds - The air gets cold - Water droplets turn into ice crystals - Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose higher temperatures occur happens, how will it affect LESS snow.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of higher temperatures has a direct effect on the process of snow formation, resulting in less snow.  Step-by-step explanation: 1. Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky: If temperatures are higher, the evaporation rate will increase. However, this step does not directly impact the amount of snow. 2. Water droplets are in clouds: Higher temperatures might cause more water vapor in the atmosphere due to increased evaporation. This still does not directly impact the amount of snow, although it can have an effect on precipitation in general. 3. The air gets cold: This is a crucial step when it comes to snow formation. If the temperatures are higher, the air might not get cold enough for snow to form. Instead, precipitation might occur in the form of rain or other forms of liquid precipitation. This directly impacts the amount of snow. 4. Water droplets turn into ice crystals: If temperatures are higher, the atmospheric conditions required for water droplets to turn into ice crystals might not be met, preventing the formation of ice crystals and, in turn, snowflakes. This directly affects the amount of snow. 5. Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes: If the previous step is disrupted due to higher temperatures, there will be no ice crystals sticking together to form snowflakes, and subsequently, there will be less snow. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of higher temperatures directly affects the formation of snow by preventing the air from getting cold enough to support the formation of ice crystals and snowflakes. As a result, there will be less snow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Two really good soccer teams, West Ham United and Tottenham, were going to play against each other. A lot of people were very excited to watch this game because it was going to be loads of fun! Tottenham was a team that had a really good chance to become the number one team in the whole Premier League if they won this game. The Premier League is like a big competition with lots of soccer teams playing against each other, and everyone wants to be the best team in it. So, all the people who liked Tottenham really, really wanted their team to win, so they could be the best team for a while. But West Ham United was a team with some really good soccer players too, and they wanted to show everyone that they could play just as well, or maybe even better! On the day of the big game, lots of people went to Upton Park to watch and cheer for their favorite teams. The soccer players from both teams were really excited and a bit nervous, but they knew they had practiced a lot and were ready to play their best. As the game started, everyone could see that the West Ham United team was playing just amazing! They were running super-fast, kicking the soccer ball very strong, and working together really well.

Frizz is often caused by dryness, so it's important to restore moisture to your hair in the shower. Always use a sulfate-free shampoo. Sentence: You should never use shampoo that contains sulfates if you want to smooth frizzy hair.","output":"The sentence \\"You should never use shampoo that contains sulfates if you want to smooth frizzy hair\\" is generally true, though it can depend on the individual's hair type and the specific sulfate used in a shampoo. It is, however, an appropriate recommendation for most people, as sulfates are known to produce negative effects on certain hair types, especially those prone to frizziness. Sulfates are detergent-like chemicals commonly found in shampoos, which act as surfactants and help create lather. Their primary function is to remove dirt, oils, and buildup from the hair and scalp. The most common sulfates used in shampoos are sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES). While they effectively cleanse the hair and scalp, sulfates have a few downsides that make them problematic for those trying to manage frizzy hair. 1. Sulfates strip natural oils: They can be harsh and strip the hair of its natural oils, which can lead to dryness and ultimately damage. This dryness is a common cause of frizziness in hair, as it reduces the hair's ability to retain moisture. 2. Sulfates increase friction between hair strands: The use of sulfate-containing shampoos can increase the friction between the individual hair strands, making it more difficult to detangle and increasing the risk of breakage. This can worsen the appearance of frizziness. 3. Sulfates may irritate the scalp: For some individuals, sulfates can cause irritation and inflammation of the scalp. Inflammation can lead to a disruption in the scalp's natural moisture balance, leading to dryness and frizziness in the hair. By recommending a sulfate-free shampoo, one can mitigate these issues and better preserve the natural oils and moisture levels in the hair. Sulfate-free shampoos use gentler surfactants that cleanse the hair and scalp without stripping away essential oils. These products can be particularly beneficial for those with dry, damaged, or frizzy hair, as they help maintain the hair's moisture balance. However, it's essential to note that not all sulfates are created equal, and some milder sulfate options may not cause as much dryness as others. Additionally, some individuals may not experience the same level of frizziness or dryness when using sulfate-containing products. In conclusion, while the sentence \\"You should never use shampoo that contains sulfates if you want to smooth frizzy hair\\" is broadly accepted as true, it may not apply to everyone or every sulfate-containing shampoo. It is a good rule of thumb to follow, but individuals should consider their specific hair type and needs when choosing the ideal products for their hair care routine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was the first start for quarterback Brock Osweiler, substituting for the injured Peyton Manning. The Broncos grabbed the lead on their initial possession, when Osweiler, playing on his 25th birthday, connected with wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on a 48-yard touchdown pass. The Bears got on the scoreboard in the second quarter, with two field goals by placekicker Robbie Gould &#8212; from 46 and 37 yards out. The Broncos increased their lead to 10-6, with a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus as time expired in the second half. Midway through the third quarter, Broncos' linebacker Danny Trevathan intercepted a pass by Bears' quarterback Jay Cutler deep in Bears' territory. Six plays later, the Broncos were attempting to add to their lead on a 4th-and-goal, however, the Bears' defense prevailed after running back Ronnie Hillman was inadvertently tripped by Owseiler on the hand off at the 2-yard line. The Bears then marched down the field, and another 37-yard field goal by Gould narrowed the Broncos' lead to 10-9 near the end of the third quarter. The Broncos then increased their lead to 17-9 early in the fourth quarter, when Osweiler fired a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cody Latimer, who was playing in place of the injured Emmanuel Sanders. The Bears once again marched down the field, and were facing a 4th-and-goal from the Broncos' 4-yard line, however, a pass from Cutler to running back Jeremy Langford was broken up by Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib with ten minutes remaining in the game. The Broncos' offense chewed up six minutes of the clock, but were forced to punt, giving the football back to the Bears with 4:23 remaining. On the sixth play of the Bears' next drive, Broncos' linebacker Von Miller forced a strip sack and fumble off Cutler at the Broncos' 35-yard line, which was recovered by defensive end Malik Jackson with 2:30 remaining. However, the Broncos' offense went three-and-out, though they forced the Bears to burn two of their three team timeouts. Just after the two minute warning, the Bears marched down the field, and finally got into the end zone with only 29 seconds remaining, with Langford lunging for a 2-yard touchdown run. However, the Broncos' defense denied a two-point conversion running attempt by Langford, which would have tied the game. The Bears' subsequent onside kick was unsuccessful, and the Broncos' offense ran out the clock. NotesThis was the first game this season in which the Broncos' offense did not commit any turnovers. This was Bears' head coach John Fox's first game against the Broncos since mutually parting ways with the Broncos following the end of the 2014 season. It also marked Jay Cutler's first game against the Broncos, who drafted Cutler in the first round of the 2006 draft before he was traded to the Bears prior to the 2009 season. Cutler did not play when the Broncos and Bears last faced each in other in 2011 due to a thumb injury. How many yards longer was the first touchdown than the last one?","output":"The first touchdown of the game was a 48-yard pass from quarterback Brock Osweiler to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, while the last touchdown of the game was a 2-yard run by running back Jeremy Langford. To find the difference in yardage between the first and last touchdowns, subtract the yardage of the last touchdown from the yardage of the first one: 48 yards (first touchdown) - 2 yards (last touchdown) = 46 yards So, the first touchdown was 46 yards longer than the last one."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"What competition follows the continental championships?\\"  Context: \\"After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa América (CONMEBOL), African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Nations Cup (OFC). The FIFA Confederations Cup is contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup. This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the urban hubs that are within 6 miles of the ridge that picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge?, using the article: The Metacomet Ridge picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge, beginning on Sugarloaf Mountain and the parallel massif of Mount Toby, 1,269 feet (387 m), the high point of the Metacomet Ridge geography. Both Sugarloaf Mountain and Mount Toby are composed of erosion-resistant sedimentary rock. North of Mount Sugarloaf, the Pocumtuck Ridge continues as alternating sedimentary and traprock dominated strata to Greenfield, Massachusetts. From Greenfield north to 2 miles (3 km) short of the Vermont–New Hampshire–Massachusetts tri-border, the profile of the Metacomet Ridge diminishes into a series of nondescript hills and low, wooded mountain peaks composed of sedimentary rock with dwindling traprock outcrops.In Connecticut, the high point of the Metacomet Ridge is West Peak of the Hanging Hills at 1,024 feet (312 m); in Massachusetts, the highest traprock peak is Mount Tom, 1,202 feet (366 m), although Mount Toby, made of sedimentary rock, is higher. Visually, the Metacomet Ridge is narrowest at Provin Mountain and East Mountain in Massachusetts where it is less than 0.5 miles (1 km) wide; it is widest at Totoket Mountain, over 4 miles (6 km). However, low parallel hills and related strata along much of the range often make the actual geologic breadth of the Metacomet Ridge wider than the more noticeable ridgeline crests, up to 10 miles (16 km) across in some areas. Significant river drainages of the Metacomet Ridge include the Connecticut River and tributaries (Falls River, Deerfield River, Westfield River, Farmington River, Coginchaug River); and, in southern Connecticut, the Quinnipiac River.The Metacomet Ridge is surrounded by rural wooded, agricultural, and suburban landscapes, and is no more than 6 miles (10 km) from a number of urban hubs such as New Haven, Meriden, New Britain, Hartford, and Springfield. Small city centers abutting the ridge include Greenfield, Northampton, Amherst, Holyoke, West Hartford, Farmington, Wallingford, and Hamden., what would be the answer ?

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What does Moby Dick crush after dodging the nukes? The Pequod Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Moby and the Apocalypse\\" Genre: Sci-fi/Adventure Plot Outline: In a not-so-distant technologically advanced future, a radical organization orchestrates a dangerous plan to reignite the hunt for Moby Dick – the legendary great white whale. The group threatens international peace by fueling nuclear tensions between powerful nations. Their ultimate goal is to coerce the world into using nuclear weapons to force the ultimate showdown between man and beast. They believe that victory over Moby Dick can grant them global dominance and herald them as the ultimate saviors. World governments are caught in a nuclear arms race, and the hunt for Moby Dick intensifies. Sensing the urgency of the situation, a fearless crew led by the seasoned Captain Ahab, embarks on the \\"Pequod\\" – a modern, heavily armed ship designed for aquatic battles – to face the infamous whale in the watery battlefield. The aquatic war unfolds in dramatic pursuit, with numerous maritime vessels and submarines converging in an unforgiving, stormy ocean. As they trail the relentless beast, Moby Dick displays an uncanny intelligence, evading the nuclear bombardment through incredible displays of agility, speed, and stealth. Tensions rise as the crew of the Pequod witnesses the immensity and sheer power of Moby Dick for the first time. In a daring and unexpected move, Moby Dick surfaces near the Pequod and engages the vessel before anyone can react. Using its massive tail and jaw, the whale wreaks havoc on the ship, taking down helicopters on the deck, crushing weaponry, and carrying out a deadly rendezvous. Moby Dick doesn't escape unscathed; it sustains critical damage from the Pequod's advanced weapons, but it manages to incapacitate the ship's nuclear arsenal. In the climactic battle between the Pequod and Moby Dick, Captain Ahab and his crew find themselves at the mercy of the immense whale, as conventional weapons prove to be less effective. In a twist of fate, a rival crewmember, Ishmael, discovers an unusual connection with the great white beast – he can communicate empathically with Moby Dick. Moby Dick and the crew of the Pequod reach an uneasy truce, and they band together to stop the impending global nuclear catastrophe. With the whale's intelligence and unique abilities, they thwart the radical organization's plan and force them to expose their sinister plot to the world. The nuclear trigger is averted, and the nations converge to dismantle the group and restore peace. In the aftermath, Moby Dick, now an ally and protector, returns to the depths of the ocean. The crew of the Pequod, led by a redeemed Ahab and Ishmael, devote themselves to safeguarding a harmonious relationship between humans and marine life. The legend of Moby Dick resonates throughout the world as a powerful symbol of unity and understanding, as a new age of cooperation and co-existence begins in the balance of the terrestrial and aquatic realms. \\"Moby and the Apocalypse\\" is a tale of unlikely alliances, gigantic challenges, and the relentless quest for peace in the face of global turbulence. It blends classic literature with futuristic technology, exploring the complexity of human relationships, our connection to nature, and the unimaginable power within all species to unite against unimaginable threats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What's the last name of the person whose wife is running her first marathon? , can you please find it?   In the beginning of the film, a brief overview of the history of the marathon is shown, with footage of dramatic races involving Dorando Pietri, Abebe Bikila and Rod Dixon.  Notable marathoners such as Frank Shorter, Dick Beardsley, Alberto Salazar, Grete Waitz, Paula Radcliffe, Joan Benoit-Samuelson, and Kathrine Switzer provide commentary about the sport. The focus is then on the six featured runners and their training for the 2005 Chicago Marathon. American Deena Kastor and Kenyan Daniel Njenga are both elite runners, and are  determined to win the race.  Kastor was the bronze medalist at the 2004 Olympic Marathon, but has yet to win a marathon.  Njenga had finished second multiple times in previous Chicago Marathons.  Kastor is shown training and recovering from an injury in Mammoth Lakes, California, while Njenga's life as a sponsored runner in Tokyo is profiled. The rest of the runners featured live in Chicago. Ryan Bradley and Lori O'Connor are both married young professionals; Bradley is a veteran marathoner who hopes to earn a qualifying time for the Boston Marathon, and O'Connor is running her first marathon.  She finds it humorous when colleagues ask if she expects to win.  Jerry Meyers is a jovial 70-year-old who claims to run marathons for the T-shirt.

Can you guess? What is Mimi? A) A dog B) A bird C) A cat D) A tiger","output":"Based on the given information, it is possible to determine which animal Mimi is by assessing each choice and comparing it to the characteristics provided. A) A dog: While it is true that dogs can have black and white fur and occasionally enjoy sitting in the sun, the other characteristics mentioned do not align as well with what we would typically expect from a dog. Dogs generally do not climb trees, and the \\"miao, miao\\" vocalization is more consistent with another animal on this list. B) A bird: Birds can indeed have black and white feathers and sing, but the specific \\"miao, miao\\" vocalization and the fact that Mimi enjoys eating fish do not match with typical bird behavior. Moreover, the ability to climb trees is not a common trait among birds; they usually fly or perch in trees instead. C) A cat: Cats are known to have black and white fur and enjoy lying in the sun. Additionally, the vocalization \\"miao, miao\\" is a phonetic representation of the sounds cats typically make, which is often written as \\"meow\\" in English. Cats are also skilled climbers and are known to enjoy eating fish. Furthermore, Mimi's dislike of apples aligns with the fact that cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they primarily consume animal-based protein rather than plant-based foods. D) A tiger: Though a tiger might share some attributes with Mimi, such as a preference for fish and the ability to climb trees, other details suggest that Mimi is not a tiger. For instance, tigers do not have black and white fur patterns, nor do they vocalize with a \\"miao, miao\\" sound. Based on this analysis, the most likely answer is: C) A cat Mimi's black and white fur, love for sitting in the sun, favorite food being fish, dislike for apples, tree-climbing abilities, and recognizable \\"miao, miao\\" vocalization are all classic characteristics of a cat, making Option C the most fitting choice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices:  - office - building - house - desk - phone booth  The rationale to choose \\"house\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The \\"house\\" is the most appropriate and logical place to keep a personal telephone directory for several reasons, as opposed to the other options provided, such as the office, building, desk, or phone booth. 1. Accessibility: Storing your personal telephone directory in your house provides easy, quick access whenever you need to look up a contact or reference a phone number. This is particularly useful in case of emergencies or urgent calls when you need to get in touch with family members, friends, or essential services. 2. Privacy: Your personal telephone directory contains private information about your contacts, such as their full names, phone numbers, addresses, and potentially even birthdays or personal notes. Keeping this valuable information within your house offers a level of privacy and security that is not present in public or semi-public spaces such as an office or building. 3. Personalization: Your house is a space where you have the freedom to personalize and arrange items according to your preferences. This means that you can choose where to store your telephone directory within your home, whether it be in a specific drawer, on a shelf, or even next to your phone for maximum convenience. 4. Incongruence of other choices: The other options presented have distinct disadvantages:    a. Office: Typically, an office is reserved for work-related activities and materials. Mixing personal items, such as a personal telephone directory, with work resources can lead to confusion, misplacement, and potential privacy concerns.        b. Building: This choice is too vague and lacks specificity. A building could refer to various locations within a house, an office, or even a shared public space. Leaving a personal item like a telephone directory in such an indefinite location increases the risk of it being lost or accessed by unauthorized individuals.        c. Desk: While a desk might be an acceptable place for a work-related telephone directory, keeping a personal telephone directory could lead to unnecessary clutter and disorganization. Additionally, if the desk is located in an office or shared workspace, it may pose privacy concerns or create confusion.    d. Phone booth: With the widespread use of mobile phones and the decline of phone booths, this option is outdated and impractical. Furthermore, storing personal items in a public space like a phone booth presents significant risks related to privacy, theft, and loss.  In conclusion, the most appropriate and secure option for keeping a personal telephone directory is within a house. This location ensures easy access, promotes privacy and personalization, and avoids the inconveniences and concerns that come with the other options provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The music video for \\"Single Ladies\\" was shot immediately after that of \\"If I Were a Boy\\", but it received less attention during production than the \\"higher-gloss, higher-profile video\\" for \\"If I Were a Boy\\". Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\". \\"Single Ladies\\" was choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography. The two music videos premiered on MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé, and the platinum edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce. Beyoncé told Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly that the inspiration for the video was a 1969 Bob Fosse routine entitled \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" seen on The Ed Sullivan Show, which featured Fosse's wife, Gwen Verdon, dancing with two other women. \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" had become an Internet viral sensation the previous summer after Unk's \\"Walk It Out\\" was dubbed over the original mix. Beyoncé wanted to attempt a similar dance and eventually, the choreography of \\"Single Ladies\\" was liberally adapted from \\"Mexican Breakfast\\": I saw a video on YouTube. [The dancers] had a plain background and it was shot on the crane; it was 360 degrees, they could move around. And I said, 'This is genius.' We kept a lot of the Fosse choreography and added the down-south thing—it's called J-Setting, where one person does something and the next person follows. So it was a strange mixture ... It's like the most urban choreography, mixed with Fosse—very modern and very vintage.

This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules. If they left their space ship and did not use their electronics, they would not be able to hear each other. Next time you watch a science fiction movie, think about this factoid.

Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is about the same age and dreams of becoming the greatest rodeo cowboy alive. Both feel essentially alone in the world.While sharing a sheephand's backbreaking work load, facing the toil and troubles of the weather, shortages of food, and wild animal attacks, their working friendship eventually develops into something more. Breaking their employer's rule that one man must sleep with the sheep and one at the camp, one night after an evening of boozing and shooting the bull, they end up sharing the tent to avoid freezing.

Construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway began in 1845. The line was opened in October 1849, with  services from Manchester London Road via Sale to Altrincham. In 1931 it became one of Great Britain's first electrified railway lines, with a 1,500 V DC overhead line. At the same time a new Altrincham station was opened on the same line, at Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130 train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham. The line was renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system. Broadheath railway station served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm to Warrington.Altrincham Interchange is one of the Metrolink's termini. The interchange was refurbished (2015–16), and now includes a brand new footbridge, with 3 lifts to cope with increased passenger demands, a larger scale ticket office, and modern bus interchange. The new Interchange is a modern design building that looks fantastic and is helping to regenerate Altrincham city centre as the new building has helped to transform the surrounding area. The Interchange connects the town to several locations in Greater Manchester, such as Sale and Bury. The service also includes Navigation Road station. Metrolink services leave around every six minutes, between 07:15 and 19:30 on weekdays, and less frequently at other times. National Rail services link the Altrincham and Navigation Road stations with Chester via Northwich, and with Manchester via Stockport. Altrincham Interchange, next to the railway station, is a hub for local bus routes. Manchester Airport, the largest in the UK outside London, is 5 miles (8 km) to the southeast of the town, and is connected via the Manchester Picadilly – Crewe line.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The given review would decrease the chances of me buying the product. The reasons for this decision are as follows: 1. Lack of focus on the main topic: The reviewer expresses that the book, which is supposed to be about Bob Dylan, ends up focusing more on the religious aspects like \\"the sermon on the mount\\" rather than providing new information about the main subject. 2. Presence of bias: The review highlights that the book was written from a point of bias, which may lead to a skewed perspective on the topic. This might not provide a comprehensive or objective view of the subject matter of the book, and it can affect the overall experience of reading it. 3. Long and seemingly unnecessary quotes: The reviewer mentions that some reference Bible verses extend over a page, which may disrupt the flow of the text and contribute to a less engaging reading experience. It might also discourage readers who are interested in learning about Bob Dylan rather than delving into religious texts. 4. Publisher's influence: The fact that the book is published by a Christian publishing company (Relevant Books) could be a reason for the heavy religious content. This information could make potential readers doubtful whether they will get a balanced and well-researched account of Bob Dylan's life and work or if the religious angle might overshadow the main theme of the book. Taking these factors into consideration, the chances of buying the product would be decreased due to the concerns raised in the review about its content, focus, and potential bias.

(AAP) Two brothers have been arrested over the killing of two police officers in Mississippi. Police officers Benjamin Deen, 34, and Liquori Tate, 25, were shot on Saturday and taken to hospital where they were confirmed dead, The Clarion-Ledger newspaper reported, citing Forrest County Coroner Butch Benedict. Officials did not give details on the motive of the attack but said the suspects, Curtis Banks, 26, and Marvin Banks, 29, were arrested early on Sunday, ending an hours-long manhunt, according to the newspaper. Both men were reported to have criminal records, which include drugs and weapons-related charges and felony convictions. A third woman who was allegedly in the car at the time of the shooting in Hattiesburg city was also taken into police custody. The killings come in the wake of another police shooting in New York, where plainclothes officer Brian Moore, 25, was shot in the head and died last Monday. A total of five police officers have been killed in the past five months in the United States, including two other New York policemen who were shot in December. Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree decried the latest killings. \\"The men and women who go out every day to protect us, the men and women who go out every day to make sure that we're safe, they were turned on tonight,\\" DuPree said, according to The Clarion-Ledger. The newspaper said one of the officers pulled a car over Saturday night, approached the vehicle, and was joined by a second officer before shots were fired. One of the suspects allegedly fled in a police vehicle, which was later found abandoned. A neighbouring police force in Oxford, Mississippi mourned the slain officers. \\"Both Hattiesburg Police Officers have died. Terrible. Prayers to the entire community and families,\\" the Oxford force said on Twitter. The Clarion-Ledger said it was the first police killing in Hattiesburg in 30 years.

Write a summary based on this article: PORT-AU-PRINCE—Even as faint cries continue to be detected beneath the rubble, the emphasis of relief teams is already shifting away from the trapped to confront a much broader humanitarian challenge: Helping the hundreds of thousands struggling for food and shelter across the city.      View Full Image Reuters Victims reach for water Friday. Only 24 hours remain to save the trapped.      The consensus among quake experts is that time is short to save the trapped. Still, there were some isolated successes. Rescuers Friday saved a woman who sang \\"Jesus will save me\\" just before medics cut off her leg to free her.      But hundreds of thousands are homeless, tens of thousands are wounded, and nearly everyone lacks clean drinking water, raising the risk of a secondary wave of water-borne disease and death in coming days.      On Saturday, relief groups and officials were focused on moving the food, water and other aid flowing into Haiti in earnest out of the clogged airport and to hungry, haggard earthquake survivors in the capital.      In many neighborhoods, outside help hadn't yet arrived. At the corner of Rue St. Gerard and Route des Dalles, a law office has crumbled in ruin; on Friday a trapped woman could be heard moaning inside. The hillside across the street is a fresh, red-dirt grave for 32 victims.      Neighbors dig through rubble searching for earthquake survivors at Carrefour Feuilles University, Haiti. WSJ's David Belle reports.      U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was expected in Port-au-Prince on Saturday, to confer with President Rene Preval and U.S. and international civilian and military officials on how best to help the recovery effort and Haitian government.      Ms. Clinton on Friday cited a \`\`race against time'' before anxiety and anger create additional problems. Relief workers warned that unless supplies are quickly delivered, Port-au-Prince will degenerate into lawlessness.      Separately, Mr. Preval on Saturday implored the international community to better coordinate the massive aid effort and not to squabble over how to provide it.      A water delivery truck driver said he was attacked in one of the city's slums. There were reports of isolated looting as young men walked through downtown with machetes, and robbers reportedly shot one man whose body was left on the street.      On Friday, U.S. military crews got the capital's airport working, and cargo planes delivered rescue supplies. But progress remained slow. The aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, for instance, floated five miles offshore, unable to find a place to unload supplies because of extensive damage to Haiti's main port.      At the airport, a stream of flights arrived and departed without difficulty in the predawn hours for the first time since the quake. But members of the Air Force team, the 621st Contingency Response Wing, expressed frustration they hadn't been sent earlier to help the aid flow there, saying Thursday's flight freeze may have been avoided.      \\"We would have liked to have been there a little bit sooner to unclog the airfield,\\" said Col. Brian O'Connor, the wing's commander. \\"It makes me cringe, it's so disorderly.\\"      Haitians are getting increasingly desperate. There were scattered reports of looting and violence, reflecting the challenge of policing and governance amid such a broad crisis. Small, roving bands of young men with machetes raided several wrecked homes, the Associated Press reported.      Senior U.S. officials said Washington is beginning to map out a reconstruction plan. The State Department's point person on Haiti, Cheryl Mills, stressed that Washington isn't drafting plans for some kind of U.S. interim administrator.      The Red Cross estimates 45,000 to 50,000 people were killed in the earthquake. Other estimates are higher. Haiti's secretary of state for public safety, told Reuters that the death toll could hit 140,000.      Among the living on Friday were people like Junior Lerolien. Three days after losing his entire family, he walked the streets in search of water. The 22-year-old tried to get in to the United Nations compound near the city's airport, but was turned back by guards. Mr. Lerolien was outside his house in the Delmas district Tuesday when he felt the shock. \\"I saw the house collapse,\\" he said. His mother, father, three brothers and sister were inside. The rubble was so deep, he didn't even try to dig them out. \\"My whole family is buried,\\" Mr. Lerolien said.      Confusion on the Ground Click on the graphic to see information on the rescue efforts      Photos View Slideshow AFP/Getty Images See photos from the scene in Haiti.      United Nations disaster experts said at least 10% of housing in the Haitian capital was destroyed, leaving about 300,000 homeless. The U.N. launched an appeal to raise 550 million to help survivors.      Just a few kilometers from the intersection of Rue St. Gerard and Route del Dalles, the national soccer stadium has become a makeshift hospital. Several hundred people turned up looking for treatment.      \\"No gloves, nothing to sew wounds, no antiseptic,\\" said Wadner Lima, a volunteer Haitian paramedic. Mr. Lima tended to a boy with a head wound and a man whose leg was badly burned. His medical kit, a small red tackle box, had been depleted. \\"We just have some gauze left.\\"      Outside the stadium, refugees clamored to board buses out of the city. A dead body lay atop a mattress.Across Port-au-Prince, doctors and nurses provided medical attention in almost medieval conditions. Outside Haiti's national public-health laboratory, scores of wounded pleaded to get inside, where a squad of Belgian first-responders and Canadian military medics operated a field hospital.      People carried injured relatives on makeshift gurneys. On the sidewalk outside the gates, a teenage girl lay near an old woman on a table with a crumpled umbrella shielding a bleeding knee.      A young man, eyes wide with terror, was carried on a piece of plywood. His distended leg leaked pus. \\"Now it is emergency medicine, like war medicine—amputations, cleaning wounds, keeping people alive,\\" said Ronald Ackermans, a nurse and part of a team of 60 or so medics and search-and-rescue personnel who flew in from Brussels.      One of the problems is what to do with the dead. Back on Rue St. Gerard in the Carrefour Feuille neighborhood, people rubbed limes on their nostrils to stymie the smell of death.      The earthquake remade this neighborhood in a few, violent seconds. An art gallery is in ruins; so is a pharmacy. No one knows what became of the old lady who used to sell rice from a boiling pot on the corner.      Clare Lydie Parent, who is mayor of the hillside town of Petionville, stood amidst the rubble in an official orange vest on Friday, helping direct rescue efforts at what had been the law offices—the building with a survivor in it.      \\"I heard the voice this morning,\\" Ms. Parent said. \\"She gave me her name. She said, 'Mary.'\\"      Next door, at the small Universite Ste. Gerard, there were no orange vests, just young men scooping and tugging with their bare hands.      On Friday, residents heard voices and were convinced that several students remained alive in a basement classroom that had room for 60.      \\"They are calling to us, 'We're here, please help us,'\\" said Frederic Sergefils, who believed his brother was among those inside. At one point, one of the rescuers used a chair seat to dig into the wreckage. Just down the street, a wide-eyed Marie Yolene, 22, looked at the wreckage of a four-room house she shared with her three sisters, aged 21, 18 and 15.      The chairs and beds inside lay open to the street: The exterior walls had collapsed outward.      Three of the four were in the house when the quake hit.      The fourth, Marie, had been at the city's Sacred Heart Cathedral—which collapsed, killing many. Yet all four survived. \\"I was so lucky,\\" Marie said.      —Jose de Cordoba and Charles Forelle contributed to this report.      Write to Dionne Searcey at dionne.searcey@wsj.com ||||| PORT-AU-PRINCE |      PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Saturday declared one of the largest relief efforts in U.S. history to help Haiti's earthquake victims as survivors begged for aid still only trickling through to them and looters fought in the streets.      Four days after a massive quake killed up to 200,000 people and wrecked most of the capital Port-au-Prince, hundreds of thousands of Haitians were still desperately waiting for assistance as scavengers and looters preyed on shattered buildings in the widespread absence of authority and order.      Even as aid poured into Port-au-Prince airport on Saturday, thousands of Haitians streamed out on foot with suitcases on their heads or jammed in cars to find food, water and shelter in the countryside and flee aftershocks as well as violence.      Logistical logjams still kept major relief from reaching most victims, many of them sheltering in makeshift camps on streets strewn with debris and decomposing bodies.      On the city's shattered main commercial boulevard near the port, hundreds of scavengers and looters swarmed over the wrecks of shops, carrying off anything they could find and occasionally fighting among themselves for a prized item.      They carried stones, knives, ice-picks and hammers, as much to defend themselves as to break into wrecked premises and slash open boxes to grab T-shirts, bags, toys and other items.      Obama promised help as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton flew to Haiti where the shell-shocked government gave the United States control over its main airport to guide aid flights from around the world.      With the government saying up to 200,000 people may have been killed, the quake could be one of the ten deadliest in history.      \\"We're moving forward with one of the largest relief efforts in our history to save lives and deliver relief that averts an even larger catastrophe,\\" Obama said on Saturday, flanked by his predecessors George W. Bush and Bill Clinton who will lead a charity drive to help Haiti.      But on the streets of the city, where scarce police patrols fired occasional shots and tear gas to try to disperse looters, the distribution of aid appeared random, chaotic and minimal. Downtown, young men could be seen carrying pistols.      As international rescue crews combed rubble for survivors across the capital, there were jostling scrums for food and water as U.S. helicopters swooped down to throw out boxes of water bottles and rations. A reporter also saw foreign aid workers tossing packets of food to desperate Haitians.      DISORGANIZED DISTRIBUTION      \\"The distribution is totally disorganized. They are not identifying the people who need the water. The sick and the old have no chance,\\" said Estime Pierre Deny, standing at the back of a crowd looking for water with his empty plastic container.      Watching the looters downtown, student Ricardo Fume said: \\"People have nothing to eat, so they steal these things to sell. The United States had the World Trade Center (the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks), we had this, it is worse,\\" Fume said.      Haiti is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country and has for decades struggled with devastating storms, floods and political unrest. Around 9,000 U.N. peacekeepers have provided security here since a 2004 uprising ousted one president. |||||","output":"In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, relief efforts are shifting focus from rescuing trapped individuals to addressing the broader humanitarian issues affecting the city. With hundreds of thousands left homeless, clean drinking water scarce, and the risk of disease increasing, the challenge now becomes providing food, water, and shelter to these survivors. Although aid is flowing into the nation, the damaged infrastructure makes efficient distribution a challenge. The situation is further complicated by increasing desperation and potential lawlessness, as frustration and anger build among the survivors. This crisis highlights the challenges of providing assistance in the midst of widespread destruction and emphasizes the need for efficient coordination and rapid response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Air enters bronchial tubes - Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung - Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs - Alveoli is surrounded by many small blood vessels - Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels - Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body - Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale. Answer:","output":"The first step missing in this process is \\"inhaling air through the nostrils or mouth.\\"  To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the process, let's start with the missing first step and then proceed through the rest of the steps in detail: 1. Inhaling air through the nostrils or mouth: The process of respiration begins when an individual breathes in air through their nostrils or their mouth. The nostrils are lined with hair and mucus, acting as natural filters that capture dust, allergens, and pathogens, preventing them from entering the respiratory system. The air is also warmed and humidified as it passes through the nasal cavity. 2. Air travels down the trachea: After the air is inhaled through the nostrils or mouth, it travels down the trachea, also known as the windpipe. The trachea is a tube-like structure that is surrounded by cartilage rings that provide it with support and flexibility.  3. Air enters bronchial tubes: The trachea branches into two bronchial tubes, which transport the air into the lungs. Each bronchial tube is lined with cilia and mucus to help filter the air and prevent any harmful particles from entering the lungs. 4. Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung: Within the lungs, the bronchial tubes further branch into smaller structures called bronchioles, which divide and narrow progressively, forming an extensive network throughout the lung tissue. 5. Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs: At the end of the bronchioles, there are tiny air sacs called alveoli. The walls of the alveoli are very thin, and their primary function is to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. 6. Alveoli are surrounded by many small blood vessels (capillaries): The alveoli have a rich supply of blood, allowing for a thorough exchange of gases between the alveoli and the blood vessels. 7. Oxygen passes through the alveoli into blood vessels: As oxygen from the inhaled air enters the alveoli, it diffuses through the alveolar walls and into the surrounding capillaries. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide in the blood diffuses from the capillaries into the alveoli. 8. Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body: The oxygen-rich blood leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins and is pumped by the heart throughout the body. The blood delivers the oxygen to the body's cells and tissues, where it is used for cellular respiration and various metabolic processes. 9. Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs: After the oxygen has been utilized by the body's cells, waste, in the form of carbon dioxide, is produced. The blood then carries this carbon dioxide waste back to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries and into the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. 10. Carbon dioxide is released when you exhale: Finally, the carbon dioxide that has been transported back to the lungs is expelled from the body during exhalation. As the muscle diaphragm relaxes, it pushes air out of the lungs, allowing the carbon dioxide to exit through the nostrils or mouth. This entire process constitutes the respiratory cycle, which is essential for providing the body with the necessary oxygen and removing waste products in the form of carbon dioxide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In a recent State of the Union address focused on gun control, not only did we witness the president shedding tears, but the audience rose to its feet as well. The question that arises is, what brought about this transformation in the man who was known for keeping his emotions in check? According to the President's biographer, the emergence of this sensitivity is due to a newfound sense of freedom. It seems that after four years in office, Obama has grown more comfortable being himself and allowing his emotions to show. He says, \\"The one thing about being president is after four years, you get pretty humble.\\" This humility is evident in moments such as these, where he is open to displaying his raw emotions to the public. There is no denying that gun control has been a contentious issue in the United States, and Obama's strong appeal resonates with many Americans who are looking for a solution to this deeply troubling problem. The president's emotional plea for tighter regulations on firearms has undoubtedly struck a chord with the masses. In his State of the Union address, Obama cited the alarming number of gun-related deaths and tragedies that have occurred during his time in office. It is clear that his passion for this issue comes from a place of genuine concern and urgency, as he works towards finding an answer to this devastating epidemic. The tears streaming down his face during the speech showcased the depth of his compassion and commitment to making a real change. This new side to the president has been widely welcomed and appreciated, as it demonstrates his humanity and allows people to connect with him on a more personal level. The leader of a nation sets the tone for the people, and Obama's emotional transparency sends a strong signal that it is okay to be vulnerable and express feelings. In conclusion, Obama's emotional evolution is a testament to his growing experience and comfort as both a leader and a human being. His impassioned plea for gun control has captured the hearts and minds of many Americans, and we can only hope that this new openness in communication will translate to effective and lasting changes in the fight for tighter gun regulations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Florida The option that is most in line with common sense to answer the question is Florida. The question is referring to a location where a long coast is formed by a peninsula and panhandle, making it a popular vacation and retirement destination.  Florida fits this description perfectly as it is a state located on a peninsula in the southeastern United States. Its unique geography includes a long coastline that extends for approximately 1,350 miles (2,170 km) and boasts a panhandle to the northwest that borders the Gulf of Mexico. This extensive shoreline offers numerous recreational opportunities such as swimming, sunbathing, boating, and fishing, making Florida a favored choice for vacationers and retirees alike. The other options do not accurately address the specific characteristics mentioned in the question. While the United States (Option A) and California (Option E) have extensive coastlines, they do not feature a peninsula and panhandle as described. Option C, \\"country,\\" is too broad and unspecified, as many countries have coastal areas but may not have the desired characteristics mentioned in the question.

Given the question: Michael Morzeny put his hands into the pockets of his overcoat and hugged the fabric tighter around his body. The winter wind hurried down Columbus Avenue and the hem of his coat flapped around his knees letting little pockets of cold waft up to invade the warmth his body had spent so much time preparing and storing around his torso. With a bitter squeeze of his hands, his knuckles now getting cold, Morzeny bowed his square shoulders to the wind and continued walking. At sixty-seven years old the New York winters bothered Morzeny more than he cared to admit. And, although no doctor would admit it to him, he was positive that the first faint hints of arthritis tweaking through his hands were made worse by the cold. At every cross street the setting sun flashed through to the avenue in shades of crisp pink and red. Morzeny didn't want to be working right now. But these outings were the price he paid for having a hybrid job, owning buildings and brokering as many of his own leases as possible. When he had first come to the city he had been told that he needed a job, not for income, his providers took care of that, but for his own sanity. Something to keep him going. He had asked for something in real estate and had never bothered to wonder what other paths he might have taken. He had always been able to focus to the point of blindness. It helped him in every aspect of his work. He arrived at the brownstone building housing the apartment he was to show tonight. His building was tucked into a short row of buildings that squatted over the street, their steps reaching towards the curb like stunted growths. More to prove to himself that he could do it than anything else, Morzeny took the front steps two at a time. Question: What avenue was Morzeny walking down? Options:  A. Brownstone Avenue  B. not enough information  C. Broke Avenue  D. Columbus Avenue  === The correct answer is The answer is:","output":"D. Columbus Avenue To find the answer, I follow these steps: 1.

Question: If somebody wanted to start a garden they would put seeds in the ground, then watering them would be making grow what?  A. growth  B. harvesting  C. die  D. sad  E. plants  The best answer is Answer:","output":"E. plants When someone starts a garden, they typically begin by planting seeds in the ground. These seeds contain the necessary genetic information and stored energy for a new plant to grow. After planting the seeds, watering them is essential to provide the moisture needed for germination and growth. When the seeds are watered, they absorb the water, which allows them to swell and eventually sprout. The water also supports essential biological processes within the seed, such as the activation of specific enzymes and the breaking down of stored energy supplies. As the seed absorbs water, the developing embryo inside starts to grow and eventually bursts through the seed coat. This growth allows the seedling to develop roots, stems, and foliage, which are the foundational components of plants.  Given enough time, water, sunlight, and the right environmental conditions, the seeds will grow into plants that can produce flowers, fruit, or even new seeds to perpetuate the life cycle of the plant's species. Watering the seeds is a crucial step in the process, as it not only triggers germination but also supports the overall growth and health of the developing plants. In summary, the best answer to the question is option E, as watering seeds after planting them in the ground ultimately leads to the growth and development of plants. Without watering, the seeds would not be able to germinate and grow into mature, healthy plants, thus hindering the success of a garden."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Salt water is contained in a factory or plant - The water is boiled to a very high tempature - The salt becomes seperated from the water - The salt is removed - The water is able to be drank at this point.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose desalination is quicker happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"In order to comprehensively address the given perturbation hypothesis, it is crucial to first understand the desalination process. The steps provided are a simplified description of the process, and in practice, desalination plants employ a variety of techniques to remove salt and other impurities from seawater to make it potable. Two of the most common techniques are thermal desalination (e.g., multi-stage flash distillation and multi-effect distillation) and membrane desalination (e.g., reverse osmosis). Now, let us consider the hypothesis: if desalination happens more quickly, will more salt be removed from the water? To answer this question, it is essential to analyze the direct and indirect effects of such a perturbation on the desalination process. Direct effects: 1. Efficiency: If the desalination process is accelerated, the efficiency of salt removal might be affected. In the case of thermal desalination, the rate at which the water is heated and evaporated will be increased. However, if the process is too rapid, there may not be enough time for the salt to separate from the water, resulting in reduced salt removal efficiency. 2. Equipment stability: Desalination equipment is designed to operate within specific parameters for optimal performance. A rapid increase in the desalination rate may put undue stress on the equipment, leading to potential malfunctions and decreased effectiveness of the salt removal process. Indirect effects: 1. Energy consumption: A quicker desalination rate could lead to higher energy consumption. In thermal desalination, the energy required to heat and evaporate water quickly would be greater than in the standard process. Similarly, in membrane desalination, the increased pressure required to force water through the membrane more quickly would consume more power. This could result in higher operational costs and greater environmental impacts. 2. Water quality: The water resulting from a rapid desalination process may be of lower quality due to reduced salt removal efficiency. The water could still contain significant concentrations of various salts and impurities, making it unsuitable for potable use without further treatment. Such an effect may lead to the need for additional post-treatment processes, increasing the overall cost and complexity of the desalination process. 3. Environmental impact: A faster desalination process could exacerbate existing environmental issues associated with desalination, such as brine disposal and greenhouse gas emissions. The increased rate of salt removal may lead to a higher volume of brine generated, which if not handled properly, can have negative environmental impacts on marine ecosystems and groundwater. Additionally, the higher energy consumption related to quicker desalination rates could contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. In conclusion, while a quicker desalination process may appear to be beneficial in terms of providing potable water more rapidly, it may in fact have various direct and indirect adverse effects on the process itself, water quality, and the environment. Consequently, the supposed perturbation could negatively affect the overall efficiency and practicality of the desalination process. Instead, it is crucial to focus on optimizing existing processes and developing new technologies that can remove salt and impurities from water effectively while minimizing negative impacts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the process is:  1. An organism dies and its remains are quickly buried by sediment (such as mud, sand, or silt) in a specific environment (e.g., a riverbed, lake, ocean floor, or terrestrial ecosystem). This rapid burial helps to protect the remains from scavengers and decomposition, preserving the original structure.  Here's a detailed outline of the entire process with the missing step included: 1. An organism dies and its remains are quickly buried by sediment. 2. Over time, sediment builds up over the remains, providing additional protection from the elements and scavengers. 3. As the remains decompose, only trace amounts of the original organic material are left behind, while the majority of the hard parts (such as bones, teeth, and shells) remain. 4. Over thousands to millions of years, the remaining organic parts are gradually replaced with minerals from the surrounding sediments and groundwater. This process, known as permineralization or petrification, involves the precipitation of minerals into the pores of the original structures, effectively turning them into stone. 5. Eventually, a fossil is formed, representing the preserved remains or impressions of the original organism.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Mr Comey told a Senate committee they were wrong to denigrate the agency and its leadership. He was also \\"confused\\" by the \\"shifting explanations\\" for his sacking, which came as he led a probe into any links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. President Donald Trump later said he never sought to impede the inquiry. Mr Trump's attorney, Marc Kasowitz, said in a statement Mr Comey's testimony \\"finally confirmed publicly\\" that the president was not under investigation as part of any probe in Russian political meddling. In the statement, Mr Trump also denied asking Mr Comey for his loyalty or to drop an investigation into fired national security adviser Michael Flynn during private meetings. In his testimony, Mr Comey said Mr Trump had repeatedly told him he was doing a \\"great\\" job. He also suggested he was fired to \\"change the way the Russia investigation was being conducted\\". The former FBI boss remained largely composed throughout almost three hours of testimony but became impassioned when delivering his opening remarks. He told the panel that the White House \\"chose to defame me, and more importantly the FBI\\" by claiming the agency was \\"poorly led\\". \\"Those were lies, plain and simple. And I'm so sorry that the FBI workforce had to hear them,\\" he continued. \\"The FBI is honest. The FBI is strong. And the FBI is and always will be independent,\\" he said in his opening remarks. Mr Comey was leading one of several Russia investigations before Mr Trump fired him. US intelligence agencies believe Russia interfered in the US election and they are investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But there is no known evidence of collusion and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as \\"fake news\\". His spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Thursday hit back at Mr Comey, saying: \\"I can definitively say the president is not a liar.\\" For Donald Trump the good news from James Comey's testimony is that the former FBI director clearly said the president was not directly under FBI investigation at the time he was fired. The bad news was, well, everything else. On multiple occasions, Mr Comey said he was either concerned or knew that the president or his administration was lying \\"plain and simple\\" - about the circumstances of his dismissal and about the nature of his meetings with the president. It's clear the president woefully mishandled this, for which he has paid a high price ever since. By unceremoniously sacking him, and offering a muddle of explanations for it, he created an adversary with both the means and the motivation to respond in the most damaging way. Mr Comey had a friend leak disturbing information about the president's actions to the media. He was given the biggest spotlight in a generation to publicly air further details. He stood before a Senate committee not just to defend himself, but also the honour of the FBI. The White House may claim today's testimony is a technical exoneration. Politically, however, it's a staggering blow. And when it comes to the presidency, politics is everything. During Thursday's testimony, Mr Comey emphasised that Russia's political meddling was \\"not a close call\\", adding: \\"There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever.\\" When asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee whether the president tried to stop the Russia investigation, Mr Comey said: \\"Not to my understanding, no.\\" He said he it was not for him to say whether Mr Trump's actions were an obstruction of justice. Democratic Senator Mark Warner, the committee's vice chairman, pressed Mr Comey on why he decided to keep a record of his conversations with Mr Trump. \\"I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting\\" he said. Mr Comey, who published his prepared remarks a day before the hearing, detailed one meeting with Mr Trump in which the president asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and White House aide Jared Kushner to leave the Oval Office. \\"I knew something was about to happen that I needed to pay very close attention to,\\" he said. \\"I remember thinking that that was a very disturbing development.\\" During another meeting with Mr Trump, Mr Comey said the president appealed to him to \\"let go\\" an investigation into fired national security adviser Michael Flynn and his ties to the Kremlin. After US media reported the conversation, the president warned Mr Comey in a tweet, saying he \\"better hope there are no 'tapes' of our conversations\\". Mr Comey told the committee he hoped there were tapes, calling on Mr Trump to release them. \\"The president surely knows whether he taped me, and if he did my feelings aren't hurt. Release all the tapes, I'm good with it,\\" he said. The White House has refused to say whether any such tapes exist. After Mr Trump's tweet about potential tapes, Mr Comey said he realised it was important to release his own account of the story. He revealed that he asked a \\"good friend of mine\\" who is a professor at Columbia Law School to share contents of the memo with a reporter, in order to build pressure for a special counsel. As a result of this episode, former FBI chief Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel to lead an independent investigation into the Trump campaign's potential ties to the Kremlin. Mr Comey said he was \\"sure\\" Mr Mueller was also looking at whether Mr Trump obstructed justice. Mr Trump attacked Mr Comey for leaking the documents, saying it showed that members of the US government are \\"actively attempting to undermine this administration\\". \\"He's new in government, and so therefore I think he's learning as he goes,\\" said Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. \\"I'm not saying it's an acceptable excuse. It's just my observation.\\" \\"If you want to convict the president of being inappropriate, putting Comey in a bad spot, being rude, crude and a bull in a china shop, you would win,\\" Senator Lindsey Graham told the BBC. \\"The American people elected a bull in a china shop to help them with their lives, not this.\\" Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said \\"it's hard to overstate the impact of Jim Comey's testimony today\\" and that \\"it seems like the walls are closing in\\". This article was about:","output":"In simple words, Mr. Comey is a man who used to work for the FBI, which is an important group of people who help keep the country safe.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession -- one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom .","output":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession -- one that typifies the delirium of post, pre, and extant stardom\\" can be perceived as moderately negative. To determine this, we must consider several factors: the choice of words, context, and overall expression of the sentence. Firstly, the sentence emphasizes a 'surface-obsession' that implies a focus on superficial and shallow aspects of the lifestyle it describes, rather than appreciating or delving into the deeper aspects. This negative connotation projects the idea that people are more interested in outward appearances, and thus could be judged or criticized for their lack of substance. Secondly, the word 'delirium' has a negative connotation, as it suggests confusion, disorientation, or even madness. In this context, it is used to describe the state of mind of those experiencing stardom, whether it is in the past, present, or future. This implies that stardom brings chaos and a lack of clarity, reinforcing the negative sentiment of the sentence. Moreover, the term 'deliberative account' suggests that the sentence aims to offer a critical examination or analysis of the described lifestyle. This further strengthens the negative implications, as it implies that the topic itself warrants a close evaluation and dissection due to its controversial or negative nature. However, it should be noted that the negative sentiment is not extremely harsh or severe; instead, it appears to gently criticize the superficiality and the chaotic nature that surrounds stardom. It is possible that the sentence aims to provoke thought and reflection in the reader's mind, encouraging them to critically analyze such a lifestyle and its implications. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence is moderately negative, as it emphasizes the shallow-focused lifestyle and associated delirium of stardom, prompting a critical reflection on the subject. The sentence uses negative keywords and expressions to portray this message, resulting in an overall negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

We'll start by isolating the term that contains g, which is 270g. To do this, we'll eliminate the constant term -119698 by adding its opposite to both sides of the equation: 270g - 119698 + 119698 = -116188 + 119698 This simplifies to: 270g = 3510 Step 2: Solve for g by dividing both sides by 270. Now that we have isolated the term with g, we will divide both sides of the equation by 270 to solve for g: 270g / 270 = 3510 / 270 This simplifies to: g = 13 So the solution to the equation is g = 13."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: With the possible exception of equal rights, perhaps the most heated argument across the United States today is the death penalty  . Many argue that it is an effective deterrent   to murder , while others think there is no enough proof that the death penalty reduces the number of murders. The argument advanced by those who are against the death penalty is that it is cruel and inhuman punishment, that it is a mark of a bad society and finally that it is of questionable effectiveness as a deterrent   to crime   anyway. In our opinion, the death penalty is a necessary action. Throughout recorded history there have always been those peculiar persons in every society who made terrible crimes such as murder. But some are more dangerous than others. For example, it is one thing to take the life of another in time of blind anger, but quite another to coldly plan and carry out the murder of one or more people in the style of a butcher. Thus, murder, like all other crimes, is a matter of different degree. While it could be argued with some reason that the criminal in the first instance should be merely kept from society, such should not be the fate of the latter type murderer. The value of the death penalty as a deterrent to crime may be open to discussion. But the majority of people believe that the death penalty protects them. Their belief is proved by the fact that the death penalty prevents murder. For example, from 1954 to 1963, when the death penalty was carried out from time to time in California, the murder rate remained between three and four murders for each 100, 000 population. Since 1964 the death penalty has been done only once, and the murder rate has risen to10.4 murders for each 100, 000 population. The sharp climb in the state's murder rate, which began when killings stopped, does not happen by chance. It certainly shows that the death penalty does stop many murderers. If the law about death penalty is vetoed  , some people will be murdered----some whose lives may have been saved if the death penalty... It can be inferred that the writer thinks that   _  . A) the death penalty is the most important problem in the United States today B) the second type of murderers (in Paragraph 2) should be sentenced to death C) the veto of the law about death penalty is of little importance D) the value of the death penalty as a deterrent to crime is not to be discussed A:","output":"The writer thinks that B) the second type of murderers (in Paragraph 2) should be sentenced to death.  In their opinion, the death penalty is a necessary action for specific types of murderers, particularly those who coldly plan and carry out the murder of one or more people. The writer acknowledges that the death penalty's effectiveness as a deterrent to crime is open for discussion, but strongly believes that it does protect society and cites the rise in California's murder rate when executions stopped as evidence of its deterrent effect. Therefore, the writer advocates for the death penalty for certain types of murderers, implying that they support the idea that the second type of murderers should be sentenced to death."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

LaMacchia 871 F.Supp. 535 (1994) was a case decided by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts which ruled that, under the copyright and cybercrime laws effective at the time, committing copyright infringement for non-commercial motives could not be prosecuted under criminal copyright law. The ruling gave rise to what became known as the \\"LaMacchia Loophole,\\" wherein criminal charges of fraud or copyright infringement would be dismissed under current legal standards, so long as there was no profit motive involved. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): When was United States v. LaMacchia not contested?","output":"To answer the question relating to the specific date when the United States v. LaMacchia case was not contested, we will follow these steps: 1. Identify the critical time frame relevant to the case. 2. Investigate any records of case proceedings and decisions. 3. Determine if there is a specific date when it was not contested, or if the information is not available. Step 1: Identifying the relevant time frame United States v. LaMacchia was a case decided by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in 1994, so we can determine that the relevant time frame for the case is somewhere within or before that year. Step 2: Investigating records of case proceedings and decisions As we dig deeper into case proceedings, we find that the court ruled that committing copyright infringement for non-commercial motives could not be prosecuted under criminal copyright law at the time. Step 3: Determining whether there is a specific date when it was not contested Unfortunately, a specific date when the United States v. LaMacchia was not contested is not readily available in the information provided or any public records. Thus, we cannot provide a precise answer to this question. In conclusion, the question is unanswerable as there is no specific date available for when the United States v.

Would a linguist find the following sentence to be a valid English sentence grammatically? In the woods lives an old woman.","output":"A linguist would indeed find the sentence \\"In the woods lives an old woman\\" to be a valid English sentence grammatically. Though the sentence structure may appear uncommon or even strange to some English speakers, it is still grammatically correct and conforms to the rules of English syntax. This particular sentence utilizes an inverted sentence structure, an intentional alteration of the standard subject-verb-object order often employed for stylistic purposes or to create emphasis. To better understand this sentence, let's analyze its grammatical components: 1. Subject: The subject of this sentence is \\"an old woman.\\" It represents the person or thing performing the action. 2. Verb: The verb in this sentence is \\"lives,\\" which denotes the action that the subject is performing or the state that the subject is in. 3. Prepositional phrase: \\"In the woods\\" is a prepositional phrase functioning as an adverb modifying the verb \\"lives.\\" It provides information about where the action of living is taking place. In English, the standard sentence structure follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) order, and in this case, the sentence would read, \\"An old woman lives in the woods.\\" This is a simple and straightforward sentence; however, the original sentence, \\"In the woods lives an old woman,\\" employs an inversion of this typical word order. Inverted sentences typically follow the pattern of adverbial (or adverbial phrase) + verb + subject. These inversions are utilized to emphasize a specific element in the sentence, create a rhythmic effect, or establish a more poetic tone. In the provided example, inverting the sentence order emphasizes the setting (\\"In the woods\\") and evokes a mysterious or mystical atmosphere surrounding the old woman's existence. From a linguistic standpoint, the sentence \\"In the woods lives an old woman\\" is grammatically valid and conforms to the rules of English syntax. Although it deviates from the conventional subject-verb-object order, the sentence demonstrates a deliberate and acceptable inversion of sentence structure for stylistic purposes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Getty      Spending days ringside to other people’s parents bickering and arguing and general dysfunction takes a soul strong of stomach and long on patience, which is why only a hardy few to be a family court judge. But it doesn’t mean they’re not funny. Either that, or one Canadian justice found an unusual way to vent. Sick of the shenanigans of a couple from, ironically, the honeymoon capital of Niagara, he ruled that the wife should have full custody of their 13-year-old daughter but that the father should only pay 1 (and that’s a Canadian dollar) a month in child support. But it was the way he ruled that has everyone talking.      Ontario Superior Court Judge Joseph Quinn’s 31-page December decision—which made the local papers and is still doing the rounds of legal circles on the internet—is filled with the kind of black humor and derision one would imagine is usually kept for close be-robed colleagues only. He chided the couple for “marinating in a mutual hatred so intense as to surely amount to a personality disorder,” and said the chances of amicable resolution were “laughable.” The wife had poisoned their daughter “irreparably” against the father who, the judge admitted, had “a near-empty parenting tool box.” (More on TIME.com: 5 New Reasons to Get or Stay Married This Year)      Quinn mocked the couple’s habit of sending abusive, vulgarity-laced texts to each other and their inability to be civil at their children’s sporting events. On one occasion apparently, Catherine, the wife, had tried to run Larry over with her car — “always a telltale sign that a husband and wife are drifting apart,” the judge noted.      Catherine’s relatives, several of whom are Hell’s Angels, made death threats against her ex , which the judge mentioned, adding that “on Oct. 18, 2007, a nautical theme was added. According to Larry, ‘Catherine’s sister-in-law yelled out her window that I was going to be floating in the canal dead.’ ” That Catherine told her children they’d go to jail if they even called their dad did not help matters.      Larry, meanwhile, was given to flipping the bird every time he drove past his ex-wife’s house, leading the justice to observe that “a finger is worth a thousand words and therefore, is particularly useful should one have a vocabulary of less than a thousand words.” (More on TIME.com: Why Married Men Are Less Antisocial)      Quinn knew his tone was harsh but defended it saying since the parties were “immune to reason” he had used ridicule as a last resort. Is there a standup circuit for the legal set?      More on TIME.com:      Healthland’s Guide to Life 2011      5 Little-Known Truths About American Sex Lives      Can an iPhone App Save Your Marriage? ||||| Faced with warring ex-spouses besieging one another with threats and verbal abuse and dragging their children into it too, Ontario Superior Judge Joseph Quinn resorted to the only tool he had left - a highly unusual verbal roasting.      \\"Paging Dr. Freud, paging Dr. Freud,\\" Judge Quinn began a recent judgment that has gone viral in the family-law community. \\"Here, a husband and wife have been marinating in a mutual hatred so intense as to surely amount to a personality disorder requiring treatment. The source of difficulties is hatred: a hardened, harmful, high-octane hatred.\\"      Judge Quinn's 31-page decision boils over with the frustrations of a family-law judge who is called upon time and again to referee bouts between couples who were once in love. He even takes a shot at family law itself, saying that spousal support is \\"the roulette of family law - blindfolds, darts and Ouija boards being optional.\\"      And he anticipates criticism of his tone: \\"The parties repeatedly have shown they are immune to reason. Consequently, in my decision, I have tried ridicule as a last resort.\\"      In a novel twist, Judge Quinn granted the wife, Catherine, sole custody of the feuding couple's 13-year-old daughter. However, he ordered Larry to pay Catherine just a dollar a month in spousal support.      Judge Quinn expressed disgust with the way Catherine has induced her daughter to detest her father. \\"The harm is irreparable,\\" he said. \\"Generally, it is unwise to place an immature 13-year-old in charge of her life. Here, however, Catherine and [her current partner]have engineered an alienation that is so complete as to leave the court with no feasible option.\\"      Toronto lawyer Phil Epstein, an expert in family law, describes Judge Quinn as a respected jurist who was justified in ridiculing the couple. \\"I'm sure there will be some who criticize Justice Quinn for this,\\" he said. \\"But others will say that sometimes you have to step back and laugh at the foibles of mankind.\\"      Family law judges spent their time dealing with inflamed litigants whose stories are \\"highly conflicting and replete with inappropriate behaviour and misconduct,\\" Mr. Epstein said. \\"They use the courtroom as a forum for all the wrongs that have been done to them in their marriage. It is not surprising that some judges try to find a better way to help resolve their problems.\\"      Alternating caustic gibes with amusing observations, Judge Quinn portrayed Catherine - a 36-year-old school caretaker - and Larry, a labourer, as vile, foul-mouthed creatures who had burned through an enormous amount of police and court time waging their futile blitzkrieg.      He said that they cannot attend their son's ball hockey games without erupting into loud conflict, and that Catherine once tried to run over Larry with a van. \\"This is always a telltale sign that a husband and wife are drifting apart,\\" Judge Quinn remarked dryly.      On three occasions, a niece of Catherine's who is engaged to a Hells Angels biker called Larry to warn him that he would be shot dead, Judge Quinn said. \\"On Oct. 18, 2007, a nautical theme was added,\\" he remarked. \\"According to Larry, 'Catherine's sister-in-law yelled out her window that I was going to be floating in the canal dead.'\\"      Judge Quinn said that Larry, 38, possesses \\"a near-empty parenting tool box,\\" and was fond of venting his anger by sending Catherine insulting text messages and giving her 'the finger' as he drove by her home. \\"A finger is worth a thousand words and therefore, is particularly useful should one have a vocabulary of less than a thousand words,\\" Judge Quinn added.      Catherine gave her children \\"advanced animosity-tutoring,\\" and repeatedly denied Larry access to them, Judge Quinn said. He said that on one occasion, Larry and his daughter were thrown out of a McDonald's restaurant because she was yelling that he was 'a deadbeat.'      \\"This is language she would have learned from Catherine,\\" Judge Quinn noted. \\"They are the result of persistent, behind-the-scenes brainwashing by Catherine.\\"      He said that Catherine also warned the children several times that if they attempted to telephone their father, they would go to jail. She also once text messaged her daughter while she was on an access visit with Larry to ask: \\"Is dickhead there?\\"      Judge Quinn said that he foolishly called a four-month hiatus during the trial in the hope that Larry and Catherine could benefit from mediation. \\"It is touching how a trial judge can retain his naivety even after 15 years on the bench,\\" he said.

Answer:","output":"To determine what Ash might want to do next, let's examine this situation step-by-step: 1. Ash gives Jordan a nice ring. 2. Jordan is taken aback by the gesture. Based on these details, we can infer that Ash was offering a meaningful gift to Jordan, likely as a show of affection or friendship.  Comparing the given options: a. hug Cameron - This could be a random option, as it doesn't involve any interaction with Jordan and introduces a third person, Cameron, who wasn't mentioned before. b. run away - This suggests that Ash might be embarrassed or afraid of Jordan's reaction, but it doesn't seem to be a faithful continuation of Ash's intentions, which were to give a nice ring to Jordan. c. walk away - This might be considered because it would give Jordan some time to process the gesture and Ash might want to give them space. However, given that Ash has made a heartfelt gesture, they might want to see Jordan's reaction or engage in further conversation. From these options, none seem like a perfect fit given the context we have.

Its origins in Tibet can be traced to early 12th century master Yumo Mikyo Dorje, but became much wider known with the help of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, a monk originally trained in the Sakya school. The Jonang school was widely thought to have become extinct in the late 17th century at the hands of the 5th Dalai Lama, who forcibly annexed the Jonang monasteries to his Gelug school, declaring them heretical.  - The Nyingma tradition is the oldest of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism (the other three being the Kagyu, Sakya and Gelug). \\"Nyingma\\" literally means \\"ancient,\\" and is often referred to as Ngangyur (, \\"school of the ancient translations\\" or \\"old school\\") because it is founded on the first translations of Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit into Old Tibetan in the eighth century. The Tibetan alphabet and grammar was actually created for this endeavour.  - The Kagyu, Kagyü, or Kagyud school, also known as the \\"\\"Oral Lineage\\"\\" or \\"Whispered Transmission\\" school, is today regarded as one of six main schools (\\"chos lugs\\") of Himalayan or Tibetan Buddhism, the other five being the Nyingma, Sakya, Jonang, Gelug and Bon. Along with the Sakya and Gelug schools, the Kagyu tradition is classified as one of the Sarma or \\"New Transmission\\" schools of Vajrayna founded during the second diffusion of Buddhism into Tibet (diffusing the so-called \\"New Tantras\\"). It is a Red Hat sect along with the Nyingma and Sakya.  - Classical Tibetan refers to the language of any text written in Tibetic after the Old Tibetan period; though it extends from the 7th century until the modern day, it particularly refers to the language of early canonical texts translated from other languages, especially Sanskrit. The phonology implied by Classical Tibetan orthography is basically identical to the phonology of Old Tibetan, but the grammar varies greatly depending on period and geographic origin of the author. Such variation is an under-researched topic.  - Bon or Bön is a Tibetan religion, which self-identifies as being distinct from Tibetan Buddhism, although it shares the same overall teachings and terminology. It arose in the eleventh century and established its scriptures mainly from termas and visions by tertöns such as Loden Nyingpo. Though Bon terma contain myths of Bon existing before the introduction of Buddhism in Tibet, \\"in truth the 'old religion' was a new religion.\\"  - The Samye Monastery or Samye Gompa (Chinese:) is the first Buddhist monastery built in Tibet. It was probably first constructed between 775-9 CE under the patronage of King Trisong Detsen of Tibet who sought to revitalize Buddhism, which had declined since its introduction by King Songtsän Gampo in the 7th century. The monastery is in Dranang, Lhoka Prefecture. It was supposedly modeled on the design of Odantapuri in what is now Bihar, India.  - Tibetan Buddhism is the body of Buddhist doctrine and institutions characteristic of Tibet, the regions surrounding the Himalayas and much of Central Asia. It derives from the latest stages of Indian Buddhism and preserves \\"the Tantric status quo of eighth-century India.\\" Tibetan Buddhism aspires to Buddhahood or rainbow body.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - In Mahayana Buddhism, bodhisattva is the Sanskrit term for anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has generated bodhicitta, which is a spontaneous wish to attain buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings. Bodhisattvas are a popular subject in Buddhist art.  - Daklha Gampo ( Dwags lha sgam po ) is a Kagyu monastery founded in 1121 CE by Je Gampopa ( 1079 - 1153 ) , the disciple of the famous and much - loved bodhisattva , Jetsun Milarepa ( c. 1052 -- c. 1135 ) It is located in Gyatsa County in the old district of Dakpo in southern Tibet on land sanctified as a geomantic power - place ( ' head of the ogress ' ) by the first Tibetan emperor , Songtsen Gampo ( 605 or 617 ? - 649 ) , and made a repository of terma by Padmasambhava .  - In Buddhism, bodhicitta (\\"putixin\\" \\"bodaishin\\" Wylie transliteration: \\"byang chub kyi sems\\" Vietnamese: B- tâm), \\"enlightenment-mind\\", is the mind that strives toward awakening, empathy and compassion for the benefit of all sentient beings.  - Songtsen Gampo (569649?/605649?) was the founder of the Tibetan Empire, and is traditionally credited with the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet, influenced by his Nepali and Chinese queens, as well as being the unifier of what were previously several Tibetan kingdoms. He is also regarded as responsible for the creation of Tibetan alphabet and therefore the establishment of Classical Tibetan, the language spoken in his region at the time, as the literary language of Tibet.  - Sanskrit (English pronunciation:; written in Devanagari script ; : or ', originally ', \\"refined speech\\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism and \\"Mahyna\\" Buddhism, a philosophical language in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It was also a literary language that was in use as a \\"lingua franca\\" in ancient and medieval South Asia. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies.  - The Tibetan alphabet is an abugida used to write the Tibetic languages such as Tibetan, as well as Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Ladakhi, and sometimes Balti. The printed form of the alphabet is called uchen script while the hand-written cursive form used in everyday writing is called umê script.  - The Sakya (\\"pale earth\\") school is one of four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism, the others being the Nyingma, Kagyu, and Gelug. It is one of the Red Hat sects along with the Nyingma and Kagyu.  - The Gelug, Gelug-pa, dGe Lugs Pa, dge-lugs-pa or Dgelugspa is the newest of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism. It was founded by Je Tsongkhapa (13571419), a philosopher and Tibetan religious leader. The first monastery he established was named Ganden, and to this day the Ganden Tripa is the nominal head of the school, though its most influential figure is the Dalai Lama. Allying themselves with the Mongols as a powerful patron, the Gelug emerged as the pre-eminent Buddhist school in Tibet since the end of the 16th century.  - In Tibetan Buddhism, the Red Hat sect or Red Hat sects, named for the colour of the monks' hats at formal occasions, includes the three oldest of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism, namely:  - Buddhism (or ) is a religion and dharma that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to the Buddha. Buddhism originated in India sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, from where it spread through much of Asia, whereafter it declined in India during the middle ages. Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravada (Pali: \\"The School of the Elders\\") and Mahayana (Sanskrit: \\"The Great Vehicle\\"). Buddhism is the world's fourth-largest religion, with over 500 million followers or 7% of the global population, known as Buddhists.  - Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked central Himalayan country in South Asia. It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language.   - Trisong Detsän or Trisong Detsen was the son of Me Agtsom and one of the emperors of Tibet. He ruled from 755 until 797 or 804 CE. Trisong Detsen was the second of the Three Dharma Kings of Tibet, playing a pivotal role in the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet and the establishment of the Nyingma or \\"Ancient\\" school of Tibetan Buddhism.  - In Buddhism, buddhahood (, or ) is the condition or rank of a buddha (or , , Pali/Sanskrit for \\"awakened one\\").  - Tibet (Tibetan Pinyin: \\"boe\\", ; /i ts¹/) is a region on the Tibetan Plateau in Asia. It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa, Qiang, and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people. Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of . The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level.  - Buddhist art is the artistic practices that are influenced by Buddhism. It includes art media which depict Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; mandalas and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as vajras, bells, stupas and Buddhist temple architecture. Buddhist art originated on the Indian subcontinent following the historical life of Siddhartha Gautama, 6th to 5th century BC, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.  - Padmasambhava (lit. \\"Lotus-Born\\"), also known as Guru Rinpoche, was an 8th-century Indian Buddhist master. Although there was a historical Padmasambhava, nothing is known of him apart from helping the construction of the first Buddhist monastery in Tibet at Samye, at the behest of Trisong Detsen, and shortly thereafter leaving Tibet due to court intrigues.

Imagine you are standing in a farm field in central Illinois. The land is so flat you can see for miles and miles. On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away. You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here. If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes. In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills. Why do you think this is? What could have caused these features? There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material. The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Where did glaciers go? Where can you see them today? Glaciers are masses of flowing ice.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Your observation about the difference in the landscape between central and southern Illinois is intriguing. There are several factors that have contributed to these differences, one of which, as you mentioned, is the impact of glaciers from around 12,000 years ago. The Laurentide Ice Sheet, a massive ice sheet that covered much of the Midwest during the last Ice Age, played a significant role in shaping the landscape of the region. As the ice sheet advanced, it scraped and eroded the underlying bedrock, depositing tons of sediment as it moved. When the ice sheet eventually retreated, it left behind a flattened landscape, which is characteristic of central Illinois. The retreating ice also deposited large amounts of soil, rock, and debris as it melted, further contributing to the flat topography of this area. In contrast, southern Illinois was not as heavily impacted by the glacier's advance and retreat. The terrain in southern Illinois is part of the Ozark Plateau and the Shawnee Hills, which had experienced a more complex geological past. The rolling hills you observe in this region are a result of millions of years of erosion and sediment deposition. Uplifting and folding of the earth's crust have also contributed to the formation of these geological structures. In addition to these geological factors, the difference in elevation between central and southern Illinois has a direct influence on the capacity to support vegetation. You might observe that the central Illinois area primarily supports grasses and crops, while southern Illinois contains thicker, more diverse woodlands. This is due to differences in soil composition and moisture availability that result from variations in elevation and topography. As for the glaciers of today, they can still be found in various parts of the world, primarily in colder and higher-altitude regions. Some prominent examples include the glaciers in Greenland, Antarctica, Alaska, the Canadian Arctic, the Himalayas, and the Andes. Most of these glaciers are remnants of past ice ages, while others have formed more recently due to fluctuations in climate. These glaciers serve as important indicators of climate change, as their levels of growth or retreat can offer valuable insights into global temperature trends. I hope this helps you better understand the contrasting landscapes of Illinois and the role of glaciers in shaping our world.

So, the correct answer is A: more. Here's a step-by-step analysis of how more coal pits would affect the given process: 1. More coal pits opened: This would lead to an increased coal supply. 2. Coal is put in a coal-fired steam station: With more coal available, more coal can be fed into the steam station, potentially increasing the power generation capacity. 3. Water is put in pipes: Water quantity remains the same, as the availability of more coal does not affect water resources directly. 4. Coal is crushed: More coal would have to be crushed due to the increased coal supply. 5. Coal is moved into a boiler along with hot air: More coal would be fed into the boiler, raising the combustion rate and potentially generating more heat. 6. The water is moving through pipes in the boiler: Water continues to move through pipes, turning into steam as it heats up. With more heat from the increased coal combustion, water might turn into steam faster. 7. The steam from the water is blown against a turning mechanism: The mechanism (usually a turbine) could potentially turn faster or more efficiently due to increased steam production. 8. The force of the steam makes the mechanism turn: The increased steam might produce more force, causing the mechanism to turn at a higher rate. 9. The mechanism generates electricity: With the mechanism turning at a higher rate, more electricity could be generated. In conclusion, opening more coal pits would result in more coal being available for the coal-fired steam station, potentially increasing the electricity generated from the process.

Problem:Hundreds clashed with women to prevent them from entering the Sabarimala shrine last week, despite a historic Supreme Court ruling. Violent protests were also held in different parts of the state, defying the police's appeal for peace. The temple has historically been closed to women of \\"menstruating age\\". A senior police officer told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi that the protesters, including both men and women, have been arrested for rioting and unlawful assembly. \\"We have arrested those who prevented women from entering the temple and also those who violently protested against the court's order. We hope that this will act as a deterrent when the temple reopens in November,\\" the officer said. The temple only opens for brief periods throughout the year. Massive protests meant that very few women attempted to enter the temple last week and those who tried were forced to turn back. Protesters believe that the ruling goes against the wishes of the deity, Lord Ayappa, himself. They say that the ban on women entering Sabarimala is not about menstruation alone - it is also in keeping with the wish of the deity who is believed to have laid down clear rules about the pilgrimage to seek his blessings. According to the temple's mythology, Lord Ayyappa is an avowed bachelor who has taken an oath of celibacy, hence the ban on the entry of women. Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals. While most Hindu temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, the Sabarimala temple was unusual in that it was one of the few that did not allow women in a broad age group to enter at all. This was overturned by the Supreme Court last month, with judges observing that \\"the right to practice religion is available to both men and women\\". The temple did open its doors to women last week as directed by the court ruling. However, not a single woman was able to enter because of the protesters. Two women managed to reach the main temple premises last week. More than 100 policemen protected them from stone-throwing protesters as they walked the last 5km (3-mile) stretch to the shrine. But they had to turn back after a stand-off with devotees just metres from Sabarimala's sanctum.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.By noon the next day they had covered 311 miles (501 km) from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted: Around 1 pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out \\"crevasse!\\", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him. I couldn't see Ninnis, so I stopped to have a better look. Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me. He immediately jumped out of his sledge, and rushed back. When he nodded his head, I followed him, driving back his sledge. Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse 11 feet (3.4 m) wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as 150 feet (46 m), too far for their ropes to reach. \\"Dog ceased to moan shortly\\", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. \\"We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations.

Patricia just filed for divorce and needed to talk to Monica because","output":"\\"Patricia just filed for divorce and needed to talk to Monica because she was absolutely shattered.\\" Justification: The task requires completing the provided sentence in a meaningful way using one of the available choices. The choices given are: (1). Patricia was absolutely shattered. (2). Monica was absolutely shattered. Considering the context of the sentence, it seems that Patricia is going through a tough time emotionally due to her recent decision to file for divorce. It is a common scenario for individuals in such situations to seek out support from friends or family, in this case, Monica. Thus, the appropriate choice is \\"Patricia was absolutely shattered\\". This aligns with the preceding information about Patricia's emotional state post-filing for divorce, and provides a reason for her urge to talk to Monica. The idea is Patricia's emotional state (being shattered) drives her to seek out conversation with Monica, presumably for moral support or help.  On the other hand, if we chose \\"Monica was absolutely shattered,\\" it wouldn't exactly fit because it changes the focus to Monica without a clear contextual link existing from previous information in the sentence. The emotional status of Monica isn't relevant here based on what's provided about Patricia's situation.

Article: The gang were reported to have made off with 300 gold and 200 silver items of jewellery, the cost of which is still being assessed.      The thieves appeared to have drawn their inspiration from the 'The Red-Headed League,' a popular Sherlock Holmes story that was first published in 1891, while the police said they were still trying to work out the value of what had been stolen.      In 'The Red-Headed League', rated by Conan Doyle as one of his best stories, a pair of robbers digs up the basement of a pawn broker's shop in 19th century London in order to break into a bank vault next door.      The thieves get the shop's red-haired owner out of their way by hiring him for an invented but well-paid clerical job. The owner is improbably told that only people with red hair are eligible to do the job. Holmes solves the bizarre case quickly, thwarting the theft by waiting for the thieves in the bank vault and catching them red-handed.      \\"The criminals dismantled a brick wall in the flat and then got into the shop where they stole various adornments,\\" said one police source.      They bought a flat located next to a jeweller's shop in St. Petersburg, Russia's second city, three weeks before the theft.      The flat shared a common wall with the jewellery shop next door, and neighbours said they thought nothing of it when they heard drilling and hammering, assuming that the flat's new owners were renovating the place.      The gang finally knocked a hole all the way through into the jewellery shop last weekend, triggering an alarm in the process. But the security guards who responded to the alarm twice assumed nothing was wrong as the doors and windows of the shop showed no signs of a break-in from the outside. ||||| St Petersbourg are no doubt wishing that Sherlock Holmes could give them a helping hand on this most curious incident. (MAXIM MARMUR/GETTY)      Russian police have said that culprits behind a jewellery heist in St Petersburg used a Sherlock Holmes novel as the blueprint for the robbery.      Mimicking 120-year-old short story The Red-Headed League from the Sherlock Holmes series by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the gang paid a 74-year-old woman in St Petersburg to leave her flat, which was next door to a jeweller, and then tunnelled through her walls to gain access to the jewellery shop and stole hundreds of gold and silver valuables.      The burglar alarm in the shop sounded twice during the raid but security guards dismissed it as a false alarm because the doors and windows of the shop were still locked.      Story continues below      Advertisement            Although the exact trick used to coax the woman out of her flat is still unknown, Russian police believe that it might have been the exact same ruse employed by the criminals on The Red-Headed League. In the book, fictional shop keep Jabez Wilson is lured away from his premises on the promise of a highly paid job for a bogus company that is only open to red-headed men.      In the 1892 novel, the would-be robbers are caught by Sherlock Holmes who foils their plans by waiting in the bank vault for them to arrive through the walls. In St Petersbourg, however, there was no such obstacle for these literary-loving jewellery thieves.      One St Petersburg policeman said: “Where was Sherlock when we needed him?”. He went on to add that the gang got away clean, leaving no traces at the scene of the crime. |||||Summary:","output":"A gang of thieves in St. Petersburg, Russia, pulled off a jewellery heist seemingly inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story, \\"The Red-Headed League.\\" The criminals paid a 74-year-old woman to leave her flat, which was next to a jeweller's shop, and then tunneled through her walls to gain access to the store.

Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: Madonna starred in the film \\"Swept Away,\\" which was directed by Guy Ritchie.  \\"Swept Away\\" is a romantic comedy film released in 2002, featuring Madonna in the leading role. The movie is an adaptation of the 1974 Italian film \\"Swept Away... by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August,\\" which was directed by Lina Wertmüller. Guy Ritchie, a prominent British director known for movies such as \\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\\" (1998) and \\"Snatch\\" (2000), took on the challenge of directing and writing the script for this remake. The storyline revolves around a wealthy socialite named Amber Leighton (played by Madonna) who is forced to change her perspective on life when she becomes stranded on a deserted island with a fellow castaway, a communist sailor named Giuseppe Esposito (played by Adriano Giannini). Over time, their relationship transforms from animosity to a passionate romance fueled by the challenges of surviving on the remote island with only each other. \\"Swept Away\\" received mixed to negative reviews from critics, with many pointing out the lack of chemistry between the lead actors as well as the weak dialogue and storyline. However, despite its underwhelming reception, the film did garner appreciation for its stunning locations and cinematography. Guy Ritchie and Madonna were married at the time of filming. They began dating in the late 1990s, got engaged on December 2000, and married in Skibo Castle in Scotland on December 22, 2000. The couple filed for divorce in 2008, with their divorce being finalized in January 2009. While the couple has had other collaborations, \\"Swept Away\\" remains the only full-length feature film where Madonna was directed by Ritchie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"To determine the category for \\"The Islamic Globe,\\" I will analyze the title and consider its possible meaning in relation to the given categories. Step 1: Analyze the title \\"The Islamic Globe\\" seems to be a combination of two words: \\"Islamic\\" and \\"Globe.\\" The word \\"Islamic\\" indicates a connection to the religion of Islam, while \\"Globe\\" implies a worldwide or geographical aspect.  Step 2: Compare possible meanings with categories Now, I will go through the categories and assess if \\"The Islamic Globe\\" fits into each category: 1. Company - It is possible but seems unlikely, as there is no clear indication that this title refers to a business entity. 2. Educational Institution - It could be an institution providing education in Islamic studies with worldwide operations or campuses, but there is no direct association. 3. Artist - This is unlikely, as the title doesn't resemble a person's name or stage name. 4. Athlete - Similar to above, it doesn't resemble a person's name or stage name. 5. Office Holder - This title doesn't match a typical office position within a government or organization. 6. Mean of Transportation - It doesn't seem to be related to a vehicle or transportation method. 7. Building - It could potentially refer to a building, like a mosque or Islamic center, but the term \\"Globe\\" doesn't usually fit for naming a building. 8. Natural Place - Unlikely, since it doesn't refer to any specific geographic location or feature. 9. Village - Similar to above, it doesn't refer to a specific location or settlement. 10. Animal - It's not related to any known animal species. 11. Plant - It's not related to any known plant species. 12. Album - Possible but unlikely; the title could be related to an artistic work focused on Islamic culture or history, but it doesn't resemble a traditional album title. 13. Film - Similar to the album, it could be a film about Islamic culture or history, but the connection isn't strong. 14. Written Work - \\"The Islamic Globe\\" could be a book or an article discussing the global influence, history, or aspects of Islamic culture or religion. This seems more fitting than other categories, as written works often have versatile titles that cover a broad range of topics. Based on the analysis, I would categorize \\"The Islamic Globe\\" under the \\"Written Work\\" category, as it seems the most fitting for the title, given its potential meaning related to Islamic culture, history, or religion on a global scale."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By James Gordon A woman known as the 'Sweetheart Scammer' has been captured in Florida after police say she conned an elderly man out of a small fortune. Michelle Nicholas, 46, ended up befriending 82-year-old John Deam and used a romantic getaway in order to con him out of a luxury car, a Rolex and thousands of dollars. The Broward Sheriff's Office reported Wednesday that 46-year-old Michelle Nicholas is charged with grand theft and exploitation of the elderly. Michelle Nicholas, 46, from South Florida, known as the Sweetheart Scammer has been released on bond after she was arrested for allegedly conning an elderly man out of thousands of dollars After coming back from their getaway,","output":"Michelle Nicholas began asking John Deam for financial assistance under false pretenses. She claimed to be in desperate need of money due to various fabricated issues, such as unpaid medical bills, debts, and other emergencies. As Deam continued to provide her with financial support, Nicholas would manipulate him into giving her more and more, even going as far as to convince him to purchase expensive items such as a luxury car and a Rolex watch. John Deam was unaware of Nicholas' intentions and criminal background. Unfortunately, he fell victim to her calculated and deceitful tactics. The 82-year-old man, who had likely hoped for genuine companionship from Nicholas, was ultimately left emotionally and financially devastated. The Sweetheart Scammer's criminal activity caught the attention of the authorities, leading to an extensive investigation by the Broward Sheriff's Office. They worked diligently to collect evidence of Nicholas' crimes and build a strong case against her. Through their efforts, they obtained substantial proof that she had exploited several other vulnerable elderly individuals over the past few years. The authorities believe that Nicholas specifically targeted people of a certain age and social status, preying on their loneliness and sense of trust. Upon her arrest, Michelle Nicholas was charged with grand theft and exploitation of the elderly. She was brought to court to face the consequences of her actions and held accountable for the suffering she had caused. During her trial, evidence of her manipulative tactics, previous criminal activity, and the impact of her actions on the victims were presented to the judge and jury. The prosecution argued that Nicholas posed a significant threat to society, specifically to the elderly population, and should be dealt with severely to prevent any future harm. As the trial progressed, stories from her previous victims were brought to light, reinforcing the extent of her manipulation and deception. Many of these individuals also experienced financial losses and emotional distress as a result of their interactions with Nicholas. After careful deliberation, the jury found Michelle Nicholas guilty of her charges. The judge presiding over the case took into consideration the impact of her actions on her victims and the potential danger she posed to society. Consequently, the judge sentenced her to a significant amount of time behind bars, in addition to ordering her to pay restitution to the victims for the financial losses they suffered as a result of her crimes. Since her arrest and conviction, the case of the Sweetheart Scammer has brought increased awareness to the issue of financial crimes targeting the elderly. Law enforcement agencies are now working to educate the public on the signs of scams and the importance of being vigilant when dealing with financial matters, especially when it involves strangers or online acquaintances. The story of Michelle Nicholas serves as a cautionary tale for those seeking companionship and love, reminding us to be wary of individuals that may be looking to take advantage of our vulnerabilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or duchess at an embassy ball, even the young woman with a strong Cockney accent named Eliza Doolittle who tries to sell them flowers. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons.

Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more.

In the first quarter, San Diego struck first as QB Philip Rivers completed a 57-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates, yet the Niners tied the game with QB Alex Smith completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR Bryan Gilmore. RB LaDainian Tomlinson helped the Chargers retake the lead, as he got a 5-yard TD run.  In a topsy-turvy second quarter, points were flying everywhere.  It began with 49ers kicker Joe Nedney kicking a 42-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Chargers retook the lead as Rivers hooked up with WR Vincent Jackson on a 33-yard TD strike, followed by Tomlinson getting a 1-yard TD run.  Then, Smith connected with FB Moran Norris on a 2-yard pass for San Francisco, which was followed up with the Niners getting a safety from an intentional grounding penalty.

Read this: A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.

Process:  - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose High caloric meats and happens, how will it affect \\"Food cant be processed fully\\".  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this scenario suggests that the consumption of high caloric meats could affect the full processing of food in the digestive system. To determine whether this hypothesis holds true, let's examine the possible direct or indirect effects of high caloric meats on the overall digestive process. 1. Food is taken into the mouth: The consumption of high caloric meats would not have a direct or indirect effect on this step, as the physical act of taking food in the mouth isn't impacted by the type of food being consumed. 2. The food is chewed: High caloric meats might require more chewing compared to other types of food, but this would not have a direct effect on the ability to fully process the food. Chewing helps break down the food into smaller particles and mix it with saliva to initiate the digestive process. 3. Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down: High caloric meats may lead to the secretion of more saliva due to a higher protein content, which requires more amylase (enzyme found in saliva) for breaking down food. However, this shouldn't inhibit the food's full processing. 4. The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach: High caloric meats should not have a direct or indirect effect on this step, as the movement of food down the esophagus is a physical process not impacted by the type of food being consumed. 5. The stomach secretes acid, grinds, and mixes the food: The impact of high caloric meats on this stage might be slightly indirect, as these foods might take longer to digest due to their high fat and protein content. Nonetheless, proper functioning stomach will still be able to secrete the necessary acids and enzymes to process high caloric meats. 6. The food moves to the small intestine: High caloric meats, particularly those high in fats, require more bile and pancreatic enzymes for digestion. This might increase the workload in the small intestine, but a well-functioning digestive system should still effectively process these foods. 7. The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food: Again, high caloric meats may require a higher production of enzymes due to the increased fat and protein content, but a healthy small intestine should adapt and release the necessary enzymes for digestion. 8. The food passes into the colon: During the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine, high caloric meats might result in a higher amount of undigested fats or proteins reaching the colon. However, this should not directly affect the capability to process the food fully. 9. The food is expelled from the body: High caloric meats should not directly affect the expulsion of waste from the body. If the digestive system is functioning properly, the body should be able to expel any waste products produced during digestion. In conclusion, while the consumption of high caloric meats might impose additional demands on the digestive system, it should not directly affect the overall processing of food in a well-functioning digestive system. However, individuals with pre-existing digestive issues might experience difficulty in processing high caloric meats fully, leading to indigestion or other gastrointestinal problems."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article:","output":"Title: Ex-Military Chiefs Propose Boosting Special Forces Operations to Combat Fanatics in Northern Iraq  In recent developments, former military chiefs have proposed enhancing the operations of Special Forces in an attempt to disrupt and 'spoil the day' of fanatics, such as British Muslims, operating in northern Iraq. Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon and Air Commodore Andrew Lambert have called for Britain to escalate its military options in response to the increasing terrorist activities taking place in the region. This call to action follows the horrific murder of US journalist James Foley, apparently by a British jihadist, in what was claimed to be an act of retribution for US-led airstrikes in the region. The ex-military chiefs emphasize the urgency of stepping up the operations of the Special Forces to counter the rise of radical activities perpetrated by individuals, including British citizens, in Iraq. The ongoing conflict in northern Iraq has attracted numerous foreign fighters from various parts of the world, including Britain, thus raising concerns over the situation's potential impact on national security. Air Chief Marshal Graydon and Air Commodore Lambert's proposition to ramp up military efforts in Iraq seeks to enhance the support for local forces on the ground, from combating terrorism to providing aid and training assistance. Special Forces would likely be tasked with gathering intelligence, conducting high-value target operations, and ensuring the safety of British and allied personnel present in the region. The gruesome murder of US journalist James Foley serves as a brutal reminder of the extent to which the fanatics are willing to go in their quest for supremacy and violence. The assailant, believed to be a British jihadist, declared the act as revenge for US-led airstrikes in Iraq. This incident brings to light the complexity of the situation, where citizens from seemingly peaceful countries can be radicalized and driven to commit atrocities in the name of a twisted cause. The suggestion made by the ex-military chiefs to increase the role of the Special Forces in Iraq comes at a time when the threat of global terrorism is higher than it has ever been. Their proposal aims to provide a more proactive approach to countering terrorism while assisting the local forces in their fight against violence. Boosting the operations of the Special Forces would thus represent a strategic response to an ever-growing security concern, both in Iraq and on a global scale. In conclusion, the proposal put forward by Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon and Air Commodore Andrew Lambert highlights the urgent need to combat the escalating terrorist activities in northern Iraq. By enhancing the role of the Special Forces in the region, Britain would be taking a decisive stance against the fanatics threatening the security and stability of not only Iraq but also Western nations. Strengthening the operations of the Special Forces will ensure that those who partake in such violence are identified, pursued, and ultimately brought to justice, while simultaneously thwarting the dangerous expansion of terrorist organizations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was associated with the utopian and Symbolists artistic and literary community Abbaye de Créteil between 1907 and 1908. Marinetti is best known as the author of the first \\"Futurist Manifesto\\", which was written and published in 1909.  - Carlo Carrà (February 11, 1881  April 13, 1966) was an Italian painter and a leading figure of the Futurist movement that flourished in Italy during the beginning of the 20th century. In addition to his many paintings, he wrote a number of books concerning art. He taught for many years in the city of Milan.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Luigi Russolo (30 April 1885  6 February 1947) was an Italian Futurist painter, composer, builder of experimental musical instruments, and the author of the manifesto \\"The Art of Noises\\" (1913). He is often regarded as one of the first noise music experimental composers with his performances of noise music concerts in 191314 and then again after World War I, notably in Paris in 1921. He designed and constructed a number of noise-generating devices called Intonarumori.  - Futurism was an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It emphasized speed, technology, youth, and violence, and objects such as the car, the aeroplane, and the industrial city. Although it was largely an Italian phenomenon, there were parallel movements in Russia, England, Belgium and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even Futurist meals. Its key figures were the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, Antonio Sant'Elia, Bruno Munari, Benedetta Cappa and Luigi Russolo, the Russians Natalia Goncharova, Velimir Khlebnikov, Igor Severyanin, David Burliuk, Aleksei Kruchenykh and Vladimir Mayakovsky, the Belgian Jules Schmalzigaug and the Portuguese Almada Negreiros. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past. Cubism contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism's artistic style. Important Futurist works included Marinetti's \\"Manifesto of Futurism\\", Boccioni's sculpture \\"Unique Forms of Continuity in Space\\", and Balla's painting \\"Abstract Speed + Sound\\" (pictured). To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements Art Deco, Constructivism, Surrealism, Dada, and to a greater degree Precisionism, Rayonism, and Vorticism.  - Unique Forms of Continuity in Space is a bronze Futurist sculpture by Umberto Boccioni. It is seen as an expression of movement and fluidity. The sculpture is depicted on the obverse of the Italian-issue 20 cent euro coin.  - Art Deco, or Deco, is a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I. It became popular in the 1920s and 1930s, and influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewellery, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners. It took its name, short for \\"Arts Décoratifs\\", from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925. It combined modernist styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress.  - Antonio Sant'Elia (30 April 1888  10 October 1916) was an Italian architect and a key member of the Futurist movement in architecture. He left behind almost no completed works of architecture and is primarily remembered for his bold sketches and influence on modern architecture.  - Giacomo Balla ( July 18 , 1871 -- March 1 , 1958 ) was an art teacher , painter and poet and participated later in Futurism . In his art he created a pictorial depiction of light , movement and speed .  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - Natalia Sergeevna Goncharova (June 21, 1881  October 17, 1962) was a Russian avant-garde artist, painter, costume designer, writer, illustrator, and set designer.  - Igor Severyanin (pen name, real name Igor Vasilyevich Lotaryov (  ) (May 16, 1887, Petersburg  December 20, 1941, Tallinn) was a Russian poet who presided over the circle of the so-called Ego-Futurists.  - Umberto Boccioni (19 October 1882  17 August 1916) was an influential Italian painter and sculptor. He helped shape the revolutionary aesthetic of the Futurism movement as one of its principal figures. Despite his short life, his approach to the dynamism of form and the deconstruction of solid mass guided artists long after his death. His works are held by many public art museums, and in 1988 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York organized a major retrospective of 100 pieces.  - Viktor Vladimirovich Khlebnikov, better known by the pen name Velimir Khlebnikov ( 28 June 1922), was a poet and playwright, a central part of the Russian Futurist movement, but his work and influence stretch far beyond it.  - Aleksei Eliseevich Kruchenykh or Kruchonykh or Kruchyonykh (21 February 1886  17 June 1968), a well-known poet of the Russian \\"Silver Age\\", was perhaps the most radical poet of Russian Futurism, a movement that included Vladimir Mayakovsky, David Burliuk and others. Together with Velimir Khlebnikov, Kruchenykh is considered the inventor of \\"zaum\\". Kruchenykh wrote the libretto for the Futurist opera \\"Victory Over the Sun\\", with sets provided by Kazimir Malevich. He married Olga Rozanova, an avant-garde artist, in 1912.  - Jules Schmalzigaug (Antwerp, 1882 or 1883 (the sources have different data)  The Hague, 13 May 1917) was a Belgian futurist painter.  - Violence is defined by the World Health Organization as \\"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\\", although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of \\"the use of power\\" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word. This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes. Violence in many forms is preventable.

For much of his life he divided his time between Paris and Rome. He was associated with neo-classicism and the \\"return to order\\" in the decade after the First World War. During his career he worked in a variety of media, including mosaic and fresco. He showed his work at major exhibitions, including the Rome Quadrennial, and won art prizes from major institutions.  - David Davidovich Burliuk (  ; 21 July 1882  15 January 1967) was a Russian and Ukrainian Futurist, Neo-Primitivist, book illustrator, publicist, and author associated with Russian Futurism.

The album's theme is ambiguous, however, ongoing themes in the songs' lyrics suggest that the main character in question, Sonny, suffers from mental illness, resulting in the creation of many different personalities. The album alludes strongly to the dadaist movement: its cover was based on a painting by Salvador Dalí titled \\"Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire\\". Produced by long-time collaborator Bob Ezrin, at the time his first production with Cooper in six years, \\"DaDa\\" was recorded at ESP Studios in Buttonville, Ontario, Canada.  - Vorticism was a short-lived modernist movement in British art and poetry of the early 20th century, partly inspired by Cubism. The movement was announced in 1914 in the first issue of \\"BLAST\\", which contained its manifesto and the movement's rejection of landscape and nudes in favour of a geometric style tending towards abstraction. Ultimately, it was their witnessing of unfolding human disaster in World War I that \\"drained these artists of their Vorticist zeal\\".

Evans has released eight studio albums: Three Chords and the Truth (1997), No Place That Far (1998), Born to Fly (2000), Restless (2003), Real Fine Place (2005), Stronger (2011), Slow Me Down (2014), Words (2017), plus one Christmas album, At Christmas (2014). Evans was born in Boonville, Missouri, in 1971, and is of Welsh, English, Irish, and Native American descent. She was raised on a farm near New Franklin, Missouri, the eldest girl of seven children. By five, she was singing weekends in her family's band. At the age of eight, she was struck by an automobile in front of the family home, and her legs suffered multiple fractures. Recuperating for months in a wheelchair, she continued singing to help pay her medical bills. When she was 16, she began performing at a nightclub near Columbia, Missouri, a gig that lasted two years.  Evans moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1991 to be a country music artist. She met fellow musician Craig Schelske and left Nashville with him in 1992, moving to Oregon. They married in 1993. She returned to Nashville in 1995 and began recording demos. Nashville songwriter Harlan Howard was impressed by her demo of his song \\"Tiger by the Tail\\". He decided to help her music career, leading to a signed contract with RCA Nashville.  In 1997, Evans released her debut album for RCA, Three Chords and the Truth. Although none of its three singles (\\"True Lies,\\" the title track, and \\"Shame About That\\") reached the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, the album received critical praise for its neotraditional country sound. In 1998, Evans released her second album, No Place That Far. The album's lead single, \\"Cryin' Game,\\" also failed to reach the Top 40. However, the album's second single and title track, gave Evans her first Number One hit on the Hot Country Songs chart in March 1999.

A: A:","output":"The process responsible for the creation of the new seafloor at the mid-ocean ridge is known as seafloor spreading. To fully understand this phenomenon, it's important to learn about the Earth's structure, tectonic plates, and the mechanism involved in seafloor spreading. The Earth has multiple layers, the innermost being the core, followed by the mantle, and the outermost being the crust. The crust and the upper portion of the mantle form an integrated layer called the lithosphere, which is separated into solid sections known as tectonic plates. These plates consist of two types: oceanic plates that form the ocean floor and continental plates that form landmasses. The tectonic plates move due to the heat generated in the Earth's mantle, responsible for the movement and change of the Earth's crust. This heat-driven force, or convection currents, results from the slow circulation of hot material rising up to the crust and cooler material sinking back down into the mantle. Seafloor spreading occurs at the boundaries where two oceanic plates diverge, that is, they move apart from each other. Mid-ocean ridges are such boundaries formed by a series of underwater mountain ranges enveloping the globe, with the most prominent example being the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These ridges are the result of extensive tectonic activity and are characterized by frequent volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. As the tectonic plates diverge at the mid-ocean ridge, hot, molten material from the mantle below rises up towards the Earth's crust through a process known as upwelling. This upwelling brings along with it minerals and gases from deeper within the Earth. When the magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor, it cools and solidifies, forming new oceanic crust material. This newly formed crust adds to the existing oceanic plates and pushes them apart, like two slow-moving conveyor belts. As a result, over a period of millions of years, the seafloor expands, creating new ocean floor. This process has been instrumental in shaping the arrangement of our continents, as well as the current configuration of the Earth's oceans. Fossil records, paleomagnetism, and ocean floor spreading age data further support the concept of seafloor spreading. As the new seafloor forms and moves away from the ridge, it takes with it a record of the Earth's magnetic polarity at the time of its formation. This creates a pattern of magnetic stripes on the ocean floor parallel to the mid-ocean ridges, which has been instrumental in providing evidence for the theory of seafloor spreading and, consequently, the larger theory of plate tectonics. In conclusion, the creation of the new seafloor at the mid-ocean ridge is primarily driven by seafloor spreading, which results from the diverging tectonic plates and the upwelling of hot, molten material from the mantle. This process has played a crucial role in shaping the Earth's geology, including the arrangement of continents and the structure of the ocean floor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: The Ultimate Guide to Engaging Your Cat's Curiosity and Keeping Them Entertained Introduction Cats are curious creatures by nature, and often their curiosity leads them to some less-than-ideal situations, such as getting fixated on doors or trying to escape outside. This article outlines the perfect way to divert your cat's attention from the door, keep them entertained indoors, and even safely let them explore the great outdoors. Step 1: Distract Your Cat from the Door Whether it's because they want to escape or they hear a sound outside, cats often become fascinated with doors. To prevent your cat from becoming obsessed with a specific door, follow these steps: 1. Identify your cat's trigger: Determine what is causing your cat to focus on the door, such as a noise or a gap under the door. 2. Block visual access: Use a screen or tall barrier to obscure your cat's view of the door. 3. Create a diversion: Place toys, puzzles, or treats in areas away from the door to entice your cat to explore elsewhere. 4. Use positive reinforcement: Reward your cat with praise or treats when they leave the door and engage with the distractions provided. Step 2: Provide Entertainment for Your Cat To keep your cat's interest in indoor activities, try these creative entertainment ideas: 1. Interactive toys: Toys that require your cat's interaction, like treat puzzles or remote-controlled mice, can keep them engaged for hours. 2. Window perches: Cats love to observe the world around them, so provide them with a comfortable perch near a window to watch birds or squirrels. 3. Feather wands or laser pointers: Encourage your cat to exercise their hunting skills by playing with them using these tools. 4. Climbing trees and scratching posts: Cats love to climb and scratch, so investing in these structures can keep them entertained and prevent damage to your furniture. Step 3: Let Your Cat Explore the Great Outdoors Allowing your cat to safely explore the outdoors can satisfy their curiosity and reduce their interest in doors. Here are a few ways to give your cat a taste of the great outdoors: 1. Leash training: With patience and persistence, cats can be leash trained, allowing you to take your feline friend on supervised walks. 2. Enclosed outdoor spaces: If you have a yard, consider setting up a secure outdoor cat enclosure or \\"catio,\\" complete with climbing structures, hiding spots, and places to sunbathe. 3. Window bird feeders: Distract your cat from the door by attracting birds to your window with a bird feeder, giving them something interesting to watch. 4. Encourage indoor/outdoor play: Make playtime more engaging by occasionally allowing your cat to chase after toys tossed outside, while supervising from within. Conclusion With these tactics in place, your cat's fascination with the door should diminish, and they'll be able to enjoy a variety of entertaining and safe activities, both inside and out. By addressing their curiosity, you're not only strengthening the bond between you and your feline friend, but you're also providing them with a stimulating and happy environment, which is essential to their well-being."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

If you want, you can use a standard sized binder to spread papers out.;","output":"If you are using the binder for more than one class or subject, get a 3 or 5 inch binder. Get the 1 or 2 inch binders if you plan to use separate binders for each of your classes. When selecting a binder, the most important aspect is that it's the right size to hold all the materials you'll need for your classes or projects. It's critical to consider how many subjects or projects you'll be organizing in a single binder, as space will be essential for keeping things neat, tidy, and easily accessible. While the design of the binder may seem attractive, always remember that functionality should come first.  Once you've selected the appropriate binder size, consider adding dividers or tabs to separate different classes or subjects. This way, you can easily flip to the section you need without having to shuffle through a disorganized stack of papers. You may want to consider getting color-coordinated dividers or labeling each section clearly to make it even easier to find the information you need. Next, invest in some clear sheet protectors and hole-punched folders. Sheet protectors are ideal for keeping important documents and handouts safe from damage, while hole-punched folders can hold any loose papers you may have. Additionally, having a few pockets or pouches in your binder can be helpful for storing pens, pencils, erasers, and other smaller items. To ensure your binder stays organized throughout the school year or duration of your project, make it a habit to file away any new materials as soon as you receive them. This prevents the buildup of unsorted papers and reduces the amount of time you'll need to spend reorganizing later on. Finally, take some time every few weeks to review the contents of your binder and do any necessary reorganizing. This may involve rearranging pages, updating labels, or removing any outdated or unnecessary materials. By staying on top of your binder's organization, you'll be better equipped to succeed in your classes or projects and less likely to feel overwhelmed by clutter. In summary, when organizing a binder, it's crucial to select the right size for your needs, divide the binder into clearly labeled sections, use sheet protectors and folders to store papers and materials, establish good habits to maintain organization, and periodically review the contents to ensure everything is up-to-date and organized. By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating an efficient and effective binder that will help you stay organized throughout the school year or the duration of your project."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They are like a big team who play together and work together to help make things better in their country. But sometimes, they don't agree on everything. This can make it hard for them to work together and stay as a strong team. A man named Smith is worried about this. He thinks that if they don't learn to work together, the big group might break apart and disappear. That means that they won't be a team anymore, and they won't be able to help people the way they used to. Smith is talking to another man named Corbyn, who is the leader of the group. Corbyn is like the captain of the team. Smith wants Corbyn to know that it's important for the whole group to stay strong and work together, or else they might break up. In order to keep the group together, Smith thinks they need to listen to each other and try to understand everyone's ideas. That way, they can make a plan that works for everyone, and continue to help the people in their country.

Boone County Legal Aid, which for 31 years has provided legal services to those who couldn't afford them, will close in February if a 10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino is not awarded. The legal service is one of the few programs in Iowa that offers legal representation to those who qualify without turning to the state for its services. \\"It is a very sad situation, but that's the fact,\\" said Alan Schroeder, city attorney and supervisor of Boone County Legal Aid. For the past two years using money mostly from the city and county, Schroeder has upheld the outfit alone, taking on about 60 clients a year, and settling cases that range from domestic abuse to bankruptcy. He also has a private practice. If the legal service closes, he's unsure where his clients will go. The city of Boone gave Schroeder 6,300 in July to resolve pending cases, said Kathy Berg, Boone's finance officer. Without that, the program might already be closed. \\"All governments are having problems with finances,\\" Boone Mayor George Maybee said. \\"No one else stepped in. The county didn't. The state didn't.\\" Donovan Olson, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said the board quit funding the legal service in July because it felt the county didn't need it. Drake University ended its funding after the 2000 spring semester \\"for a variety of reasons,\\" Suzanne Levitt, the law professor who oversaw the program, said via e-mail. Olson said Schroeder must prove Prairie Meadows is the primary money source for the board to grant the program any more money. Schroeder ran the program without the help of law students or Drake, which had provided as much as two-thirds of the money in some years.

In Western countries like the United States, many women are now working and earning money outside their homes, with more than half of the women aged eighteen to sixty-five having good jobs. These women generally have more education than those who stay at home, and they are increasingly asserting their desire for equal chances of success as men. However, the best jobs are still often given to men, and women in many cases earn less than their male counterparts for the same work. On the other hand, women in the Middle East countries face more traditional constraints and expectations. They are typically expected to stay at home, take care of their families, and manage the household work, with limited opportunities to work outside the home. When they do venture out in public, they are often required to cover their faces and walk behind their husbands. Despite these limitations, the passage notes that the women's lives in the Middle East have been changing in recent years, with many women seeking to play an active role in society. Some challenges still remain, however, as men may still prefer to marry women in the old ways even if the women are working. In summary, from this passage, we know that women's roles and opportunities vary significantly across different regions and cultural contexts, with some progress being made towards gender equality in the workplace and in societal expectations. However, further efforts are needed to ensure that women worldwide have the same opportunities and chances for success as men."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Several major companies — Enterprise Holdings, First National Bank of Omaha, Symantec, Hertz and Avis — have ended co-branding partnerships with the National Rifle Association as a #BoycottNRA social media movement picks up steam.      Enterprise — the parent company of car-rental brands Enterprise, Alamo and National — cut ties on Thursday, when it discontinued an arrangement that offered discounts to NRA members. Hertz, Avis Budget Group and TrueCar later followed suit.      First National Bank of Omaha, one of the country’s largest privately held banks, also announced Thursday the end of a credit-card co-branding deal with the NRA. The bank had issued what its ads described as the “Official Credit Card of the NRA,” according to the Omaha World-Herald; the Visa card offered 5 percent back on gas and sporting goods store purchases and a 40 bonus card.      On Friday, Symantec announced in a terse statement on Twitter that it had also ended its discount program with the gun-rights organization. The company, which provides cybersecurity solutions worldwide, had been offering discounts on Norton anti-virus and malware protection, cutting prices on its premium package from 110 to 48 for NRA members.      Separately, insurance company Chubb Limited said Friday that it will stop underwriting “NRA Carry Guard,” a policy marketed to NRA members who face legal or civil lawsuits after they shoot someone. A spokesman for Chubb told Reuters that the company informed the NRA of the decision three months ago; the policy has faced criticism from gun-control groups who called it “murder insurance.”      The decisions came as the names of companies with NRA associations began circulating widely on the Internet and social media under the #BoycottNRA hashtag after the deadly Valentine’s Day attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.      A gunman wielding an AR-15 rifle killed 17 people and wounded at least 14 others, drawing anguished calls for a ban on assault weapons from students and families.      The mass killing focused renewed attention on the NRA, which is credited with blocking gun-control measures for years through millions of dollars in political campaign contributions and pressure from its large membership base.      American businesses have become increasingly politically aware and have participated in boycotts over the past few years against states over LGBT rights. But the NRA is a well-funded membership operation devoted to a single cause — guns — and unlikely to be moved by the actions of companies with which it has such loose and peripheral ties.      Like many other organizations, the NRA has benefit deals with companies designed to make membership more appealing. The NRA “member benefits” page offers savings on a credit card, hearing aids, car rentals, travel, car purchases and prescription drugs.      FedEx, for example, gives NRA Business Alliance members up to a 26 percent discount on shipping expenses.      FedEx has not said anything publicly about its NRA association in recent days; when reached around 4:30 ET on Friday afternoon, a company spokesperson said he had no information to provide.      Hashtags urging boycotts of specific companies involved in the deals have sprouted up across social media over the past several days. People then started posting comments on the social media platforms of many of the companies urging them to take action.      The Omaha bank appears to have been the first to respond publicly.

TrueCar tweeted that it would end its car-buying service relationship with the NRA on Feb. 28.      [Activists call for tech companies to drop NRA’s digital TV channel]      Movers North American Van Lines and Allied Van Lines also disassociated their companies from the NRA.      The insurer Metlife said it has terminated discounts offered to NRA members on the gun lobby group’s website, the Associated Press reported.      The hotel chains Best Western and Wyndham Hotels also told social media users that they were no longer affiliated with the NRA, the AP reported.      One activist listed more than a dozen brands who had severed NRA relationships:      Meantime, gun-control organizations Moms Demand Action and Everytown sent a letter Friday asking five companies — Google, Amazon, Apple, AT&T; and Roku — to cease streaming NRATV, saying “it’s time for tech leaders to acknowledge their role in helping the NRA spread this dangerous content.”      The NRA has not commented on the announcements.      However, the World-Herald quoted Rod Moeller, director of government affairs for the Nebraska Firearms Owners Association, saying that the group will “be giving strong consideration to moving their accounts to a bank that hasn’t bowed to political pressure.”      Boycott movements have become increasingly effective political tools over the past few years. Indiana got hit hard by threatened boycotts in 2015 when Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed legislation allowing businesses and individuals to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. The Indiana legislature and Pence reversed the measure within two weeks.      In 2016, North Carolina was the target of a business boycott after it enacted a “bathroom bill” requiring transgender people to use bathrooms based on their assigned gender at birth. After the NCAA canceled tournaments in the state and PayPal decided not to build a new facility in the state, the legislation was partially repealed.      The NRA claims 5 million members and corporate allies in the gun industry that provide the organization with tens of millions of dollars per year. The group devotes massive resources to fighting gun regulations in the name of the Second Amendment to the Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms.      T.J.

First National Bank of Omaha was among the first to ditch the NRA when it announced Thursday that it would end a Visa credit card it had offered with NRA branding, citing a deluge of customer complaints.      First National Bank of Omaha's breakup with the NRA put an end to a card that offered 5% back on gas and sporting goods purchases, according to an NRA blog, which boasted that \\"every time you pack up and head out on a hunt or to the range…. you’re putting money back in your pocket.\\"      The moves suggest the NRA is losing a degree of support in the corporate world amid a firestorm of criticism over the group's support for gun rights despite recent killing sprees.      \\"Banks and other companies are sensitive to being on the wrong side of a social media campaign, which can spread pretty quickly these days,\\" said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor who has taught classes on marketing. \\"They don’t want to risk having people march or boycott.\\"      Still, Gordon said a widespread movement against NRA-affiliated companies was \\"unlikely\\" because most consumers don't change their behavior based on political issues.

People on social media are calling for boycotts of companies including FedEx, Norton Security, Best Western, and Wyndham Hotels that offer — or have offered — special deals for NRA members. As part of their membership, NRA members receive discounts on things from renting cars to buying prescription drugs.      However, while Wyndham Hotels previously offered a 10% discount to NRA members, the hotel chain no longer does so.      Just a few of dozens of tweets denying ties to the NRA Wyndham      This week, the Twitter accounts for Wyndham and its rewards program tweeted dozens of times that the hotel chain \\"is no longer affiliated with the NRA\\" in response to boycott threats.      A Wyndham representative told Business Insider the company ended its relationship with the NRA in late 2017, prior to the school shooting in Parkland, Florida that sparked recent boycott efforts.      Best Western has been similarly targeted by boycott efforts, as the hotel chain offered NRA members discounts as recently as 2016.      In response, Best Western has tweeted dozens of times that the company \\"does not have an affiliation with and is not a corporate partner of the National Rifle Association.\\"      Best Western      \\"Best Western ended any association with the NRA in 2014,\\" a representative said in a statement to Business Insider.      Both hotel chains have been targeted in past boycotts organized by gun control activists.      In 2012, activist group Avaaz organized a boycott calling for Wyndham and Best Western to cut ties with the NRA following the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. At the time, both hotel chains were listed on the gun rights group's website as \\"friends of the NRA\\" and offered members discounts at hotels.      \\"It's time for mainstream companies like Wyndham Hotels to get out of bed with the extremist NRA,\\" Avaaz campaigner Joseph Huff-Hannon said in 2012, The Guardian reported.

They struggled further in the second quarter with RB LeGarrette Blount getting a 17-yard TD run; but they replied with RB Josh Vaughan making a 2-yard TD run. Tampa Bay scored again when Freeman found TE Kellen Winslow on a 20-yard TD pass. The Panthers tried to cut the lead down with Kasay's 28- and 48-yard field goals, but the Buccaneers pulled away in the fourth quarter with kicker Connor Barth nailing a 32-yard field goal, and with RB Cadillac Williams getting a 45-yard TD run. Answer this question based on the article: How many yards shorter was John Kasay's second field goal compared to his first?","output":"Okay, little buddy! In the story, John Kasay had two field goals. His first one was 46 yards and his second one was 28 yards. To find out how many yards shorter the second field goal was compared to the first, we just have to subtract 28 from 46. So, 46 minus 28 equals 18. That means John Kasay's second field goal was 18 yards shorter than his first."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the present-day name of the place John Fordun referred to as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'?  The first written record of St Kilda may date from 1202 when an Icelandic cleric wrote of taking shelter on \\"the islands that are called Hirtir\\". Early reports mentioned finds of brooches, an iron sword and Danish coins, and the enduring Norse place names indicate a sustained Viking presence on Hirta, but the visible evidence has been lost. In the late 14th century John of Fordun referred to it as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'. The islands were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when Donald Munro suggested that:  \\"The inhabitants thereof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit in aney religion, but M’Cloyd of Herray, his stewart, or he quhom he deputs in sic office, sailes anes in the zear ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize bairnes ther.\\"Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' isolation and dependence on the bounty of the natural world meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism as it did to Christianity until the arrival of Rev. John MacDonald in 1822. Macauley (1764) reported the existence of five druidic altars, including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground near the Stallir House on Boreray.Coll MacDonald of Colonsay raided Hirta in 1615, removing 30 sheep and a quantity of barley. Thereafter, the islands developed a reputation for abundance. At the time of Martin's visit in 1697 the population was 180 and the steward travelled with a \\"company\\" of up to 60 persons to which he \\"elected the most 'meagre' among his friends in the neighbouring islands, to that number and took them periodically to St. Kilda to enjoy the nourishing and plentiful, if primitive, fare of the island, and so be restored to their wonted health and strength.\\" A:","output":"The present-day name of the place John Fordun referred to as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world' is St Kilda."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I knew that my daughter’s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred. I thanked her for the 14 years she had been one of my daughter’s closest companions and I held her as she took her last breath. I was afraid my daughter was going to be angry with me when I told her that i made the decision with out giving her time to say goodbye.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Is Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin higher or lower than Mark's?  Mark has just graduated high school and is going to visit his grandpa, Tom, over the summer for a couple days. Since Tom is retired, he often has plenty of time to go fishing, and he even has a small cabin by the lake. The two men are planning to spend several days at the cabin cooking, fishing, chopping firewood to make fires and just general outdoor activities.  Hint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. A:","output":"A: Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin is higher than Mark's.

Hypothesis: Their influence disappeared and they just went to live in the city. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise and the hypothesis are similar, but they do not exactly entail each other. They both indicate a decline in influence and a shift towards a more ordinary lifestyle. However, there are some key differences in the details and implications of these statements. Premise: \\"Their influence waned, and they began to be absorbed into the general population.\\" This statement suggests a gradual decline in the group's influence over a period of time. It indicates that the group did not abruptly lose their power or importance, but rather experienced a steady reduction of their sway. As their influence waned, the group started to integrate into the general population, becoming indistinguishable from the rest of society. This implies a loss of uniqueness or distinctiveness, as the group no longer maintained a separate or special status within the broader population. Hypothesis: \\"Their influence disappeared and they just went to live in the city.\\" This statement describes the group's influence vanishing, which indicates a more abrupt change in status. It does not convey the same sense of a gradual decline as the premise does. Instead, the group's influence is described as disappearing altogether, suggesting a potentially sudden and unexpected shift in power dynamics. Additionally, the hypothesis specifically references the group relocating to a city. This adds a geographic element to the situation, which is not present in the premise. While both the premise and the hypothesis communicate a decline in influence and integration into a larger community, they differ in the way this process occurs. The premise implies a more gradual decline and eventual absorption into the general population, whereas the hypothesis suggests a sudden disappearance of influence and a relocation to a city setting. As such, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis, as there are differences in the way the group's loss of influence and integration into society is described.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the work that was likely influenced by Musidora?  By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still  regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: Some sheep that are wearing bells around their necks.","output":"In the given sentence, \\"Some sheep that are wearing bells around their necks,\\" the most important words can be analyzed based on their contextual significance and roles within the sentence: 1. \\"sheep\\" - The word \\"sheep\\" is the central focus or subject of the sentence. It represents the entity being discussed. In this context, it is the animals that are being referred to and are the primary objects of interest. 2. \\"wearing\\" - This word indicates an action or state of the sheep. It describes what the sheep are doing or what condition they are in. The use of \\"wearing\\" helps paint a visual image of the sheep and provides more information about them, making it essential for understanding the sentence. 3. \\"bells\\" - The word \\"bells\\" is another important element in the sentence. It is the object that the sheep are wearing. Bells are typically small, hollow, and metallic instruments that produce a ringing sound when struck. In this case, their presence on the sheep suggests that the animals might be part of a larger group, a herd, or might be domesticated for some purpose. 4. \\"around their necks\\" - This phrase provides additional context for the placement of the bells. By specifying that the bells are \\"around their necks,\\" we gain a clearer understanding of how the sheep are wearing the bells. This phrase helps construct the mental image of the sheep and is important for comprehending the full context of how the bells are situated on the animals. 5. \\"Some\\" - Though it is not as important as the other words, \\"some\\" serves a contextual purpose in the sentence. It indicates that the description applies to an unspecified number of sheep within a larger group. This word could imply that not all sheep in a group are wearing bells or that the description applies to only a select few sheep. In summary, the most important words in the sentence \\"Some sheep that are wearing bells around their necks\\" are \\"sheep,\\" \\"wearing,\\" \\"bells,\\" and \\"around their necks.\\" Each one of these words and phrases contributes crucial information that helps to understand the main subject, the implied action, related objects, and context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Tom also wondered: could we be one of God's dreams? Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The premise and the hypothesis are essentially expressing the same idea in slightly different ways. To understand this, we need to unpack the two statements.  The premise: \\"And (as Tom wonders in the book's opening line) are we all characters in one of God's dreams?\\" This statement tells us that Tom, a character in the book is pondering on a metaphysical question. He is contemplating whether all beings, or all of humanity, could potentially be characters in a dream conjured up by God. Here, “God’s dreams” could be interpreted to mean a metaphysical plane, a divine plan, or the manifestation of God’s will or imagination. Essentially, Tom in this context is questioning the nature of existence and whether our reality is part of a much larger, divine construct, something akin to a dream of God. The hypothesis: \\"Tom also wondered: could we be one of God's dreams?\\" In this statement, Tom is once again positing the same existential notion. He is asking if our existence, our reality, and indeed humanity itself could potentially exist within a dream of God's. Here, the term \\"God's dreams\\" is once again open to interpretation and could be interpreted to mean a realm outside our understanding, a divine blueprint or simply an aspect of divine imagination or will. In both cases, Tom is contemplating the same central theory: the possibility of our existence and reality being part of a spiritual or divine design that is beyond our comprehension, perhaps similar to characters within a dream.  In conclusion, given that the two queries maintain the same existential question pertaining to the nature of our reality and its relation to a greater divine plan or construct, we can assuredly say that the premise does entail the hypothesis. Both propose the idea that we could be living within one of God's dreams.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.  Two coworkers are sitting in the large break room eating lunch and watching the news on TV when they see an advertisement for glasses. John, upon seeing the ad, comments that he really should go and get a new pair since he is nearsighted and hasn't gotten a new pair of glasses in a couple years. Rick says he is glad that he doesn't need to wear glasses because it seems like such a pain to have to always have something on your face. John nods in agreement and then both men turn to see a woman at the other side of the break room waving at them and trying to get their attention.  Which person's parents are less likely to wear glasses? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Rick's parents are less likely to wear glasses. Rick mentioned that he doesn't need to wear glasses, suggesting he may not have inherited the genetic predisposition for nearsightedness from his parents. Conversely, John is nearsighted, which can be inherited, indicating there's a higher chance that one or both of his parents wear glasses. However, it's essential to note that the absence of definitive information about their parents' vision and other possible causes for vision problems make it impossible to draw a conclusive answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: I teach geography at UNLV three times per week. Last Monday, at the beginning of class, I cheerfully asked my students how their weekend had been. One young man said that his weekend had not been so good. He had his wisdom teeth removed. The young man then asked me why I always seemed to be so cheerful. \\"I choose to be cheerful.\\" I said. Then I told them a story. In addition to teaching here at UNLV, I also teach out at the community college in Henderson, 17 miles down the freeway from where I live. One day I drove those 17 miles to Henderson. I exited the freeway and turned onto College Drive. I only had to drive another quarter mile down the road to the college. But just then my car died and wouldn't start again. So I left my car there and marched down the road to the college. As soon as I got there I called AAA  and arranged for a tow truck   to meet me at my car after class. The secretary in the office asked me what had happened. \\"This is my lucky day.\\" I replied, smiling. \\"Your car breaks down and today is your lucky day?\\" She was puzzled. \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"My car could have broken down anywhere along the freeway but it didn't.\\" I replied, \\"Instead, it broke down in the perfect place: off the freeway, within walking distance from here. I'm still able to teach my class, and I've been able to arrange for the tow truck to meet me after class.\\" The secretary's eyes opened wide, and then she smiled. I smiled back and headed for class. So ended my story. I scanned the sixty faces in my class at UNLV. Despite the early hour, no one seemed to be asleep. Somehow, my story had touched them. Or maybe _ In fact, it had all started with a student's observation that I was cheerful. An Indian wise man once said, \\"Who you are speaks louder to me than anything you can say.\\" I suppose it must be so. Question: By saying \\"it wasn't the story at all\\", the author means that  _  . Options: A: His story is not convincing B: He shouldn't have told the story C: His attitude to life has inspired the students D: His story is not as interesting as expected The answer is:","output":"C: His attitude to life has inspired the students Step-by-step justification: 1. The author shares a personal story about choosing to be cheerful and finding luck even in an unfortunate situation, like their car breaking down. 2. The student's comment was about the author's cheerfulness, showing their awareness of the author's attitude. 3. In the quote \\"Who you are speaks louder to me than anything you can say\\", it suggests that actions and attitudes can have a stronger impact than words alone. 4. Given the context of the story and the focus on the author's attitude, option C fits best as it refers to the author's attitude inspiring the students, instead of placing importance on the story itself."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.  Question: \\"How did the Moors change Portugal?\\" Response: \\"The Moors influence can be seen in their contribution of wells, waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the local people and the introduction of Islam as a religion\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct based on the information provided in the paragraph.

That's as scary as it gets for the Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals inched closer to what would be an ongoing franchise-record fourth consecutive postseason berth in Week 15 when plenty of money signs were flashed but none coming from the player most associated with the overbearing gesture, Johnny Manziel. The Cleveland rookie quarterback's first career NFL start was as dismal as it gets and the Browns were whitewashed, 30-0, by the AFC North-leading Bengals. But if Jim Ross was getting ready to broadcast the Bengals' next game, the famed wrestling announcer might say: \\"Business is about to pick up.\\" Cincinnati can clinch the playoff spot with a win over the AFC West champion Denver Broncos on Monday night, and it can earn the AFC North crown with a win coupled with losses by the Steelers, who play Kansas City on Sunday, and the Ravens, who are at Houston. \\"We're still in control of everything,\\" said Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton. \\"We know these next two games are going to be big. The way our division is going, everyone keeps winning. We know what we're facing.\\" What their facing is the Boogeyman on \\"Monday Night Football,\\" along with the stark realization that Manziel will be turning into Manning over a one-week span. That's the equivalent of a basic arithmetic test followed up by one on advanced calculus. \\"It's going to be a big shift, safe to say,\\" Cincinnati coach Marvin Lewis admitted. \\"It's a challenge. (Manning) gets everyone's attention in this building right away. The player he is, how he carries himself, how he runs things on the field -- it's going to be a great challenge for us.\\" Challenge may be an under statement because the Bengals have never beaten Manning whether he was in Indianapolis or Denver, compiling an 0-8 mark when the five-time MVP is lined up opposite them. If that wasn't daunting enough, the game is also going to be played after sundown and that's never a good thing for Cincinnati. The Bengals have played twice in primetime so far this season, getting blown out both times, a 43-17 setback at New England in a Sunday night game on Oct. 5, and a 24-3 drubbing at the hands of the Browns while Brian Hoyer was still in charge on Thursday, Nov. 6. Since Dalton took over the Bengals in the 2011 season Cincinnati is playing .250 football (2-6) under the national spotlight, a sharp contrast from its 37-16-1 mark over that same span during day games. \\"I have no idea,\\" defensive end Wallace Gilberry said when asked about the team's struggles at night. \\"I guess we're afraid of the dark.\\" Add in the three playoff losses since 2011 and the Bengals are a downright dismal 2-9 when the spotlight is focused squarely on them and Lewis' team is tired of hearing about it. \\"It is annoying and it's our job to make it unannoying,\\" safety George Iloka said. \\"If we lose this game, the talk will come back again. But that's (the media's) job to do. And if we want to silence the critics, we've got to put up or shut up. That's how it goes. It might be annoying, but that's on us.\\" Silencing anyone on Monday is going to be a daunting task. Manning and the Broncos' offense have taken a step back from their historical 2013 performance, perhaps the best statistical season in NFL history. That said, when you look up, the numbers remain staggering as Manning is third in the AFC with 4,143 passing yards and even better with 37 TD passes (second in the NFL) and a 106.4 passer rating (tops in the conference). The veteran now has an NFL record 14 career 4,000-yard passing seasons and headlines an offense that is fifth in the NFL in both yards (400.7 yards per game) and points per game (29.1). If anything the group has become more well-rounded in recent weeks because of the emergence of the ground game and C.J. Anderson, who is averaging 135.3 scrimmage yards per game (812 total) with six total TDs (four rushing, two receiving) over the past six games. The receiving threats, meanwhile, remain as good as any in football led by Demaryius Thomas, who has 1,389 receiving yards and leads all AFC receivers with 41 TD catches since entering the league in 2010. His running mate, Emmanuel Sanders, has a career-high 1,261 yards and seven TD catches over his past nine games. The Cincinnati defense looked like world-beaters against Manziel but has taken a significant step back overall without Mike Zimmer, now the head coach in Minnesota. The Bengals D entered last week's contest 25th in the league and are now 20th after dominating Manziel. The 25 number is probably more indicative of where Cincinnati belongs because facing a QB who isn't ready to play in the NFL is an anomaly and certainly not what the Bengals will be up against on Monday night. \\"We have to get through this game before we have any opportunities at January,\\" Lewis said. \\"It's been (a playoff mentality) for the last seven weeks. Preparation and how you go about it, and the confidence of knowing what to do and how to do it allows you to play fast. That's the most important thing, for us: to play fast, to play physical, to play smart.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Cincinnati Bengals are preparing to face the Denver Broncos in a game that could secure their place in the playoffs, but they must overcome their struggles in primetime games and face the challenge of Peyton Manning and the Broncos' high-powered offense.

As you may have gathered from the title, I wholeheartedly believe this movie to be the worst zombie movie of all time. The acting, camera-work, writing, special effects and anything else remotely related to this movie sucked. People have argued that while this movie is terribly-acted and terribly-produced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script. Wow. The plot has more holes than I or anyone else could possibly count. For starters, why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when it's not safe? I know the government's supposed to be evil but they don't gain anything by killing the entire population of the country. There wouldn't be anyone to govern! Another thing that I was wondering about, even if the government told everyone to go to work, why would people go if the streets were swarming with zombies? Were the zombies going to hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet? And how about the ending? That stupid Torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies. He probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature. And another thing, why does he say Hindenburg before he dies. The Hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people. The zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country, possibly the world. He doesn't think anyone else will get a few snapshots? They also managed to ruin the only semi-interesting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer. Why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl? Especially when the zombie could have come through the DOOR. It's probably just something an unintelligent zombie movie fan such as myself wouldn't understand. Every day I pray that God with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in Feeding the Masses. Anywho, I think it's interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production. Hey Trent Haaga, I'm calling you out!

In the process outlined, the formation and buildup of electrostatic charges play a critical role in the development of a thundercloud and subsequent lightning. When there is a greater number of electrostatic charges produced inside a cloud, it will have a direct impact on the process: 1. Increase in ice particles inside the cloud: As more ice forms inside a cloud, it provides a greater number of particles for the collision and bumping process. These collisions result in the generation of electrostatic charges. 2. Enhanced electrostatic charging: More collisions of ice particles would cause a greater number of electrostatic charges to be generated. As a result, the cloud would acquire a more potent negative charge, leading to a stronger polarization of charges within the thundercloud. 3. Intensification of the thundercloud: The stronger electrostatic energy contributes to the development of a larger, more intense thundercloud. This, in turn, could lead to more powerful thunderstorms, producing more frequent and potentially more dangerous lightning. 4. Increased attraction of positive energy: With the enhanced negative charge in the cloud, the positive energy on the ground would be more strongly attracted to it, leading to a greater concentration of positive charges on the ground as they attempt to connect with the negative charges in the cloud. 5. Greater potential for lightning: The stronger connection between positive and negative energy would result in a higher likelihood of lightning formation. Furthermore, this lightning could exhibit more powerful effects due to the increased energy buildup within the cloud and ground. In conclusion, the increase in electrostatic charges within a cloud would directly impact the process of thundercloud and lightning formation. This impact would lead to more intense thunderclouds and potentially more dangerous and frequent lightning occurrences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I read this book completely impartially, even looking forward to it. Thea Dorn as the \\"most macabre crime author\\" is titled by Welt am Sonntag. FAZ describes her novel as intelligent and humorous. And admittedly: the description of the content even sounds promising. I expected a thriller full of wonderful black humor, but Thea Dorn's narrative style left me bitterly disappointed. Her way of writing reminds me of my attempts as an author...at the age of 12. Thea Dorn tries to create strong and extraordinary characters. However, she doesn't succeed in the least. The characters, above all the main character, are boring and one-dimensional. Thea Dorn didn't want caricatures in her novel which is her bad luck. Thus, her characters appear neither meaningful nor humorous but exude one-dimensionality. \\"Berliner Aufklärung\\" is in no way recommendable. Some prejudices about specific newspapers are truly reinforced (see above).\\" 2. Analyze the text to determine if it is a positive or negative review.

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: After a long and winding argument over the topic, Lee left Austin's house.

A “Downton Abbey” movie is finally in the works, according to the Sun.      The ITV show, whose cast included Hugh Bonneville, Laura Carmichael, Michelle Dockery, Joanne Froggatt and Maggie Smith ended last March after six seasons of uptight British drama.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose body was flown to Adelaide?, using the article: By 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration. Nevertheless, he continued to  visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when  he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after  further surgery  he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital  went well, but his conducting in the afternoon  was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\".  Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie  that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs.  His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record  attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: \\"I have been trying to write score for several days. But I have not succeeded yet.\\"Grainger died in the White Plains hospital on 20 February 1961, at the age of 78. His body was flown to Adelaide where, on 2 March, he was buried in the Aldridge family vault in the West Terrace Cemetery, alongside Rose's ashes. Ella survived him by 18 years; in 1972, aged 83, she married a young archivist, Stewart Manville. She died at White Plains on 17 July 1979., what would be the answer ?

Who is the American actor and voice actor that guest starred in the animated television series Death in Bloom as Death?","output":"The American actor and voice actor who guest-starred in the animated television series Death in Bloom as Death is none other than Miguel Ferrer. Miguel Ferrer was born on February 7, 1955, in Santa Monica, California, and passed away on January 19, 2017.  Death in Bloom is an episode from the second season of the popular animated television series Adventure Time, originally aired on Cartoon Network. This episode was first broadcasted on February 28, 2011. The series, created by Pendleton Ward, follows the adventures of Finn the Human and his best friend Jake the Dog in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo. The Death in Bloom episode showcases the duo's quest to the underworld to retrieve the soul of Princess Bubblegum's plant out of fear of her anger should they fail. Miguel Ferrer, who voices the character of Death, was an accomplished actor in both live-action and voice acting roles. He was born into a talented family, with his father being the famous actor and director Jose Ferrer, and his mother being the singer and actress Rosemary Clooney, making him a cousin to the well-known actor George Clooney. Throughout his career, Ferrer appeared in numerous film and television projects, such as his roles in the cult classic sci-fi film RoboCop (1987) as Bob Morton, the crime drama series Twin Peaks (1990-1991) as the forensic pathologist Albert Rosenfield, and the television series NCIS: Los Angeles (2012-2017) as Assistant Director Owen Granger. In addition to his live-action work, Ferrer lent his distinct voice to multiple animated projects. Some notable examples include the villainous Shan Yu in Disney's Mulan (1998), the antagonistic Vice President Rodriguez in the animated series The Batman (2004-2008), and the Silvermane character in The Spectacular Spider-Man (2008-2009). His voice acting work showcased his range and ability to adapt to various roles, from menacing and sinister characters to more complex, emotionally driven parts. Miguel Ferrer's portrayal of Death in Adventure Time's Death in Bloom episode added depth and charisma to the character, demonstrating his proficiency in voice acting. Despite his unfortunate passing in 2017, Ferrer's legacy continues to live on through the memorable characters he brought to life on both the big and small screen."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. When Maria Elza de Fatima learned the World Cup was coming to Brazil in 2014, she thought the good times were soon to return. Once the owner of a busy clothing stall, the 59-year-old Sao Paulo resident had scraped around for work since her license expired and wasn't renewed by city authorities. But now the World Cup was coming to her home town -- along with many thousands of fans, visitors and tourists -- opportunities would abound, wouldn't they? It hasn't quite turned out that way. De Fatima may be one of the lucky ones who has been able to secure an official World Cup job but what she can do and where she can work is limited. Alongside roughly 600 others, she has been given permission to sell ice packs and soft drinks outside the Sao Paulo stadium. Only official FIFA partners are allowed to hock their wares here and within the arena. De Fatima is all too aware that many others haven't been so fortunate. She recalls the days when as many 22,000 stall-owners plied their trade on Sao Paulo's streets. A mere 600 jobs (although there are also temporary roles in other areas) isn't nearly enough for them, she laments. \\"This World Cup is not for the Brazilians,\\" de Fatima replies when asked whether Sao Paulo has experienced the boon she expected. \\"It is for the foreigners and FIFA friends.\\" Nationwide protests. De Fatima isn't the only disillusioned Brazilian. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that 61% of respondents felt hosting the World Cup would be a bad thing for their country. According to Marina Mattar of the Sao Paulo Popular Committee of the World Cup, an umbrella organization for disparate protest groups in the city, the tournament will bring a lot of money into Brazil, but mainly to a well-connected few. \\"The World Cup is bringing benefits to Brazil but it's to the economic and political elites -- not to street vendors, not to small companies, entrepreneurs and not to workers in general,\\" she said. Key to this debate are the spiraling costs of building new stadia across the country to host matches during the World Cup. Promotional literature released by the Brazilian government puts expenditure in terms of funds, loans and credit lines from the public purse for stadium projects at at 3.5 billion. But a recent audit suggests the price has escalated to 4.2 billion. \\"The stadiums are not being built for ordinary people because the price of the tickets is very high and many people will not be able to go watch football any more. \\"Instead, the stadiums are in a way very good for big engineering companies to make money,\\" Mattar said. People have also been evicted from their homes to make way for projects relating to the World Cup and there has been the \\"pacification\\" of favelas, which has seen police forcibly occupy some of the poorer neighborhoods in the city, she added. Such concerns are far from exclusive to Sao Paulo. All across Brazil, street protests have raged in the last year while popular committee groups have also sprung up in Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and beyond. A multitude of grievances, not all directly related to the world Cup, have driven this discontent -- including rising transport prices, higher living costs, housing concerns and accusations of police brutality. Fairness and equality are at the heart of these concerns. While Brazil has grown rapidly since the turn of the century, creating a new middle class, inequality remains high and some fear the very poorest are being left behind. According to the CIA World Factbook, Brazil ranks 17th out of 140 countries in terms of the highest levels of income disparity. Protesters are asking why an emerging nation is spending billions on hosting a football tournament when that money could be better directed towards alleviating poverty. \\"It is unacceptable to build a mega event that will provide high profits to FIFA ... while there are serious problems of social inequality in the country,\\" said Jean Marcelo, an activist with the student protest group Domino Publico. \\"The World Cup reaffirms an existing logic that rules the Brazilian government. It's a logic benefiting big businesses and a small elite who occupy the top of the social pyramid,\\" he added. But with new roads, airports and stadiums being built, all of which have brought jobs and improvements to the country's infrastructure, there are many who say the initial outlay, however eye-watering, will be worth it in the long term. The Brazilian government estimates that 710,000 temporary and permanent jobs will be created during the tournament while fan spending alone is expected to total 13 billion. On top of that, many Brazilian cities see the exposure they will gain hosting matches as an opportunity to position themselves as attractive destinations to potential investors and tourists now and in the future. A World Cup for all? \\"There has been significant investment in urban mobility projects, in airport modernization projects, in port modernization projects, telecommunications infrastructure and security infrastructure,\\" Brazil's deputy sports minister Luis Fernandes told CNN. \\"You have to remember that Brazil is still a developing nation... as well as providing jobs for hundreds of thousands of Brazilians, these investments will benefit people in terms of the services provided,\\" he added. \\"The fans who come to the World Cup won't be taking back with them the new urban transport solutions or airport extensions,\\" Fernandes said. Paulo Esteves, general supervisor at Rio de Janeiro-based think-tank, the BRICS Policy Center, agrees with this viewpoint. \\"In a way, what we are seeing are investments that otherwise do not take place,\\" he said. \\"The World Cup has been a kind of catalyst for this.\\" \\"The government did not take money from health or transportation to invest in stadiums. Investments in public health and transportation will go on and on.\\" Esteves is quick to add, however, that this doesn't mean public grievances are without merit, and believes the World Cup has created a platform for groups and people dissatisfied with how Brazil is developing as to unite and make their voices heard. In recent weeks teachers, metro workers and bus drivers have gone on strike demanding better pay and conditions. Others have taken to the streets to campaign for better housing. Rather than highlighting the negatives of hosting a football tournament, these protests \\"are really talking about the other side of economic modernization in Brazil,\\" Esteves said. \\"The World Cup is not a target per se but it is an opportunity to vocalize and make stronger ... claims for strengthening the process around political and social inclusion.\\" However, Mattar and others in protest movements maintain their opposition to the World Cup is based on principled rejection of spending decisions tied to what they regard as an elitist, closed event. Yet, with billions of dollars already spent and the tournament about to start, they are realistic about what opposition can now achieve. Still, Mattar hopes the anger felt by many Brazilians will reach the watching world and provide lessons for future hosts of big sporting events, including the next two World Cup host countries. \\"We hope our legacy will be to show to people in Russia, Qatar and maybe in other places that these events and the way they are organized (make it) impossible they will bring any benefits,\\" Mattar said.

Process:  - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a weaker coffee filter is used happens, how will it affect MORE coffee being made.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If a weaker coffee filter is used, it may affect the process of making more coffee both directly and indirectly.  Direct effect: The weaker filter could potentially tear or break due to the weight or pressure of the coffee grounds, causing the grounds to mix with the water and yielding a lower quality coffee. In such cases, the coffee-making process might need to be repeated, which will affect the overall quantity and speed of coffee production. Indirect effect: A weaker filter might not hold the coffee grounds as effectively as a stronger one, leading to some grounds escaping into the brewed coffee. As a result, coffee produced could be slightly more bitter or have an inconsistent taste. This may cause dissatisfaction to the consumer, and they might request another cup of coffee made with a better filter, thus affecting the overall quantity of coffee being made. In summary, the perturbation of using a weaker coffee filter can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of making more coffee, impacting the quality and quantity of the final product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Calculate the possible outcomes There are a total of 6 faces on each die, so when throwing two dice, we have 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. Step 3: Determine the totals List all the possible combinations and their respective totals when throwing two dice: (1,1) = 2 (1,2) = 3 (1,3) = 4 (1,4) = 5 (1,5) = 6 (1,6) = 7 (2,1) = 3 (2,2) = 4 (2,3) = 5 (2,4) = 6 (2,5) = 7 (2,6) = 8 (3,1) = 4 (3,2) = 5 (3,3) = 6 (3,4) = 7 (3,5) = 8 (3,6) = 9 (4,1) = 5 (4,2) = 6 (4,3) = 7 (4,4) = 8 (4,5) = 9 (4,6) = 10 (5,1) = 6 (5,2) = 7 (5,3) = 8 (5,4) = 9 (5,5) = 10 (5,6) = 11 (6,1) = 7 (6,2) = 8 (6,3) = 9 (6,4) = 10 (6,5) = 11 (6,6) = 12 Step 4: Count the occurrences of the totals Now, we count the number of times each total appears: Total:   Frequency: 2\\t          1 3\\t          2 4\\t          3 5\\t          4 6\\t          5 7\\t          6 8\\t          5 9\\t          4 10         3 11         2 12         1 Step 5: Identify the most likely total From the frequency count, the most likely total is the one with the highest number of occurrences.

Science/Tech;","output":"This topic is related to (c). Business. The statement by US Treasury Secretary John Snow regarding his support for a \\"strong dollar\\" refers to a belief in allowing market forces to determine the value of the US dollar, as well as advocating for a strong currency value when considering US economic policy. Discussing the matter in Dublin during his tour of Europe, his perspective on the topic has implications for global financial markets and international economic relations. The value of a currency is primarily determined by market supply and demand, which in turn are influenced by various factors, such as interest rates, economic indicators, and political events. Adhering to a policy of allowing market forces to determine the value of the dollar is an approach often adopted by governments that prefer not to actively intervene in currency markets. This can provide a more transparent and competitive environment for international trade and investment. A strong dollar policy, on the other hand, involves advocating for a healthy, stable, and robust value for the US currency. A strong dollar can have numerous economic benefits, such as encouraging foreign investment, reducing inflationary pressures, and promoting global confidence in the US economy. However, it can also have negative effects, such as making US exports more expensive and less competitive in international markets. One reason for John Snow's adherence to a strong dollar policy can be linked to his desire to position the US as a stable global economic power that inspires investor confidence. By supporting a strong dollar, he is signaling the US government's commitment to maintaining a healthy, sustainable, and growth-oriented economy. At the same time, Snow's belief in allowing market forces to determine the value of the dollar helps to demonstrate his confidence in the efficiency and wisdom of financial markets. Free market principles and the concept of laissez-faire, or non-interventionism by governments, are often viewed as central planks in modern economic liberalism. However, this reliance on market forces also has its critics. Some argue that, in times of economic turmoil or uncertainty, government intervention may be necessary to stabilize and protect the national currency from speculative attacks that may negatively impact the real economy. In summary, US Treasury Secretary John Snow's comments in Dublin support both a \\"strong dollar\\" policy and allowing market forces to guide the value of the US dollar. This topic falls under the category of (c). Business, as it involves the exchange rate policy of the United States, its potential effects on global financial markets and international trade, and aligns with broader debates in economic policy about the appropriate role of government in currency markets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.  Question: \\"What are two ways in which the body cools down?\\" Answer: \\"Sweat glands and blood vessels\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, this answer is correct. The two ways in which the body cools down are through the evaporation of sweat produced by sweat glands and the dilation (widening) of blood vessels in the skin to increase blood flow and radiate heat from the surface of the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Taking the kids to the zoo was fun for Elena but not Patricia because  Choices:  --Elena did not love animals..  --Patricia did not love animals..","output":"In order to understand which choice best fits to complete the sentence provided, I will analyze the sentence and its context. I will consider the clues given and the coherence of the meaning. Step 1: Analyzing the sentence The sentence states that taking the kids to the zoo was fun for Elena, but not for Patricia. The contrast between Elena enjoying the zoo while Patricia didn't suggests that the reason for Patricia's lack of enjoyment should be added to complete the sentence. Step 2: Considering the choices 1. --Elena did not love animals. 2. --Patricia did not love animals. Step 3: Determining coherence with the sentence and remaining consistent with the contrast between Elena and Patricia Choice 1 states that Elena did not love animals. This contradicts the initial given information that taking the kids to the zoo was fun for Elena. Given the contradiction, this choice does not logically complete the sentence. Choice 2 states that Patricia did not love animals. This choice is coherent with the original sentence because it provides a reason for Patricia not having fun at the zoo. This choice maintains the contrast between Elena's enjoyment and Patricia's lack of enjoyment while visiting the zoo.

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was born in 1947 in Imam Sahib District of the Kunduz province, northern Afghanistan, a member of the Kharoti tribe of the Ghilji Pashtun. His father, Ghulam Qader, who migrated to Kunduz, is originally from the center of Ghazni province. Afghan businessman and Kharoti tribal leader Gholam Serwar Nasher deemed Hekmatyar to be a bright young man and sent him to the Mahtab Qala military academy in 1968, but he was expelled due to his political views two years later. From 1970 to 1972, Hekmatyar attended Kabul University's engineering department. A highly controversial commander, Hekmatyar has been dubbed the \\"Butcher of Kabul\\", accused of being responsible for the destruction and civilian deaths Kabul experienced in the early 1990s.  According to the U.S. Special Envoy to Afghanistan in 1989-1992, Peter Tomsen, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was hired in 1990 by the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to conquer and rule Afghanistan in the benefit of Pakistani interests, which plan was delayed until 1992 due to US pressure to cancel that plan.  In April 1992, as the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan began to collapse, government officials joined the mujahideen, choosing different parties according to their ethnic and political affinities. For the most part, the members of the khalq faction of the PDPA, who were predominantly Pashtuns, joined with Hekmatyar. With their help, he began on 24 April to infiltrate troops into Kabul, and announced that he had seized the city, and that should any other leaders try to fly into Kabul, he would shoot their plane down. The new leader of the \\"Islamic Interim Government of Afghanistan\\", Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, appointed Ahmad Shah Massoud as defense minister, and urged him to take action. This he did, taking the offensive on 25 April, and after two days heavy fighting, the Hezb-i Islami and its allies were expelled from Kabul. A peace agreement was signed with Massoud on 25 May 1992, which made Hekmatyar Prime Minister. However, the agreement fell apart when he was blamed for a rocket attack on President Mojaddedi's plane. The following day, fighting resumed between Burhanuddin Rabbani's and Ahmed Shah Massoud's Jamiat, Abdul Rashid Dostum's Jumbish forces and Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami forces.  From 1992 to 1996, the warring factions destroyed most of Kabul and killed thousands of people, most of them civilians, during the Afghan civil war. All the different parties participated in the destruction, but Hekmatyar's group was responsible for most of the damage, because of his practice of deliberately targeting civilian areas. Hekmatyar is thought to have bombarded Kabul in retaliation for what he considered its inhabitants' collaboration with the Soviets, and out of religious conviction. He once told a New York Times journalist that Afghanistan \\"already had one and a half million martyrs. We are ready to offer as many to establish a true Islamic Republic.\\" His attacks also had a political objective: to undermine the Rabbani government by proving that Rabbani and Massoud were unable to protect the population. In 1994 Hekmatyar would shift alliances, joining with Dostum as well as Hizb-e-Wahdat, a Hazara Shi'a party, to form the Shura-i Hamahangi (\\"Council of coordination\\"). Together they laid Siege of Kabul, unleashing massive barrages of artillery and rockets that led to the evacuation of U.N. personnel from Kabul, and caused several government members to abandon their posts. However the new alliance did not spell victory for Hekmatyar, and in June 1994, Massoud had driven Dostum's troops from the capital. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What roles did the different parties play?","output":"Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was a man from Afghanistan who was born a long time ago in 1947. He became the leader of a group called Hezb-i Islami. Hekmatyar and his group were involved in a big fight with other groups in Afghanistan during the 1990s. This big fight was called the Afghan civil war. In this fight, different groups had different roles. Hekmatyar's group, Hezb-i Islami, was responsible for a lot of destruction in the city of Kabul. They would attack places where people lived, making life very hard for the people there. Hekmatyar wanted to show that the other leaders, like Rabbani and Massoud, couldn't protect the people. Other groups in the fight were Rabbani's and Massoud's Jamiat, Dostum's Jumbish, and a group called Hizb-e-Wahdat. They all fought against each other, trying to gain control of Afghanistan. At some point, Hekmatyar even joined forces with Dostum and Hizb-e-Wahdat, but they still didn't win. Massoud and his group managed to push them out of Kabul. So, the different parties in the Afghan civil war each had their roles and fought against each other to try and take control of the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The first aircraft to use the ski jump ramp was the British Aerospace Sea Harrier. It is a STOVL (Short Take Off and Vertical Landing) aircraft that was initially operated by the Royal Navy. The ski jump ramp was developed to assist STOVL aircraft like the Sea Harrier to take off at much higher weights than possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. The concept of the ski jump ramp was introduced and tested by the Royal Navy in the late 1970s, with the first successful trials taking place on the HMS Invincible in 1977. The ramps quickly became standard features on British Invincible-class aircraft carriers, and since then, have been adopted by many other navies for their smaller carriers to enhance the capabilities of STOVL aircraft.

When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus.

The Brain, a gangster with multiple girlfriends, is accompanied by a gambler named Regret (after the only horse he ever placed a winning bet) and an outsider who (with his bloodhounds) is being treated to a meal. Feet Samuels (so named because of his big feet) is in love with a showgirl named Hortense Hathaway, who is tossed out of the diner because of an unsavory reputation. Feet plans to have one wild night before committing suicide, having sold his body in advance to a medical doctor. Harriet MacKyle, a sheltered but friendly socialite, makes arrangements with a smooth-talking fixer for a big party that night at her estate, where many of the players will later attend. She has an interest in the exciting but dangerous criminal element. A girl selling flowers comes in after Feet makes a full payment of a debt to the Brain, so the Brain offers 5 for a 5-cent flower, telling her to keep the change. But before he can leave, a hitman for the Brooklyn Mob stabs him.  The wounded Brain tells his men to take him \\"home.\\" Unfortunately, his many girlfriends refuse to allow him in for various reasons. Feet gets involved in a high-stakes craps game.

School children in China and Japan begin to learn English at an early age. English is the official language of more than seventy-five countries including Britain, Canada, the United States and Australia. Many different languages are spoken in some countries.

Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Q: In visual planning (VP), an agent learns to plan goal-directed behavior from observations of a dynamical system obtained offline, e.g., images obtained from self-supervised robot interaction. VP algorithms essentially combine data-driven perception and planning, and are important for robotic manipulation and navigation domains, among others. A recent and promising approach to VP is the semi-parametric topological memory (SPTM) method, where image samples are treated as nodes in a graph, and the connectivity in the graph is learned using deep image classification. Thus, the learned graph represents the topological connectivity of the data, and planning can be performed using conventional graph search methods. However, training SPTM necessitates a suitable loss function for the connectivity classifier, which requires non-trivial manual tuning. More importantly, SPTM is constricted in its ability to generalize to changes in the domain, as its graph is constructed from direct observations and thus requires collecting new samples for planning. In this paper, we propose Hallucinative Topological Memory (HTM), which overcomes these shortcomings. In HTM, instead of training a discriminative classifier we train an energy function using contrastive predictive coding. In addition, we learn a conditional VAE model that generates samples given a context image of the domain, and use these hallucinated samples for building the connectivity graph, allowing for zero-shot generalization to domain changes. In simulated domains, HTM outperforms conventional SPTM and visual foresight methods in terms of both plan quality and success in long-horizon planning. A:","output":"Hallucinative Topological Memory (HTM) improves visual planning by using an energy function and a conditional VAE model to generate samples for building the connectivity graph, enabling zero-shot generalization and better performance in long-horizon planning."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

He had no direction in his life.","output":"While the word \\"direction\\" is used in both sentences, it carries different meanings and connotations in each context.  1. In the first sentence, \\"Keep going in the same direction,\\" the word \\"direction\\" refers to a physical or geographical orientation –typically indicating the path or course that a person or object should follow to reach a specific destination or goal. This usage of \\"direction\\" is quite literal, and it likely pertains to navigation or spatial movement. In this context, \\"direction\\" may be further specified using cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) or instructions for turning (left, right, straight ahead). 2. In the second sentence, \\"He had no direction in his life,\\" the word \\"direction\\" is used in a figurative and more abstract manner. Here, it signifies purpose, motivation, or a clear sense of one's goals and aspirations. When someone is said to have \\"no direction\\" in their life, it indicates that they are aimless or uncertain about what they want to achieve in the future; they may be drifting through life without a clear plan or not making progress toward a fulfilling vocation or accomplishment. This use of \\"direction\\" is more metaphorical and conveys a state of being or mindset, rather than a physical or locational attribute. In conclusion, while the word \\"direction\\" appears in both sentences, its meaning and usage vary significantly based on the context. In the first sentence, \\"direction\\" pertains to a concrete, spatial interpretation, whereas, in the second sentence, it denotes an abstract, psychological concept.

An ideal gas would have a value of 1 for that ratio at all temperatures and pressures and the graph would simply be a horizontal line. As can be seen, deviations from an ideal gas occur. As the pressure begins to rise, the attractive forces cause the volume of the gas to be less than expected and the value of drops under 1. Continued pressure increase results in the volume of the particles to become significant and the value of rises to greater than 1. Notice, that the magnitude of the deviations from ideality is greatest for the gas at 200 K and least for the gas at 1000 K. Answer:","output":"Increasing the pressure will initially cause the expected volume to be less, as the paragraph states that \\"as the pressure begins to rise, the attractive forces cause the volume of the gas to be less than expected and the value of drops under 1.\\" However, with continued pressure increase, the volume of the particles will become significant, causing the value of to rise to greater than 1, and the expected volume will be more than it would be for an ideal gas. It is also important to note that the deviations from ideality are greatest for the gas at 200 K and least for the gas at 1000 K."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: What style of commercial vehicle body, incorporating an enclosed box body extended over the cab, takes its name from the town in Bedfordshire where the Bedford commercial vehicle plant was located?","output":"The style of commercial vehicle body you are referring to is known as the Luton body or Luton van. This particular style of vehicle is named after the town of Luton in Bedfordshire, England. Luton is synonymous with the commercial vehicle industry mainly because it was home to the Bedford commercial vehicle plant, which was operated by Vauxhall Motors. The plant produced various types of commercial vehicles, including the Luton-style van, which eventually took its name from the town. The Luton van features an enclosed box body that extends over the cab area, creating a distinctive \\"peak\\" known as the \\"Luton peak\\" or \\"kick.\\" This additional space above the cab is specifically designed to maximize the vehicle's storage capacity, making it a popular choice for various industries, particularly in the freight, removals, and logistics sectors. The Luton van format allows businesses to transport larger volumes of goods in a single trip, thereby improving efficiency and reducing overall transportation costs. Luton vans typically come in two distinct styles – the standard Luton van and the Luton box van. The main difference between the two lies in their construction and overall size. While both vans have the distinctive Luton peak, the standard Luton van is built by attaching the box body to a chassis cab, whereas the Luton box van is constructed using more rigid and robust materials, such as a GRP (Glass Reinforced Plastic) or fiberglass body, and often offers a greater overall volume for storage. Other key features of Luton vans include: 1. Versatility: Luton vans can be easily customized to suit various needs, with optional shelving, storage systems, and tail lifts tailored to fit the specific requirements of a business. 2. Weight capacities: These vans come in a range of sizes and weight capacities, typically spanning from 3.5 to 7.5 tonnes. This means that there is a Luton van suitable for various types of cargo and business demands across different industries. 3. Accessibility: Luton vans typically have large rear doors, often equipped with tail lifts or ramps, which makes loading and unloading heavy or bulky goods more manageable. 4. Internal height: The internal height of a Luton van is generally greater than that of a standard panel van, which makes it an ideal choice for transporting tall or bulky items. 5. Fuel efficiency: Thanks to their boxy design and lightweight construction materials, Luton vans are often more fuel-efficient than traditional panel vans. In summary, the Luton van is a popular type of commercial vehicle body, characterized by its enclosed box body extended over the cab area. This distinct design not only provides additional storage space but also offers numerous practical advantages for various industries. Originating from the town of Luton, Bedfordshire, which was home to the renowned Bedford commercial vehicle plant, the Luton van remains a symbol of the area's legacy and its contribution to the growth and development of the commercial vehicle industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is \\"He subsequently took back the annexed Caucasian territories which were divided among the Ottoman and Russian authorities by the ongoing chaos in Iran.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, this statement is generally correct. Nader Shah was a prominent Persian ruler who ruled from 1736 to 1747. During his reign, he took back several territories that were annexed by the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire.  To provide more detail, Nader Shah's rise to power came after a period of political instability in Iran, which was weakened and fractured by internal strife and external threats. The Safavid Empire had been diminished under the ineffective rule of Shah Sultan Husayn, who was eventually overthrown by an Afghan invasion in 1722. As a result, several nations took advantage of Persia's weakened state. The Ottoman Empire occupied western and northwestern regions of Persia, including significant historical provinces and cities, such as Azerbaijan, Kermanshah, and Hamadan. The Russian Empire, meanwhile, expanded its influence in the Caucuses and the Caspian Sea region during the Iran crisis of 1722–1723. The Treaty of Constantinople between the Ottoman Empire and Russia in 1724 resulted in further divisions of Persian lands between the two empires, with the Ottomans controlling the Caucasus region and Russia occupying the territories around the Caspian Sea. When Nader Shah seized power in 1736 after a series of military campaigns, he sought to restore Persian territories and pride. He began by retaking Azerbaijan from the Ottomans in 1735, a conquest that eventually led to the signing of the Treaty of Ganja with the recapture of Dagestan, eastern Georgia, and Armenia. This treaty, signed in 1735, confirmed Persia's control over these territories. Next, Nader Shah turned his attention to the Russian-controlled lands in the north. After unsuccessful diplomatic negotiations with the Russians, Nader Shah launched military campaigns against them in 1739. This resulted in the capture of important territories in the Caspian Sea region, such as Derbent, Rasht, and Baku.  Finally, Nader Shah's Persian forces managed to reestablish control over the lost Persian territories. The Treaty of Resht, signed on January 21, 1732, and the Treaty of Ganja, signed on September 10, 1735, formalized the return of these territories to Persia from the Ottomans and Russians, respectively. These events marked a significant resurgence of Persian power under Nader Shah's rule and highlighted his efforts to reclaim Iran's rightful territories that had been lost during the country's chaotic and vulnerable periods."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1642, Güshi Khan, founder of the Khoshut Khanate, overthrew the prince of Tsang and made the 5th Dalai Lama the highest spiritual and political authority in Tibet, establishing the regime known as Ganden Phodrang. Tsewang Rabtan invaded Tibet in 1717, deposed the pretender to the position of Dalai Lama of Lha-bzang Khan, the last ruler of the Khoshut Khanate, and killed Lha-bzang Khan and his entire family. They also viciously destroyed a small force in the Battle of the Salween River which the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty had sent to clear traditional trade routes in 1718. In response, an expedition sent by Kangxi Emperor, together with Tibetan forces under Polhané Sönam Topgyé of Tsang and Kangchennas , the governor of Western Tibet, expelled the Dzungars from Tibet in 1720. This began the Qing rule of Tibet, which lasted until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912.

Negative: Title: \\"A Hazy Disappointment\\" A Hazy Disappointment began with much promise, boasting an alluring premise and star-studded cast. Regrettably, it failed to capitalize on its potential, resulting in a painfully unengaging and forgettable cinematic experience. The storyline revolves around a group of talented scientists who embark on a groundbreaking experiment to unlock the secrets of human memory. Unfortunately, the plot quickly unravels into a haphazard accumulation of poorly conceived subplots, leaving the audience with a general sense of confusion and disappointment. Contrived twists and underdeveloped characters plague the narrative, making it easy to question the intentions of the filmmakers. Speaking of characters, the talented actors are sorely underutilized. Their remarkable skills are obscured by shallow character development and implausible dialogue, making it impossible for the audience to establish any emotional connection with the protagonists. Moreover, their performances are encumbered by a lack of chemistry, further hindering the movie's overall appeal. Visually, A Hazy Disappointment is no saving grace either. While the creative concept of the film suggested a great potential for stunning visuals and intriguing cinematic moments, the final product does little to inspire awe or wonder. The cinematography is bland and uninspired, and the special effects range from passable to embarrassingly outdated. A glaring issue that defies the otherwise brilliant score is its thorough mismatch with what unfolds on screen. At times it can be more of a distraction rather than an enhancement to the story. The discordant audio makes a feeble attempt to invoke emotions that the narrative cannot cultivate, further amplifying the disappointment. In conclusion, A Hazy Disappointment squanders its intriguing concept and Academy Award-winning cast on a convoluted, ill-conceived narrative. A film that could have been a powerful exploration of themes such as memory, identity, and human connection, instead succumbs to clichéd tropes and superficial storytelling. Ultimately, A Hazy Disappointment joins the long list of forgettable films that leave viewers pondering what might have been if only the potential had been properly harnessed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"After analyzing the given review, the chances of buying the product would likely decrease due to several concerns mentioned by the reviewer. Here is a detailed breakdown of the factors that contribute to this decreased likelihood: 1. Ineffective cooling capacity: The reviewer mentions that the product couldn't adequately cool an 11x12 room with high ceilings, even though it is stated to have a higher BTU rating compared to their window A/C unit that performs well under the same conditions. This indicates that the product may not be as efficient or effective as advertised, which could lead to unsatisfactory results in maintaining optimal room temperature. 2. Excessive noise from the fan: The loudness of the fan is another issue highlighted in the review. A noisy fan could be a significant disturbance, particularly in a residential setting where people value peace and quiet. This could create discomfort and possibly affect sleep and relaxation, making it an undesirable feature for a potential buyer. 3. Positive customer support experience: Despite the negative aspects of the product, the reviewer mentions that the customer support was great. While this is a benefit, it is important to note that it doesn't outweigh the product's performance issues. Ideally, customers shouldn't have to rely on customer support for a product that meets their expectations in the first place. 4. Overall negative recommendation: The review title and content strongly advise against purchasing the product. With phrases like \\"Bomb! Avoid it!\\" and \\"ROTTEN product,\\" the reviewer clearly demonstrates their dissatisfaction and emphasizes that others should steer clear of the item. In conclusion, the mentioned review will significantly decrease the chances of buying the product due to the emphasized negative aspects, overshadowing any positive experience with customer support.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

But a senior adviser has suggested that the door was being left open for a future review of its status.

Neil Carmichael said ministers had \\"brushed over\\" MPs' proposals. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said PSHE lessons were important but \\"not yet good enough in many schools\\". The select committee had called for a message from ministers that the subject would be made compulsory. The education secretary said: \\"In the coming months I intend to look at all the options to ensure PSHE is taught well everywhere.\\" The subject teaches a wide range of topics related to keeping pupils safe and healthy, including issues such as: It is taught by most state schools, but it is not compulsory. The House of Commons Education Select Committee, in a report published before the general election, had warned of a \\"lack of clarity on the status of the subject\\". \\"This must change, and we accept the argument that statutory status is needed for PSHE, with sex and relationships education as a core part of it,\\" it said. The committee had said that the quality of lessons in the subject required improvement in 40% of schools - and that young people too often reported that the \\"sex and relationships education they receive is inadequate\\". \\"This situation would not be tolerated in other subjects,\\" said the committee's report. The education secretary's response emphasised the need to improve the standards of PSHE lessons, but did not indicate any decision to change its status. Mrs Morgan said PSHE and sex and relationships education were \\"essential to keeping pupils safe and healthy, inside and outside the school gates\\". \\"Young people today face unprecedented pressures posed by modern technology,\\" she said. \\"Good quality PSHE can provide them with the information they need to stay safe and build resilience against the risks of exploitation or radicalisation. \\"At its heart, good PSHE supports young people to make informed choices.\\" Education Select Committee chairman Mr Carmichael said the response was \\"disappointing\\". \\"Ministers entirely sidestep the call made by MPs in the closing months of the last Parliament to give statutory status to PSHE,\\" he said. \\"It is unclear why it should have taken the government so long to publish such a feeble response. \\"The inquiry found the government's strategy for improving PSHE and sex and relationships education in schools to be weak. \\"Yet there is nothing in this response to reassure Parliament - or young people - that the situation will now improve.\\" But the Family Education Trust has spoken out against the idea of PSHE being made compulsory, arguing it would weaken the sense of parents having prime responsibility for keeping their children safe and healthy. \\"The more that schools take responsibility to themselves for these areas, the less that parents will see them as their responsibility,\\" said director Norman Wells.

Negative Movie Review: Title: \\"Disenchanted Dreams\\" Disenchanted Dreams had the potential to be a captivating story exploring the role of reality and dreams, but it fell catastrophically short in execution. Despite the promising premise, the film suffered from glaring issues in pacing, character development, and special effects. Step 1: Address the pacing issues Firstly, the pacing of the movie was uneven and disjointed, which made it difficult for the audience to stay engaged in the narrative. Long stretches of the film were filled with slow, uneventful scenes that did little to propel the story. The transitions between events felt abrupt, and the climax arrived without any buildup, leaving the viewers underwhelmed and unsatisfied. Step 2: Discuss character development The lack of character development was another major drawback. The protagonist, played by renowned actor Dylan Farrington, appeared one-dimensional and failed to invoke any sympathy for his plight. The supporting characters were equally bland, their motivations and relationships with the protagonist poorly defined, which left the audience uninvested in their fates. Step 3: Comment on special effects Furthermore, the film's heavy reliance on special effects to create the dream worlds was a major misstep. The visuals were unconvincing, at times even laughable, and ultimately served as a distraction rather than an enhancement to the story. This was disappointing given the film's ambitious concept and the opportunities that it presented for creative visual storytelling. Step 4: Offer final thoughts In conclusion, Disenchanted Dreams squandered its intriguing premise with poor pacing, lackluster character development, and subpar special effects. What could have been a thought-provoking exploration of dreams and reality was marred by its execution, leaving the audience feeling disenchanted."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But in the town of Ayn Issa, barely 35 miles (56km) north of the front lines, they are already looking at a future post-caliphate. On Wednesday, Brett McGurk, the US envoy to the coalition fighting the group that calls itself Islamic State (IS), arrived at the headquarters of the Raqqa Civilian Council to meet local leaders-in-waiting. \\"There are tremendous challenges ahead,\\" he said. \\"The United States is committed to defeating Daesh [IS]. That's why we're here. And we want to make sure that what comes after Daesh is stable. \\"And if you look at the record to date, coalition-backed operations in Iraq and Syria have cleared out about 60,000 sq km of territory. We've liberated over four million people.\\" Mr McGurk's presence in Ayn Issa is part of a growing engagement from the US, which is backing the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of Arab and Kurdish fighters leading the assault on Raqqa. As they advance into the city, families are fleeing. Many end up in a camp on the outskirts of Ayn Issa. Their futures look as uncertain as the future of Syria itself after more than six years of war. The people now staying in tents until recently lived under the harsh rule of IS. For some, even the heat and the dust feel like respite. But not all the inhabitants of the Ayn Issa camp were in the caliphate against their will. One corner of the camp is reserved for the wives and children of IS fighters. Perhaps not surprisingly, these people are not popular. Nour left Lebanon for Raqqa two years ago to join her husband, a jihadi. When he was killed, she married a Tunisian. And so she joined the ranks of a relatively privileged group: the wives of foreign fighters. She still seems to have little sympathy for the treatment of the thousands of Yazidi sex slaves at the hands of their IS captors. \\"There was a lot of tension between the wives and the sex slaves,\\" she said. \\"Some of the wives even divorced their husbands because of that. They were spending too much on the sex slaves, buying them the best makeup, clothes and accessories. \\"My first husband had an app on his phone. It was a market for sex slaves. They were sharing photos of the sex slaves with the best makeup and clothes, and asking 2,000 [Â£1,538] for this one, 3,000 for that one. A virgin cost 10,000.\\" The caliphate may be crumbling but the IS mentality persists. If the self-declared capital of IS falls, it will be in large part thanks to the support for the SDF from US forces and their international allies, including Britain. A US military transport plane touches down on a dirt runway carved discreetly into a hillside. This is the main logistics hub for the American effort in northern Syria. From this base, they support their own forces and arm the SDF. The US has been reluctant to publicise its presence in Syria. Their troops number in the hundreds. They will not say exactly how many. Their special forces are involved in fighting on the ground while their planes are bombing Raqqa from the sky. UN war crimes investigators warned earlier this month of \\"staggering loss of life\\", with hundreds of civilians killed since March, as coalition air strikes and artillery support the Kurdish-led offensive on the city. Lt Gen Stephen Townsend, the overall commander of the international coalition against IS in Iraq and Syria, rejected the charge that the US was taking insufficient care in its bombardment. \\"I would challenge anyone to find a more precise and careful campaign in the history of warfare on this planet,\\" he told the BBC. \\"I think we are being as careful as we need to be and as we can be, and I would challenge the individual from the UN who made this hyperbolic statement that civilian casualties are staggering. Show me some evidence of that.\\" The American logistics hub in northern Syria is one of a number of US bases in the area. Much of the infrastructure has been put in place in the last six months. Getting in is often easier that getting out, as the US military discovered in Afghanistan and Iraq. Syria may be no exception. \\"ISIS [IS] is certainly not defeated when Mosul is liberated or Raqqa is liberated,\\" says Lt Gen Townsend. \\"There is a lot of hard work left to do. Mosul and Raqqa are intermediate objectives on a path to a final victory.\\" What that final victory might look like is unclear. The end of the caliphate will not mean the end of the war in Syria. Earlier this month, a US fighter jet shot down a warplane belonging to the Russian-backed regime in Damascus. For now, Washington and Moscow share a common enemy. But once IS is gone, two big powers will be left backing different sides in an unfinished war. The potential for confrontation is real. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the ongoing efforts to defeat ISIS and the challenges that lie ahead in a post-caliphate future. The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of Arab and Kurdish fighters, are leading the assault on Raqqa, ISIS' stronghold in Syria.

The article also highlights the presence of US and international forces involved in the military effort against ISIS, such as American special forces on the ground and planes bombing Raqqa from the sky. While the immediate focus is on defeating ISIS in Raqqa and Mosul, the article reminds that the end of the caliphate will not mark the end of the war in Syria.

Write a title for this article: There was never much doubt that Pedro Martinez relished the idea of intimidating Yankee hitters and plunking them when he felt like it. On Wednesday he admitted the one guy with whom he considered it personal was Jorge Posada. On Wednesday’s Daily News Live, Martinez made it clear that he still holds a grudge against Posada, claiming the ex-Yankee catcher carried their running feud too far at one point by insulting the Red Sox pitcher’s mother. “Between Latinos you don’t mention anybody’s mother,” Pedro said. “And I never forgot that one. To this day.” Martinez was on the TV show with fellow newly elected Hall of Famers John Smoltz, Randy Johnson and Craig Biggio. When Daily News Live host Jonas Schwartz asked Martinez lightheartedly if he had a Yankee he preferred hitting the most, Martinez didn’t hesitate: When Schwartz asked why, Martinez said, “Because Jorge always seemed to have a bad attitude toward me.” Under further questioning Pedro admitted to making fun of Posada’s ears at times, saying, “I call him Dumbo, but that’s no reason for him to want to kill me.” Martinez, who hit Posada only once during his career, then seemed to change course, saying he never tried to hit Posada intentionally. Yet he said the bad blood came to a head during the Yankees-Red Sox 2003 post-season brawl, during which Martinez famously threw 72-year-old coach Don Zimmer to the ground. “Believe it or not we competed cleanly, I never tried to hit him or do anything,” Martinez said of Posada. “It was just competing. But he was always mad at me for some reason. “Then he let it go a little bit too far with the Zimmer incident. Between Latinos you don’t mention anybody’s mother. I did not appreciate that. I know it was in the heat of the situation, but that’s sensitive to Latino players.” Martinez wasn’t clear if Posada’s insult helped ignite the brawl or was delivered after Zimmer had charged Pedro and wound up on the ground. In any case, the Yankees were furious at Martinez that day when they felt he intentionally drilled Karim Garcia in the upper back. Posada was seen gesturing angrily from the dugout toward Martinez, and soon after the dugouts emptied when Manny Ramirez took exception to a high pitch from Roger Clemens. In 2013 Martinez told reporters that 90% of the batters he plunked during his career were hit intentionally, but he insisted he wasn’t trying to hit Garcia. Former Red Sox first baseman Kevin Millar, however, told the Daily News last year that Martinez hit Alfonso Soriano and Derek Jeter back-to-back in another famous incident intentionally in retaliation for Clemens plunking Millar. “First pitch to Soriano —wham! Up near the neck,\\" Millar said. “Next batter, Jeter — wham! Up near the neck. Pedro later told me, ‘You tell Clemens, he hits one of mine, I take two of his.’” MOBILE USER?

Alfred, Lord Tennyson, was an acclaimed British poet and remains one of the most popular and well-known poets in the English language. He wrote a vast range of works, including \\"In Memoriam A.H.H.,\\" a requiem for his close friend Arthur Hallam, the dramatic monologue “Ulysses,” and the famous \\"Charge of the Light Brigade,\\" which honored the heroism of British soldiers during the Crimean War. Tennyson's work was often characterized by its deep emotional resonance, vivid imagery, and mastery of metrical forms. As Poet Laureate, Tennyson was responsible for composing verse for significant national events, such as the birthdays and coronations of British monarchs, military victories, and other occasions of national importance. He held the position until his death in 1892, a tenure of more than 40 years. During his time as Poet Laureate, Tennyson continued to be a prolific writer, and his work remained widely popular throughout his lifetime. Because of his immense influence and popularity as a poet, Tennyson was made a Baron by Queen Victoria in 1884, after he turned down a similar offer several years earlier. As a result, he became the first British poet to be honored with a peerage. Following his death, Tennyson was buried in Westminster Abbey's Poets' Corner, a testament to his lasting legacy in the literary world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Where startups really get (cash) crunched If startups are facing a cash crunch, it isn’t when they start up. Venture capitalists today are buzzing about a Wall Street Journal story about how Internet startups are facing a “cash crunch.” It’s mostly based on AngelList data (or not, see update below), plus venture fund-raising statistics from Dow Jones. I don’t dispute either of them, but believe they need to be viewed in a broader context. More importantly, I think the real story they tell was overlooked. First, overall venture capital activity is not decreasing. Official Q3 data won’t be released until later this week, but a preliminary look shows that U.S.-based companies raised less money than in Q2 but more than in Q1. And since third quarters are traditionally slow due to the vacation months of July and August, there doesn’t seem to be much news in the top-line numbers. Moreover, around 49% of completed U.S. venture deals in the past three months were for seed-stage or early-stage companies. For the past 12 months, the figure stands at 47%. The difference in dollars invested as a percentage of the whole was negligible (from 30.4% for past 3 months to 30.6% for past 12 months). AngelList data is an important metric, but it also reflects the biases of a relatively small — and arguably skewed — subset of venture investors. For example, the recent market volatility has likely knocked out a lot of angel tourists who had been allocating 10 or 15% of their assets to venture investing (denominators don’t only affect public pension funds). Institutional VCs, however, have not been similarly affected (and I include super-angels in this category). It certainly is true that fewer and fewer VC firms are raising money, but that trend has been in place for years and there is still plenty of dry powder. After all, the rise of super-angels is barely one year old. Moreover, many larger firms have launched seed-stage investing programs within the past 18 months — thus increasing the overall capital pool for nascent startups. Examples include New Enterprise Associates, Greylock and Menlo Ventures. Some folks discount these programs as cynical window-dressing, but money is money within this particular argument (and I happen to think most of the programs are legit). To me, the larger issue is capital availability beyond the seed-stage. I’m not talking about massive Series F rounds for Facebook or Groupon, but rather Series A or B deals in the 5 million to 25 million range. This is where I see a bit of capital gap. How many venture firms out there market themselves as Series B investors, first and foremost? Not many (it’s no surprise that First Round Capital hasn’t been copied by a Second Round Capital or Third Round Capital). For example, expansion-stage deals made up 28% of all U.S. venture deals completed in the past 12 months, and around 35% of the total invested capital. Five years ago those figures were 36% and 42%, respectively. How come? Because post-seed A or B rounds often carry the same risks as seed with less potential reward. It’s one thing for an existing seed investor to participate pro rata, but quite another for an outsider to join the party (unless success seems obvious, at which point the valuation will be sky-high). In fact, that’s a pretty good case for entrepreneurs to sign on with larger institutional VCs at the seed-stage, rather than trying to rely on angels who are one 400-point Dow loss away from being tapped out. I know some entrepreneurs don’t want to get “lost” in a larger firm, and appreciate the personal attention and networks of angels. And there certainly can be a happy mix of both. But, if you have to choose, the institution is far more valuable. If Web startups are hitting a cash crunch, it’s likely because they chose the wrong seed-stage investors (assuming they had a “choice”) and there aren’t enough mid-round institutions to help them out. Update: AngelList’s Naval Ravikant just tweeted the following: Sign up for my daily email newsletter on deals and deal-makers: GetTermSheet.com What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the current cash crunch situation that many startups are facing, focusing on the importance of looking at the broader context and examining trends in venture capital activity. Contrary to the widespread notion that venture capital activity is decreasing, the data shows that overall investment levels are not declining dramatically. Furthermore, the proportion of deals for seed-stage or early-stage companies remains consistent. However, the challenge lies in capital availability beyond the seed-stage, particularly in Series A or B deals that carry the same risks as seed-stage funding but with less potential reward. The article also highlights the potential for market volatility to impact angel investors, who may allocate a portion of their assets to venture investing. In contrast, institutional venture capitalists have not been similarly affected, suggesting that startups should focus on partnering with larger institutional VCs rather than relying solely on angels. This is because institutional investors are more stable and can provide valuable support to startups throughout their growth journey. The author argues that if web startups are experiencing a cash crunch, it could be because they have chosen the wrong seed-stage investors, and there are not enough mid-round institutions to provide support."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given the title of a story consisting of five sentences, numbered 1 through 5.

We stayed at TI and one evening after a long day of workshops and speeches, we wanted to just get something to eat downstairs at our hotel. We wandered around surveying our options. Unfortunately, we landed here because the boss was afraid to commit to any one particular genre of food and because she was afraid of not liking her food. Since she holds the company credit, we ate here.  It was gross. See Greg O.'s review for a good description of what the food and atmosphere are like. He is spot on - tired and shriveled up are the words to best describe this place.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1:  \\"Nothing--nothing at all, damn it!\\" Hanson told him. Sentence 2: Hanson did nothing. Nothing at all. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Understanding the two sentences you provided, we need to analyze whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence or not. Entailment refers to the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another. If Sentence 1 entails Sentence 2, then Sentence 2 must be true whenever Sentence 1 is true. Let's break down the two sentences: Sentence 1: \\"Nothing--nothing at all, damn it!\\" Hanson told him. In this sentence, Hanson is expressing frustration or annoyance while stating that he did nothing or nothing of consequence. Here, we have a quote of what Hanson said, which implies that this is a direct statement from him. Sentence 2: Hanson did nothing. Nothing at all. In this sentence, we are told straightforwardly that Hanson did nothing and that he did \\"nothing at all.\\" It is a simple description of the situation, without emotions or quotations. Now, let's determine if there is an entailment between the two sentences: Both sentences do convey the same basic information: that Hanson did nothing. However, the first sentence has an added layer of emotion (frustration or annoyance) which is not included in the second sentence. Additionally, the first sentence presents the information as a quote, so we know that Hanson himself said it, while the second sentence is a simple statement with no indication of its source. Because the second sentence lacks the emotional aspect and the direct quote from Hanson, it does not contain all of the information present in the first sentence. However, the basic information—that Hanson did nothing—is consistent between both sentences. In conclusion, the second sentence is not completely entailed by the first sentence due to the differences mentioned above, but it is partly entailed because their core information is the same. When considering just the actions of Hanson, which is the primary subject of the sentences, the second sentence would be regarded as entailed by the first sentence since both communicate that Hanson did nothing. However, when taking into account aspects like the quote and emotions present in the first sentence, the entailment is not complete."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Addscrollloaditem (' img _ 1eb168effe' )  Remove the nut and washer and discard the nut. Answer:","output":"After making sure that the wheel is free of any oil that could compromise its performance or the frame lining, the next most logical step would be to clean the surface of the rear hub center pulley. Use a dust cloth or a similar tool to clean the base sections properly. This is crucial in ensuring that the new hub bearing operates efficiently and lasts longer. Grime, road salt, and other particles can get lodged between the hub and the bearing, increasing wear and tear. Next, you will have to loosen the brake caliper so you can access the hub assembly. The brake caliper is fixed onto the wheel using a set of bolts attached to the back side of the caliper bracket. Using a tool, typically a socket wrench, carefully unscrew these bolts to free the brake caliper. Make sure to suspend the brake caliper in a manner that doesn't strain or damage the brake hose. Now it's time to remove the old hub bearing. Begin by removing the tailpipe from your rear light assembly. Depending on your vehicle's make, you may need a screwdriver to pry the tailpipe out. Be careful in this step, as you wouldn't want to damage the rear light assembly as it could affect your lights' functionality. After successfully removing the old hub bearing, it's time to set up the new one. It's recommended that you use a new nut when replacing the wheel bearing; they usually come packaged together. This new nut can help to ensure that the new bearing is secured properly. After the new bearing is placed and secure, carefully reassemble the wheel and tire assembly. Ensure all bolts and components have been put back correctly and are tightened adequately. Start your vehicle and give it a test to confirm if the replacement was successful. In summary, replacing a Ford Explorer's rear hub bearing involves few crucial steps: cleanup, dismantling, removing the old hub bearing, installing the new one, and reassembling the wheel mechanism. It's a somewhat complicated task that requires patience, precision, and the right tools, but with due diligence, it's doable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Unfortunately, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted my future occupation to be. The only thing I did know was that I did not want to spend the next 45 years teaching, being a nurse or sitting in an office. But that was before the postman delivered a catalogue   of courses that were being offered at the local college. As I looked through it, I was attracted by a page that talked about the difficulties faced by deaf people in their everyday lives and how students could help by learning sign language. It went on to say that graduates of the course usually find work in different organizations, such as law companies, the Stock Exchange, insurance companies and banks. Then I saw something that really caught my eye: \\"Singer\\" are also needed for sporting events, concerts, theatrical performances and, believe it or not, circuses! By the time I got to the bottom of the page, I knew I had found the perfect occupation. I enrolled   on the course, which to my parents' great delight was free of charge. The course was brilliant. My favourite part was the final lesson, when our teacher asked us to sign our favourite song.

The reviewer expresses strong discontent and dissatisfaction towards the movie they are discussing. The usage of words like \\"bad\\", \\"crappy\\", \\"idiot\\", \\"lame\\", \\"grotesque\\", \\"awful\\" and \\"waste\\" sets a negative tone and clearly articulates the reviewer's negative feelings. The review opens with the repetition of the word \\"bad,\\" constituting a profound negative sentiment at the outset. The description of the film as a \\"crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema\\" portrays the writer's belief that the film lacks intellectual and creative substance, is of substandard quality, and may not appeal to viewers who expect deeper content or more sophisticated humor, hence further emphasizing the negative sentiment. The reviewer strongly criticizes the casting and character development, particularly singling out the performances of Mike Myers and a Chinese actress who they feel did not contribute positively to the film. They also criticize the plot of the film which they describe as \\"lame\\" and filled with \\"dirty jokes\\", which they find unpleasant. This sentiment extends towards the future release mentioned, \\"Green-Eggs and Ham\\", where they express their skepticism and suspicion rather than excitement or anticipation. Moreover, they also express their concern that the film may ruin the legacy of the classic book it's based upon, indicating a sentiment of disappointment not only in the film but in its potential to negatively impact the perception of the original literary work. Their closing remark, \\"Don't waste time and money by seeing this\\" underscores their negative sentiment by advising potential viewers against watching the film. It is clear that the reviewer did not enjoy the film and feels strongly that it is not worth the time or investment, thereby conveying an overall negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Republicans escalated their charges against the Obama administration for alleged failures in handling last month’s Libya attack, thrusting the death of the U.S. ambassador there into the center of the presidential campaign Friday.      Mitt Romney accused his rival of “doubling down on denial” about the true origins of the Sept. 11 siege in Benghazi, which senior Obama officials initially said appeared to be an outgrowth of anti-American protests, not terrorism. Whether the administration has truthfully disclosed what it knew about the perpetrators of the attacks became a flash point in Thursday night’s debate, when Vice President Biden blamed the administration’s shifting explanations on U.S. intelligence agencies.      “There were more questions that came out last night because the vice president directly contradicted the testimony of State Department officials,” Romney told supporters Friday at a campaign event in Richmond. “American citizens have a right to know just what’s going on.”      Earlier in the week, State Department officials had said that they had not received reports of protests outside the compound before the killings. But Biden said the explanation that the attacks grew from a protest — rather than from terrorists determined to hit the consulate — persisted “because that’s exactly what we were told” by intelligence officials.      After trying for weeks to portray the deaths in Benghazi as part of a larger failure of Obama’s foreign policy, Republicans now sense their first real opening on national security, an area that has long been considered one of the president’s strengths. It was an unexpected twist that the administration seemed to grow more vulnerable following the debate between Biden, a veteran of global diplomacy and the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Ryan, a relative novice whose expertise is the domestic budget.      1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Romney on the campaign trail View Photos Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, buoyed by his performance in the Oct. 3 presidential debate, has been making more of a presence in Virginia this past week, speaking at a campaign rally in Richmond and elsewhere throughout the swing state.

Melina Mara/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.      Obama officials moved swiftly Friday to blunt further fallout, first during the White House briefing and later in a speech by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.      “There is nobody in the administration motivated by anything other than trying to understand what happened,” Clinton said. “We do not have all the answers. No one in this administration has ever claimed otherwise.”      In Thursday’s debate, Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan raised the possibility that the White House had blamed the attacks on anti-American protests at first because a successful terrorist attack would blemish Obama’s national security credentials. The successful killing of Osama bin Laden is a stock Obama campaign theme, and he frequently tells audiences that his administration has al-Qaeda “on its heels.”      “Look, if we are hit by terrorists, we’re going to call it for what it is — a terrorist attack,” Ryan said. Romney continued that theme Friday, telling voters at a campaign rally that he would investigate the varying accounts.      There are multiple investigations into the attack: an FBI probe into the deaths of the four Americans, an independent inquiry by a panel appointed by Clinton and at least two congressional probes.      As Republicans pounced on Biden’s remarks, White House press secretary Jay Carney and Clinton said Friday that there was no selective use of intelligence about the attacks.      “We have been very transparent about what we know,” Carney said. “As hours and days and weeks have passed by and more facts have come to light and more has been revealed through the investigations underway, that, you know, we have gained a clearer picture of what happened and what did not happen.”      Administration accounts have evolved because information about the attacks has evolved, Clinton said.      “We are providing the best information we have at that time and that information continues to be updated, it also continues to be put into context and more deeply understood through the process we are engaged in,” she said.      Another point of contention is whether the White House should have been alerted to requests by security officials for more manpower ahead of the Benghazi attack. Biden suggested on Thursday night that the security requests had not made their way back to Washington — a claim that was quickly contested.      Two former security officials testified before Congress this week that they had made requests for more manpower that were either ignored or rejected. Senior State Department officials acknowledged the requests but said there was no evidence that additional security would have prevented the attack. On Friday, administration officials clarified that what Biden said during the Thursday debate — that “we did not know they wanted more security” — meant only that the White House had not been informed of the threat by the State Department, not that no one in the administration had been informed.      “There was no actionable intelligence regarding the Benghazi facility” that could have been used to prevent the attack, Carney said, and continued questions about what the administration knew are “an effort here to politicize this, to turn this into an issue in the campaign.”      Carney and congressional Democrats have said some of the Republicans now criticizing embassy security had voted to cut the State Department’s security budget. Republicans counter that Democrats also voted for smaller security budgets.      In separate remarks Friday, Clinton repeatedly vowed to find out what happened and to do everything possible to protect diplomats in the field. But she said the business of diplomacy, like combat, involves a calculated risk.      “We will not retreat,” she said in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.      “We will never prevent every act of violence or terrorism, or achieve perfect security,” Clinton said. “Our people can’t live in bunkers and do their jobs. But it is our solemn responsibility to constantly improve, to reduce the risks our people face and make sure they have the resources they need to do their jobs.”      She spoke a day after a Yemeni security official at the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa was killed on his way to work.

In a pair of campaign rallies, the Republican presidential candidate and his running mate Paul Ryan took direct aim at Obama and his administration over allegations of mishandled security in Libya and contradictory statements issued afterward.      Text Size -      +      reset      “Yesterday I raised some questions about Benghazi and the tragedy that occurred there, and there are more questions that came out of last night because the vice president directly contradicted the sworn testimony of State Department officials,” Romney said at an afternoon campaign rally in Richmond, Va. “He’s doubling down on denial, and we need to understand exactly what happened. … American citizens have a right to know just what is going on and we’re going to find out.”      Ryan took up the mantle in Lancaster, Ohio. Speaking before a packed crowd Ryan said, “We’re talking about blame. First they blame a YouTube video and a nonexistent riot, then when the country is getting upset about it, they blame Romney-Ryan for getting people upset about it.”      “They keep changing their story. This is not what leadership looks like,” he added.      The push to emphasize Obama’s foreign policy and concerns in Libya comes a day after Vice President Joe Biden and Ryan faced off over the issue in their only debate of the campaign. The pair traded barbs on Libya after Ryan criticized the Obama administration’s lack of “leadership” in dealing with the issue. To which Biden responded that the claim was “a bunch of malarkey” and said that Republicans would cut embassy funding “300 million below what we asked for.”      The Obama administration has come under attack for security decisions it made in Benghazi and for not increasing security after State Department personnel reportedly asked for it.      The administration had originally blamed the attack on riots and downplayed any connections with terrorists, but has since backed away from those statements. ||||| WASHINGTON — In the weeks leading up to the attack last month on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, diplomats on the ground sounded increasingly urgent alarms. In a stream of diplomatic cables, embassy security officers warned their superiors at the State Department of a worsening threat from Islamic extremists, and requested that the teams of military personnel and State Department security guards who were already on duty be kept in service.      The requests were denied, but they were largely focused on extending the tours of security guards at the American Embassy in Tripoli — not at the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, 400 miles away. And State Department officials testified this week during a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that extending the tour of additional guards — a 16-member military security team — through mid-September would not have changed the bloody outcome because they were based in Tripoli, not Benghazi.      The handling of these requests has now been caught up in a sharply partisan debate over whether the Obama administration underestimated the terrorist threat in Libya. In a debate with Representative Paul D. Ryan on Thursday night, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said White House officials were not told about requests for any additional security. “We weren’t told they wanted more security again,” Mr. Biden said.      The Romney campaign on Friday pounced on the conflicting statements, accusing Mr. Biden of continuing to deny the nature of the attack. The White House scrambled to explain the apparent contradiction between Mr. Biden’s statement and the testimony from State Department officials at the House hearing.      The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said Friday that security issues related to diplomatic posts in Libya and other countries were dealt with at the State Department, not the White House. Based on interviews with administration officials, as well as in diplomatic cables, and Congressional testimony, those security decisions appear to have been made largely by midlevel State Department security officials, and did not involve Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or her top aides.      While it is unclear what impact a handful of highly trained additional guards might have had in Benghazi were they able to deploy there, some State Department officials said it would probably not have made any difference in blunting the Sept. 11 assault from several dozen heavily armed militants.      “An attack of that kind of lethality, we’re never going to have enough guns,” Patrick F. Kennedy, under secretary of state for management, said at Wednesday’s hearing. “We are not an armed camp ready to fight it out.”      A senior administration official said that the military team, which was authorized by a directive from Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, was never intended to have an open-ended or Libya-wide mission.      “This was not a SWAT team with a DC-3 on alert to jet them off to other cities in Libya to respond to security issues,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter.      Security in Benghazi had been a growing concern for American diplomats this year. In April, the convoy of the United Nations special envoy for Libya was attacked there. In early June, a two-vehicle convoy carrying the British ambassador came under attack by rocket-propelled grenades. Militants struck the American mission with a homemade bomb, but no one was hurt. In late June, the Red Cross was attacked and the organization pulled out.      “We were the last thing on their target list to remove from Benghazi,” Lt. Col. Andrew Wood of the Utah National Guard, who was deployed in Tripoli as the leader of the American military security unit, told the House committee.      But friends and colleagues of Ambassador Stevens said he was adamant about maintaining an American presence in Benghazi, the heart of the opposition to the Qaddafi government. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"This long article essentially revolves around the events surrounding the 2012 attacks on U.S. diplomatic compounds in Libya, particularly in Benghazi, and the political discussions and investigations that followed. The article begins by detailing the global protests ignited by an anti-Islam film, which started outside the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and extended as far as India. Over 50 people died across the world due to violence linked to this film, which was perceived as mocking Islam and Prophet Mohammed. The focus then shifts to the political arena in the United States, where Republicans accused the Obama administration of mishandling the Libya attack specifically in Benghazi, where U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed. This led to the issue of the events in Benghazi becoming central to the presidential campaign at the time. Mitt Romney, who was the Republican presidential nominee, accused President Obama of denial about the true motive of the Benghazi attack, which senior officials from Obama's administration initially ascribed to anti-American protests rather than terrorism. This led to the genesis of multiple investigations into the attack, including an FBI probe and a congressional probe. The Administration, particularly Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, defended their handling of the situation, arguing that their accounts evolved as better information became available. Biden suggested that the White House had not been informed of the need for increased security, a claim that was challenged and led to further political debate.  The article ends with descriptions of increasingly alarmed diplomatic cables sent pre-attack by U.S. diplomats in Libya, warning of a rising threat from Islamic extremists. Romney's campaign capitalized on the confusion between Biden's statements during a debate and the testimonies of State Department officials in a hearing, further politicizing the issue. There was a division in opinion on what impact a few more guards might have had on the situation in Benghazi, with some believing it would not have thwarted the lethal attack.    Across these developments, politicians, state officials, and diplomats grappled with contradictions, evolving narratives, and finger-pointing, all under the looming shadow of the Benghazi tragedy. The killings, and how they were handled, became a pivotal point in the U.S. presidential election campaign, illustrating how foreign policy can directly spill over into domestic politics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is not possible to tell In analyzing these two sentences, we need to determine if the second sentence can be logically deduced from the first sentence or not. The first sentence is a statement of apology from an unidentified speaker to Dave Hanson, communicating a sense of gentleness. The second sentence refers to someone, presumably the speaker from the first sentence, refusing to say anything to Dave Hanson.  The two sentences do relate to the same character, Dave Hanson, but they do not share a direct logical connection. The first sentence conveys an apology, while the second represents a refusal to communicate. These situations could be referring to different contexts or events, and without further information, it is impossible to determine how they relate to each other. Moreover, while it is implied that the same speaker is involved in both sentences, it is not explicitly stated. Therefore, without additional context, it is not possible to tell whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more. They key is to cut it off at the pass. Question: Immediately after the end of this text, the narrator is Answer: Choices: [I] Happy he spoke up. [II] not enough information. [III] a new BA manager.

Then they asked me to have a family trip. On our trip, we turned on the TV at the motel and saw the second plane crash into the World Trade Center. Seeing it falling down, I said to my kids: \\"I'm going to Afghanistan\\". And a few weeks later, international Medical Corps sent me to set up 20 clinics in provinces where people had no health care. In these field clinics surrounded by frightening shoots or deadly bombs, we were eventually serving 27,000 patients a month in a very busy schedule. Tired and nervous, I gradually had a sense of achievement, a sense of purpose, and my depression went away. In the years to follow, I went to Indonesia after the tsunami, Pakistan after the earthquakes, Sudan after the civil warm and Iraq after more and more bombs. Each time after disasters one after another, hundreds of people were killed, wounded and many more had to flee. We once set up movable clinics in an area with 19,000  _ , and it was supposed to hold 13,000 originally.

Mary Ellen Keating, a company spokesperson, told Ars by e-mail that while earlier reports of the firing of the entire Nook hardware team were incorrect, there were indeed some “job eliminations across the organization.\\" Keating declined to give any more specifics. Last month, three top B&N Nook executives also left the company.      In her e-mail, Keating added:      We believe we have a strong management team in place at Nook, having recruited significant new talent. The new Nook management team is focused on managing the business efficiently so that it becomes financially strong while at the same time aggressively moving to drive revenue growth.      In January 2014, Barnes & Noble also announced that “device and accessories sales” plummeted to 88.7 million during the October through December 2013 holiday period, a drop of 66.7 percent. The company attributed the loss to “lower unit selling volume and lower average selling prices.” Of course, that was prime shopping season, when most retailers see a spike in sales. The company added that “digital content sales” were 36.5 million during the same time frame, a drop of 27.3 percent. ||||| Spencer Platt/Getty Images Barnes & Noble laid off its Nook hardware engineers, according to a source that tipped Business Insider.

Barnes & Noble tried making a Nook e-reader, and a Nook tablet that competed with the iPad, and the Kindle Fire. It was a bold, and aggressive attempt to fend off the rise of Internet companies that were destroying booksellers.      It did not work, though. In the September quarter of last year, Nook revenue was down 32.2% on a year-over-year basis, and it had an EBITDA loss of 45.2 million. Those numbers made Nook the worst- performing part of Barnes & Noble.      Barnes & Noble has been talking about reducing the size of its Nook business for a year. Last February, Barnes & Noble executives were privately acknowledging that the Nook line needs to go.      It decided to move away from making its own devices, and focus on just doing its own applications, and digital distribution. Barnes & Noble stopped making a tablet, but continued making a Nook e-reader, the GlowLight. We're not sure what the future holds for the GlowLight.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Sympatric Speciation Can divergence occur if no physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and reproduce in the same habitat? The answer is yes. The process of speciation within the same space is called sympatric speciation; the prefix “sym” means same, so “sympatric” means “same homeland” in contrast to “allopatric” meaning “other homeland. ” A number of mechanisms for sympatric speciation have been proposed and studied. One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. In a normal cell division event chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes. However, sometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few individual chromosomes in a condition called aneuploidy (Figure 18.14).

Israel terror victims fight Shalit deal in court Jerusalem (CNN) -- Families of Israeli terror victims are urging the country's Supreme Court Monday to block the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Three petitions were submitted to the Supreme Court on Sunday after Israel released the names of the first group of prisoners to be freed. \\"The goal of this petition is to stop the madness. We are very afraid that the terror will again rule the streets -- that they will murder us again in restaurants, in cafes, at night in bed, at kindergartens and in schools,\\" said Meir Schijveschuurder, whose parents and three siblings were killed in the 2001 bombing of a Sbarro pizza restaurant. Two other families that lost loved ones in a 2003 bombing of a bus in Haifa filed civil lawsuits against the plotters of the attack. \\"It may sound like I am a drowning man clutching at a straw, but this is the least that we can do ... at this time,\\" said Ron Kerman, whose daughter was killed. Shalit's father Noam was in court to oppose their petitions. \\"We understand the hearts of the bereaved families -- we are a bereaved family as well,\\" Shalit's mother Aviva said on Israeli television Sunday. \\"But in spite of this any delay in the deal might endanger Gilad's life. It's a life-saving matter. I request that when my son returns home you will help us help in his recovery.\\" The Israeli public overwhelmingly supports the exchange of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for Shalit, an Israeli army sergeant who was abducted in a raid in 2006, when he was 19 years old. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote to the families of terror victims to say he understood their pain. \\"You were in my thoughts during the many uncertainties that have accompanied me in the negotiations,\\" he said in the letter, which was released by his office. \\"The decision regarding the release of Gilad Shalit is one of the hardest I have taken ... I understand the difficulty in digesting that these villains who committed these crimes against your loved ones will not be paying the full price that they deserve to,\\" Netanyahu wrote. But, he said: \\"The state of Israel does not abandon its soldiers and its citizens.\\" Nearly eight out of 10 Israelis favor the deal, according to the poll of 500 people conducted by the Dahaf Polling Institute for the daily Yedioth Aharonoth. Israelis are equally split on whether \\"the release of terrorists\\" will harm Israeli security, with 50% saying \\"Yes\\" and 48% saying \\"No\\" -- a statistical tie given the number of people polled. The families of some Palestinian prisoners being released had mixed feelings about the deal, they told CNN. Mohamad Abu Khalil, whose son got three life sentences plus 90 years in jail, is glad his son Ayman is being freed -- but said he won't be coming home. \\"It's better that Ayman is going to be released from Israeli jails, but sad that he won't be around his family here. It's better to be transferred to another country than being in Israeli jails,\\" his father said. The official Israeli list of prisoner releases lists him as being sent \\"abroad,\\" rather than to Gaza or the West Bank, without specifying where. The Israel Defense Forces declared a number of sites connected to the prisoner transfer and Shalit release to be closed military zones as of Monday. The list released by Israel features 477 names, including those of Ahlam Tamimi, serving life terms for being an accomplice in the Sbarro bombing, and Amneh Muna, who plotted the killing of a 16-year-old Israeli boy in 2001 and received a life sentence. The most notable name not on the list is that of jailed Palestinian lawmaker Marwan Barghouti, who is serving five life sentences. He was convicted in an Israeli court on murder and other charges related to his role in planning attacks on Israelis during the second Intifada. Israel approved the deal last week, agreeing to release in two stages 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including hundreds serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis. Shalit has been held incommunicado by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza, since his seizure. The first swap is expected to take place early this week, with the second stage scheduled for later this year. Israel's Prisons Authority said the Palestinians slated for release are being taken to two facilities -- one for the 27 female prisoners on the list, the rest for the men -- from which they will be released together. Once freed, they will be under various restrictions on a case-by-case basis: Some will not be allowed to leave the country, while others will have other restrictions on their movement or be required to report their whereabouts to local police, Justice Ministry spokesman Moshe Cohen told CNN. Shalit, meanwhile, will be transferred back into Israeli territory via the Kerem Shalom border crossing and will undergo medical tests and debriefing at an air force base, the Israeli military said. Once that is complete, he will be flown to his home at Mitzpe Hila, north of Haifa. Shalit's family has continuously petitioned Israeli government officials to broker a deal that would secure his release.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Which kingdom had their king baptized in 580?  John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century.

Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified, and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film.

Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people? I highly doubt it. But if they didn't, one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK.

Help as much as you can. I know that the answer to the question \\"Who is the defendant in Hill v. McDonough?\\" is in \\"Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\\".

This song was specifically created as the theme song for the 1973 James Bond film, \\"Live and Let Die.\\" Paul McCartney, one of the most celebrated and iconic musicians of all time, first gained fame as a member of the British rock band, The Beatles, which also included John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. As one of the band's primary songwriters, Paul McCartney, alongside Lennon, developed a collaborative partnership that yielded many of the band's biggest hits. After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, McCartney continued his musical career, forming the rock band Wings with his wife, Linda Eastman McCartney, and former Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine.  Wings was active from 1971 to 1981 and released several chart-topping albums. Linda, though primarily known for her photography and animal rights activism, was a key member of Wings, contributing keyboards and vocals. In 1973, the producers of the James Bond films approached McCartney to compose the theme song for \\"Live and Let Die,\\" which would be the eighth film in the Bond series, and the first to feature Roger Moore as the famous spy. McCartney agreed, and with Linda, wrote the song, introducing a more modern, rock-infused sound to the traditionally orchestral music of the James Bond films.  \\"Live and Let Die\\" became a standout in both the Bond theme pantheon and the discography of Wings. It is an interesting blend of various music genres, mixing elements of rock, reggae, and orchestral styles. McCartney's strong, melodious voice, combined with the song's dynamic range of tempo and tone, made it an instant classic. In the decades since its release, \\"Live and Let Die\\" has been covered by various other artists, including Guns N' Roses, whose version was nominated for a Grammy Award. Despite the numerous renditions, the original version by Paul McCartney and Wings is still widely enjoyed by fans around the world. Sir Paul McCartney, as a solo artist and as a member of Wings and The Beatles, continues to be one of the most successful and influential songwriters and musicians in the history of recorded music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So often we forget that \\"we are what we eat\\" and neglect the obvious link between diet and health. I think this book is a great resource for anyone interested in healthy aging.
