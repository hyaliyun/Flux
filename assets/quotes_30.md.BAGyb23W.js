We'll check even and odd ( n ) separately and consider numbers divisible by 3.  1. **Considering even ( n geq 6 )**:     - For any even number ( k geq 6 ), there are at least four divisors: 1, 2, ( frac{k}{2} ), and ( k ) itself. Hence, ( d(k) geq 4 ). 2. **Checking small values of ( n )**:     - For ( n = 3 ):         [ d(2) = 2,, d(3) = 2,, d(4) = 3 ]         [ d(2) + d(3) + d(4) = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 ]         which satisfies the condition since ( 7 leq 8 ).

Hence, no odd ( n geq 7 ) satisfies the condition. 4. **Considering even ( n geq 6 )**:     - When ( n geq 8 ):         - If ( n-1 ) is divisible by 3, then ( d(n-1) geq 3 ).         - Hence,              [ d(n-1) + d(n) + d(n+1) geq 3 + 4 + d(n+1) > 8 ]     - Similarly, if ( n+1 ) is divisible by 3,         [ d(n-1) + d(n) + d(n+1) geq d(n-1) + 4 + 3 > 8 ] 5. **Only remaining case when ( n ) is divisible by 6**:     - Let ( n = 6k geq 12 ):     - For ( n geq 12 ), which is divisible by 6, the divisors include 1, 2, 3, ( frac{n}{3} ), ( frac{n}{2} ), and ( n ), giving at least 6 divisors: ( d(n) geq 6 ).     - Hence,         [ d(n-1) + d(n) + d(n+1) geq d(n-1) + 6 + d(n+1) > 8 ] Therefore, there are no more possible solutions for ( n geq 12 ). # Conclusion: Summarizing the computations, we find the only solutions for ( n geq 3 ) are ( n = 3, 4, ) and ( 6 ).

Therefore, aside from pennies, the total value without pennies must be divisible by 5.    - The removed pennies must leave a remainder divisible by 5. Considering the properties,      we conclude there are at least 4 pennies (i.e., ( 4 text{ pennies} )): 7. **Recalculate without Pennies:**    - This leaves ( 17 - 4 = 13 ) coins.    - The remaining value is ( 289 text{ cents} - 4 text{ cents} = 285 text{ cents} ). 8. **Investigate Number of Quarters:**    - ( 13 ) coins: Considering the higher valued quarters because they fit our reduced total in more multiples:      - ( 11 text{ quarters} ), ( 1 text{ dime} ), and ( 1 text{ nickel} ). 9. **Verify our Counts:**    - ( 11 text{ quarters} = 11 times 25 = 275 text{ cents} ).    - ( 1 times 10 = 10 text{ cents} ).    - ( 2 times 5 = 10 text{ cents}).    - Therefore,      (boxed{(11 times 25) + (2times 5) + (4times1)} = 275+10+4 = 289.) # Conclusion: Thus, there must be (boxed{2}) nickels in the purse.

The new weight of the marbles in the bag is ( M - frac{1}{5}M ) or ( frac{4}{5}M ). The new total weight of the bag with the remaining marbles is 2.98 kg, so we can write another equation: [ E + frac{4}{5}M = 2.98 ] Now we have a system of two equations: 1. ( E + M = 3.4 ) 2.

Below is the identity used in the proof: |ac| - Re(ac) = frac{1}{2} |bar{c} - a|^2 - frac{1}{2} (|c| - |a|)^2  To understand this, we will demonstrate the necessity and sufficiency of the conditions. 1. **Assuming the condition ( | bar{c} - a | leq 1 )**:    When ( |bar{c} - a| leq 1 ), we analyze the expression for ( z = a c ), and verify the provided identity.

We express xy and x^2 in terms of a single variable: let x = frac{36}{y}. Substituting into (x+y) gives us frac{36}{y} + y = 11. Cross-multiplying leads to 36 + y^2 = 11y. 4.

The intersection of ( MBC ) and ( AD ) line is ( N ), thus ( N' equiv N ).     - Therefore:     [     N text{ divides } AD text{ in } d : (b_{1}+c_{1}+d_{1})     ]     - Similar analysis shows:     [     frac{AP}{PB} = frac{b}{b_{1}+c_{1}+d_{1}} quad text{and} quad frac{AQ}{QC} = frac{c}{b_{1}+c_{1}+d_{1}}     ] 7. **Proving Coplanarity and Centroid**:     - Since ( BCD ) and ( B_{1}C_{1}D_{1} ) are parallel, triangles ( A_{1}DN ) and ( D_{1}NA ) are similar:     [     frac{AD_{1}}{A_{1}D} = frac{AN}{ND} = frac{d}{b_{1}+c_{1}+d_{1}}     ]     - Hence:     [     overrightarrow{AD_{1}} = frac{d}{b_{1}+c_{1}+d_{1}} overrightarrow{A_{1}D}     ]     - Similarly:     [     overrightarrow{AB_{1}} = frac{b}{b_{1}+c_{1}+d_{1}} overrightarrow{A_{1}B} quad text{and} quad overrightarrow{AC_{1}} = frac{c}{b_{1}+c_{1}+d_{1}} overrightarrow{A_{1}C}     ] 8. **Concluding with Centroid Condition**:     - Summing the vectors:     [     overrightarrow{AB_{1}} + overrightarrow{AC_{1}} + overrightarrow{AD_{1}} = frac{1}{b_{1}+c_{1}+d_{1}} left( d cdot overrightarrow{A_{1}D} + b cdot overrightarrow{A_{1}B} + c cdot overrightarrow{A_{1}C} right) = mathbf{0}     ]     - Thus, ( A ) is the centroid of ( B_{1}C_{1}D_{1} ), which completes the proof.

Note that D is non-empty and is a union of closed intervals. 4. **Expanding to More Sets**:    - Consider adding another subset E to the existing sets A, B, and C.    - Since any three of these four sets must intersect, E must intersect D (since D = A cap B cap C and any three including E must have a common point).    - Therefore, D cap E is non-empty. 5. **Generalizing to All Sets**:    - Extend this argument to all subsets in the family. For each additional subset added to the family, it must intersect with D because any three subsets including the new one must have a common point.    - Thus, every subset in the family intersects D. 6. **Finding a Point in Half the Sets**:    - Since D is a union of closed intervals and every subset intersects D, there must be at least one point in D that lies in at least half of these subsets.    - This is because if no such point existed, it would imply that every point in D is in fewer than half the subsets, contradicting the fact that every subset intersects D. 7. **Conclusion**:    - Therefore, there exists at least one point in D which is common to at least half of the subsets in the family. boxed{text{There exists a point common to at least half of the subsets in the family.}}"},{"instruction":"Triangle X is equilateral with side length B and circumradius S, and Triangle Y is equilateral with side length b and circumradius s.

Given that five out of the six possible ant pairs have crossed paths, assume that the pair (3,4) is the only pair where we are unsure if they have met. 5. Since ants 1 and 2 have crossed paths, the lines Delta_1 and Delta_2 intersect, meaning they lie within the same plane, denoted mathcal{P}. 6.

P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1 (The probability of selecting any ball) 2. P(A) + P(B) = frac{3}{4} (The probability of selecting a red or yellow ball) 3. P(B) + P(C) = frac{1}{2} (The probability of selecting a yellow or blue ball) Solving these equations step by step: - Subtracting equation (3) from equation (2), we get P(A) - P(C) = frac{1}{4}. - Adding this result to equation (3), we find 2P(A) = frac{3}{4} + frac{1}{4} = 1, leading to P(A) = frac{1}{2}. - Substituting P(A) = frac{1}{2} into equation (2), we get P(B) = frac{3}{4} - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{4}. - Finally, knowing P(A) and P(B), we find P(C) = 1 - P(A) - P(B) = 1 - frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{4}.

Since the chocolate cost 7, and the candy bar cost 2, the difference in cost is indeed 7 - 2 = 5, which confirms the information given. To find out how much money Dan had initially, we need to add the total amount he spent to any remaining money he had after the purchases. However, the problem does not provide information about any remaining money. Since we only know the total amount spent, which is boxed{9,}  we can only conclude that Dan had at least 9 initially.

Since ( 0 ) is inside the given polygon, it can be represented as:    [    0 = sum_{v in V_1} alpha_v v    ]    where ( alpha_v ) are positive rationals. Multiplying this equality by some integer, we can assume ( alpha_v ) are positive integers. Adding this representation to both sides of the previous equation as many times as needed, we get a representation of ( w - w_1 ) with all coefficients positive. Thus, ( w - w_1 ) is reachable by the first grasshopper. 9. **Reaching ( w_2 )**:    Using the above claim, ( w_2 ) is also attainable by the first grasshopper. Since all possible values of ( w_2 ) are finite (its coefficients are small rational numbers with denominator ( N )), there is a constant ( c ) (depending only on ( V_2 )) such that the first grasshopper can reach ( w_2 ) with at most ( c ) hops. 10. **Conclusion**:     From ( w = w_1 + w_2 ), it follows that ( w ) is attainable by the first grasshopper in at most ( n + c ) jumps.

Since the area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, we have: a = s^2 The perimeter of a square is given by the formula P = 4s, so we have: p = 4s Now, according to the given equation: 6a = 6(2p + 9) We can substitute a = s^2 and p = 4s into this equation: 6s^2 = 6(2(4s) + 9) Now, let's simplify the equation: 6s^2 = 6(8s + 9) Divide both sides by 6 to simplify further: s^2 = 8s + 9 Since s^2 = a, we can rewrite the equation as: a = 8s + 9 Now, we need to express the perimeter p in terms of a. We know that p = 4s, so we need to solve for s in terms of a and then substitute back into the perimeter formula. Let's solve for s: s^2 - 8s - 9 = 0 This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for s using the quadratic formula: s = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a) In this case, a = 1, b = -8, and c = -9. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get: s = [8 ± √(64 + 36)] / 2 s = [8 ± √100] / 2 s = [8 ± 10] / 2 We have two possible solutions for s: s = (8 + 10) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9 s = (8 - 10) / 2 = -2 / 2 = -1 Since a side length cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution.

This way ({l_j}) has period (n).    - Define a sequence ({b_j}) of integers in ([0, m-1]) by:      [      b_j = sum_{i=1}^{j-1} a_i mod m,      ]      where (b_1 = 0).    - By definition, (l_j) is the smallest positive integer such that (b_{j+l_j} = b_j).    - For every (j in mathbb{N}), we have:      [      b_{j+mn} - b_j equiv sum_{i=j}^{j+mn-1} a_i = m sum_{i=1}^n a_i equiv 0 pmod{m}.      ]    - Therefore, ({b_j}) has period (mn). By the lemma, we have:      [      sum_{j=1}^{mn} l_j leq m^2 n.      ]    - Since ({l_j}) has period (n), we have:      [      sum_{i=1}^n l_i = frac{1}{m} sum_{j=1}^{mn} l_j leq mn.      ] (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"f f(x) is an odd function on mathbb{R}, and when x < 0, f(x) = log_2(2x), then f(0) + f(2) =  ?","output":"-2 **Key Points:**   - Properties of odd and even functions. **Special Topic:**   - Calculation problems; properties and applications of functions. **Analysis:**   - By applying the definition of an odd function and the given expression, we can find f(0) = 0 and f(2) = -2, which leads to the conclusion.    - Since f(x) is an odd function on mathbb{R},   we have f(-x) = -f(x),   which implies f(0) = 0 and f(-2) = -f(2),   when x < 0, f(x) = log_2(2-x),   f(-2) = log_2(2+2) = 2,   thus, f(0) + f(2) = 0 - 2 = -2.

Find the range of omega.","output":"To find the range of omega for the function f(x)=sin (omega x-frac{π}{6}) given that it has a zero point but no extreme values in the interval left(frac{π}{2}, piright), we proceed as follows: 1. **Identifying the Period and Zero Points**:    The period T of the sine function is given by T=frac{2π}{omega}. For the function to have a zero point but no extreme values in the interval left(frac{π}{2}, piright), the half-period frac{T}{2}=frac{π}{omega} must be at least as large as the length of the interval, which is pi - frac{π}{2} = frac{π}{2}. This gives us:    [    frac{π}{omega} geqslant frac{π}{2}    ]    Simplifying, we find:    [    0 < omega leqslant 2    ] 2. **Finding the Zero Points**:    The zero points of the sine function occur at omega x - frac{π}{6} = kπ, where k is an integer. Solving for x gives us the general formula for the zero points in terms of omega and k. 3. **Applying the Interval Constraints**:    We apply the interval constraints to the formula for zero points. For the function to have a zero point in the interval without extreme values, we consider the conditions:    [    kpi +frac{π}{2} leqslant omega cdot frac{π}{2}-frac{π}{6} < kpi +pi    ]    and    [    kpi +pi < omega cdot pi -frac{π}{6} leqslant kpi +frac{3π}{2}    ]    Simplifying these inequalities gives us:    [    2k+frac{4}{3} leqslant omega < 2k+frac{7}{3}    ]    and    [    k+frac{7}{6} < omega leqslant k+frac{5}{3}    ] 4. **Determining the Range of omega**:    By setting k=0, we find the range of omega as:    [    [frac{4}{3}, frac{5}{3}]    ]    And by setting k=-1, we find another range for omega as:    [    (frac{1}{6}, frac{1}{3})    ] 5. **Combining the Ranges**:    Therefore, combining the ranges obtained for omega, we get:    [    (frac{1}{6}, frac{1}{3}) cup [frac{4}{3}, frac{5}{3}]    ] Hence, the range of omega is boxed{(frac{1}{6}, frac{1}{3}) cup [frac{4}{3}, frac{5}{3}]}."},{"instruction":"regular hexagon ABCDEF, points P and Q are the midpoints of sides overline{BC} and overline{EF} respectively.

If any element of S is removed, then the remaining integers can be divided into two collections with the same size and the same sum. Show that all elements of S are equal.","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    The problem states that removing any element from the set ( S ) allows the remaining elements to be divided into two subsets with equal size and equal sum. We need to show that under these conditions, all elements of ( S ) are equal. 2. **Initial Observations:**    Let's denote the finite set of integers by ( S ). If we remove an element ( x ) from ( S ), the remaining set ( S' = S setminus { x } ) can be split into two subsets ( A ) and ( B ) such that:    [    |A| = |B| quad text{and} quad sum_{a in A} a = sum_{b in B} b    ]    Here, ( |A| ) and ( |B| ) denote the cardinalities (sizes) of the subsets, and the sums denote the sums of elements within those subsets. 3. **Transforming Elements:**    To simplify the problem, we consider the transformation ( ax + b ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are chosen such that all elements become positive. By setting sufficiently large ( b ), we ensure this. 4. **Establishing Property ( X ):**    Let's define property ( X ) for a set ( S ) as follows:    - All elements are positive integers.    - The set retains the original problem's property (removal of any element allows splitting the remaining into two equal sum and equal size subsets).    - Not all elements of ( S ) are equal. 5. **Redefining in terms of ( f(S) ):**    Denote ( f(S) ) as the sum of the elements in set ( S ). We analyze a set ( S ) initially with property ( X ). 6. **Parity Consideration:**    Observation: For any element ( x ) in ( S ), ( f(S) - x ) must be even (since ( A ) and ( B ) should have equal sums):    [    f(S setminus {x}) = f(S) - x quad text{is even} implies x quad text{has same parity as} quad f(S)    ]    Hence, all elements of ( S ) have the same parity. 7. **Forming a New Set ( T ):**    Depending on the parity:    - If all elements in ( S ) are even, form ( T = left{ frac{x}{2} mid x in S right} ).    - If all elements in ( S ) are odd, form ( T = left{ frac{x+1}{2} mid x in S right} ). 8. **Properties of ( T ):**    ( T ) remains a set of positive integers, and it retains properties (equal sum and equal size on removal of any element), ensuring that ( T ) has property ( X ). 9. **Reduction Argument:**    Compare sums:    - For ( T ), ( f(T) < f(S) ) (since ( x/2 < x ) and ( (x+1)/2 < x ) unless ( x = 1 )).    - Elements of ( S ) are not all equal implies at least one element will be reduced on transformation, ensuring ( f(T) < f(S) ). 10. **Contradiction and Conclusion:**    This process implies an infinite reduction sequence of ( f ), which contradicts finiteness (as ( f(S) ) is initially positive and integral). Therefore, our initial assumption that not all elements of ( S ) are equal must be false. Thus, it concludes that all elements in ( S ) must be equal.

Our objective is to prove that there exists a set of four vertices such that all edges between these vertices are of the same color. 1. **Initial assumption**:    Take an arbitrary vertex ( v ) in the graph ( K_{18} ). This vertex ( v ) is connected to the remaining 17 vertices by 17 different edges. 2. **Pigeonhole Principle application**:    By the pigeonhole principle, the edges connecting ( v ) to the other 17 vertices must include at least (leftlceil frac{17}{2} rightrceil = 9) edges of the same color. Without loss of generality, let's assume that there are at least 9 red edges emanating from ( v ). Denote the set of these 9 vertices connected to ( v ) by red edges as ( S ). 3. **Induced Subgraph consideration**:    We now consider the induced subgraph ( K_9 ) on the set ( S ). This induced subgraph is a complete graph on 9 vertices where each edge is either red or blue. 4. **Ramsey's Theorem application**:    Next, we apply Ramsey's theorem (specifically ( R(3,3) = 6 )) which states that any complete graph of 6 vertices, with edges arbitrarily colored with two colors, contains at least one monochromatic triangle. Here, the complete graph ( K_9 ) contains ( binom{9}{4} = 126 ) subsets of 4 vertices. By Ramsey's theorem, within this ( K_9 ), we can guarantee the existence of a monochromatic triangle. 5. **Finding 4-clique**:    By extending the result, since ( K_9 ) has more vertices than the minimum required by ( R(4,4) = 18 ), it is guaranteed within ( K_9 ) with each edge being either red or blue, there exists a monochromatic ( K_4 ) (a 4-clique). This means there exist four vertices within ( S ) such that the edges between any pair of these vertices are of the same color. 6. **Conclusion**:    We have shown that any 18-vertex complete graph, with edges colored either red or blue, will necessarily contain a monochromatic ( K_4 ) (four vertices all connected by edges of the same color).

Treat person A and person B as a single unit, so now we have 4 units to arrange. This gives us A_{4}^{4} ways.

This tells us that (n > 0) and by the nature of ellipses, we infer:    [    m < 0    ]    implying that (F_{2} = (0, m)) is below the origin if (m) is negative. 3. **Use the second equation:**    The second equation     [    |z + nmathrm{i}| - |z - mmathrm{i}| = -m    ]    indicates that the point (z) lies on one branch of a hyperbola with foci at (F_{1} = (0, -n)) and (F_{2} = (0, m)).  4. **Determine the possible geometric configuration:**        Combining the information from the first and second equations, we consider both shapes and the points on them. Based on the positions of (F_1) and (F_2) and the nature of ellipses and hyperbolas, the configuration options are:    [    boxed{(B)}    ] This captures the correct placement of foci for the equations given."},{"instruction":"A grainstorage warehouse has a total of 30 bins.

Hence, proposition (2) is true. - **Proposition (3):** If alpha and beta are both perpendicular to the same line l, then they must be parallel to each other.

A good candidate is the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the integers on the longest diagonal of the board. 3. **Analyze the effect of the action on the diagonal**:     - Consider a square on the diagonal. When we perform the action on this square, the integer in this square decreases by the number of its neighbors, and each neighbor's integer increases by 1.     - If the square is on the diagonal, the parity of the sum of the integers on the diagonal can change only if the number of neighbors is odd. However, for a square on the diagonal, the number of neighbors is even (2 or 3 for edge or corner squares, respectively). 4. **Construct a counterexample**:     - Take any odd integer ( k ).     - Place ( k ) on the longest diagonal and (-k) on the squares not on the longest diagonal. Set all other integers to zero.     - The sum of the integers on the longest diagonal is ( k times n ), which is odd since ( k ) is odd and ( n ) is an integer. 5. **Prove the invariant**:     - Since the sum of the integers on the longest diagonal is odd initially, it will remain odd after any number of actions because the action does not change the parity of the sum of the integers on the diagonal.     - Therefore, it is impossible to make all integers zero because the sum of the integers on the diagonal would need to be even (specifically zero) for all integers to be zero. 6. **Conclusion**: Since the sum of the integers on the longest diagonal remains odd, it is impossible to turn all the integers into zeros in a finite number of actions.

Let's place a point (K) on the base (AD) such that (AK = BC). This means (KD = CD) because (BC + CD = AD), thus point (K) divides (AD) into two segments where (AK = BC) and (KD = CD). 3. Next, we observe that quadrilateral (ABCK) is a rhombus because (AB = BC = CK = AK) by the construction and given conditions. By the properties of a rhombus, all sides are equal. 4. Let's denote the measure of the angle ( angle CAK = alpha ). 5. Since ( angle ABC) and ( angle ACK) are angles in the rhombus, they must sum up to (180^circ). 6. Also, the opposite angles of a rhombus are equal, so we can deduce the following relationships:    - ( angle AKC = angle ACK = alpha ). 7. Given (ABC) is a rhombus, the angles in a rhombus are all related such that:    - ( angle KCA = angle KAC = alpha ). 8.

Therefore, [ q^2 leq 1977 quad text{implying} quad q leq sqrt{1977} approx 44.44 ] Since q is an integer, we can take the upper bound as: [ q leq 44 ] # Step 2: Analyzing ( r ) If q leq 43, then: [ r = 1977 - q^2 geq 1977 - 43^2 = 1977 - 1849 = 128 ] Therefore: [ r geq 128 ] # Step 3: Investigating ( a + b ) From the given condition ( r < a + b ) and re-arranging ( a^2 + b^2 = q(a + b) + r ), we study: [ frac{1}{2} (a + b)^2 leq a^2 + b^2 = q(a + b) + r < q(a + b) + (a + b) ] as ( r < a + b ). Simplifying: [ frac{1}{2} (a + b)^2 < 44(a + b) ] Dividing both sides by (a + b) (possible since a + b > 0): [ frac{1}{2} (a + b) < 44 ] So we obtain the bound: [ a + b < 88 ] # Step 4: Checking for contradictions We have a + b < 88 but must also satisfy a + b > r geq 128. This is contradictory unless q is the largest possible value under its bound. Thus: [ q = 44 ] Then: [ r = 1977 - 44^2 = 1977 - 1936 = 41 ] # Step 5: Substituting ( q ) and ( r ) We substitute these into our original condition: [ a^2 + b^2 = 44(a + b) + 41 ] Rewriting this: [ a^2 + b^2 - 44a - 44b = 41 ] Completing the square for both a and b: [ (a - 22)^2 + (b - 22)^2 = 41 + 2 cdot 22^2 = 41 + 968 = 1009 ] # Step 6: Solving for ( |a-22| geq |b-22| ) Assume without loss of generality |a-22| geq |b-22|.

Square both a and b:    a^2 = (sqrt{6}+sqrt{7})^2 = 13 + 2sqrt{42},    b^2 = (2sqrt{2}+sqrt{5})^2 = 8 + 4sqrt{2} + 5 + 2sqrt{10} = 13 + 4sqrt{2} + 2sqrt{10}. 3. Compare the squares of a and b: Since 42 > 40, we have sqrt{42} > sqrt{40} = 2sqrt{10}. Multiplying both sides of the inequality by 2, we obtain 2sqrt{42} > 4sqrt{10} > 4sqrt{2} + 2sqrt{10}. Thus, a^2 > b^2. 4. Because a^2 > b^2 and both a and b are positive, we can conclude that a > b.

Let's consider a right-angled triangle, formed by dropping perpendiculars from ( P ) to the sides of ( triangle ABC ). 8. **Distance Calculation**:    If ( P ) lies within a right-angled triangle on hypotenuse ( AB ) (for simplicity), it makes angle considerations as follows:    - For ( triangle PRS ) where ( RS = AB ) and ( P ) is an internal point, observe that:        - (angle RPS) is central to the calculations and since the sum of angles in any triangle is ( 180^circ ). 9. **Conclusion**:    Since the largest angle in any triangle cannot exceed ( 90^circ ) around ( P ), and the side lengths are constrained by the circle's radius, it boils down to showing that:    [    PR leq RS quad text{and} quad PS leq RS    ]    which is true because ( RS = AB leq 2r ). Thus, the point ( P ) is always at most distance ( r ) from some vertex. Therefore, any point inside the parallelogram is a distance ( leq r ) from at least one of its vertices.

The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, so we have: [ a + ar + ar^2 = 180 ] Since the angles must be positive integers, let us express a as a = frac{180}{1 + r + r^2}. For a to be an integer, 1 + r + r^2 must be a divisor of 180. Divisors of 180 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, 180. We need to check which divisors d = 1 + r + r^2 lead to a being an integer and ar, ar^2 also being distinct and integers. After running checks, we find permissible values of r: - For r = 1.618 (approximate golden ratio), 1 + r + r^2 approx 4.236, close to 5. This gives a approx frac{180}{5}, not an integer. - For integer values of r, only r=2 works as 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7, so a = frac{180}{7}, not an integer. This approach yields no solutions since for all valid integer values of r, either a is not an integer or the conditions of distinct, integer angles are violated. boxed{0} triangles have angles in integer geometric progression."},{"instruction":"The area of a sector of a circle of a certain radius formed by an arc of length 4 cm is 10 cm².

This can be seen by connecting the midpoints of the adjacent sides of the rectangle. Each of these segments is a line connecting the midpoint of one side of the rectangle to the midpoint of an adjacent side. This ensures that opposite sides of the newly formed quadrilateral are parallel and equal in length, thus forming a parallelogram. Specifically, since the original shape is a rectangle, the resulting parallelogram will not only be any parallelogram but a rhombus. 2. **Determining the Side Length of the Rhombus**:     To find the perimeter of the rhombus, we need to calculate the length of one of its sides.

If we split the rectangle along this diagonal, we have two congruent right triangles, each with a hypotenuse of 8.    Let the lengths of the sides of the rectangle be (a) and (b).

If we halve each side of the rectangle, the midpoints create a smaller rectangle with side lengths ( frac{a}{2} ) and ( frac{b}{2} ). 4. **Finding the Distance Between Midpoints**:    Utilizing the diagonal of this smaller rectangle, which acts as the side length of the rhombus,    [    text{side length of rhombus} = sqrt{ left( frac{a}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{b}{2} right)^2 } = frac{1}{2} sqrt{ a^2 + b^2 }    ]    Since ( a^2 + b^2 = 64 ):    [    text{side length of rhombus} = frac{1}{2} sqrt{64} = frac{1}{2} times 8 = 4    ] 5. **Calculating the Perimeter of the Rhombus**:    A rhombus has four sides of equal length. Thus, if one side is 4 units, the perimeter ( P ) of the rhombus is given by:    [    P = 4 times (text{side length}) = 4 times 4 = 16    ] **Conclusion**: The perimeter of the quadrilateral formed by the midpoints of the sides of a rectangle with a diagonal of 8 units is: [ boxed{16} ]"},{"instruction":"A banker found out that among a set of identicallooking coins, one is counterfeit (lighter in weight). He asked an expert to identify the counterfeit coin using a balance scale but stipulated that each coin can be used in weighings no more than twice. What is the maximum number of coins the banker can have so that the expert can definitely identify the counterfeit coin in n weighings?","output":"To determine the largest number of coins the banker can have such that the expert can always find the counterfeit coin in n weighings, each coin being weighed no more than twice, we start by solving a simpler version of the problem.  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Simplified Problem:**    Let’s begin by considering the banker allowing each coin to be placed on the scale no more than once. What is the largest number of coins from which the counterfeit one could be identified in k weighings?        Observing that if, during any weighing, more than one coin is on a pan of the scale, the counterfeit coin cannot be identified as another weighing isn't permitted. Thus, for each weighing, there should only be one coin on each pan.        - If the scales are unbalanced, the lighter coin is counterfeit.    - If balanced, the number of suspect coins reduces by 2. 2. **Result from Simplified Problem:**    Therefore, with k weighings, we can identify the counterfeit coin among 2k+1 coins. Now, let’s apply this to the case where a coin can be weighed up to twice. 3. **Main Problem:**    Let f(n) represent the maximum number of coins that can be checked in n weighings. Assume in the first weighing there are s coins on each pan.    - If the scales are unbalanced, identify the counterfeit coin among the s coins on the lighter side, ensuring no coin is weighed more than once further and (n-1) weighings remain. By the simplified problem result, s leq 2(n-1)+1 = 2n-1. 4. **Balanced Scales Scenario:**    If the scales are balanced, then the problem reduces to finding the counterfeit coin among the remaining f(n) - 2s coins in n-1 weighings, implying:     f(n) - 2s leq f(n-1)  5. **Combining Results:**    We derive the total inequality:     f(n) leq f(n-1) + 2s      leq f(n-1) + 2(2n-1)     By iterative summation up to n, we have:         f(n) leq 2(2n-1) + 2(2n-3) + ldots + 2 cdot 3 + f(1)  6. **Summing the Series:**    The summation of the series 2(2n-1) + 2(2n-3) + ldots + 2 cdot 3 is the sum of an arithmetic series with first term 2(2n-1), common difference -4, and n-1 terms:     text{Sum} = 2 sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (2(2n-2k+1)-1) = 2 left[ 2n(n-1) - (0 + 1 + ldots + (n-2)) right]      = 2 left[ 2n(n-1) - frac{(n-2)(n-1)}{2} right]      = 2 left[ 2n(n-1) - frac{n(n-1) - (n-1)}{2} right]      = 2 left[ 2n(n-1) - frac{n(n-1)}{2} + frac{n-1}{2} right]      = 2 left[ frac{4n(n-1) - n(n-1) + (n-1)}{2} right]      = 2 left[ frac{3n(n-1) + (n-1)}{2} right] = 3n(n-1) + (n-1)      = 3n^2 - 3n + n - 1 = 3n^2 - 2n - 1     Therefore:     f(n) leq 2(2 n-1) + 2(2 n-3) + ldots + 2 cdot 3 + 3 = 2(n(2n-1) - 3) + 3 = 2(n^{2}+n)+1       f(n) = 2n^2+1  Therefore, the maximum number of coins for which the expert can always find the lighter counterfeit coin in n weighings, with each coin weighed no more than twice, is boxed{2n^2+1}."},{"instruction":"a circular region with radius 3 units, what is the probability that a randomly selected point within this circle will be closer to the center than it is to twice the radius of an inner concentric circle with radius 1 unit?

Setting s-1 = 8k, the smallest s satisfying 180 ≤ s ≤ 250 is s = 8k + 1. We solve 180 leq 8k+1 leq 250: - For the lower bound, 180 leq 8k+1 gives 179 leq 8k, so k geq frac{179}{8} = 22.375.

According to the multinomial theorem, the expansion of ((x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_m)^n) can be written as:     [     sum_{k_1+k_2+cdots+k_m=n} frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! cdots k_m!} x_1^{k_1} x_2^{k_2} cdots x_m^{k_m}     ]     Therefore,:     [     (1-2x + ax^2)^8 = sum_{n_1+n_2+n_3=8} frac{8!}{n_1!n_2!n_3!} cdot 1^{n_1} cdot (-2x)^{n_2} cdot (ax^2)^{n_3}     ]     Simplifying each term, we get:     [     (1-2x + ax^2)^8 = sum_{n_1+n_2+n_3=8} frac{8!}{n_1!n_2!n_3!} cdot (-2)^{n_2} cdot a^{n_3} cdot x^{n_2 + 2n_3}     ] 2. In order to find the coefficient of (x^4), we need to determine which terms in the summation contain (x^4). For terms containing (x^4), we need:     [     n_2 + 2n_3 = 4     ] 3. Simultaneously, the sum of the exponents (n_1, n_2, n_3) equals 8:     begin{equation}     begin{cases}     n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 8      n_2 + 2n_3 = 4     end{cases}     end{equation} 4. We solve this system of equations. From the second equation (n_2 + 2n_3 = 4), we notice that (n_2) must be even because (2n_3) is always even. The non-negative integer solutions of (n_2 + 2n_3 = 4) are:     - If (n_2 = 0), then (2n_3 = 4 Rightarrow n_3 = 2)     - If (n_2 = 2), then (2n_3 = 2 Rightarrow n_3 = 1)     - If (n_2 = 4), then (2n_3 = 0 Rightarrow n_3 = 0) 5.

The total coefficient of (x^4) in the expansion is the sum of these contributions:     [     28a^2 + 672a + 560     ] 8. According to the problem, this coefficient must be equal to (-1540):     [     28a^2 + 672a + 560 = -1540     ]     Simplifying this, we get a quadratic equation:     [     28a^2 + 672a + 560 + 1540 = 0 Rightarrow 28a^2 + 672a + 2100 = 0     ] 9.

One example of such an integer is ( m = 3^{2019} ), since the number of divisors of ( 3^{2019} ) is ( 2019 + 1 = 2020 ). 2. **Introduce the parameter k:**    Consider ( n = 2^k m ) for some integer ( k ) chosen such that ( 2^k > m ). This ensures that ( 2^k ) is significantly large compared to ( m ). 3. **Characterize the divisors of ( n ):**    Any divisor of ( n ) can be written in the form ( 2^ell d ) where ( d ) is a divisor of ( m ).  4. **Establish the close divisor condition:**    To ensure a divisor ( 2^ell d ) of ( n ) is within the close divisor range, we need:    [    sqrt{n} < 2^ell d < 2 sqrt{n}    ]    Because ( n = 2^k m ), we find:    [    sqrt{n} = sqrt{2^k m} = 2^{k/2} sqrt{m}    ]    Thus, the inequality becomes:    [    2^{k/2} sqrt{m} < 2^ell d < 2 cdot 2^{k/2} sqrt{m}    ] 5. **Determine the integer ( a ):**    Since ( sqrt{n} ) (i.e., ( 2^{k/2} sqrt{m} )) is not an integer, there exists a unique integer ( a ) such that:    [    2^{k/2} sqrt{m} < 2^a d < 2 cdot 2^{k/2} sqrt{m}    ]    which simplifies to:    [    sqrt[2]{n} < 2^a d < 2 sqrt[2]{n}    ] 6. **Range of (ell):**    Similarly, as ( 2^k > m ), we derive:    [    m < 2^{k/2} sqrt{m} < 2^k    ]    and since ( 1 leq d leq m ), it follows:    [    1 < frac{2^{k/2} sqrt{m}}{d} < 2^a < frac{2 cdot 2^{k/2} sqrt{m}}{d} < 2 cdot 2^k    ]    thus:    [    0 < a leq k    ] 7. **Unique (ell) for each divisor ( d ):**    Given ( m ) has exactly 2020 divisors and ( ell ) spans over a unique integer range ensuring for each ( d ), ( 2^ell d ) is a close divisor, we affirm:    Since ( d in {1, 2, ldots, m} ) each have unique ( ell ), hence there are 2020 such unique close divisors. # Conclusion: Thus, we have constructed a positive integer ( n = 2^k times 3^{2019} ) which has exactly 2020 close divisors.

For our case, A=-1, B=1, and C=1, with (x_0, y_0)=(0,-1). Thus, d=frac{|-1cdot0+1cdot(-1)+1|}{sqrt{(-1)^2+1^2}}=frac{|-1+1|}{sqrt{2}}=frac{0}{sqrt{2}}=0. However, this seems to be a mistake in the calculation. Correctly, it should be d=frac{|-1cdot0+1cdot(-1)+1|}{sqrt{(-1)^2+1^2}}=frac{|-1+1|}{sqrt{2}}=frac{|0|}{sqrt{2}}=sqrt{2}. 3. **Find the chord length using the Pythagorean theorem**: The distance d forms a perpendicular from the center of the circle to the chord, dividing the chord into two equal segments. Let the half-length of the chord be l. We have a right triangle with l as one leg, d as the other leg, and the radius r as the hypotenuse. Thus, r^2=d^2+l^2. Solving for l, we get l=sqrt{r^2-d^2}=sqrt{3-2}=sqrt{1}=1. Therefore, the total length of the chord is 2l=2cdot1=2.

We can reframe this to show that the sum of an infinite arithmetic progression and an infinite non-constant geometric progression does not result in an arithmetic progression.  2. **Properties of Arithmetic and Geometric Progressions**:     - An **arithmetic progression** (AP) is a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. If a_n denotes the n-th term of an arithmetic progression, it can be written as:       [       a_n = a + (n-1)d       ]       where a is the first term, and d is the common difference.     - A **geometric progression** (GP) is a sequence where the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. If b_n denotes the n-th term of a geometric progression, it can be written as:       [       b_n = b cdot q^{n-1}       ]       where b is the first term, and q is the common ratio.  3. **Sum of the Sequences**:     - Consider the sum sequence c_n = a_n + b_n = (a + (n-1)d) + b cdot q^{n-1}. To be an arithmetic progression, the sum sequence c_n must satisfy the property:       [       c_{n+1} - c_n = text{constant}       ] 4. **Difference of Consecutive Terms**:     - Calculate the difference between consecutive terms of the sum sequence:       [       c_{n+1} = a_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = left(a + ndright) + b cdot q^n       ]       and       [       c_n = a_n + b_n = (a + (n-1)d) + b cdot q^{n-1}       ]       The difference is:       [       c_{n+1} - c_n = left(a + nd + b cdot q^nright) - left(a + (n-1)d + b cdot q^{n-1}right)       ]       Simplifying this, we get:       [       c_{n+1} - c_n = d + b cdot (q^n - q^{n-1})       ] 5. **Behavior of the Difference**:     - Notice that q^n - q^{n-1} = q^{n-1}(q-1). Thus:       [       c_{n+1} - c_n = d + b cdot q^{n-1}(q-1)       ]     - For the sum sequence {c_n} to be an arithmetic progression, the term d + bq^{n-1}(q-1) must be constant, independent of n. However, since bq^{n-1}(q-1) depends on n, it cannot be constant (considering q neq 1, which corresponds to a non-constant geometric progression). 6. **Conclusion**:     - Since the difference c_{n+1} - c_n is not constant, the sum sequence {c_n} is not an arithmetic progression. Therefore, the sum of an infinite arithmetic progression and an infinite non-constant geometric progression cannot form an arithmetic progression. Hence, the statement is proven.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Maria gave some of her money to her friend Isha, half of what she gave to Florence.

We can express the width c of the trapezoid at a depth x by using similar triangles. 3. **Expression for c**:    - The width at the base: b = 10.8 , text{m}    - The width at the top: a = 6.6 , text{m}    - Height: h = 4.0 , text{m}    The width c of the trapezoid at depth x is:    [    c = b - x frac{b-a}{h}    ]    So,    [    c = 10.8 - x frac{10.8 - 6.6}{4}    ]    [    c = 10.8 - 1.05x    ] 4. **Expression for Force**:    The infinitesimal force delta F at depth x over an infinitesimal height delta x:    [    delta F = P cdot delta S = rho g x cdot c cdot delta x    ]    Substitute c:    [    delta F = rho g x cdot (10.8 - 1.05x) cdot delta x    ]    Integrate from x = 0 to x = h to find the total force:    [    F = int_0^h rho g x cdot (10.8 - 1.05x) , dx    ] 5. **Perform the Integration**:    [    F = int_0^4 1000 times 10 times x times (10.8 - 1.05x) , dx    ]    Compute:    [    F = 10000 int_0^4 [10.8x - 1.05x^2] , dx    ]    [    F = 10000 left[ int_0^4 10.8x , dx - int_0^4 1.05x^2 , dx right]    ]    [    F = 10000 left[ 10.8 cdot frac{x^2}{2} Bigg|_0^4 - 1.05 cdot frac{x^3}{3} Bigg|_0^4 right]    ]    [    F = 10000 left[ 10.8 cdot frac{16}{2} - 1.05 cdot frac{64}{3} right]    ]    [    F = 10000 left[ 10.8 cdot 8 - 1.05 cdot frac{64}{3} right]    ]    [    F = 10000 left[ 86.4 - 22.4 right]    ]    [    F = 10000 times 64 = 640000 , text{N}    ]    Therefore, the force with which the water pressures on the dam is:        [    boxed{640000 , text{N}}    ]"},{"instruction":"On a board, all natural numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive are written. Vasya picks a pair of numbers from the board, whose greatest common divisor is greater than one, and erases one of them.

He chooses pairs of numbers such that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is greater than one. He then erases one of the numbers in each pair. Our task is to find the minimum number of numbers that can remain on the board after Vasya completes his actions.  2. Considering the Prime Factorization: For Vasya to erase a number, he needs to find two numbers that share at least one prime factor in their prime factorizations. This means that prime numbers, which have no common divisors with other prime numbers, cannot generally be paired and erased, except within their own multiples.  3. Analysis of the Bounds: - The number 1 does not affect any other number because it has no prime factors. Therefore, it remains on the board. - Prime numbers from 1 to 100 need special consideration: primes over 50 cannot be paired with any other numbers under the given range because there would be no multiples of these primes within the range.  4. Identification of Numbers Remaining: - Prime numbers greater than 50: (53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97). These are exactly 10 numbers. - Numbers containing prime factors less than or equal to 50 will remain to certain extents, as each prime will eventually narrow down pairs for itself.  5. Specific example strategy: - Vasya could pair each prime less than 50 with its multiples (e.g., (p) and (2p)).   - Prime numbers like (2, 3, 5, 7) and so on, could be paired into prime-multiple pairs.   - Further pairing must ensure enough primes to handle each round of erasure until only primal numbers or unique prime-comprising numbers remain.  6. Listing what remains after all pairings: - For primes such as (2, 3, 5, 7), each time a smaller pair composite gets removed until larger prime (itself free from pairs): - Composites involving higher primes follow pairing, leading to leftovers principally as those not forming a composite relationship in gcd or far exceeding differences within range of pairings. Consequently, the following 12 numbers satisfy as they remain unpaired until the final remaining step: [ 1, 2, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 ]  Conclusion: Thus, the minimum number of numbers that can remain on the board through Vasya’s actions is: [boxed{12}]"},{"instruction":"During the first eleven days, 700 people responded to a survey question.

First, note that the interval (-1, 4] includes the point x = 0, where f(0) = 0^2 - 2^0 = -1. Since f(x) + f(x + 5) = 16, we can infer that f(x) and f(x + 5) are symmetric about the line y = 8. This symmetry, combined with the given form of f(x) in the interval (-1, 4], allows us to extend the behavior of f(x) beyond this interval by using the functional equation. The zeros of f(x) in the interval [0, 2013] can be found by considering the periodicity introduced by the functional equation. Since f(x) = x^2 - 2^x has a limited number of zeros in the interval (-1, 4], and given the symmetry and periodicity of f(x), we can calculate the number of zeros in the larger interval [0, 2013] by dividing the interval into segments of length 5 (due to the f(x + 5) term) and analyzing the behavior of f(x) within each segment.

For the hyperbola, the distance between the center and each focus is sqrt{a+1+1}, because the formula for the distance to the foci for a hyperbola is sqrt{a^2+b^2}, where a^2 is the denominator of the x^2 term and b^2 is the denominator of the y^2 term. Here, a^2 = a+1 and b^2 = 1, so the distance is sqrt{a+1+1}. For the ellipse, the distance between the center and each focus is sqrt{4-a^2}, because the formula for the distance to the foci for an ellipse is sqrt{a^2-b^2}, where a^2 is the larger of the denominators of the x^2 and y^2 terms, and b^2 is the smaller. Here, a^2 = 4 and b^2 = a^2, so the distance is sqrt{4-a^2}. Since the hyperbola and the ellipse share the same foci, we equate the distances: [ sqrt{a+1+1} = sqrt{4-a^2} ] Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives: [ a+1+1 = 4-a^2 ] Simplifying this equation: [ a+2 = 4-a^2 ] Rearranging terms: [ a^2 + a - 2 = 0 ] Factoring the quadratic equation: [ (a+2)(a-1) = 0 ] Solving for a gives two possible values: [ a = -2 quad text{or} quad a = 1 ] However, we must consider the conditions a+1 > 0 and 4 > a^2 to ensure the denominators in the equations of the hyperbola and ellipse are positive and meaningful.

Consider a graph ( G ), where the vertices are the elements of the set ( X ). If two people in ( X ) are friends, then there is an edge between the corresponding vertices in ( G ). Conversely, if they are not friends, then there is no edge between the corresponding vertices. 2. If a graph ( G ) can be partitioned into pairs such that each pair of vertices in the same group is connected by an edge, then we call this partition a \\"perfect matching\\" of the graph ( G ). The problem statement essentially says that the set ( X ) cannot be partitioned into such perfect matchings. 3. We convert the problem statement into the following conditions for graph ( G ):    - The graph ( G ) does not admit a perfect matching.    - If any two vertices ( x, y ) in ( G ) are not connected by an edge, then adding the edge ( xy ) to ( G ) creates a graph that admits a perfect matching.    - There is no vertex in ( G ) that is adjacent to every other vertex. 4. We need to prove that for any three vertices ( a, b, c in X ), if ( a ) is friends with ( b ) and ( b ) is friends with ( c ), then ( a ) must also be friends with ( c ). 5. Proof by contradiction: Suppose there exist three vertices ( a, b, c ) such that ( a ) is friends with ( b ), ( b ) is friends with ( c ), but ( a ) is not friends with ( c ). 6. Given that no vertex is friends with every other vertex, there exists a vertex ( d in X ) such that ( b ) is not friends with ( d ). 7. According to the given conditions, the graph ( G + ac ) (where the edge ( ac ) is added) admits a perfect matching, denote this perfect matching as ( F_1 ). Similarly, the graph ( G + bd ) (where the edge ( bd ) is added) also admits a perfect matching, denote this perfect matching as ( F_2 ). 8. Consider the symmetric difference between ( F_1 ) and ( F_2 ):    [    S = F_1 Delta F_2 = (F_1 cup F_2) - (F_1 cap F_2).    ] 9. ( S ) consists of disjoint cycles, where each cycle is made up of an even number of edges. Assume ( ac ) belongs to cycle ( C_1 ) and ( bd ) belongs to cycle ( C_2 ). 10. We analyze two cases:     - If ( C_1 neq C_2 ): Outside the cycle ( C_1 ), partition the vertices as per the matching ( F_1 ), and inside cycle ( C_1 ), partition the vertices as per the matching ( F_2 ). This configuration provides a perfect matching for the original graph ( G ), which contradicts the assumption that ( G ) does not admit a perfect matching.     - If ( C_1 = C_2 ): Start from vertex ( b ) and follow the edge ( bd ). Suppose this path first connects to vertex ( a ), forming the path ( P ). Then ( P + ab ) forms a cycle, wherein half of the edges belong to ( F_2 ). Outside the cycle ( P + ab ), partition the vertices as per ( F_2 ), and inside the cycle ( P + ab ), partition the vertices as per ( ab ) and ( F_1 ). This configuration also provides a perfect matching for ( G ), which contradicts the assumption that ( G ) does not admit a perfect matching. 11. Both cases lead to contradictions, so our initial assumption that ( a ) and ( c ) are not friends must be false. 12. Therefore, for any three vertices ( a, b, c in X ), if ( a ) is friends with ( b ) and ( b ) is friends with ( c ), then ( a ) must also be friends with ( c ).

The goal is to make the water quantity in each glass equal.    - **Step 1**: Pair the glasses as follows: (A-B) and (C-D).      - Equalize the water between (A) and (B) by transferring water, so (A) and (B) end up with the same amount.      - Equalize the water between (C) and (D) similarly.    - After this step, we have two pairs of glasses with equal water: { (A, B) } and { (C, D) }.    - **Step 2**: Now consider (A) and (C).      - Equalize the water between (A) and (C), effectively making (A, B, C,) and (D) all have the same amount of water.    - Thus, the water in all four glasses is now equal. 2. **Induction Hypothesis (For Eight Glasses)**:    - Assume that the procedure works for (2^k) glasses, where (k) is a positive integer. Now we need to prove that it works for (2^{k+1}) glasses, which in our case means going from four glasses to eight glasses. 3. **Inductive Step (From Four to Eight Glasses)**:    - Let's now consider eight glasses labeled as (A, B, C, D, A', B', C', D'). We will follow a similar strategy:    - **Step 1**: Pair the glasses: ( (A - A'), (B - B'), (C - C'), (D - D') ).      - Equalize the water in each pair. After this step, we have four pairs of glasses with equal amounts of water:         [        A = A', ; B = B', ; C = C', ; D = D'        ]    - **Step 2**: Now consider the resulting glasses as two new groups of four glasses: ( {A, B, C, D} ) and ( {A', B', C', D'} ).      - Each of these groups is a scenario identical to the four-glass case which we have already solved.      - In each group of four glasses, transfer water to balance as done in the base case.        - Group 1: (A, B, C, D),        - Group 2: (A', B', C', D').        - After balancing each group, every glass in group 1 and group 2 will have the same amount of water. 4. **Conclusion**:    - By repeatedly applying the inductive step, we have shown that we can balance the water across all eight glasses. Thus, we can conclude that it is indeed possible to equalize the water in all eight glasses using the allowed operations.

Since (p) cannot divide (s), this is a contradiction.    - **Case 2: ( alpha geq p+1 ):**      [      p^{alpha - (p-1)} cdot s = (alpha + 1) tau(s)      ]      - Considering the bounds:        [        frac{p^{p-1} (alpha + 1)}{p^alpha} = frac{s}{tau(s)} geq frac{s}{2 sqrt{s}} = frac{sqrt{s}}{2}        ] 6. **Bounding ( tau(s) ):**    - For all (p geq 5) and ( alpha geq p+1):      [      2 (alpha + 1) < p^{alpha - (p-1)}      ]      - Using mathematical induction, it is straightforward to verify this inequality.      - Given the inequality, we conclude (s < 1), which again is a contradiction, as (s) must be a positive integer. 7. **Special Case:** ( alpha = p ):      [      p s = (p + 1) tau(s)      ]      - This implies (p) must divide (tau(s)).

Prove that ( n = 2m^2 ) for some integer ( m ).","output":"Let's rewrite the given conditions and details step-by-step to understand why ( n ) must be of the form ( n = 2m^2 ) for some integer ( m ). 1. **Identify the Divisors:**    Let ( n ) be a positive integer with the following properties:    - ( t_1, t_2, ldots, t_s ) are all the positive odd divisors of ( n ).    - Let ( 2^k ) be the highest power of 2 that divides ( n ).    Thus, the complete list of divisors of ( n ) can be written as:    [    t_1, t_2, ldots, t_s, , 2 t_1, 2 t_2, ldots, 2 t_s, , ldots, , 2^k t_1, 2^k t_2, ldots, 2^k t_s    ] 2. **Sum and Count Divisors:**    We are given that the sum of all the divisors of ( n ) except ( n ) itself, plus the number of these divisors, equals ( n ). Formally written:    [    left( sum_{text{divisor } d  of  n,  d neq n} d right) + (text{number of divisors of } n - 1) = n    ] 3. **Formulate the Sum of Divisors:**    The sum of all divisors of ( n ) can be formulated as follows:    [    1 + t_1 + t_2 + ldots + t_s + 2(1 + t_1 + t_2 + ldots + t_s) + ldots + 2^k(1 + t_1 + t_2 + ldots + t_s)    ]    This sum can be simplified using the sum of a geometric series:    [    (2^{k+1} - 1)(1 + t_1 + t_2 + ldots + t_s)    ] 4. **Sum Including the Multiplied Factors:**    Including the number of divisors, we have:    [    left( 1 + t_1 + t_2 + ldots + t_s right) sum_{i=1}^{k+1} 2^{i-1} = (2^{k+1} - 1)(1 + t_1 + t_2 + ldots + t_s)    ]    Thus:    [    text{Number of divisors} = (k+1) times s    ] 5. **Equating the Conditions:**    Considering all divisors except ( n ), and given the relationship:    [    left( (2^{k+1} - 1)(1 + t_1 + t_2 + ldots + t_s) right) - n + (k+1) times s - 1 = n    ]    After simplification, we find:    [    2n = (2^{k+1} - 1)(1 + t_1 + t_2 + ldots + t_s) + (k+1)s - 1    ]    For the right-hand side to be even, both ( k ) and ( s ) must be odd. 6. **Structure and Powers:**    If both ( k ) and ( s ) are odd, it implies that the count ( s ) of positive odd divisors of ( n ) results from ( n / 2^k ) being a perfect square:    [    n = 2^k times r^2     ]    where ( r ) is an integer.

The magnitude of this sum vector is calculated as: [ |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|=sqrt{(-1)^2+1^2}=sqrt{2} ] Since sqrt{2} neq 2, option A is incorrect. **For option B:** If overrightarrow{a} is parallel to overrightarrow{b}, then their components must be proportional, i.e., frac{1}{-2}=frac{lambda}{1}.

Does it follow that the polygon is regular?","output":"1. **Identify the given conditions**: We are given a convex heptagon (7-sided polygon) that has two symmetry axes. 2. **Reflection and transformation considerations**:     - Reflect the heptagon successively across the two symmetry axes.     - The resulting transformation can either be:       - A translation if the axes are parallel, which is not applicable as the heptagon cannot be mapped onto itself by simple translation.       - A rotation if the axes intersect.     3. **Characterizing the rotation**:    - Since the transformation must map the heptagon onto itself, it must be a rotation.    - The angle of this rotation must be twice the angle between the two symmetry axes and should be less than (180^circ). 4. **Exclusion based on (180^circ) rotation**:    - A (180^circ) rotation implies point reflection symmetry, which is not possible for an odd-sided convex polygon like a heptagon. 5. **Defining point orbits**:    - Consider a specific vertex (A_1) of the heptagon.    - This vertex can be mapped to other vertices by the rotation.    - Let us define the orbit of a vertex as the set of vertices this vertex maps to under successive rotations.      - For example, if (A_1) maps to (A_3), (A_3) maps to (A_5), and (A_5) maps back to (A_1), then ({A_1, A_3, A_5}) forms an orbit. 6. **Arguments against 1-element and 2-element orbits**:    - An orbit cannot consist of just one vertex, as that would imply the center of rotation is at a vertex, contradicting convexity.    - An orbit cannot consist of two elements, as this would imply a (180^circ) rotation, already excluded. 7. **Analysis of possible rotation angles**:    - If a vertex orbit has three elements, the rotation angle must be (120^circ) or (240^circ).    - A four-element orbit would imply an angle of (90^circ) or (270^circ), which contradicts our prior analysis as (90^circ) and (270^circ) do not allow seven vertices (a prime number) to map onto themselves evenly. 8. **Concluding that all vertices form a single orbit**:    - Any vertex’s orbit must cover all seven vertices.    - This implies the existence of an integer (n) such that successive rotations by (alpha) map vertices through all seven positions. 9. **Establishing regular vertex angles**:    - Since the orbit includes all vertices, the rotation angle (alpha) must be ( frac{360^circ}{7} ).    - Therefore, every vertex angle ( angle A_1 O A_2 ) is the same, meaning all vertex angles and all side lengths are equivalent. 10. **Conclusion**:     - Since each angle between consecutive vertices around point (O) is identical and every side length is equal, the heptagon must be regular.

Apply triangle ( triangle A_1B_1C_1 ) to triangle ( triangle ABC ) in such a way that their bases coincide and vertex ( B_1 ) moves to point ( B' ), lying on the same side of the diameter ( DE ) and the chord ( AC ) as vertex ( B ). Let the angle bisector ( B_1P_1 ) correspond to the segment ( B'P' ). Given that ( B' ) lies on the circumscribed circle of ( triangle ABC ), we have (angle AB'C = angle A_1B_1C_1 = angle ABC).

A 20-pretty number n can be expressed as n = 2^a 5^b k, where a ge 2, b ge 1, gcd(k,10) = 1, and n has exactly 20 divisors. The divisor function d(n) = 20 implies that 20 = (a+1)(b+1)d(k), considering the multiplicative nature of the divisor function. # Case Analysis 1. **Case a+1 = 4:**    - Here, b+1 must be 5, leading to (a,b) = (3,4).

Consider:        left(a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{2013}right)^2.        Expanding this, we get:        left(a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{2013}right)^2 = a_{1}^2 + a_{2}^2 + cdots + a_{2013}^2 + 2 sum_{1 leq i < j leq 2013} a_{i} a_{j}.         3. **Separation of Squares**:    Since ( a_i in {1, -1} ), we know ( a_{i}^2 = 1 ) for all ( i ).

Let (1 leqslant a < b leqslant n) be such that (2^{b-a} x_{a} x_{b}) is maximal. This choice of (a) and (b) implies certain inequalities involving the (x_i) values:    - For all (1 - a leqslant t leqslant b - a - 1), we have (x_{a+t} leqslant 2^t x_{a}).    - Similarly, for (b - n leqslant t leqslant b - a + 1), we have (x_{b-t} leqslant 2^t x_{b}). 2. Suppose that (x_{a} in left(frac{1}{2^{u+1}}, frac{1}{2^u}right)) and (x_{b} in left(frac{1}{2^{v+1}}, frac{1}{2^v}right]). We denote (x_{a} = 2^{-alpha}) and (x_{b} = 2^{-beta}), where (alpha in (u, u+1]) and (beta in (v, v+1]). 3. We now bound the sum of (x_i) outside the interval ([a+u, b-v]):    - The sum of terms up to (a + u - 1) is      [      sum_{i = 1}^{a+u-1} x_i leqslant 2^u x_a left( frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} + ldots + frac{1}{2^{a+u-1}} right) < 2^u cdot x_a cdot frac{1}{1 - frac{1}{2}} = 2^u x_a cdot 2 = 2^{u+1} x_a.      ]    - Using the fact that (x_a leqslant frac{1}{2^u}), we have (2^{u+1} x_a leqslant 1). 4. Similarly, the sum of terms from (b - v + 1) to (n) is    [    sum_{i = b-v+1}^{n} x_i leqslant 2^v x_b left( frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} + ldots + frac{1}{2^{n-(b-v)+1}} right) < 2^v cdot x_b cdot 2 = 2^{v+1} x_b.    ]    - Since (x_b leqslant frac{1}{2^v}), we also have (2^{v+1} x_b leqslant 1). 5. Thus, the sum of the (x_i) values for (i) outside the interval ([a + u, b - v]) is strictly less than 2. Considering that (s = sum_{i=1}^n x_i geqslant 3), the sum of the (x_i) values in the interval ([a + u, b - v]) must be at least 1. Since each individual (x_i) can be at most 1, the interval must include at least two integers, i.e., (a + u < b - v). 6. Now, we can bound the sum (s) considering contributions in different ranges:    [    s < 2^{u+1} x_a + 2^{v+1} x_b + ((b-v) - (a+u) - 1).    ] 7. Recall the definitions of (alpha) and (beta), and applying Bernoulli's inequality:    [    2^{u+1-alpha} leqslant 1 + (u+1 - alpha), quad 2^{v+1-beta} leqslant 1 + (v+1 - beta).    ] 8. By substituting these bounds, we get:    [    2^{u+1-alpha} + 2^{v+1-beta} - (u + v + 1) leqslant 2 + 2 - (u + v + 1) = 3 - (u + v).    ] 9. This allows us to write:    [    s < (b - a) + 2^{u+1-alpha} + 2^{v+1-beta} - (u + v + 1).    ] 10. From this, it follows that:    [    s - 3 < (b - a) - (alpha + beta).    ] 11. Hence:    [    2^{s-3} < 2^{b-a - (alpha + beta)}.    ] 12. Given the maximal choice of (2^{b-a} x_a x_b), we have:    [    2^{s-3} < 2^{b-a} x_a x_b,    ]    as required.     # Conclusion: [ boxed{2^{j-i} x_{i} x_{j} > 2^{s-3}} ] boxed"},{"instruction":"Point P is a moving point on the parabola y^2 = 4x.

We aim to prove that these mappings, together with the automorphisms of ( G ), form a group that contains the group of automorphisms of ( G ) as a direct factor. 2. **Identify the canonical anti-automorphism:**    There is a canonical anti-automorphism, namely the inversion map ( i : x mapsto x^{-1} ). This map satisfies ( i^2 = 1 ) and ( i neq 1 ) (since ( G ) is non-commutative). The inversion map ( i ) commutes with all automorphisms of ( G ). 3. **Establish the relationship between automorphisms and anti-automorphisms:**    For any automorphism ( f ) of ( G ), the composition ( fi ) (where ( i ) is the inversion map) is an anti-automorphism. Conversely, for any anti-automorphism ( g ), the composition ( gi ) is an automorphism. This establishes a bijection between the automorphisms and the anti-automorphisms of ( G ). 4. **Define the group homomorphism:**    Consider the map:    [    phi: text{Aut}(G) times langle i rangle to text{Sym}(G), quad (f, g) mapsto fg    ]    where ( text{Aut}(G) ) is the group of automorphisms of ( G ), ( langle i rangle ) is the cyclic group generated by the inversion map ( i ), and ( text{Sym}(G) ) is the symmetric group on ( G ). 5. **Prove injectivity of the homomorphism:**    The map ( phi ) is injective because if ( phi(f, g) = phi(f', g') ), then ( fg = f'g' ). Since ( i ) commutes with all automorphisms, this implies ( f = f' ) and ( g = g' ). 6. **Determine the image of the homomorphism:**    The image of ( phi ) consists exactly of the automorphisms and the anti-automorphisms of ( G ). This is because any element in the image can be written as ( fg ) where ( f ) is an automorphism and ( g ) is either the identity or the inversion map ( i ). 7. **Conclude the group structure:**    The automorphisms and anti-automorphisms of ( G ) form a group isomorphic to ( text{Aut}(G) times mathbb{Z}/2 ).

Consider triangle ( HB_1 C_1 ). Since ( AH ) is the angle bisector of ( angle B_1 H C_1 ) and ( O ) lies on this bisector, it follows that ( AH ) also forms a perpendicular from ( O ) to ( B_1 C_1 ).

We are given a ruler of length 10 cm without any markings. We need to find the minimum number of intermediary divisions that cover all segment lengths from 1 cm to 10 cm (both inclusive) by using the ruler exactly once in each case. 2.

Suppose we place three divisions at points x, y, and z such that (0 < x < y < z < 10 ). This divides the ruler into four segments: ( [0, x] ), ( [x, y] ), ( [y, z] ), ( [z, 10] ). 4. Each of these segments and their combinations must result in lengths of 1 cm through 10 cm.

Notice with three divisions, we can only cover a maximum of 9 different lengths. But our requirement is for 10 distinct lengths (from 1 cm to 10 cm). This proves that three divisions are not enough. 6. Now, we need to show that four divisions are sufficient.

We need to find the roots of f(x). Checking simple values, observe that f(0) = -7 < 0 and f(1) = 3 + 17 - 23 - 7 = -10 < 0 and f(-1) = -3 + 17 + 23 - 7 = 30 > 0. Therefore, there is at least one root between -1 and 0. Applying the Rational Root Theorem, we see that if f(p/q) = 0, then p must divide 7 and q must divide 3.

To ensure the function is defined, the expression inside the logarithm must be strictly greater than zero, so (y=(t-1)^{2}) must be within the interval ((0,+infty)). Rewriting (y=(t-1)^{2}) in terms of (x), we get: [4^{x} - 2 cdot 2^{x} + 1 = (2^{x} - 1)^{2}] Since (2^{x}) is always positive for any real number (x), and since ((2^{x} - 1)^{2} geq 0) for all (x), the only restriction we have is to avoid the logarithm of zero.

Let's analyze the given statements step by step. **Step 1: Determine the eccentricity of C** Given that the distance from the focus to the asymptote is 1, we can write the relationship as frac{|cb|}{sqrt{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}}}=1. Since the distance from the center to the focus (denoted as c) is sqrt{3}, we have c=sqrt{3}.  The eccentricity e of a hyperbola is given by e=frac{c}{a}. We need to find a and b to determine e. From the relationship frac{|cb|}{sqrt{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}}}=1, substituting c=sqrt{3}, we get b=1.  Since c^2=a^2+b^2, we can solve for a: [ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 implies (sqrt{3})^2 = a^2 + 1^2 implies a^2 = 2 implies a = sqrt{2} ] Thus, the eccentricity e is: [ e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{6}}{2} ] Therefore, statement A is correct. **Step 2: Minimum value of |PF_{2}|** The minimum value of |PF_{2}| is given by c-a = sqrt{3} - sqrt{2}.

The vertices A and B are at (-sqrt{2}, 0) and (sqrt{2}, 0) respectively. The slopes of PA and PB are frac{y_{0}}{x_{0}+sqrt{2}} and frac{y_{0}}{x_{0}-sqrt{2}} respectively. The product of these slopes is: [ frac{y_{0}}{x_{0}+sqrt{2}} cdot frac{y_{0}}{x_{0}-sqrt{2}} = frac{y_{0}^2}{x_{0}^2-2} ] Given that frac{x_{0}^2}{2}-y_{0}^2=1, we can express y_{0}^2 as frac{x_{0}^2}{2}-1. Substituting this into the product of slopes, we get: [ frac{frac{x_{0}^2}{2}-1}{x_{0}^2-2} = frac{1}{2} ] Therefore, statement C is correct. **Step 4: Area of triangle PF_{1}F_{2} and angle F_{1}PF_{2}** Given that the area of triangle PF_{1}F_{2} is frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the angle theta between PF_{1} and PF_{2}. The area is given by frac{1}{2}|PF_{1}||PF_{2}|sintheta.

The square is then cut along the diagonals to form 4 congruent right triangles which are then rearranged to form a new larger square. Determine the difference in area between the new larger square formed by the triangles and the original inscribed circle.","output":"First, let's find the side length of the original square. Since the perimeter is 48 meters, each side of the square is 48 meters / 4 = 12 meters. The diameter of the inscribed circle is equal to the side length of the square, so the diameter is also 12 meters. The radius of the circle is half of the diameter, so the radius is 12 meters / 2 = 6 meters. The area of the circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius. So the area of the circle is A = π * 6^2 = 36π square meters. Now, let's find the area of the new larger square formed by the triangles. When the square is cut along the diagonals, each triangle has legs that are equal to the sides of the original square (12 meters). The hypotenuse of each triangle is the diagonal of the original square. The diagonal of a square can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, where the diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with both legs equal to the side of the square. So, the diagonal (d) is: d^2 = 12^2 + 12^2 d^2 = 144 + 144 d^2 = 288 d = √288 d = 12√2 meters When the triangles are rearranged to form a new square, the hypotenuse of each triangle becomes the side of the new square. So, each side of the new square is 12√2 meters. The area of the new square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the side length. So the area of the new square is A = (12√2)^2 = 144 * 2 = 288 square meters. Finally, the difference in area between the new larger square and the original inscribed circle is: Difference = Area of new square - Area of circle Difference = 288 - 36π square meters Since π is approximately 3.14159, we can calculate the numerical value of the difference: Difference ≈ 288 - 36 * 3.14159 Difference ≈ 288 - 113.09724 Difference ≈ 174.90276 square meters Therefore, the difference in area between the new larger square formed by the triangles and the original inscribed circle is approximately boxed{174.90276}  square meters."},{"instruction":"Given vectors vec{a}=(3,m) and vec{b}=(1,2), find the value of m such that vec{a}cdotvec{b}=vec{b}^2.","output":"This problem involves operations on the coordinates of planar vectors and the application of conditions for vector collinearity to obtain the result. Step 1: Apply the dot product formula to the given vectors. Recall that the dot product of two vectors vec{u}=(u_1,u_2) and vec{v}=(v_1,v_2) is given by vec{u}cdotvec{v}=u_1v_1+u_2v_2. Thus, we have vec{a}cdotvec{b}=(3,m)cdot(1,-2)=3cdot1+mcdot(-2)=3-2m.  Step 2: Calculate the squared magnitude of vector vec{b}. Recall that the magnitude of a vector vec{u}=(u_1,u_2) is given by |vec{u}|=sqrt{u_1^2+u_2^2}, and its square is given by (vec{u})^2=u_1^2+u_2^2. Thus, we have vec{b}^2=(1,-2)^2=1^2+(-2)^2=1+4=5.  Step 3: Use the given equation vec{a}cdotvec{b}=vec{b}^2 to solve for m. Substituting our results from Steps 1 and 2 into the equation, we obtain 3-2m=5.

Prove that the number of ordered ( n )tuples ( (x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) ) with ( 0 leq x_{i} < p ) such that ( f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) ) is an integer multiple of ( p ) is an integer multiple of ( p ).","output":"We are given a polynomial f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) with integer coefficients and total degree less than n. We need to prove that the number of ordered n-tuples (x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) with 0 leq x_{i}<p such that f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) is an integer multiple of p is an integer multiple of p. 1. **Setup and use of Fermat's Little Theorem**:    By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer a not divisible by a prime p, we have a^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}. For a equiv 0 pmod{p}, a^{p-1} equiv 0 pmod{p}.    Hence, the expression f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n})^{p-1} is:    - 0 pmod{p} if f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) equiv 0 pmod{p}.    - 1 pmod{p} if f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) notequiv 0 pmod{p}.    Thus, we can rewrite the sum as:    [    S = sum_{0 leq x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}<p} f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n})^{p-1}    ] 2. **Counting zeros mod (p)**:    If z is the number of tuples for which f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) equiv 0 pmod{p}, then the sum S can be expressed as:    [    S = p^{n} - z    ]    Since f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n})^{p-1} equiv 0 pmod{p} for zeros of f, and 1 pmod{p} elsewhere, thus:    [    S equiv p^{n} - z equiv -z pmod{p}    ]    To show z equiv 0 pmod{p}, we must show S equiv 0 pmod{p}. 3. **Considering polynomial expansion and sums**:    Expanding f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n})^{p-1} as a polynomial, we note each term is of the form:    [    sum_{0 leq x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}<p} c_{a_{1}, ldots, a_{n}} x_{1}^{a_{1}} cdots x_{n}^{a_{n}}    ]    This can be written as:    [    S = sum_{a_{1}, ldots, a_{n}} c_{a_{1}, ldots, a_{n}} left( sum_{0 leq x_{1} < p} x_{1}^{a_{1}} right) cdots left( sum_{0 leq x_{n} < p} x_{n}^{a_{n}} right)    ] 4. **Simplifying the inner sums**:    We claim that at least one factor sum_{0 leq x_{i} < p} x_{i}^{a_{i}} in the product is zero modulo p. Since f has degree less than n, implying that the degree of f^{p-1} is at most (n-1)(p-1), not every a_{i} can be p-1. Therefore, for some i, we have 0 leq a_{i} < p-1. 5. **Proving T equiv 0 pmod{p} for each factor**:    Let T := sum_{0 leq x < p} x^{a} where 0 leq a < p-1. For a=0, it's clear that:    [    T = p equiv 0 pmod{p}    ]    For 0 < a < p-1, we can consider the non-trivial case. Since the equation y^a equiv 1 pmod{p} has at most a roots, choose y such that y^a notequiv 1 pmod{p}. Then:    [    (y^a - 1) T = sum_{0 leq x < p} (xy)^a - sum_{0 leq x < p} x^a    ]    Noticing that {xy mid 0 leq x < p} is just a permutation of {x mid 0 leq x < p}:    [    (y^a - 1) T equiv 0 pmod{p}    ]    Since y^a not equiv 1 pmod{p}, we conclude:    [    T equiv 0 pmod{p}    ] 6. **Final conclusion**:    Since S is a sum of products where each product has at least one term T equiv 0 pmod{p}, every such product is zero modulo p. Thus:    [    S equiv 0 pmod{p}    ]    Hence:    [    -z equiv 0 pmod{p}    ]    This implies:    [    z equiv 0 pmod{p}    ] Conclusion: [ boxed{z} ]"},{"instruction":"Jean is trying to motivate herself to write her final 20page paper in just 4 hours.

Similarly, train B takes 4 more hours to reach its destination, so the remaining distance for train B is ( V_b times 4 ) km. Since they are traveling towards each other from two destinations, the sum of the distances they cover before and after meeting should be equal.

Thus, the equation becomes e^{-2x} + x - 1 - kx = 0. Let g(x) = e^{-2x} + x - 1, we find g(0) = 0. The derivative g'(x) = -2e^{-2x} + 1 is always less than or equal to -1, which means g(x) is strictly decreasing. The line h(x) = kx passes through the origin (0,0), and for y = f(x) - |x-1| - kx to have exactly one root, the slope of h(x) must be such that it touches g(x) only once, which requires k geq -1. **For 0 < x < 1**, the absolute value in the equation opens negatively, so we solve e^{2x} - (x - 1) - kx = 0.

This ensures that for any k, the line h(x) = kx will intersect l(x) at most once. Combining all three conditions, we get that the range of the real number k must satisfy both k geq -1 and k leq 3.

It is considered a medium-level question. By deducing the range of angles from the values of trigonometric functions and then discussing cases, we conclude that A is an acute angle. Then, by using the sine formula for the sum of two angles to find sin C, and applying the sine rule, we can solve for a, thus resolving the problem. **Solution** If A is an obtuse angle, because sin A= frac{5}{13} < frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2} > cos B= frac{3}{5} > frac{1}{2}, therefore 150^circ < A < 180^circ, 30^circ < B < 60^circ, therefore A+B > 180^circ, which is a contradiction, Hence, A is an acute angle, because sin A= frac{5}{13} < frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2} > cos B= frac{3}{5} > frac{1}{2}, therefore 0 < A < 30^circ < B < 60^circ, and cos A= frac{12}{13}, sin B= frac{4}{5} therefore C is an obtuse angle, therefore c is the longest, being 63, and a is the shortest, therefore sin C=sin (A+B)=sin Acos B+cos Asin B= frac{5}{13} times frac{3}{5}+ frac{12}{13} times frac{4}{5}= frac{63}{65}, By the sine rule, we have frac{a}{sin A}= frac{c}{sin C}, therefore a= frac{63}{frac{63}{65}} times frac{5}{13}=25, hence the shortest is a=25, Therefore, the answer is boxed{25}."},{"instruction":"There are two arithmetic sequences: 2, 6, 10, ..., 190 and 2, 8, 14, ..., 200.

We can observe that a number will be common to both sequences if and only if it can be written as both 2 + 4k and 2 + 6m for some integers k and m.  This implies that the number minus two must be a common multiple of 4 and 6. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 6 is 12, so the common terms must be of the form 2 + 12n for some integer n. Next, we need to find the range for n: - The smallest value of the common term is clearly 2 (when n = 0). - The largest common term from the first sequence is 190, and from the second sequence is 200. We need to find the largest term of the form 2 + 12n that is less than or equal to 190: 2 + 12n leq 190 implies 12n leq 188 implies n leq frac{188}{12} implies n leq 15. Hence, the common terms are 2 + 12n for n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 15. Now we calculate the sum of the common terms. The sum S of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:  S = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n),  where n is the number of terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the last term. In this sequence, the first term a_1 is 2, the last term a_{16} is 2 + 12 times 15 = 182, and the number of terms is 16. Thus,  S = frac{16}{2}(2 + 182) = 8 times 184 = 1472.

Consider the problem's conditions: 10 gnomes raised their hands for liking vanilla ice cream, 5 gnomes for chocolate, and 1 gnome for fruit-flavored ice cream. Therefore, the total number of hands raised is:    [    10 + 5 + 1 = 16    ] 3. Each truthful gnome would raise their hand only once for their favorite ice cream flavor. Each lying gnome, on the other hand, would raise their hand twice (one for each flavor they claim to like other than their actual preference).

This is because adding one more term to the set {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n+k}} either introduces a new distinct element or it does not.    - If a_{i+1} = a_i, then a_{k+i+1} must be one of the elements in {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{k+i}}.    - If a_{i+1} = a_i + 1, then a_{k+i+1} must be a new distinct element not in {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{k+i}}. 3. **Defining Operations:**    - Let + denote the operation a_i rightarrow a_{i+1} when a_{i+1} = a_i + 1.    - Let square denote the operation a_i rightarrow a_{i+1} when a_{i+1} = a_i. 4. **Sequence Construction:**    - The sequence {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{k+1}} determines the entire sequence.    - If we know the order of + and square operations in the first k+1 terms, we can extend this pattern to the entire sequence. 5. **Counting Distinct Elements:**    - Let m be the number of + operations in the first k+1 terms. Then there are k-m square operations.    - The number of distinct elements in the sequence {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{k+1}} is m+1.    - Therefore, a_1 = m+1. 6. **Combinatorial Counting:**    - For each m (where 0 leq m leq k), there are binom{k}{m} ways to choose the positions of the + operations.    - Summing over all possible values of m, we get the total number of k-pop sequences.

Since |w| = 3, the set of complex numbers for w^2 lie on a circle with radius |w|^2 = 9. The distance between 6 + 5i and w^2 is maximized when w^2 lies on the line passing through the origin and 6 + 5i. This line will intersect the circle at the furthest point from 6 + 5i. This intersection gives the required point of w^2 which maximizes the distance from 6 + 5i. Given the original complex number location w^2, this setup implies rotating the vector for 6 + 5i to point directly opposite on the identified radius 9 circle. If 6 + 5i is mapped to the vector form (e.g., polar coordinate expression), it lies approximately 53.13^circ from the real axis.

A: y^{2}=4x B: y^{2}=2x C: x^{2}=4y D: x^{2}=2y","output":"Given that the directrix of parabola C is y=-1, we aim to find the standard equation of parabola C. Step 1: Understand the relationship between the directrix and the focus of a parabola. Since the directrix is a horizontal line (y=-1), the parabola opens upwards or downwards, and its focus is on the y-axis. For simplicity and based on the given options, we assume the parabola opens upwards. Step 2: The general equation for a parabola opening upwards or downwards is x^{2}=4py, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus and also to the directrix. Step 3: The vertex of the parabola is midway between the focus and the directrix. Given the directrix y=-1, let's assume the focus is at (0, p-1), where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus. The vertex, therefore, is at (0, -1 + frac{p}{2}). Step 4: Since the directrix is y=-1 and it is p units away from the vertex, we set up the equation -frac{p}{2} = -1 to find the value of p. Step 5: Solving for p in the equation -frac{p}{2} = -1, we get -frac{p}{2} = -1 Rightarrow p = 2. Step 6: Substituting p = 2 into the general equation of the parabola x^{2}=4py, we get x^{2}=4(2)y Rightarrow x^{2}=8y. Correction Step: Notice that in the initial setup, the assumption made about the focus and directrix relationship was slightly misinterpreted. The correct interpretation should lead directly to the equation x^{2}=4py with the correct value of p=2, resulting in the equation x^{2}=4y without the multiplication error.

Let (e_1, e_2, e_3) be the vectors of three consecutive segments of the given broken line in space with all segments having the same length and each set of three consecutive segments being pairwise perpendicular. 2. Since each segment is perpendicular to the other two in the set of three, by definition, after (e_3), the next vector must be perpendicular to both (e_2) and (e_3). Therefore, the sequence of vectors will look like: [ (e_1, e_2, e_3, pm e_1, pm e_2, pm e_3, ldots) ] 3. This indicates that the sequence of vectors repeats every three segments, implying that the number of segments must be a multiple of 3. 4. Furthermore, since the broken line is closed, it must return to the starting point, meaning the net vector displacement around the closed loop must be zero. 5. Therefore, for each vector (e_1), there must be a corresponding vector (-e_1) to cancel it out. The same holds true for vectors (e_2) and (e_3). 6. This condition on the net displacement being zero enforces that the counts of vectors (e_1) and (-e_1), (e_2) and (-e_2), and (e_3) and (-e_3) must be equal.

This is because, by the Law of Cosines, b^{2}=a^{2}+c^{2}-2accos B. Comparing this with the given equation, we get:    [    2accos B = 2ac - ca implies cos B = frac{2ac - ca}{2ac} = frac{a^{2}+c^{2}-b^{2}}{2ac}    ]    Substituting the given condition into this equation, we find:    [    cos B = frac{1}{2}    ] 3. **Determine Angle B**: Knowing that cos B = frac{1}{2} and considering that B is an angle in a triangle (hence Bin (0,pi)), we can conclude that:    [    B = frac{pi}{3}    ] 4. **Use the Sine Rule**: Given sin A = 2sin C and applying the Sine Rule, which states frac{a}{sin A} = frac{c}{sin C}, we can deduce that:    [    a = 2c    ] 5. **Calculate b in Terms of c**: Substituting a = 2c into the given equation b^{2}=c^{2}+a^{2}-ca, we get:    [    b^{2} = c^{2} + (2c)^{2} - 2ccdot c = 3c^{2}    ]    Therefore, we find that:    [    b = sqrt{3}c    ] 6. **Determine the Shape of triangle ABC**: Since we have a = 2c and b = sqrt{3}c, and it's known that a^{2} = b^{2} + c^{2}, this implies that triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A.

We need to show that if a point ( P ) belongs to the interior of ( D ), then we can find two distinct points ( Q ) and ( R ) in ( S ) such that ( P ) is the midpoint of ( QR ). Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. **Initial Assumptions and Setup**:     - ( D ) is the smallest disk that contains ( S ).      - ( C ) is the boundary (circle) of the disk ( D ).     - Suppose ( C ) does not contain a point ( X ). 2. **Contradiction Proof**:     - Since ( S ) is closed, it does not include a neighborhood of ( X ).     - Find a small circle ( C' ) centered at ( X ) such that the disk ( D' ) enclosed by ( C' ) lies entirely outside the set ( S ).     - ( C' ) meets ( C ) at points ( A ) and ( B ).          Construct another circle ( C'' ) through points ( A ) and ( B) as follows:          - The center of ( C'' ) should be on the same side of the chord ( AB ) as the center of ( C ), but further away, ensuring ( C'' ) has a larger radius than ( C ).     - ( C'' ) will thus contain all the points of ( D setminus D' ) and hence all points of ( S ).          However, ( C'' ) does not contain all points of disk ( D ), leading to a contradiction. Therefore, ( S ) contains all points on ( C ).  3. **Midpoint of Chord]:     - Since any point ( P ) inside ( D ) can be the midpoint of some chord ( QR) of ( C ).     - ( C = partial D implies S text{ contains the chord endpoints } Q text{ and } R). So, if (P) is any point in the interior of (D), we can indeed find points (Q) and (R) in (S) such that (P) is their midpoint. This follows because: - For every point ( P ) in the interior of disk ( D ), ( C ) (which lies on ( S )) can be used to determine points ( Q, R ) on ( C ) such that ( P ) is the midpoint of ( QR ). Hence, it concludes that for any point ( P in text{interior}(D) ), there exist distinct points ( Q, R in S ) such that ( P ) is the midpoint of ( QR ).

Calculate (angle DBC):    [    angle DBC = 180^circ - angle ABD = 180^circ - 77^circ = 103^circ    ] 5. Since (BC = CD), (triangle BCD) is isosceles with (angle BCD = n^circ). 6. In (triangle BCD), the sum of the internal angles is (180^circ):    [    angle BCD + angle DBC + angle BDC = 180^circ    ] 7. Let (angle BDC = angle DBC = x). Since (angle DBC = 103^circ), we have:    [    x + x + n = 180^circ    ]    [    2x + n = 180^circ    ] 8.

Since (n) must be a positive integer, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's consider the symmetry and properties of the quadrilateral more carefully. 10. Given the symmetry and the angles, we can use the fact that (angle BCD) is influenced by the isosceles property and the given angles. We need to find a consistent value for (n) that fits all conditions. 11.

Every plane or spherical surface containing points A and B intersects with every (distinct) plane or sphere that C and D lie on. What is the geometric configuration of these four points?","output":"1. **Introduction to the Problem:**    We have four distinct points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) in space. It is given that any plane or sphere passing through the points ( A ) and ( B ) intersects every plane or sphere passing through ( C ) and ( D ) but not containing ( A ) and ( B ). We must determine the possible configurations of these four points. 2. **Step 1: Common Point Argument:**    The line segments ( AB ) and ( CD ) must intersect at a common point; otherwise, it would be possible to construct a plane ( S ) that separates these segments. If such a plane ( S ) existed, we could find spheres that contain ( AB ) and ( CD ), and these spheres would touch ( S ) and hence not intersect each other, contradicting the problem's condition. 3. **Constructing a Sphere through ( A ) and ( B ):**    Suppose there is a sphere passing through points ( A ) and ( B ). To find the center ( O ) of such a sphere:    - Let the intersection point of the line ( AB ) with the plane ( S ) be ( P ).    - A circle in ( S ) centered at ( P ) with radius ( r = sqrt{PA cdot PB} ).    - The intersection of a line perpendicular to ( S ) at point ( E ) and the perpendicular bisector plane of ( AB ) gives the center ( O ) of the sphere. 4. **Special Case - Parallel Planes:**    If ( AB ) is parallel to ( S ), let the projection of the midpoint of ( AB ) onto ( S ) be ( F ). It is straightforward to construct a sphere passing through ( A ) and ( B ) that touches ( S ) at point ( F ). Similarly, we can construct a sphere for ( C ) and ( D ). 5. **Examining the Convex Hull:**    The convex hull of ( A, B, C, D ) cannot be a triangle, nor can it include either of the segments ( AB ) or ( CD ). If either situation occurred, the sphere containing one pair of points could encapsulate the sphere containing the other pair, violating the problem conditions. 6. **Line or Circle Configuration:**    From the above arguments, if the four points lie on a straight line, ( A ) and ( B ) must separate ( C ) from ( D ). If they don’t lie on a line, then ( AB ) and ( CD ) intersect at some internal point. 7. **Proving the Circle Case:**    Assume ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) form a cyclic quadrilateral. If ( D ) is not on the circle circumscribing the triangle ( ABC ), then:    - The perpendicular bisector of ( CD ) intersects line ( OC ) at a point ( Q ).    - A sphere centered at ( Q ) with radius ( QC ) won’t intersect the sphere centered at ( O ) with radius ( OA ), given the problem’s conditions. 8. **Conclusion:**    Summarizing the observations:    - If the four points lie on a line, ( A ) and ( B ) separate ( C ) from ( D ).    - If the four points are not collinear, the segments ( AB ) and ( CD ) intersect in their interior forming a cyclic quadrilateral. Therefore, the four points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) must either lie on a single line or on a circle, structured such that ( A ) and ( B ) separate ( C ) from ( D ).

Let a_k represent Alice's number after k seconds, and let p_k be its smallest prime divisor.  Step 1: Consider the case when a_0 is even: 1. Since a_0 is even, it can be written as a_0 = 2m for some integer m. 2. Every second, Alice will subtract 2 from her number (smallest prime divisor of an even number is 2):    [    a_{n+1} = a_n - 2    ] 3. After 2022 seconds, the equation becomes:    [    a_{2022} = a_0 - 2022 cdot 2    ] 4. Given that a_{2022} is a prime number and the smallest even prime number is 2:    [    a_{2022} = 2    ] 5. Substituting a_{2022}:    [    2 = a_0 - 4044    ]    [    a_0 = 4046    ]  Step 2: Consider the case when a_0 is odd: 1. Let a_0 be an odd number. 2. In this case, the smallest prime divisor p_0 of a_0 must be subtracted first, resulting in:    [    a_1 = a_0 - p_0    ] 3. Since a_0 is odd, its smallest prime divisor, p_0, must also be an odd number, making a_1 even. 4. After the first subtraction, a_1 will be even, and thereafter every second subtraction involves subtracting 2:    [    a_{n+1} = a_n - 2, text{ for } n ge 1    ] 5. Hence, by similar logic to when a_0 was even, after 2021 seconds from a_1 being even, we have:    [    a_{2021} = a_1 - 2020 cdot 2    ] 6. Since a_{2022} must be a prime and since a_1 is even:    [    a_{2022} = 2    ] 7. Thus:    [    2 = a_1 - 4040    ]    [    a_1 = 4044    ] 8. Furthermore:    [    a_0 - p_0 = 4044    ] 9. Considering the factors of 4044:    [    4044 = 4 cdot 3 cdot 337    ] 10. Possible values for p_0 are 3 and 337. If p_0 = 337, then a_0 = 4044 + 337 = 4381 which implies 337 is not the smallest prime divisor of a_0 (contradicts p_0 being smallest). Thus:    [    p_0 = 3    ] 11.

Also, given f(0)+f(3)=6, we need to analyze the properties of f(x) based on these conditions. 1. Since f(x+1) is an odd function, we have:    - f(1)=0 because odd functions satisfy f(-x)=-f(x), and for x=0, it implies f(1)=-f(1), which means f(1)=0.    - The function f(x) is symmetric about the point (1,0) because f(x+1)=-f(-x+1). 2. Since f(x+2) is an even function, we have:    - f(x+2)=f(-x+2), indicating that f(x) is symmetric about the line x=2. 3. From the properties of odd and even functions, we derive that:    - f(x+2)=-f(-x) by substituting x with x+1 in the odd function property and using the even function property.    - Letting t=-x, we get f(t+2)=-f(t), and consequently, f(t+4)=f(t), showing that f(x) has a period of 4. Therefore, statement A is correct because the period of f(x) is 4. 4. The symmetry about x=2 and the periodicity imply that x=6 is also a line of symmetry for f(x), making statement B correct. 5.

Therefore, when xin [1,2], f(x)=-2x^{2}+2, which contradicts statement C; hence, C is incorrect. 6.

The total number of ways to select 4 children from 12 is: C(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12 - 4)!) = 12! / (4! * 8!) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 495 Now, let's calculate the number of ways to select at least 2 girls and 2 boys.

Next, we need to analyze the minimum number of weights by proving that it cannot be done with fewer than 6 weights:     - Assume that we can use 5 weights instead of 6. By counting all possible combinations of two weights, we have: (5 cdot 5 - 5 = 10) possible combinations because the combinations of the same two weights (w_i + w_i = 2w_i).     - Let's count the total weights we should achieve:          Only possess (w_i) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, 5) for single weight weighing.          - For odd weights, the total count is 10 and is derived from the equation:       (k + k(5 - k)).

This means that the angle theta must be in the fourth quadrant because that is where sine is positive and cosine is negative. For option A, we consider the relationship between theta and the given point. Since cos theta = sin 2, we can use the co-function identity sin 2 = cos(frac{pi}{2} - 2).

Note that the statement of the problem is invariant under translations of (x); thus, without loss of generality, we may assume that the numbers (d_{1}, d_{2}, ldots, d_{9}) are positive integers. 2. Observe that there are only eight prime numbers smaller than 20. These primes are (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19). 3. Consider the polynomial (P(x)=left(x+d_{1}right)left(x+d_{2}right) cdots left(x+d_{9}right)). Since (P(x)) has nine factors and there are only eight primes below 20, it follows that (P(x)) must be divisible by a prime number greater than 20 when (x) is sufficiently large.  4. We will now show that for (N = d^8), where (d = max {d_{1}, d_{2}, ldots, d_{9}}), (P(x)) is divisible by a prime greater than 20 for all integers (x geq N). 5. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there is some integer (x geq N) such that (P(x)) is composed exclusively of primes smaller than 20.  6. For each index (i in {1, 2, ldots, 9}), the number (x + d_i) must be expressed as a product of powers of the small primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19). 7. Since (x + d_i > x geq d^8), there exists some prime power (f_i > d) that divides (x + d_i). 8. By the pigeonhole principle, since we have nine factors and only eight primes, there must be two distinct indices (i) and (j) such that (f_i) and (f_j) are powers of the same prime number. 9. Without loss of generality, assume (f_i leq f_j). Then, both (x + d_i) and (x + d_j) are divisible by (f_i), and hence the difference (|d_i - d_j|) must also be divisible by (f_i). 10. However, since (0 < |d_i - d_j| leq max{d_i, d_j} leq d < f_i), this is a contradiction because (d) cannot be divisible by (f_i) (as (f_i > d)). 11. Therefore, our assumption that (P(x)) is composed only of primes smaller than 20 for some (x geq N) must be false. # Conclusion Thus, there exists an integer (N) such that for all integers (x geq N), the number (P(x)) is divisible by a prime number greater than 20.

Let ( H_A, H_B, H_C, H_D ) be the orthocenters of the same triangles. 2. **Show similarity between ( G_A G_B G_C G_D ) and ( ABCD ):**    We need to show that the quadrilateral ( G_A G_B G_C G_D ) is similar to ( ABCD ) with a similarity ratio of ( frac{1}{3} ). 3. **Use properties of centroids:**    Recall that the centroid ( G ) of a triangle divides each median in the ratio ( 2:1 ). For example, in triangle ( BCD ), the centroid ( G_A ) divides the median from ( C ) to the midpoint of ( BD ) in the ratio ( 2:1 ). 4. **Homothety with center ( O ):**    Consider a homothety centered at ( O ) (the circumcenter of ( ABCD )) with a ratio of ( 3 ). This homothety maps each centroid ( G ) to the corresponding orthocenter ( H ). Specifically, ( G_A ) maps to ( H_A ), ( G_B ) maps to ( H_B ), and so on. 5. **Parallelism and segment ratios:**    Let ( M ) be the midpoint of ( AB ). The centroid ( G_D ) divides the segment ( CM ) in the ratio ( 1:2 ), and the centroid ( G_C ) divides the segment ( DM ) in the same ratio. Therefore, ( G_C G_D parallel CD ) and ( G_C G_D = frac{1}{3} CD ). 6. **Conclusion:**    Since ( G_A G_B G_C G_D ) is similar to ( ABCD ) with a similarity ratio of ( frac{1}{3} ), and the homothety with center ( O ) and ratio ( 3 ) maps ( G_A G_B G_C G_D ) to ( H_A H_B H_C H_D ), it follows that ( H_A H_B H_C H_D ) is congruent to ( ABCD ).

The atomic weights for these elements are approximately: - Aluminum (Al): 26.98 g/mol - Phosphorus (P): 30.97 g/mol - Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol The compound is composed of aluminum, 1 phosphorus, and 4 oxygen atoms. Let's denote the number of aluminum atoms as \\"n\\". The molecular weight of the compound is given as 122 g/mol. The molecular weight of the compound can be calculated as follows: Molecular weight = (n × atomic weight of Al) + (1 × atomic weight of P) + (4 × atomic weight of O) Substituting the known values: 122 g/mol = (n × 26.98 g/mol) + (1 × 30.97 g/mol) + (4 × 16.00 g/mol) Now, let's calculate the total weight of 1 phosphorus atom and 4 oxygen atoms: Weight of P and O = (1 × 30.97 g/mol) + (4 × 16.00 g/mol) Weight of P and O = 30.97 g/mol + 64.00 g/mol Weight of P and O = 94.97 g/mol Subtracting the weight of P and O from the total molecular weight, we get the weight of aluminum in the compound: Weight of Al = 122 g/mol - 94.97 g/mol Weight of Al = 27.03 g/mol Now, we divide the weight of aluminum by the atomic weight of aluminum to find the number of aluminum atoms: n = Weight of Al / atomic weight of Al n = 27.03 g/mol / 26.98 g/mol n ≈ 1 Therefore, there is approximately boxed{1}  aluminum atom in the compound."},{"instruction":"Calculate the value of dfrac{11!}{7!4!} times 2 without using a calculator.","output":"To solve the problem, let's first simplify the combination: [ dfrac{11!}{7!4!} = dfrac{11 times 10 times 9 times 8 times (7!)}{7! times (4 times 3 times 2 times 1)} = dfrac{11 times 10 times 9 times 8}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} ] Now, simplify further: [ dfrac{11 times 10 times 9 times 8}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = dfrac{11 times 10 times 9 times 8}{24} = dfrac{7920}{24} = 330 ] Considering the multiplication by 2 in the problem: [ 330 times 2 = 660 ] Therefore, the final result is boxed{660}."},{"instruction":"the diagram, angle ABC and angle ADB are each right angles.

The Emperor would like to close  k  of these companies such that it is still possible to reach any planet from any other planet. Find the maximum value of  k  for which this is always possible.  (D. Karpov)","output":"1. **Restate the problem with variables:**    Let n = 10^{2015} be the number of planets (vertices) and m = 2015 be the number of travel companies (colors). We need to find the maximum number k of companies that can be closed while ensuring the graph remains connected. 2. **Define the graph and its properties:**    We have a complete graph K_n with n vertices, where each edge is colored with one of m colors. We need to find the maximum k such that removing any k colors leaves the graph connected. 3. **Graph decomposition:**    Consider the graph G_1 formed by the edges of the k colors we choose to remove, and G_2 formed by the remaining m-k colors. Note that G_2 is the complement of G_1. 4. **Connectivity argument:**    If G_1 is disconnected, then G_2 must be connected. Suppose G_1 is disconnected with connected components C_1, C_2, ldots, C_r where r > 1. Any edge between vertices in different components C_i and C_j must be in G_2, ensuring G_2 is connected. 5. **Maximizing k:**    We can always delete at least lfloor m/2 rfloor colors and still have a connected graph. This is because if k leq lfloor m/2 rfloor, then m-k geq lceil m/2 rceil, ensuring G_2 has enough edges to remain connected. 6. **Constructing a critical example:**    To show that lfloor m/2 rfloor is the maximum, construct a graph where removing lfloor m/2 rfloor + 1 colors disconnects the graph. Let k = lfloor m/2 rfloor + 1. Consider sets V_1 with k vertices and V_2 with binom{m}{k} vertices. Map each set of k colors to a vertex in V_2 and color edges between V_1 and V_2 such that each color in the set is used exactly once. 7. **Ensuring disconnection:**    If we remove any k colors, there will be a vertex in V_2 that becomes isolated, as it will lose all its incident edges. This construction ensures that removing lfloor m/2 rfloor + 1 colors disconnects the graph. 8. **Vertex count:**    The number of vertices in G is k + binom{m}{k} < lfloor m/2 rfloor + 1 + 2^m < 10^m. We can add dummy vertices to reach exactly 10^m vertices without affecting the connectivity properties.

It requires the flexible application of the relationship between roots and coefficients. Let the equation of the line l passing through the point P(2,1) be (y-1) = k(x-2). The line intersects the function f(x) at points A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2). By combining the equation of the line with the analytic expression of the function f(x), we can determine the values of (x_1 + x_2) and (x_1x_2) through the relationship between roots and coefficients. This allows us to find the value of (y_1 + y_2), which can then be substituted into the dot product formula for vectors to solve the problem. Solution process: 1. Let the equation of the line l passing through the point P(2,1) be (y-1) = k(x-2). 2. The line intersects the function f(x) at points A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2). 3.

It is cyclic because:    [    angle AIX equiv angle AIB = angle ACF equiv angle ACX    ]    Since angle CXI = 90^circ, the circumcenter of AXCI is the midpoint of CI, which is the diagonal of the square CAIJ.

The right triangle triangle IMJ is isosceles, and BM cuts the arcs JI, Q_1Q_2 at their midpoints M, S'. Thus, triangle Q_1S'Q_2 is isosceles with Q_1S' = Q_2S' and angle Q_2Q_1S = angle Q_1Q_2S' = 45^circ. 9. **Final Congruence:**    Since angle Q_1XQ_2 = angle Q_1ZQ_2 = 90^circ, X, Z lie on (M_2). The angle angle AZK equiv angle Q_2ZS = 45^circ spans the same arc Q_2S' as angle Q_2Q_1S' = 45^circ, so S' equiv S. Thus, triangle Q_1SQ_2 is isosceles with angle Q_1SQ_2 = 90^circ and Q_1S = Q_2S. Similarly, triangle P_1SP_2 and triangle R_1SR_2 are isosceles with angle P_1SP_2 = angle R_1SR_2 = 90^circ and P_1S = P_2S, R_1S = R_2S. Therefore, triangle P_2Q_2R_2 is obtained from triangle P_1Q_1R_1 by a 90^circ rotation around S, proving the triangles are congruent. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given that a > 0, a neq 1, and log_{a}3 < log_{a}2, the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = log_{a}x in the interval [a, 3a] differ by 1. 1.

First, consider the vector expressions for ( overrightarrow{PQ} ):          [     overrightarrow{PQ} = overrightarrow{PA} + overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{BQ}      ]     and          [     overrightarrow{PQ} = overrightarrow{PK} + overrightarrow{KL} + overrightarrow{LQ}     ] 3. **Combining Vector Equations:**     Add these vector equations:          [     overrightarrow{PQ} = overrightarrow{PA} + overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{BQ} = overrightarrow{PK} + overrightarrow{KL} + overrightarrow{LQ}     ]     Considering that (overrightarrow{PA} = overrightarrow{PK} / 2 ) and (overrightarrow{BQ} = overrightarrow{LQ}/2 ), we get:          [     2 overrightarrow{PQ} = overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{KL}     ]     Hence:          [     overrightarrow{PQ} = frac{overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{KL}}{2}     ] 4. **Vectors for Adjacent Sides:**     Similarly, for the vector ( overrightarrow{QR} ):          [     overrightarrow{QR} = frac{overrightarrow{BC} + overrightarrow{LM}}{2}     ]     Note that in general, for squares, ( overrightarrow{BC} ) can be obtained from ( overrightarrow{AB} ) by a rotation of ( 90^circ ). Similarly, ( overrightarrow{LM} ) can be obtained from ( overrightarrow{KL} ) by a rotation of ( 90^circ ). 5. **Perpendicularity and Lengths:**     Since rotations by ( 90^circ ) are involved, the lengths and perpendicularity properties are conserved:          [     overrightarrow{QR} = frac{overrightarrow{BC} + overrightarrow{LM}}{2}     ]     Notice that both ( overrightarrow{BC} ) and ( overrightarrow{LM} ) are the result of rotating ( overrightarrow{AB} ) and ( overrightarrow{KL} ) by ( 90^circ ). 6. **Conclusion:**     From these observations, ( overrightarrow{QR} ) is simply ( overrightarrow{PQ} ) rotated by ( 90^circ ). This rotation implies that ( overrightarrow{PQ} ) and ( overrightarrow{QR} ) are perpendicular and have equal lengths. This orthogonality and equality also hold for the remaining sides ( overrightarrow{RS} ) and ( overrightarrow{SP} ). Consequently, the quadrilateral ( PQRS ) has all equal sides and perpendicular adjacent sides, confirming that it is a square.

That is,    [    a_{1} x^{2} + b_{1} x + c_{1} > 0     ]    can be rewritten as    [    k (a_{2} x^{2} + b_{2} x + c_{2}) > 0    ]    for some constant k > 0. This multiplication does not change the set of x values that satisfy the inequality, implying that Q is a sufficient condition for P. 2. **Check if Q is necessary for P:**    Consider counterexamples to test whether the solution condition Q is necessary. For instance:    - Take the quadratic inequalities:      [      x^{2} - 3x + 2 > 0      ]      and      [      -x^{2} + 3x - 2 > 0.       ]    - The solutions to these inequalities are different.

To minimize the variance, we want to minimize the sum of the squared deviations. We notice that x and y are symmetric around the median (10). If x and y move closer to each other (and hence to the median), the sum of the squared deviations will decrease, since we are reducing the squared deviation of these two terms without affecting the others.

We need to find a number that is stationary during both the left-to-right and the right-to-left passes, meaning it doesn't get swapped at all. 1. **Interpret the given numbers and objective**:      - There are natural numbers from 1 to 1982.     - The machine performs two passes over these numbers:       - The first pass moves left to right and swaps adjacent numbers if a larger number is on the left.       - The second pass moves right to left and swaps adjacent numbers if a larger number is on the left. 2. **Analyze given conditions**:      - We are given that the number at the 100th position does not move in both passes. 3. **Consider edge cases involving this stationary nature**:     - If the number remains stationary through both passes, it is neither the largest number in the first 99 numbers nor the smallest number in the last 1882 numbers. 4. **Identify constraints on our number**:     - Let the number in the 100th position be ( k ).     - For ( k ) not to move, it must be larger than all numbers to its left (positions 1 to 99) after the first pass.     - Additionally, ( k ) must be smaller than all numbers to its right (positions 101 to 1982) after the second pass. 5. **Formulate the hypothesis**:     - The number ( k ) must be positioned such that:       [       max(text{positions 1 to 99}) < k < min(text{positions 101 to 1982})       ] 6. **Determine the possible value of ( k )**:     - Since the machine examines all sequential pairs and swaps values accordingly, the sequences on either side of the 100th position approach sorted order due to multiple passes.     - The simplest number to fit this criteria would be 100 itself in a naturally ordered list. 7. **Verification**:     - If we place ( k = 100 ) at the 100th position and the initial sequence is in ascending order, then:       - It will not be swapped with any number to its left because all numbers to its left are smaller.       - It will not be swapped with any number to its right because all numbers to its right are larger. 8. **Conclusion**:     - Given the conditions,       [       boxed{100}       ]     - The number at the 100th position in the sorted order sequence from 1 to 1982 is 100."},{"instruction":"the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, given point A(0,3) and line l: y=2x4, suppose circle C has a radius of 1 and its center C lies on line l.

Case 2: Line not passing through the origin - Assume the line has intercepts such that their sum equals zero. If x-intercept is a and y-intercept is -a, the line equation can be written as frac{x}{a} + frac{y}{-a} = 1. - Given the line passes through A(1,4), we substitute these coordinates into the line equation: frac{1}{a} - frac{4}{a} = 1. - Solving for a, we get 1 - 4 = a, leading to a = -3. - With a = -3, the equation of the line becomes x - y + 3 = 0.

Applying the Condition - The sum of intercepts equals zero: 1 - frac{4}{k} + 4 - k = 0. - Simplifying, we get 5 - k - frac{4}{k} = 0. - Multiplying everything by k to clear the denominator, we have 5k - k^2 - 4 = 0. - Rearranging, k^2 - 5k + 4 = 0, which factors into (k - 4)(k - 1) = 0. - Thus, k = 4 or k = 1.
