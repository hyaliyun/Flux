Question: With whom is Axel having an affair? Movie title: My Bloody Valentine Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (December 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On the Valentine's Day of 1997, in a small town, a cave-in on the north side of a Hanninger mine trapped six miners. Six days later, rescue teams found five dead miners and the comatose Harry Warden (Richard John Walters), who survived by killing the other miners with a pickaxe, allowing himself to breathe. Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) the owner's son, was blamed for the mine disaster because he forgot to vent the methane lines and caused a cave-in, but also Harry Warden for killing the miners. A year later, Valentine's Day, Warden wakes from his coma in the hospital, and goes on a murderous rampage. Soon after, Sheriff Burke (Tom Atkins) arrives, finding multiple mutilated bodies many of which have been severed in half and the heart of a nurse inside a candy box. Burke and his partner come to the conclusion that Warden had awoken from his coma and, realizing they don't have much time left, they try to figure out where he's headed. Meanwhile, at the abandoned mine shaft that was the site of the disaster, a party is in full swing, attended by many teens, including Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), his girlfriend, Irene (Betsy Rue), Tom Hanniger and his girlfriend, Sarah (Jaime King). Tom was initially reluctant to go, but he goes anyway. He leaves Sarah and goes back to his car to pick up some beers before going inside. Sarah goes alone and gets lost looking for Axel and Irene. She runs across a teen and a few seconds later, he is stabbed through his eye. She is confronted by Warden in full miner's garb, carrying a bloody pickaxe, and she flees, finding several dead bodies. Axel grabs her and they, along with Irene, hide from the killer. Warden eventually sees the trio, and they run out of the mine, meeting Tom as he comes in. Warden hits Tom with the pickaxe, injuring him, while the other three run...

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Motor systems are areas of the brain that are directly or indirectly involved in producing body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.\\"?","output":"Question: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the brain and voluntary muscle movements, according to the passage? A. Motor systems in the brain only control eye movements. B. Motor neurons involved in producing body movements are controlled by the brain and spinal cord. C.

Answer the following question: Question: The couple woke up to good weather finally, the rain had ruined the vacation so far but today they would what? Options: - climb - play frisbee - travel - hike - go somewhere  Explain why a human would choose \\"go somewhere\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"go somewhere\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: Step 1: Assess the context of the question. In this case, the context is that the couple has had their vacation negatively affected by bad weather, specifically rain. Today, however, the weather has improved, so they want to make the best of it. Step 2: Evaluate the options. - Climb: This option could be an activity that the couple engages in, but it is specific and may not appeal to everyone, nor would it necessarily utilize the whole day. - Play frisbee: This is a fun outdoor activity, but again it is specific and may not be everyone's preference. Also, it might not maximize the good weather opportunity. - Travel: Though this may involve visiting new places or exploring the area, it could be interpreted as too broad/vague, or it could also refer to leaving the current vacation spot. - Hike: This could be an enjoyable outdoor experience, but it assumes the couple is interested in hiking and that there are suitable trails nearby. Like climbing, it is a specific outdoor activity. - Go somewhere: This option is more general and open-ended, and would allow the couple to decide where to go based on their preferences, such as sightseeing, shopping, visiting points of interest, or partaking in outdoor activities. Step 3: Choose the most suitable answer. Considering the context and the evaluation of the options, a human would likely choose \\"go somewhere.\\" This answer is broad and versatile, allowing the couple to make diverse choices about how to spend their day, which is important after having previous days negatively affected by rain. They can choose any activity or destination that they feel would maximize their enjoyment of the good weather without being restricted to specific activities like climbing, playing frisbee, or hiking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OK , the other night me and my cousin got drunk when the parents were out and played around with one we found in the basement cuz we was bored . It was nt fun . Why did the narrator get drunk ?","output":"The narrator got drunk due to a combination of factors, primarily stemming from the absence of parental supervision, boredom, and the desire to engage in an activity for amusement or excitement with their cousin.  To begin with, the parents' absence played a significant role in the narrator's decision to get drunk. Without any authoritative figure to monitor their actions, the narrator, and their cousin had the freedom to explore and indulge in activities that may be considered inappropriate, risky, or unsafe under normal circumstances. The lack of parental oversight consequently provided an environment that encouraged the exploration of activities such as consuming alcohol. Secondly, boredom was a motivating factor. The narrator explicitly states that they were bored, which indicates that they were seeking ways to pass the time and alleviate their boredom. In this context, getting drunk could have been perceived as an appealing option for entertainment and as a means to create novelty and excitement in an otherwise dull situation. The desire to escape boredom might have overpowered their better judgment and rational thinking, leading to their choice to indulge in alcohol consumption. Additionally, the social context of the situation also played a role in the narrator's decision to get drunk. The fact that their cousin was present and willing to partake in the activity with them likely contributed to their decision, as engaging in such activities in a social context can make it more enjoyable or appealing. Lastly, it should be noted that the narrator and their cousin stumbled upon the alcohol in the basement, which could have triggered their curiosity and eagerness to experiment with it. This chance discovery, combined with the previously mentioned factors, eventually led the narrator to get drunk with their cousin. In conclusion, the narrator got drunk due to a mix of factors such as the absence of parental supervision, their boredom, the influence of their cousin's presence, and the accidental discovery of alcohol in the basement. These factors blended together to create a situation where the narrator decided to consume alcohol to create excitement and amusement, despite the negative consequences that ultimately followed."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere.   - Lake MichiganHuron (also HuronMichigan) is the combined waters of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, which are joined through the wide, 20-fathom (120 ft; 37 m) deep, open-water Straits of Mackinac. Huron and Michigan are technically a single lake because the flow of water through the straits keeps their water levels in near-equilibrium. (Although the flow is generally eastward, the water moves in either direction depending on local conditions.) Combined, Lake MichiganHuron is the largest fresh water lake by area in the world. If Lake Huron and Lake Michigan are considered two separate lakes, Lake Superior is larger than either.  - Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes of North America and the only one located entirely within the United States. The other four Great Lakes are shared by the U.S. and Canada. It is the second-largest of the Great Lakes by volume and the third-largest by surface area, after Lake Superior and Lake Huron (and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia). To the east, its basin is conjoined with that of Lake Huron through the wide Straits of Mackinac, giving it the same surface elevation as its easterly counterpart; the two are technically a single lake. Lake Michigan is shared, from west to east, by the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Ports along its shores include, Chicago, Milwaukee, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Gary, Indiana, and Benton Harbor, Michigan. The word \\"Michigan\\" originally referred to the lake itself, and is believed to come from the Ojibwa word \\"mishigami\\" meaning \\"great water\\". In the earliest European maps of the region, the name of Lake Illinois has been found in addition to that of \\"Michigan\\".  - The Great Lakes (also called the Laurentian Great Lakes, or the Great Lakes of North America) are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes located primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America, on the CanadaUnited States border, which connect to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River. Consisting of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron (or MichiganHuron), Erie, and Ontario, they form the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth, containing 21% of the world's surface fresh water by volume. The total surface is , and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is . Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as \\"inland seas\\". Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world by area, and Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country. The southern half of the Great Lakes is bordered by the Great Lakes Megalopolis.  - Michilimackinac is derived from an Odawa name for present-day Mackinac Island and the region around the Straits of Mackinac between Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. Early settlers of North America applied the term to the entire region along Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior. Today it is considered to be mostly within the boundaries of Michigan, in the United States. Michilimackinac was the original name for present day Mackinac Island and Mackinac County.  - The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 1812 to February 1815, fought between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, its North American colonies, and its Native American allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but the British often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. By the war's end in early 1815, the key issues had been resolved and peace returned with no boundary changes.  - Fort Mackinac (pronounced: \\"MACK-in-awe\\") is a former British and American military outpost garrisoned from the late 18th century to the late 19th century in the city of Mackinac Island, Michigan, on Mackinac Island. The British built the fort during the American Revolutionary War to control the strategic Straits of Mackinac between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, and by extension the fur trade on the Great Lakes. The British did not relinquish the fort until fifteen years after American independence.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Lake Huron is one of the five Great Lakes of North America. Hydrologically, it comprises the easterly portion of Lake MichiganHuron, having the same surface elevation as its westerly counterpart, to which it is connected by the , Straits of Mackinac. It is shared on the east by the Canadian province of Ontario and on the west by the state of Michigan in the United States. The name of the lake is derived from early French explorers who named it for the Huron people inhabiting the region. The Huronian glaciation was named due to evidence collected from Lake Huron region. The northern parts of the lake include the North Channel and Georgian Bay. The main inlet is the St. Marys River and the main outlet is the St. Clair.  - A suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck (the load-bearing portion) is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders. The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 19th century. Simple suspension bridges, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world.  - The Mackinac Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Straits of Mackinac to connect the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of the U.S. state of Michigan. Opened in 1957, the bridge (familiarly known as \\"Big Mac\\" and \\"Mighty Mac\\") is the world's 17th-longest main span and the longest suspension bridge between anchorages in the Western Hemisphere. The Mackinac Bridge is part of Interstate 75 and the Lakes Michigan and Huron components of the Great Lakes Circle Tours across the straits; it is also a segment of the U.S. North Country National Scenic Trail. The bridge connects the city of St. Ignace on the north end with the village of Mackinaw City on the south.  - Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word \\"mishigamaa\\", meaning \\"large water\\" or \\"large lake\\". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit.  - The Great Lakes Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. It consists of routes for circumnavigating the lakes, either individually or collectively.  - The Straits of Mackinac Shipwreck Preserve is a 148 - square - mile ( 380 km2 ) state preserve in and around the Straits of Mackinac . The preserve is divided in two by the Mackinac Bridge . The waters of the preserve include the waters offshore from Mackinaw City and St. Ignace , as well as all or part of the shorelines of Bois Blanc Island , Mackinac Island , Round Island , and St. Helena Island . The preserve contains at least eleven identified wrecks . Frequent fog and congested shipping added to the count of shipwrecks in the Straits area . Half a dozen lighthouses in and around the preserve testify to the dangers that existed prior to the invention of radar in the 1940s . Tragedies have continued , however . One modern wreck within the boundaries of the preserve is the Cedarville , a limestone lake freighter that sank in 1965 after a collision . For more information on the wrecks , see \`\` Shipwrecks of the Straits of Mackinac '' by Dr. Charles E. Feltner and Jeri Baron Feltner . Divers also visit underwater formations of Mackinac breccia near Mackinac Island ; one such formation , the Rock Maze , is offshore from Arch Rock . Further east off Arch Rock , a drowned , 100 - foot - high ( 30 m ) waterfall formation , Mackinac Falls , was discovered in August 2007 .  - The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America.  - The fur trade is a worldwide industry dealing in the acquisition and sale of animal fur. Since the establishment of a world fur market in the early modern period, furs of boreal, polar and cold temperate mammalian animals have been the most valued. Historically the trade stimulated the exploration and colonization of Siberia, northern North America, and the South Shetland and South Sandwich Islands.  - The Straits of Mackinac is a narrow waterway in the U.S. state of Michigan, between Michigan's Lower and Upper Peninsulas. The Straits of Mackinac connect two of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. The straits are wide and deep. Hydrologically, the two connected lakes can be considered one, which is called Lake MichiganHuron. Historically, the region around the Straits was known by the native Odawa people as Michilimackinac.  - The Odawa (also Ottawa or Odaawaa ), said to mean \\"traders,\\" have long had territory that crossed the current borders of the United States, where they are federally recognized as Native American tribes, and Canada, where there are numerous recognized First Nations bands. They are one of the Anishinaabeg, related to but distinct from the Ojibwe and Potawatomi peoples.  - Mackinac Island is an island and resort area, covering in land area, in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located in Lake Huron, at the eastern end of the Straits of Mackinac, between the state's Upper and Lower Peninsulas. The island was home to an Odawa settlement before European exploration began in the 17th century. It served a strategic position as a center on the commerce of the Great Lakes fur trade. This led to the establishment of Fort Mackinac on the island by the British during the American Revolutionary War. It was the site of two battles during the War of 1812.

He is the adopted son of wrestler \\"Iron\\" Mike DiBiase, who was Italian-American. DiBiase is of mostly German and English ancestry. DiBiase also spent time in the Georgia area where he had an early face run. One legendary angle had DiBiase enduring four piledrivers (one on the concrete floor and three in the ring) administered in the WTBS studio arena by The Fabulous Freebirds before his tag team partner, Tommy \\"Wildfire\\" Rich, threw in the towel (the angle of DiBiase being badly injured was so real the TBS studio audience could be seen crying). Rich and DiBiase later feuded, leading to a loser leaves town match which DiBiase won, but instead of Rich leaving the area, he donned a mask calling himself \\"Mister R.\\" The feud culminated in a match between Mister R and DiBiase, Rich appeared from backstage and distracted DiBiase. Mister R then rolled up DiBiase to get the win and unmasked as Brad Armstrong. Both DiBiase and Rich left the territory shortly thereafter.  In the early to mid-1980s, DiBiase participated in angles in various territories feuding with the likes of Ric Flair best known from this point in his Mid South return with the likes of Bob Roop, Paul Orndorff, Dick Murdoch, The Fabulous Freebirds and One Man Gang. DiBiase turned heel against the Junkyard Dog and formed a group called The Rat Pack with Jim Duggan and Matt Borne, ran Mid-south for months. Aligning with Skandor Akbar, Dibiase caused a riff with the group, namely Duggan. The two would feud until DiBiase lost a loser leave town match. He also held various championships and made frequent trips to All Japan Pro Wrestling until his eventual departure from Mid-South Wrestling (which by this point was now the UWF).

DiBiase was eventually convinced by WWF to sign up despite the fact that he would not be told his gimmick until after he agreed, under the promise that it was something that would receive a serious push. WWF official Pat Patterson informed DiBiase that if owner Vince McMahon were to go out to wrestle, it would be the gimmick that he would give himself. Were there any other matches of note?","output":"Imagine that Ted DiBiase is a superhero in the world of wrestling. He was born in a place called Miami, and he comes from a family of wrestlers and entertainers, which means they like to perform and have fun in the ring. Basically, wrestling is in his blood. Ted has had a lot of exciting adventures in the wrestling world. One time, he fought against some bad guys called The Fabulous Freebirds, who tried to hurt him really badly. But his friend Tommy saved the day by stopping the fight. Ted also had lots of battles with other wrestlers like Ric Flair, Bob Roop, Paul Orndorff, Dick Murdoch, The Fabulous Freebirds, and One Man Gang. He even had a group of friends called The Rat Pack with Jim Duggan and Matt Borne, but they had a misunderstanding and became enemies. There was another big wrestling company called WWF, and they wanted Ted to join them. They promised him a super cool wrestler character but didn't tell him what it was until he agreed to join them. When Ted joined WWF, he got an awesome character, just like they promised. There were many more exciting matches in Ted's wrestling career, but these were some of the most memorable moments that made him famous and loved by fans all around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer choices: - hours  - decades  - months  - H20  - Joules  - DNA  - years  - seasons Answer:","output":"The unit of time that can be estimated by the rings in a tree trunk is years. Each tree ring represents one year of the tree's life. Each year, a tree goes through a cycle of growth and dormancy. The growth period typically occurs in the spring and summer months, during which the tree adds a layer of cells. As the tree grows, the older layers of cells form a ring around the younger layers. The thickness of each ring indicates the amount of growth that occurred during that year. Thicker rings generally mean a year of favorable conditions, such as abundant rainfall and sunlight, while thinner rings indicate a year of less favorable conditions, such as a drought or other environmental stressors. Counting these rings can provide an estimate of the tree's age.

Post-punk: Also emerging during this period was New York's no wave movement, a short-lived art and music scene that began in part as a reaction against punk's recycling of traditionalist rock tropes and often reflected an abrasive, confrontational and nihilistic worldview. No wave musicians such as the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, DNA, Theoretical Girls and Rhys Chatham instead experimented with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to non-rock styles. The former four groups were included on the Eno-produced No New York compilation, often considered the quintessential testament to the scene.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Children who spend more time outdoors may have a lower risk of becoming nearsighted, new research suggests. In the study, researchers looked at about 1,900 schoolchildren. The scientists found that the kids who had been instructed to spend more time outdoors over three years were 23 percent less likely to develop nearsightedness during this time than those who had not been instructed to spend more time outdoors. Moreover, among the kids who did become nearsighted during the study, the degree to which their eyesight worsened was slightly smaller among those who spent more time outdoors. The researchers selected six schools and required the children, whose average age was 7 at the start of the study, to attend one additional 60-minute class of outdoor activities during each school day for three years. The parents of these children were also encouraged to engage their children in outdoor activities after school, especially during weekends and holidays. The other half of the children, from another six schools, continued their usual activity patterns. Afterthree years, 30.4 percent of the kids in the intervention  group had become nearsighted, compared with 38.5 percent of the kids in the other group. It is not clear exactly why spending more time outside would benefit children's eyesight, the researchers said. However, some research has suggested that the higher levels of light intensity found outdoors may increase the release of the chemical dopamine  of the eye. In turn, dopamine is known to restrain the type of growth in the eye that is associated with nearsightedness. Based on the new results, the researchers recommend that children spend more time outdoors because of the potential benefits to their eyesight. However, it's important to protect kids' skin and eyes from UV light, which can be damaging. Question: Which can serve as the best title for the passage?

Films like Idle Roomers (1944) and Booby Dupes (1945) present a Curly whose voice was deeper and his actions slower. It is believed that he suffered the first of many strokes between the filming of Idiots Deluxe (October 1944) and If a Body Meets a Body (March 1945). After the filming of the feature length Rockin' in the Rockies (December 1944), he finally checked himself (at Moe Howard's insistence) into Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, California, on January 23, 1945, and was diagnosed with extreme hypertension, a retinal hemorrhage, and obesity. His ill health forced him to rest, leading to only five shorts being released in 1945 (the normal output was six to eight per year).  The Three Stooges: An Illustrated History, From Amalgamated Morons to American Icons by Michael Fleming, states that Moe Howard pleaded with Harry Cohn to allow his younger brother some time off upon discharge to regain his strength, but Cohn would not halt the production of his profitable Stooge shorts and flatly refused his request. Other sources state the Stooges had five months off between August 1945 and January 1946. They used that time to book themselves a feature film at Monogram, and then leave on a 2-month live performance commitment in New York City working shows 7 days per week. During that NYC appearance, Howard met and married his 3rd wife Marion Buxbaum, a bad relationship that further deteriorated his health and morale. Returning to L.A. in late November 1945, Howard was a shell of his former self. With two months rest, the team's 1946 schedule at Columbia commenced in late January, but involved only 24 days work during February - early May. In spite of 8 weeks' time off in that same period, Howard's condition continued to deteriorate.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Veteran Luke Ridnour Rapidly Adds Four Teams to His Résumé Everything about Luke Ridnour’s N.B.A. career was fairly nondescript until a week ago. Over 12 seasons, he was gainfully employed by five organizations, averaging 9.3 points and 4.5 assists as he played for the likes of the Milwaukee Bucks and the Minnesota Timberwolves. A steady-handed point guard, he was also capable of shooting well from beyond the 3-point line. He was a player who rounded out rosters, a backup vocalist to more famous stars. Nothing about his game screamed for attention. But on the eve of the N.B.A.’s free-agent period, Ridnour has become someone else altogether, through no fault of his own — the league’s foremost vagabond. As of last Wednesday, Ridnour was still a member of the Orlando Magic, for whom he played last season. Since then, he has become a member of four other teams. The Magic sent him to the Memphis Grizzlies, who traded him to the Charlotte Hornets, who dealt him to the Oklahoma City Thunder, who sent him to the Toronto Raptors. The last move was made Tuesday; the Thunder received the draft rights to Tomislav Zubcic, a Croatian power forward who has yet to appear in an N.B.A. game. And the Raptors may not even keep Ridnour. Ridnour, 34, has become so eminently dispensable (and acquirable) because he has a 2.75 million contract that is nonguaranteed. Salaries generally need to align whenever teams make trades. So Ridnour’s contract is a useful one to include as teams seek ways to engineer deals and clear space under the salary cap. Teams try to include nonguaranteed years on these types of contracts for this purpose, and Ridnour probably knew he would be dealt in the run-up to free agency, which is set to begin shortly after midnight. But four times? And counting? The good news for him is that the start of free agency will initiate a league-imposed moratorium on further deals until July 9. So it has been a pseudo-odyssey for Ridnour, who has been involved in deals for Zubcic, Janis Timma, Matt Barnes and Jeremy Lamb. But only Ridnour’s contract has been shipped from organization to organization; Ridnour himself has not gone anywhere. Several former players, including Quentin Richardson, can no doubt relate. Over a four-week span in 2009, Richardson went from the Knicks to the Grizzlies to the Los Angeles Clippers to the Timberwolves. But Ridnour has hopscotched to different teams at a pace that is truly dizzying. Predictably, the Internet has had some fun with Ridnour’s travels. His Wikipedia page was temporarily blocked because of “persistent vandalism.” Someone had amended his profile to include the comment that Ridnour had “been traded four times in the past week and doesn’t have a clue where he lives.” A version of this article appears in print on July 1, 2015, on page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Veteran Rapidly Adds Four Teams to His Résumé.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer a question about this article: During the 18th and 19th centuries, federal law traditionally focused on areas where there was an express grant of power to the federal government in the federal Constitution, like the military, money, foreign relations (especially international treaties), tariffs, intellectual property (specifically patents and copyrights), and mail. Since the start of the 20th century, broad interpretations of the Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution have enabled federal law to expand into areas like aviation, telecommunications, railroads, pharmaceuticals, antitrust, and trademarks. In some areas, like aviation and railroads, the federal government has developed a comprehensive scheme that preempts virtually all state law, while in others, like family law, a relatively small number of federal statutes (generally covering interstate and international situations) interacts with a much larger body of state law. In areas like antitrust, trademark, and employment law, there are powerful laws at both the federal and state levels that coexist with each other. In a handful of areas like insurance, Congress has enacted laws expressly refusing to regulate them as long as the states have laws regulating them (see, e.g., the McCarran-Ferguson Act). When did the Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution allow federal power to begin expanding?","output":"The Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution allowed federal power to begin expanding in the 20th century. This expansion allowed the federal government to get involved in areas like aviation, telecommunications, railroads, pharmaceuticals, and many more."},{"instruction":"Q: Title: Not nearly engaging enough Review: I was very impressed with The Red Tent. I loved the way the characters and their interactions were developed throughout the story. Although not a lengthy book, the author achieved real depth quickly and easily with her narrative. The Last Days of Dogtown simply did not have the same depth. The story seemed very disjointed; there is no real beginning and no definitive end. Although some of the vinettes of the various characters were interesting, the compilation of the whole was somewhat pointless.

Review title: broke after 30 minutes of practice Product review: My son hasn't broken a drum stick in his two years of playing (sure, he's splintered some and otherwise worn out sticks), but when he got these Sugar Maple sticks, one of the sticks broke clean off on a diagonal starting at the nylon tip after the first 30 minutes of practice.These are his first set of maple sticks (the sticks he normally uses are hickory) and I've read that maple isn't as durable as hickory, but 30 minutes???Given the clean diagonal break, I'm thinking the grain on this particular stick was not quite straight along the length of the stick and thereby it was especially weak. Or maybe this is a general issue that explains the super low sale price when I ordered them. A:","output":"After reading the review, I will go through the following steps to decide whether it decreases or increases the chances of buying the product: Step 1: Analyze the content of the review. The customer is mentioning that the product broke after just 30 minutes of use. They also mention that this is their first experience with maple sticks, and their son usually uses hickory sticks. The customer acknowledges that maple might not be as durable as hickory but still expresses concern about the short life of the product. Step 2: Consider the possible reasons for the issue. The customer suggests two possible reasons for the issue: the stick might have had a grain that was not quite straight, making it weak, or the low price might be an indication of a general issue with the product. Step 3: Evaluate the relevance of the review. As a potential buyer, I would evaluate whether the mentioned drawbacks are relevant to me. If I am also planning to buy maple sticks for the first time, this review might be particularly relevant, as it highlights a potential issue with the product's durability. Step 4: Weigh the pros and cons. In this case, the review highlights a significant issue with the product, breaking after just 30 minutes of use. Additionally, the customer highlights that this issue might be a common one due to the low sale price. Conclusion: Based on the steps above, I conclude that the mentioned review would decrease the chances of buying the product. The review highlights a potential durability issue, and as a customer, I would prefer a product that lasts longer, even if it's at a slightly higher price."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence as they provide different pieces of information about the Windermere Steamboat Museum and relate to different aspects of its existence.  The first sentence establishes the location of the Windermere Steamboat Museum, which is north of the town, and provides a brief insight into its purpose: showcasing the golden age of lake transport. This suggests that the museum is open and functioning. In contrast, the second sentence discusses a different aspect of the museum's history by mentioning that it had stood empty for many years. This statement does not inherently contradict the information provided in the first sentence, but it introduces a new piece of information which is not contained in the first sentence. The second sentence relates to the museum's past, whereas the first sentence seems to describe its current state and its purpose.

Title: The Keys of the Kingdom Movie plot: Father Francis Chisholm (Gregory Peck) is visited in his old age by Monsignor Sleeth (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) at his parish in Tweedside. The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice.

Choose your answer from:  (1). Yes.  (2). No.","output":"The correct answer would be (1). Yes, fertilizer helps plants cultivate their entire lifespan. However, it is essential to provide a more comprehensive explanation to fully address the question. Plants require essential nutrients, water, air, and sunlight to grow and thrive throughout their entire lifespan. While fertilizer does play a critical role in providing essential nutrients, it is one component among various factors that collectively contribute to plant growth and development. The primary function of fertilizers is to supply plants with essential nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, in addition to several micronutrients like calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. These nutrients are crucial for various biochemical processes, ranging from photosynthesis to cell division, that promote growth and development. Moreover, proper watering is essential in supporting plant growth. Water helps in the absorption of nutrients from the soil, transport of nutrients and other substances within the plant, and in maintaining the plant's turgidity and structural integrity. Water also enables plants to carry out essential physiological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. Light, in particular sunlight, is vital for providing plants with the energy they need to carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process through which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, that is stored in the form of glucose, also releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This glucose is then used to fuel growth, and oxygen helps in aerobic respiration, ensuring plant survival. Air plays an essential role since the atmosphere supplies plants with carbon dioxide, crucial for photosynthesis, which is derived from the air. Oxygen is required for aerobic respiration, which is critical for providing energy to the plant for its various metabolic processes. In conclusion, while fertilizer is undoubtedly a significant component in helping plants cultivate their entire lifespan, it is essential to understand that it is one aspect of a more comprehensive set of factors. Water, sunlight, and air, along with soil composition and proper care, also substantially contribute to the overall health and success of plant growth and development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lindsey Caroline Vonn (nee Kildow ; born October 18, 1984) is an American World Cup alpine ski racer on the US Ski Team. She has won four World Cup overall championships--one of only two female skiers to do so, along with Annemarie Moser-Proll--with three consecutive titles in 2008, 2009, and 2010, plus another in 2012. Vonn won the gold medal in downhill at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the first ever in the event for an American woman. She has also won a record 8 World Cup season titles in the downhill discipline (2008-2013, 2015, 2016), 5 titles in super-G (2009-2012, 2015), and 3 consecutive titles in the combined (2010-2012). At the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010, Vonn planned to compete in all five women's alpine events. On February 10, she revealed she had severely bruised her shin in training the previous week. Vonn said the pain from her injury was \\"excruciating\\" and she would have a difficult time competing at the Winter Olympics. Due to unseasonably warm weather and resultant poor snow conditions, many of the Alpine skiing events were moved back, giving Vonn additional time to heal. On February 17, in her first event, Vonn won the gold medal in the downhill at Whistler Blackcomb, beating longtime U.S. rival Julia Mancuso by 0.56 seconds and becoming the first American woman to win Olympic gold in downhill.  In her second event, the super combined, Vonn finished first in the downhill portion of the race. In the slalom portion, however, she crashed when she failed to get her ski around a right-hand gate. Vonn said her shin wasn't the problem. Gold and silver were won by Maria Riesch and Julia Mancuso respectively.  In her third event, the super-G, Vonn finished third behind Andrea Fischbacher and Tina Maze, 0.74 seconds behind Fischbacher's winning time. Afterwards, Vonn said she didn't ski the last part of the course as aggressively as she could have and lost the race as a result. In her fourth event, the giant slalom, fog affected visibility. Vonn crashed in her first run, resulting in a broken fourth finger and Vonn's disqualification from the event. In her fifth event, the slalom, Vonn lost control and straddled a gate, disqualifying her from the event.

Now, people in some countries start the meal with lettuce as part of a salad. There are hundreds of kinds of lettuce. The main ones include head lettuce, such as iceberg, leaf lettuce,Boston, bibb and romaine. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden. The best time to plant the seeds is during cool weather. The University of Illinois Extension advises that the best planting temperature is 150C. Lettuce seeds are small, so do not place them too deep in the ground. If you plant some seeds every week or two, you will have crops ready to eat one after another. To start the seeds inside, you can use a seed tray in your home or other shelter. This container should be deep enough to hold at least three centimeters of soil or more. There should be about one centimeter of space between the soil and the top of the container. The container should have holes in the bottom so the extra water can flow out. Drop the seeds over the surface and cover them lightly with soil. If the soil is not already a little wet, give it some water. But do not drown the seeds. Next, cover the seed tray with paper. When the seedlings have come up far enough to touch the paper, take it off. You can transplant the seedlings into the garden when they are about two to three centimeters tall. Do this when the weather is not too hot and not too cold. Take out as much soil as you can with the seedlings, Then dig a hole in the ground bigger thanthe lettuce roots. Water the plants but not too heavily. Harvest leaf lettuces when the leaves are big enough to eat. Pull the leaves from the outside of the planting so the inside leaves will keep growing. Or, you can cut off the whole plant. Leave about two or three centimeters above the ground so the plant will re-grow. Cut off head lettuces at ground level. Lettuce is best when served fresh, so make a salad and enjoy. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: Who does the deceased's lover look like?, using the article: Dr. Frank Peralta is stabbed to death in his apartment one night. The detective on the case, Lt. Stevenson, quickly finds multiple witnesses putting Peralta's lover, Terry Collins, at the scene. However, when Stevenson finds Terry and questions her, she has an iron-clad alibi with multiple witnesses. It is revealed that Terry has an identical twin sister, Ruth, and the pair share the same job and routinely switch places for their own benefit. Stevenson and the district attorney are unable to prosecute, since the twins refuse to confirm which one of them has the alibi. Unable to accept the \\"perfect crime\\", Lt. Stevenson asks Dr. Scott Elliot for help. Scott is an expert on twin study, and has been routinely encountering the Collins twins at their shared place of work, but does not know which one is which. As a front, Scott asks Terry and Ruth if he can study both of them individually as part of his research. The twins accept, though Ruth is worried that Scott might find out that Terry was at Peralta's apartment the night of the murder. However, Terry is attracted to Scott and insists that they can keep the secret for the sake of seeing him. She also comforts Ruth, reminding her that she was only at Peralta's apartment but didn't kill him. From Scott's psychological tests and by spending time with them, he discovers that Ruth is kind and loving, while Terry is highly intelligent, insane, and has been manipulating Ruth almost their entire lives. Terry is jealous that people keep preferring Ruth over her, and is again enraged when Scott falls in love with Ruth instead of her. Terry starts methodically gaslighting Ruth, making her believe that she's hallucinating and going insane, in the hopes of pushing her to suicide., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"Based on the article you provided, the deceased, Dr. Frank Peralta's, lover resembles Terry Collins. However, Terry Collins has an identical twin sister, Ruth. This adds a layer of complexity to physical identity, as the two sisters look exactly alike and they frequently switch places in their shared workplace and even their personal relationships. Terry is characterized as being highly intelligent, whereas Ruth is described as being kind and loving. But in terms of physical appearance, there is no difference between Terry and Ruth, hence the deceased's lover looks like both Terry and Ruth Collins. Since Terry was the one involved with Dr. Frank Peralta, and was reported being at Peralta's apartment the night of the murder, it may further be inferred that Dr. Frank Peralta's lover indeed resembles Terry Collins."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Title: Disappointment: A Wasted Opportunity Step 1: Choose a fictional movie title and premise For this review, I will create a fictional movie titled \\"The Time Caravan\\", a science fiction film about a group of explorers who travel through time using a magical vehicle to save the world from an impending apocalypse. Step 2: Critique the plot The plot of \\"The Time Caravan\\" is unoriginal and dull, taking the well-trodden path of time-travel clichés. The storyline is inconsistent, with gaping plot holes and a lack of coherent continuity. The movie's attempts at depicting different time periods feel lazy and unconvincing, with the writers choosing to rely on superficial stereotypes rather than providing any insightful observations about the eras being portrayed. Step 3: Comment on the characters Characters in \\"The Time Caravan\\" are one-dimensional and lack any relatable qualities, making it difficult for viewers to feel any emotional attachment to the protagonists. The film's villain is cartoonish and uninspired, ultimately detracting from any potential narrative tension. Additionally, the romantic subplot feels incredibly forced and undermined by the protagonists' lack of chemistry, leaving the audience feeling emotionally unsatisfied. Step 4: Discuss the visuals and special effects Despite being a science fiction film, the special effects and visual aspects of \\"The Time Caravan\\" fall woefully short of industry standards. The time machine itself is unimaginative in design and, coupled with poorly executed CGI, ends up looking outdated and tacky. The costumes and sets, meant to evoke different time periods, appear cheap and inauthentic, making it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the world of the movie. Step 5: Critique the directing and pacing The pacing of the film is painfully slow, with random, hard-to-follow scene transitions that often lead to confusion for viewers. The director's attempts at creating suspense fall flat, leaving the audience bored and disconnected from the action. Furthermore, the film's obligatory action sequences feel uninspired and lack any real tension, making for a less-than-memorable cinematic experience. Step 6: Conclude the review In conclusion, \\"The Time Caravan\\" is a wasted opportunity that fails to capitalize on its promising concept of time travel. Hindered by bland characters, a predictable plot, subpar visual effects, and uninspired direction, this movie ends up being a lackluster entry in the science fiction genre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Even if you want to..I am anonymous for the same reason. So this happened when I was 16 year old. I belong to a very humble and conservative family, from Indore. @I never had a lot of exposure to guys, until we went to attend a marriage of one of our wealthy relatives in Delhi.. it was one of the best times I had, as we had a group of 4–5 similar aged cousins, though most of them were very distant relatives. One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know… it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting. So the second day, after having roamed all around Noida, we finally returned to our hotel and that guy accompanied me to my room. I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth …and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge. Sadly… before we could proceed, rest of our cousins called us to play Antakhshree with them. Never have we met since, but we often exchange messages on Facebook.

To set the mood for your party, make your home look like the Punxsutawney forest. Cut out pine trees from butcher paper and hang them up on the wall. Use flowers or pinecones as a table centerpiece. You could even have your party outdoors to set the mood. Alternatively, you could separate a room into winter and spring decorations to represent Punxsutawney Phil's big moment. Your guests don't necessarily have to come dressed up as groundhogs. Instead, ask them to come dressed as their favorite woodland animal. If your guests are not as passionate about groundhogs, they could come as a deer, bear, fox, wolf, or owl. Bill Murray's Groundhog Day features a weatherman who must experience the same day over and over until he learns a valuable lesson. Since Groundhog Day thrust the holiday into popular culture, there's no better movie to show at your party. Snuggle up with your friends and a bowl of popcorn, and have a good laugh together. If you do not want to watch Groundhog Day, you could watch a nature documentary on groundhogs instead. For a fun party craft, make groundhog masks out of cardstock. Draw your outline on the cardstock, then cut it out with a sharp pair of scissors. Color your mask with markers, paints, or crayons, then attach ribbon to the sides. You and your guests can now celebrate Groundhog Day in style. As an alternative, you could make animal masks to complement your guests' costumes. No party is complete without treats. You could make traditional Groundhog Day cookies (popularized on the official Punxsutawney website), or you could make a festive cake. Because groundhogs eat vegetation, you could also leave out a veggie tray or fruit bowl. To complete the woodland theme, make a trail mix for your guests to enjoy.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Courage Under Fire Context: While serving in the Gulf War, Lieutenant Colonel Serling (Denzel Washington) accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing night-time battle, killing his friend Captain Boylar. The US Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job. Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and on the next day, when further rescue arrived, Walden was reported dead. Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic (Matt Damon), praises Walden heavily. Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward and that Monfriez himself led the crew in combat, and that the fuel bladder technique was originated by him. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and rendered unconscious. Meanwhile, the crew of the Black Hawk claims that they heard firing from an M16, which Ilario and Monfriez deny. Under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg (Michael Moriarty), to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn) to prevent another cover up. When Serling puts pressure on Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train. Serling tracks down Ilario using details about Ilario's preferred vacation spot. Ilario tells the true story, revealing that Monfriez wanted to flee while leaving Rady behind.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. (A). No. (B). Yes. Question: what does the universal law of gravitation state? Would \\"Satellites and projectiles all obey Newton's law of gravitation\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"The Universal Law of Gravitation, proposed by Sir Isaac Newton, states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. It is mathematically expressed as F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, where F is the gravitational force, m1 and m2 are the masses interacting, r is the distance between the centers of these masses, and G is the gravitational constant. The Universal Gravitation Law insists on the universal nature of gravity because its influence extends to every object in the universe, regardless of its size and distance. This fundamental principle governs not just the motion of objects on Earth but also the celestial bodies, including, but not limited to, planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and even light. Thus, introducing the concept of \\"Satellites and projectiles all obey Newton's law of gravitation,\\" it's clear this statement is a wholly reasonable response in line with the Universal Law of Gravitation. These objects, like any other masses in the universe, are attracted to each other due to the gravitational interaction dictated by this law. Satellites- whether they are man-made or natural, such as the Moon- obey this law as they continually free-fall towards the Earth (or whichever massive body they are orbiting). Their curved orbital path results from the balance between inertia, the tendency of the satellite to move in a straight line, and the gravitational pull of the massive body. This particular application of the law results in what we recognize as the stable orbits of satellites- a perfect demonstration of Newton's law of universal gravitation. Similarly, projectiles launched on Earth, like a thrown baseball or a fired bullet, also obey the law of gravitation. They follow a parabolic trajectory influenced by the gravitational force of Earth. Although these objects eventually fall to the ground due to Earth's gravity, their initial motion and final impact site are both influenced by the inverse square law at work in the Universal Law of Gravitation. In conclusion, the statement \\"Satellites and projectiles all obey Newton's law of gravitation\\" is indeed a reasonable and accurate reflection of the Universal Law of Gravitation. It highlights the truth that every object, irrespective of its size and the distance from each other, is guided by the unseen but ever-present force that is Gravity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

People from all across the world visit this location during the particular weeks when the colors are at their brightest. 4. The area mentioned is in New England. Hypothesis: New England is my favorite place to view the change of seasons. Now, let's evaluate the given premise to see if it entails the hypothesis: While the hypothesis statement expounds that New England is the narrator's favorite place to view the changes of seasons, the premise focuses on providing descriptions of the location and some of its appealing features. It does not specifically address the narrator's preferences or feelings toward New England, which are essential to establish a personal favorite. Though the premise highlights the attractiveness of New England during the weeks when the bright colors are present, the absence of a direct comparison to other places or clarification of the narrator's feelings prevent the premise from implying or leading to the hypothesis. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis because it only provides a description of the beauty of New England in fall, without explicitly connecting it to the narrator's personal preferences or favorites.

SF sues Nevada after it refuses to pay patient dumping bill City Attorney Dennis Herrera wasted little time following through on his threat to file a lawsuit if Nevada didn’t pay up. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera sued the state of Nevada on Tuesday, accusing it of deliberately giving psychiatric patients one-way bus tickets to California in a practice known as patient dumping or “Greyhound therapy”. The class-action lawsuit was filed in San Francisco Superior Court after Nevada officials refused to pay a 500,000 bill the city says it’s due after a state-run mental hospital in Las Vegas bused at least 20 psychiatric patients here and they subsequently received city-sponsored medical care. The lawsuit also accuses Nevada of transporting almost 500 patients to California over about five years in “a manner that jeopardized the patients’ health and also jeopardized the health and safety of their fellow passengers.” It seeks a halt to the practice and reimbursement for all affected California municipalities. Nevada officials contend “proper discharges were made” by the Rawson-Neal Psychiatric Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada’s primary state mental facility, and that Herrera hasn’t provided evidence to support his bill. “You make a demand for approximately 500,000 but you fail to provide details to support your claim, including how you identified the 20 patients,” Nevada Chief Deputy Attorney General Linda Anderson wrote in the letter dated Monday. Herrera in August gave Nevada until Monday to respond to his demand that the state reimburse San Francisco for about 500,000 he says the city spent on medical care, housing and other aid for 20 psychiatric patients given one-way bus tickets here. In the Aug. 20 letter to Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, Herrera also demanded that Nevada reimburse other California cities and counties for their treatment costs for a combined 500 indigent psychiatric patients who were given one-way bus tickets to the Golden State since 2008. Anderson countered that Herrera has not provided “sufficient explanation of your legal theory or standing for the initiation of a lawsuit by you on behalf of the ‘affected California cities and counties.’ ” She also pointed in her letter to recent press accounts of a mental health patient sent from California to a Nevada hospital, and said that Rawson-Neal had provided care for 771 patients from California during the period Herrera is investigating, July 1, 2008 to March 31, 2013. “Therefore, it could be argued that … the taxpayers of the State of Nevada have subsidized the State of California over 6.2 million during this same period,” Anderson wrote. Herrera’s office contends there’s a difference between a state-run hospital having a policy of busing patients out of state and people voluntarily visiting a state and then needing psychiatric care. “This dispute is about Nevada’s state-sanctioned practice of improperly transporting indigent psychiatric patients,” Herrera’s spokesman, Matt Dorsey, said shortly before the lawsuit was filed. “It’s not about patients who travel between the states voluntarily. We’re disappointed that Nevada officials have declined to take responsibility for their practice, and the city attorney is preparing his response.” The issue of patient dumping — a long-believed, but never proven, contributor to San Francisco’s homeless problem — came to the fore after the Sacramento Bee chronicled the ordeal of a 48-year-old Rawson-Neal patient. He was sent on a 15-hour bus ride to Sacramento, despite having no family or friends in the area, and no arrangements for his care, housing or treatment. Hospital staff told him call 911 when he arrived in Sacramento. Since then, The Chronicle uncovered the similar ordeal of Timothy Martin, a deaf and blind man who found himself homeless on the streets of San Francisco after a one-way ride from a Reno mental hospital. Herrera launched his investigation in April.

I hope so People who live in the free world look at calendars and mark time day by day. I keep track of time not by days but by years. I’ve done so for the past 22 years that I have been incarcerated in the Ohio prison system. My 22nd Christmas behind bars has in many ways been the hardest for me. I’m now incarcerated at a reintegration prison where many of the women I serve time with will be leaving soon to rejoin their families in the community. I’ve always been extremely happy for the women who get to go home, and I have celebrated their departures as if their freedom was my own. What’s hard for me this year is that I feel that I am closer to going home than I ever have been. That’s because victim Holly Lai Holbrook, whose sister Michelle was murdered during the incident I was charged and convicted for participating in, came forward to support my innocence and ask Governor John Kasich to release me. Holly’s support means the world to me. But it also scares me. If Holly’s statement that I am innocent is not enough to bring me home, what will be? Will I ever leave this place? Will I ever experience Christmas with my family again? So this Christmas, freedom feels close but at the same time far away. One recent evening I left the recreation area, which my cell-mates and I decorated with a cardboard Christmas tree and paper ornaments to remind us of home, and returned to my cell for the nightly count. After count, I jumped in the shower and prayed for the day when I would be able to actually take a long bath, something I have not done since 1994. As a giant roach scurried by, I put on my homemade pajamas made out of prison issued sheets. I placed my leftover food – Nacho chip “cornbread” and mashed potatoes made out of potato chips – in the windowsill to remain cold as if in a refrigerator. I then got in bed feeling sad and sorry for myself. As my mind raced back and forth, I thought about how much I missed my family and how I wouldn’t be able to see them on Christmas Day for the 22nd year in a row; no visits are allowed on holidays. I felt so negative and alone as I tossed and turned. I drifted asleep mad at God. But in the middle of the night I awoke after a corrections officer making his rounds shone a light in my cell. And then I remembered something that helps me get through the difficult times: how blessed I am. And the blessings God has given me are so many. First, although I went to prison a sixth grade dropout, I was able to get my education in prison. Not only did I get my GED, but I also earned a steam engineer’s license, which means I can repair and maintain boilers, and a paralegal certificate, among other achievements. I am able to write and express myself now in ways I never could have when I entered prison at the age of 20. Second, I have a family that has stood by me for the past 22 years and has loved me unconditionally. And my family has grown as I have fought for my freedom. Today my family includes not only Momma, her partner and my two living brothers, but also the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who have followed my case and now call for my release. Third, I am so grateful for my legal team. The Ohio Justice & Policy Center has represented me free of charge for the past four years, and has fought for me the way I wish I would have been represented at my trial. I will always owe a debt to OJPC for what it has done for me. Lastly, but most importantly, although I don’t like living in an environment where almost every aspect of my life is controlled, at least I’m fortunate enough to draw breath each day. I look forward to the day when I will get to pursue my dreams. Michelle Lai never got that chance. While some may feel sorry for me, they shouldn’t. When I feel tempted to wallow in self-pity, I create art that transports me – mentally and spiritually – beyond the bars that confine me physically. So, no matter how bad I may feel from time to time, I know my suffering is only a tiny fraction of the pain the Lai family and the other victims have experienced. Maybe this will be my last Christmas in prison. I certainly hope it is. But if it is not, I will find a way to keep going and to survive, hopefully marking the calendar in days, not years. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"This heartfelt reflection from a person incarcerated for 22 years shares their longing for potential release and the uncertainty of their future, while expressing gratitude for their support system and acknowledging the pain of the victims involved in their case.

A:","output":"The first step of the process in the context of the given information involves the ingestion and digestion of food, specifically its arrival in the small intestine. When food has been well-mixed with the stomach's gastric juices, it is progressively released into the small intestine as a semi-liquid substance called chyme. Here, the activation of the pancreas comes into play. The small intestine, through the presence of chyme, triggers the release of a hormone known as secretin. This hormone signals the pancreas to secrete its digestive juices 'externally' into the small intestine. Digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates is facilitated by the enzymes that are found in the pancreatic secretions. These enzymes include lipases for fats breakdown, proteases for proteins breakdown, and amylases for carbohydrates breakdown. The digestive juices flow from the pancreas through an excretory duct into the small intestine, where the process of digestion and nutrient absorption continues. Concurrently, the pancreas also has a major role in regulating blood sugar levels. When blood sugar levels rise, as might happen after a meal, the pancreas releases insulin, a hormone that helps cells of the body to absorb glucose from the bloodstream and store it. This reduces the amount of glucose in the blood, bringing blood sugar levels back to normal. On the other hand, when blood sugar levels are too low (for example, during fasting or prolonged periods without eating), the pancreas releases another hormone called glucagon. Glucagon stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream, raising blood sugar levels back to normal. In summary, the first step of the process is the arrival of chyme in the small intestine, which stimulates the release of secretin. This hormone triggers the pancreas to secrete its digestive enzymes for the digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, while concurrently regulating blood sugar levels through the release of insulin and glucagon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was discovered in September 1998 by the California and Carnegie Planet Search team using the highly successful radial velocity method . The planet is at least 24 % more massive than Jupiter . The mean distance of the planet from the star is slightly more than Earth 's distance from the Sun. However , the orbit is very eccentric , so at periastron this distance is almost halved , and at apastron it is as distant as Mars is from the Sun. In 2000 , a group of scientists proposed , based on preliminary data from the Hipparcos astrometrical satellite , that the planet would have an inclination of 175.8 ° and a true mass of 18 times Jupiter making it a brown dwarf instead of a planet . However these measurements were later proved useful only for upper limits of inclination . If the planet orbits in the same plane as the claimed circumstellar disk , which seems a plausible assumption , it would have an inclination of 40 ° and an absolute mass of 2.2 times Jupiter , however later observations failed to confirm the disk 's existence .  - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.  - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins.  - HD 210277 is a 7th magnitude star in the constellation of Aquarius. It is a yellow dwarf star (spectral type G0V) with a mass around 0.92 times that of our Sun. Since its distance is about 70 light years, it is not visible to the unaided eye. With binoculars it is easily visible.    What is the relationship between 'hd 210277 b' and 'aquarius'? Answer:","output":"HD 210277 b is an extrasolar planet that orbits the star HD 210277, which is located in the constellation of Aquarius. The relationship between HD 210277 b and Aquarius lies in the fact that the star, around which the planet revolves, is situated within the boundaries of the Aquarius constellation. The constellation of Aquarius is a group of stars that forms a specific pattern in the night sky, and it is one of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. HD 210277, the host star of HD 210277 b, is a 7th magnitude yellow dwarf star (with a spectral type of G0V) and has a mass of approximately 0.92 times that of our Sun. It is situated about 70 light-years away from Earth. Although it is not visible to the unaided eye due to its distance, HD 210277 can be observed using binoculars or telescopes. HD 210277 b, the planet orbiting this star, was discovered in September 1998 by the California and Carnegie Planet Search team, using the radial velocity method. The planet has an eccentric orbit, with a mean distance from its host star slightly greater than Earth's distance from the Sun. The eccentricity of its orbit causes the planet's distance from its star to vary, being nearly halved at periastron and almost equal to Mars' distance from the Sun at apastron. In summary, the relationship between HD 210277 b and Aquarius is that HD 210277 b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star HD 210277, which is a part of the Aquarius constellation in the sky."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up.

With regular starting quarterback Tarvaris Jackson recovering from injuries, Kelly Holcomb started in his place. In the first quarter, the Vikings trailed early as Brett Favre threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings, surpassing Dan Marino with the 421st touchdown pass of his career. After Favre was honored for his accomplishment, Minnesota narrowed the margin between the two teams to a single point with field goals of 44 and 35 yards from kicker Ryan Longwell, before Mason Crosby hit a 28-yard field goal to restore a four-point lead for the Packers going into halftime. In the third quarter, Crosby and Longwell cancelled each other out with field goals from 44 yards and 48 yards, respectively. In the fourth quarter, Crosby made a 33-yard field goal, before Favre completed a 33-yard touchdown pass to James Jones. Minnesota tried to rebound with Holcomb completing a 15-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Sidney Rice. The Vikings failed with an attempted onside kick, but two plays later Chad Greenway recovered a fumble by Favre, giving the Vikings just under 2 minutes to go 54 yards for a game-tying touchdown. However, after moving into Green Bay territory, Holcomb was subsequently intercepted by Atari Bigby, allowing Favre to kneel out the game. Adrian Peterson ran 12 times for 112 yards, making him the first rookie running back since Chuck Foreman to rush for 100 yards in each of his first three games as a Vikings starter.

On Saturday, it didn’t need a buzzer-beating shot to win, and fans didn’t even storm the court afterward. Victor Oladipo scored the go-ahead basket on a fast-break layup with 36 seconds left and No. 13 Indiana upset No. 2 Ohio State, 74-70, the first time Indiana has defeated the nation’s top two teams in the same season. Indiana’s win over Kentucky three weeks ago was only the second time the Hoosiers had beaten a No. 1 team at Assembly Hall. On Saturday, the Hoosiers (13-1, 1-1 Big Ten) added another chapter to their rapid re-emergence. But Saturday’s celebration paled in comparison with the storm-the-court stampede that followed the win over Kentucky. Part of the explanation was that the students were on holiday break this time. The other reason: it was not as big a surprise. The Hoosiers were far from perfect. They shot 45.8 percent, about five percentage points below their season average, and they were outrebounded, 35-28. “It came down to us not being able to get a stop,” Ohio State guard Aaron Craft said. “Give them credit. They just kept coming back and coming back and knocking down big shot after big shot.” KENTUCKY 69, LOUISVILLE 62 The freshman Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had 24 points and 19 rebounds to lead No. 3 Kentucky (13-1) in a rough-and-tumble victory at Rupp Arena. Physical play at times turned the game into more of a free-throw shooting contest; 52 fouls were called. No. 4 Louisville (12-2) led only once, at 2-0. UCONN 83, ST. JOHN’S 69 UConn let a 23-point second-half lead slip to 11 before beating the Red Storm in Hartford in the second game of Coach Jim Calhoun’s three-game N.C.A.A. suspension for recruiting violations. Shabazz Napier had 17 points and 9 assists to lead the Huskies. The freshman Andre Drummond added 16 points and 11 rebounds, and Jeremy Lamb chipped in with 15 points as UConn (12-1, 2-0 Big East) won its seventh straight game. St. John’s (7-6, 1-1) was also without its head coach, as Steve Lavin continues to recover from prostate cancer surgery. Lavin, who has coached four games this season, missed his seventh in a row. There is no timetable for his return. Calhoun will be back on the bench for Saturday’s game against Rutgers. FLORIDA 90, YALE 70 Kenny Boynton’s 26 points led No. 10 Florida (11-3) over Yale less than 40 hours after the Gators were upset at Rutgers. Greg Mangano led Yale (8-4) with 26 points and 15 rebounds. IOWA 72, WISCONSIN 65 The freshman reserve Aaron White scored 16 of his 18 points in the second half as Iowa (9-6, 1-1 Big Ten) won at Wisconsin. The 11th-ranked Badgers (12-3, 1-1), who came in allowing a national-best 44.4 points a game, had not given up more than 61 in any game. But they failed to keep up with the Hawkeyes, in part because they shot 3 for 28 on 3-pointers. GEORGETOWN 49, PROVIDENCE 40 Henry Sims scored 5 of his 11 points in the final seven minutes for No. 12 Georgetown (12-1, 2-0 Big East), which made only eight field goals in the second half. Providence (11-4, 0-2) has lost 17 straight Big East road games. MISSISSIPPI ST. 66, UTAH ST. 64 Rodney Hood scored 16 points and Arnett Moultrie added 15, but No. 15 Mississippi State (13-2) needed a defensive stop on its final possession to win. MICHIGAN ST. 68, NEBRASKA 55 Draymond Green scored 19 points and Keith Appling had 8 of his 14 in the last seven minutes for No. 16 Michigan State (13-2, 2-0 Big Ten), which has won 13 in a row after an 0-2 start. KANSAS 84, NORTH DAKOTA 58 North Dakota had no answer for the 6-foot-10 Thomas Robinson, who posted career highs with 30 points and 21 rebounds for No. 17 Kansas (10-3). IN OTHER GAMES Kyle Casey scored 7 of his 26 points in the closing 4:25 as No. 24 Harvard (12-1) rallied from an 11-point deficit to beat visiting St. Joseph’s, 74-69. ... Anthony Marshall had 19 points and 13 rebounds as No. 19 U.N.L.V. (15-2) beat Hawaii, 74-69, in Honolulu. STANFORD 77, U.C.L.A. 50 Nnemkadi Ogwumike and Chiney Ogwumike each posted double-doubles for the second straight game to lead No. 4 Stanford. DEPAUL 65, N. ILLINOIS 46 Doug Bruno earned his 500th victory as No. 21 DePaul won at home. He is 500-273 in 26 seasons.

Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.

Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Answer the following question: protein that serves as the precursor molecular for thyroid hormones?","output":"The precursor molecule for thyroid hormones is Thyroglobulin, a large glycoprotein that serves as the scaffold for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and a smaller amount of triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones are essential for regulating various physiological processes like metabolism, growth, and development throughout the body. Thyroglobulin is synthesized within the thyroid gland by thyroid follicular cells, also known as thyrocytes. After being synthesized, it is stored in large quantities within the colloid of the thyroid follicles. Thyroglobulin is comprised of 660 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 330 kDa. It contains several tyrosine residues, which play a crucial role in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. The biosynthesis of thyroid hormones involves a series of steps: 1. Iodide uptake: Diet-derived iodide ions are actively transported from the bloodstream into the thyroid follicular cells through a membrane-bound transporter called the Sodium/Iodide Symporter (NIS). 2. Iodide oxidation and organification: Once inside the follicular cells, the iodide ions are oxidized to reactive iodine by an enzyme called thyroid peroxidase (TPO). TPO catalyzes the binding of this reactive iodine to the tyrosine residues in the thyroglobulin molecule through a process called organification or iodination. 3. Coupling: The iodinated tyrosines within the thyroglobulin molecule are then coupled together to form either T3 (containing three iodine atoms) or T4 (containing four iodine atoms). Once again, this reaction is catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase. 4. Endocytosis and proteolysis: When thyroid hormones are required, thyroglobulin is endocytosed back into the follicular cells in the form of colloid droplets. Inside the cell, proteolytic enzymes cleave the iodinated thyroglobulin molecule, releasing T3 and T4 from the scaffold. 5. Secretion: The liberated T4 and T3 are then transported across the basolateral membrane of the follicular cells into the bloodstream via transporters such as Monocarboxylate Transporter 8 (MCT8) and Monocarboxylate Transporter 10 (MCT10), where they will be bound to globulin proteins for distribution throughout the body. 6. Activation and deactivation: The majority of the secreted thyroid hormone is T4. However, T3 is the more metabolically active form, which means that T4 is converted to T3 in the peripheral tissues by deiodinase enzymes. Additionally, T3 can be converted to its inactive form, reverse T3 (rT3), depending on the body's needs. In summary, thyroglobulin is the precursor molecule that serves as the foundation for the synthesis of essential thyroid hormones, T3 and T4. This process entails a series of orchestrated steps, including iodide uptake, iodination, coupling, endocytosis, proteolysis, secretion, activation, and deactivation, to ensure the optimal levels of these hormones are maintained throughout the body."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The decisions for Victoria were a lot harder than those of Christine, because  Options are: + Victoria was undecided. + Christine was undecided.","output":"The decisions for Victoria were a lot harder than those of Christine, primarily because Victoria was undecided. Victoria, known for her cautious nature, would find herself constantly wrestling with decision-making, while Christine seemed to breeze through it all without a second thought. To better understand why Victoria's decisions were more challenging, let's examine the reasons and circumstances that contributed to her indecisiveness. Firstly, Victoria's upbringing played a significant role in her decision-making struggles. Raised in a conservative family where every choice had considerable consequences, she learned to weigh every option with great care. Her reserved demeanor was a reflection of the importance her family placed on cautious thinking and risk minimization. Secondly, Victoria had a more analytical and detail-oriented thought process. As a result, her decision-making would involve exhaustive exploration of every available option and potential outcome. This inclination to carefully evaluate and process information before making choices only served to prolong her decision-making time. In contrast, Christine was much more quick to decide. Her spontaneity and impulsive nature allowed her to approach decisions fearlessly and without overthinking or dwelling on potential negative outcomes. It's not that Christine ignored potential risks or consequences, but rather, she was willing to trust her instincts and confidently stand by her choices regardless of the outcome. Some would argue this level of decisiveness helped Christine in seizing unique opportunities and beneficial situations that others might dismiss due to hesitancy and over-analysis. Moreover, Christine's upbringing was quite different from Victoria's. In a more liberal and open-minded environment, Christine was given the autonomy to make her own decisions from a young age. She was encouraged to learn from her mistakes and develop a more carefree attitude towards decision-making. It is also important to note that personality traits played a crucial role in shaping their decision-making abilities. Victoria's introspective and careful nature, influenced by her upbringing, would result in slower, more deliberate choices. On the other hand, Christine's extroverted and adventurous personality would lead her to embrace a more active and assertive decision-making style. To sum up, the decisions for Victoria were more difficult than those of Christine mainly because Victoria was undecided. Her upbringing, personality, and analytical thought process created an environment where making decisions became an arduous task. In contrast, Christine enjoyed quicker, more assertive decision-making, which allowed her to adapt and seize opportunities in a rapidly changing world. While each person's decision-making style has its pros and cons, it's evident that Victoria's indecisiveness made her decision-making process not only challenging but also emotionally exhausting. Understanding their personal motivations and mental processes can help shed light on why some decisions may be harder for some individuals while easier for others."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which mammal has a name which means 'river horse' in Greek?","output":"The mammal with a name that translates to 'river horse' in Greek is the Hippopotamus. The name comes from the combination of two Ancient Greek words: 'hippos' (ἵππος), meaning 'horse', and 'potamos' (ποταμός), meaning 'river'.  Hippopotamuses, or hippos for short, are large herbivorous animals native to sub-Saharan Africa. They are the third-largest terrestrial mammals, only behind elephants and some rhinoceros species in terms of size and weight. Adult male hippos can weigh between 1,500 to 1,800 kilograms (3,300 to 4,000 pounds), while females tend to be lighter, usually weighing between 1,300 to 1,500 kilograms (2,800 to 3,300 pounds).  Hippos have distinct features such as a barrel-shaped body, a semi-aquatic lifestyle, and a large head with a wide-opening mouth. Their relatively short legs and barrel shape allow them to move effortlessly through water, while their strong, muscular jaws can open at nearly a 180-degree angle to allow them to graze on large amounts of vegetation. These animals are well adapted to their aquatic environment, with eyes, ears, and nostrils situated at the top of their heads, allowing them to breathe and observe their surroundings while being mostly submerged. Hippos can easily stay underwater for up to 5 minutes without coming up for air. They typically spend the cooler parts of the day lounging in rivers, lakes, and swamps to stay protected from the harsh sun and keep their sensitive skin moist. At night, they venture onto land to graze on grasses and other vegetation. Although hippos may seem sluggish and docile, they are known to be unpredictable and aggressive, which contributes to their status as one of the most dangerous animals in Africa. With a set of powerful, sharp teeth and a fast running speed that can reach up to 30 kilometers per hour (19 miles per hour) on land, they are known to defend their territories aggressively and attack when they feel threatened. Hippopotamuses play a significant ecological role by maintaining aquatic vegetation and shaping the ecosystem of the bodies of water they inhabit. They are also known to create channels in swamps and other wetlands, which can help regulate water flow. Unfortunately, due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the common hippopotamus as a vulnerable species, emphasizing the need for continued conservation efforts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Initially, business owners return to assess the damage to their establishments, ensuring that the structures are safe for workers and future patrons.

Answer a question about this article: Cold or oxygen-rich atmospheres can sustain life at pressures much lower than atmospheric, as long as the density of oxygen is similar to that of standard sea-level atmosphere. The colder air temperatures found at altitudes of up to 3 km generally compensate for the lower pressures there.

Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side of the equation, we have -137*w and 4*w. -137*w + 4*w = -133*w On the right side of the equation, we have -43*w and 93*w. -43*w + 93*w = 50*w So the equation becomes: -133*w - 7503 = 50*w Step 2: Move all terms with w to one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side. To do this, we will add 133*w to both sides of the equation: -133*w - 7503 + 133*w = 50*w + 133*w which simplifies to: -7503 = 183*w Next, we'll isolate w by dividing both sides of the equation by 183: -7503 / 183 = 183*w / 183 Step 3: Solve for w.

Canadian waterfall makes for one incredibly dangerous water slide Thrill seekers visiting British Columbia’s Lynn Canyon Park have found an epic way to beat the summer heat – but have been urged to be more cautious after footage of their far out stunts went viral. Video posted online shows a group of brave tourists barrelling down a natural water slide in the park, ending in a stomach-churning 11 metre drop into waters below. Constantly flowing water has polished the rock face over a long period of time, making the natural slide especially slippery. But the viral videos have drawn the attention of local officials, including North Vancouver’s District Deputy Fire Chief Wayne Kennedy. “When we see or hear about the videos that get posted popularizing the canyon and cliff jumping, it does cause some concern,” he told The Weather Network. The depth of the water is unclear from the video; however dry conditions in the area have contributed to lower water levels than usual, making such jumps especially dangerous. Ranger patrols in the park have so far done little to deter tourists from dangerous activities inside the park, with seven rescues already performed this year. Do you have any news photos or videos?

Article: If you tend to use social media as a soapbox for your political views, personal problems, or other issues, this can bother some people and even cause them to unfriend you in some cases. If you think this might have been the reason why someone unfriended you and that bothers you, consider scaling back on these kinds of posts. For example, instead of posting about your political beliefs on social media, try discussing your views in a political forum or in a closed Facebook group for politics. This will allow you to continue engaging in politics through social media without rubbing any of your friends the wrong way. Some people might unfriend people because they never interact with them. If you are upset by someone unfriending you, you might make a point of liking and leaving positive comments on other people’s posts more often.  For example, if a friend from high school posts a picture of their new haircut, like their picture and give them a compliment. Or, if someone posts an article that they think is interesting, give it a quick read and comment on what you think is interesting about it. if it’s upsetting you.

Please answer the following question: For Yali Liu, the hardest thing about UK higher education is having to go to the pub. \\"It's how much you need to invest socially with other students,\\" she says. \\"I don't like going to a pub or club, but people just keep going out and I feel the pressure to go out too.\\" This is because, unlike in China, she says, there is so much emphasis during the course on teamwork and group projects, so socialising with other students - especially British people, is crucial. Liu, 23, who is in her final year of a BSc in business administration at the University of Bath, is one of more than 80,000 Chinese students studying in UK universities. They are responsible for a large proportion of the more than PS10bn a year that international students contribute to the UK economy. However, research shows that where their academic attainment  is concerned, the picture is not satisfactory. While nearly 58% of all students - and 45% of overseas students graduated with a first-class degree last year, this was true of only 35% of students from China. To find an explanation, Zhiqi Wang and Ian Crawford, lecturers at the University of Bath, compared the performance of Chinese and British undergraduates in each year of their degree. Taking a sample of 100 British and Chinese students and comparing their average marks and final degree classification, they found a dramatic drop in performance among the Chinese students between year one, when they performed better than their UK counterparts, and year two, when they performed worse. They believe the drop results from two factors. First, Chinese students fail to adapt their approaches to learning and so their performance declines in the later years when the complexity of the work increases. Second, many young people in China enroll in higher education due to pressure from family rather than their own motivation. Professor Sedghi thinks part of the problem may be the changing socio-economic background of Chinese undergraduates. While 85% of Chinese students at British universities before 2000... What can be inferred about Yali Liu from the passage? A) She is not good at socialising with local students. B) She is bored with the teamwork and group projects.

Question: what are the top three laws in science I found the following answer on Google: Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, universal constants emerge from scientific laws. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"The answer you found on Google refers to the emergence of universal constants in scientific laws, which is indeed an important aspect of science. However, this answer does not directly address the question about the top three laws in science. Thus, the response you found is not a direct answer to your question, although it's related to scientific laws in general. Identifying the top three laws in science could be subjective, as it depends on the context of the scientific field and its major contributions. However, let me provide you with three fundamental laws from different areas in science that have significantly impacted our understanding of the world. 1. Newton's Laws of Motion (Physics): Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most influential scientists of all time, proposed three fundamental laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting upon it. These laws have far-reaching applications in various fields, such as engineering, mechanics, and aeronautics.     a. Newton's First Law (Inertia): An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction, unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force.        b. Newton's Second Law (Force): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).        c. Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. 2. Law of Universal Gravitation (Physics): Another major contribution by Sir Isaac Newton, the law of universal gravitation states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2). This law is fundamental in understanding the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies in the universe. 3. Mendelian Laws of Inheritance (Biology): Gregor Mendel's laws of inheritance are fundamental principles in genetics and have had a profound impact on our understanding of heredity and traits in living organisms. Mendel's laws include:    a. Law of Segregation: During gamete formation, the two alleles of a gene segregate so that the offspring acquires one allele from each parent.        b. Law of Independent Assortment: Genes for different traits assort independently of one another during gamete formation.        c. Law of Dominance: When two organisms with contrasting traits are bred, the offspring will express the dominant trait. While it's difficult to narrow down the top three laws in science, these laws mentioned above have had a significant impact on scientific knowledge and various applications in the modern world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A charismatic and popular figure, Morales' ascendancy signifies a potential return to power for the Movement for Socialism (MAS), the party he founded and led for more than 13 years before being ousted in 2019. Evo Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous president, served three consecutive terms from 2006 to 2019. Throughout his tenure, Morales implemented numerous progressive policies focused on reducing poverty and inequality, as well as nationalizing key industries. His actions led to significant improvement in Bolivia's social and economic indicators, which gained him widespread support from the working class and indigenous majority. However, his term was not without controversy, as there were allegations of corruption and authoritarianism during his rule. After being declared the winner of the disputed 2019 presidential election, Morales faced widespread protests and accusations of electoral fraud from opposition parties and international organizations, including the Organization of American States. Amid escalating tensions and violence, the military urged him to step down, leading to his resignation and eventual exile in Mexico and Argentina. Since Evo Morales' departure, Bolivia has been governed by an interim president, Jeanine Áñez, who's faced her own set of challenges in trying to stabilize the nation. The political landscape has seen no shortage of uncertainty and unrest, and many Bolivians hope that the upcoming elections will mark a turning point for the country. The recent voting preference poll demonstrates the remarkable resilience of Evo Morales' political influence in Bolivia. Despite being barred from running for a fourth presidential term by the Bolivian Constitutional Court, Morales has strategically positioned himself and his party for a potential comeback. The poll shows that, as an opposition leader, Morales' popularity remains intact; this is a testament to his enduring allure amongst the electorate. The Movement for Socialism's (MAS) lead in the voting preference poll denotes the possibility of a dramatic return to power, which could reshape Bolivia's political future. The MAS, known for its pro-indigenous, socialist ideals, has pledged to continue the policies that were enacted during Morales' time in power, such as nationalization, social welfare programs, and infrastructure development. In conclusion, the results of the Bolivian voting preference poll reveal a significant shift towards the opposition leader, Evo Morales, and his Movement for Socialism, as the country prepares for its upcoming elections. The MAS's potential return to power demonstrates Morales' enduring influence and popularity, as well as the party's commitment to addressing social and economic inequality in Bolivia. As the nation seeks stability after a turbulent period, all eyes will be on the election outcomes to determine the direction of this South American country moving forward."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: In order to properly credit an image, you need to gather as much information as you can. Once you’ve located the original source for an image, try to find the name of the person who created it.  This could be the name of the person who runs the website where the image is hosted. This could be a username (especially if the image originated on tumblr, pinterest, or other social media sites). Look for a caption, scroll over the image to see if additional information comes up, or attempt to save the image to see what the file is named. If possible, try to determine when the image was created. If the image in question is a representation of an existing artwork or photograph, include the date that the original work was created.  If you are working with a web-only image, see if the website hosting the image has information about image usage or copyright. You may be able to find the date of creation there. If you are citing an existing artwork, an internet search should be able to tell you the date of creation. If you are citing an artwork, you’ll also need to mention where the original piece is held. List the name of the gallery, library, or museum. Also, list the city where that institution is located. For instance, if you’re talking about Dali’s The Persistence of Memory, a quick internet search will tell you that it is held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife.

This meaning is more related to personal experience, with the focus on the sensory or practical aspects of the activity being suggested. 2. \\"The judge tried both father and son in separate trials.\\" In this sentence, \\"try\\" takes on a different meaning as a verb, which is \\"to examine and determine the issues in a case through a judicial process.\\" In this context, the judge is the person who is conducting the legal process to decide whether the father and son have committed an offense based on the presented evidence and arguments in the trials. This meaning of \\"try\\" is related to law and the judicial system, and it implies the investigation and examination of facts, testimonies, and legal procedures in order to make a verdict. This usage has a more formal connotation than the one found in the first example. So, even though the word \\"try\\" appears in both sentences, its meaning and application in each context are distinct. In the first sentence, it conveys the idea of sampling or testing something new, while the second sentence addresses the concept of conducting a legal examination in a courtroom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: A Journal Review: This book tells of the grief period that a woman went through after losing a loved one. It was well written, and she poured her soul into it. Answer: A:","output":"Based on the given information, it appears that the product review has a predominantly positive tone. This can be inferred from various aspects of the review which I will discuss in detail.

Answer based on context: Coming off their loss to the Chargers, the Cowboys hosted the Denver Broncos at home for an interconference duel.  The Cowboys grabbed a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tony Romo to wide receiver Dez Bryant, followed by running back DeMarco Murray rushing for a 4-yard touchdown. The latter score occurred after a fumble by Broncos' wide receiver Eric Decker. The Broncos later got on the scoreboard, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 4-yard shovel pass to tight end Julius Thomas for a touchdown. Early in the second quarter, a 43-yard field goal by placekicker Dan Bailey gave the Cowboys a 17-7 lead. The Broncos then reeled off 21 unanswered points, with Manning adding two more touchdown passes &#8212; a 2-yarder to Decker and a 9-yarder to Thomas, followed by Manning rushing for a 1-yard touchdown on a bootleg play. A 48-yard field goal by Bailey at the end of the first half narrowed the Broncos' lead to 28-20. In the second half, the Broncos added to their lead midway through the third quarter, with Manning connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker. However, the Cowboys subsequently began chipping away at the Broncos' lead, with Romo connecting on an 82-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrance Williams. A 48-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater gave the Broncos a 38-27 lead, but the Cowboys further narrowed the Broncos' lead, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Bryant (with an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt). Following an intercepted Broncos' pass,  the Cowboys subsequently re-claimed the lead early in the fourth quarter, with Romo throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten, coupled with a two-point pass from Romo to Williams. The Broncos tied the game at 41-41 on their next possession, with a 50-yard field goal by Prater.  As the shootout continued, on the Cowboys' next possession, Romo connected on a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cole Beasley to give the Cowboys a 48-41 lead with 7:19 remaining in the fourth quarter. Manning subsequently led the Broncos on a 9-play, 73-yard drive, which culminated with running back Knowshon Moreno rushing for a 1-yard touchdown to tie the game at 48-48 with 2:24 remaining in the fourth quarter. Two plays into the Cowboys' next possession, as the Cowboys were attempting a game-winning drive, Romo was intercepted by Broncos' linebacker Danny Trevathan at the Cowboys' 24-yard line just before the two-minute warning. On the fourth play of the Broncos' final possession, the Broncos were facing a 3rd-and-1 at the Cowboys' 2-yard line, after the Cowboys had exhausted two of their three team timeouts. Moreno earned a crucial first down after Manning implored him to go down before reaching the goal line instead of scoring a touchdown, which forced the Cowboys to burn their final timeout with 1:35 remaining in the fourth quarter. After three kneel-downs by Manning, Prater nailed the game-winning 28-yard field goal as time expired.

I was already staying at the Rio, so this location was very convenient.  There were several things that I liked better about this Hash House than at the Imperial Palace, mostly that it felt less stuffy.  Overall, it was a much better dining experience.   My instincts to give it another shot paid off as I really enjoyed my food.  I ordered the bacon waffle, which was a waffle with bacon in the center that stuck out of each corner.  My plan was to order a waffle and a side of bacon, but this covered all my bases!  It was slightly on the salty side, but my waiter had warned me about that prior to ordering.

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.  - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties.  - Alan Walbridge Ladd (September 3, 1913  January 29, 1964) was an American actor and film and television producer. Ladd found success in film the 1940s and early 1950s, particularly in Westerns such as \\"Shane\\" (1953) and film noirs where he was often paired with Veronica Lake, such as \\"This Gun for Hire\\" (1942), \\"The Glass Key\\" (1942) and \\"The Blue Dahlia\\" (1946).

The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - A film genre (or ) is a motion picture category based on similarities in either the narrative elements or the emotional response to the film (namely, serious, comic, etc.).

Other subgenres include the courtroom and trial-focused drama known as the legal drama. Types of fiction which may seem unrelated can also be combined to form hybrid subgenres, such as the melding of horror and comedy in the \\"Evil Dead\\" films. Other popular combinations are the romantic comedy and the action comedy film.  - The James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz.

Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - O.S.S. is a 1946 war film starring Alan Ladd and Geraldine Fitzgerald about the Office of Strategic Services , directed by Irving Pichel , who would soon be blacklisted and written by Richard Maibaum , a World War Two vet who would later write 12 of the first 15 James Bond films .

It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was a wartime intelligence agency of the United States during World War II, and a predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The OSS was formed as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Other OSS functions included the use of propaganda, subversion, and post-war planning.  - Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly such that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography. Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression.  - Veronica Lake (born Constance Frances Marie Ockelman; November 14, 1922  July 7, 1973) was an American film, stage, and television actress.

If the room you’re working in has external windows, open these as wide as possible. If you’d like to take a further safety precaution, rent a vapor-rated respirator  and wear it while you’re staining the pine floor.  You can rent a vapor-rated respirator at a local hardware or home supply store. Since you’ll be working with the windows open, it’s advisable to finish the pine flooring on a warm, rain-free day. If you are not impressed with the natural color of the pine flooring and would like to darken it, you can purchase a stain to seal and darken the pine. Visit your local paint store and ask to peruse their stain selection. Speak with the sales staff to determine which brand and variety of stain is best for your flooring, considering its location in your house and the amount of use it will receive. The major difference between stain and varnish is that varnish will dry clear while stain will darken the color of your flooring. So, if you prefer the natural color of the pine flooring and just want to seal it to protect against moisture and scratches, opt for a varnish. Unlike oil, varnish adheres to the top of the wood without soaking deep into the grain. Consequently, you can remove varnish if you decide to. Oil cannot be removed from wood. Oils are a traditional softwood finish that will penetrate deep into the pine flooring. Oil finishes—unlike many varnishes—won’t peel or flake, and often look better with age. Types of oil commonly used to finish pine floors include:  Tung oil, which has a relatively low level of sheen. This leaves the pine with a more “natural” appearance. Linseed oil, which is tarry and so brings out the grain of the pine. Lemon or walnut oil, which are considered specialty oils and may be more expensive. Before you stain the entire floor, test the stain in an inconspicuous are to make sure that you like the color. Apply the stain using a 3 in (7.6 cm) paintbrush. Let the stain dry for 24 hours.  If you like the appearance of the stained sample patch, you can proceed with staining the entire floor. If you don’t like the appearance of the stained wood, select a different colored stain. Or, if you realize that you prefer the natural color of unstained pine, opt for a clear varnish instead.","output":"Fumes from stain or varnish can be harmful to one's health, so it is essential to take necessary precautions while working with these substances, especially when staining or varnishing pine flooring. To ensure proper ventilation, open external windows as wide as possible, and consider renting a vapor-rated respirator from a local hardware or home supply store for added safety. To achieve the desired color or protective finish on pine flooring, choose between stain, varnish, or oil. Stain darkens the wood, while varnish provides a clear protective layer on top of the wood without changing its natural color. Oil penetrates deep into the wood grain and offers a more traditional finishing option that does not peel or flake and becomes more appealing over time. For oils, there are several options, such as tung oil which leaves a low sheen and looks more \\"natural,\\" linseed oil that brings out the wood grain, or specialty oils like lemon or walnut oil, which can be more expensive. Before applying the chosen finish to the entire floor, it is best to test a small, inconspicuous area to ensure satisfaction with the color and appearance. If happy with the result, proceed to apply the stain, varnish, or oil using a 3-inch (7.6 cm) paintbrush and leave it to dry for 24 hours. If dissatisfied, either choose a different color of stain or opt for a clear varnish to maintain the natural color of the pine flooring. When working on pine flooring, it is also crucial to choose a warm, rain-free day, as windows should be open for ventilation purposes. Remember to consult with sales staff at a local paint store to determine the best type of stain, varnish, or oil for your specific floor and its location within your home.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Reading my review of THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED, many may assume that I'm some 14 year old who thinks SCREAM is considered \\"classic\\" horror. This is not the case, as I'm 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life. But admittedly, I'm a child of the 80's that grew up on slasher/zombie/ghost/cannibal, etc...types of horror films - so I do typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster-paced. Just like someone who can appreciate different music, painting, or in this case, film - but not necessarily like them - I can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of film...I just don't... THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is an exceedingly dull and tedious film about a school for wayward girls. The heavy-handed mistress of the school rules with an iron hand (or whip in some cases...) to keep the girls in line. She has a young son who creeps around and peeps on the girls while they shower (in their nightgowns no less (?!?)...), and meanwhile, girls are disappearing from the school as they are the victim of a murderer who's lurking about the campus... I can see why THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is often compared to SUSPIRIA (which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion...), in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - but this film is so dull and uneventful that I could barely stay awake. I'm all for \\"tension\\" and \\"suspense\\" in horror films - but this film held neither for me. Luckily, I wasn't expecting a whole lot going into this one, so I can't say I was really disappointed - THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED just reinforced the fact that I personally don't typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70's. This isn't a hard and fast rule, but those that I HAVE enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception. Probably a \\"must-see\\" for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror films - but as I don't really know too many fans of that sort of material, I can't really recommend this one...4/10 What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly negative. The person who wrote this doesn't really like the movie \\"THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED\\". They use words like \\"dull,\\" \\"tedious,\\" and \\"uneventful,\\" and they said they could barely stay awake.

He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He had to storm the pass of the Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury. On entering Persepolis, Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days. Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months. During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of Xerxes and spread to the rest of the city.

This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade.

The premise suggests that the current network may not be meeting the intended goal of providing Floridians with adequate access to help. Consequently, it also implies that the person making this statement considers restructuring or altering the existing system to be a necessary measure in order to meet these needs. Now, let us examine the hypothesis: \\"The current network in Florida is not streamlined.\\" This hypothesis, in essence, proposes that the network in question is not designed or organized effectively. In other words, it contends that the current system is not optimized for maximal performance. The premise and the hypothesis appear to be logically connected. The desire for a \\"streamlined and more efficient network\\" expressed in the premise, indicates a belief that the present system is lacking in these aspects. This subsequently aligns with the notion put forth in the hypothesis—that the existing network is not, in fact, streamlined.  Therefore, one might conclude that the premise provides reasonable evidence in support of the hypothesis. The assertion that a more efficient and streamlined network is desirable in Florida implies a perception that the current system is not sufficiently optimized to most effectively serve Floridians in need of help.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer for the question: Who is a former real estate developer? from the following article ?  Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive. The answer to this question is:","output":"Doris Hillman is the former real estate developer in the article. She approaches Edward Shaw with a business proposal to buy land together and build houses that she would sell using her experience as a former real estate broker.

Two American tourists and their guide were kidnapped Friday in the Sinai region of Egypt, authorities said. Bedouin kidnappers want authorities to release a relative who is in detention in Alexandria on drug charges, said Gen. Ahmed Bakr, head of security in the North Sinai. Kidnappings and armed robberies have increased since a popular uprising ousted Egypt's long-ruling dictator, Hosni Mubarak, last year. In February, two American tourists were kidnapped and soon released in the Sinai region. The same thing happened in June, when two American tourists were released about a day after being abducted. In the most recent incident, Bedouins stopped a tour bus en route to Taba and kidnapped the two tourists -- a man and a woman -- and their guide, Bakr said.

To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being.  By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful.  Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... Question: What takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy? Options:  A. Avoiding one's feelings  B. Keeping an exercise routine  C. not enough information  D. Sticking to a diet  === The correct answer is A:","output":"Avoiding one's feelings takes a lot of mental, physical, and emotional energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What does an animal do when it becomes old?  A. live long  B. leave home  C. feel pain  D. eating  E. sense fear in human  The best answer is The answer is:","output":"C. feel pain As animals age, they undergo various changes in their bodies similar to humans. These changes can lead to a decline in their physical and mental abilities. Thus, the best answer to the question \\"What does an animal do when it becomes old?\\" is C. feel pain, as it encompasses the age-related discomforts and ailments that an older animal is likely to experience. Let's discuss this answer in more detail along with the other options for a deeper understanding. A. Live long: While it is true that animals have varied lifespans, simply becoming old doesn't guarantee a longer life. In fact, as animals age, they become more susceptible to illness and injuries, which can lead to a shortened life expectancy. B. Leave home: Generally, animals do not leave their homes or territories because of old age. However, their ability to maintain and defend their territories may be affected as they get older, making them more vulnerable to competitors. C. Feel pain: As mentioned earlier, this option is the most accurate answer. As animals age, they become more prone to experiencing pain and discomfort due to deteriorating body functions, joint issues, and other age-related ailments. For instance, older dogs can develop arthritis, which causes pain and stiffness in their joints. Old age can also exacerbate existing health conditions, leading to increased discomfort and pain. D. Eating: While eating is an essential activity for animals throughout their lives, it doesn't adequately describe their experience as they age. Older animals may face difficulties in eating due to dental problems or a decrease in their sense of smell and taste, but this doesn't holistically describe their overall condition when they get old. E. Sense fear in human: This option is unrelated to an animal's experience of aging. Animals can have varying sensitivity to human emotions based on their species, individual personality, and level of socialization. However, this ability is not directly connected to the aging process. In conclusion, the most accurate answer to the question is C. feel pain, as it highlights the physical challenges and discomforts that animals are likely to encounter as they grow older. While the other options may hold some relevance, they do not capture the essence of an animal's experience during old age."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","output":"Yes, both Phu Quoc Ridgeback and Mudi are breeds of dogs. They are distinct in their characteristics, appearances, and origins, but they share common traits as they both belong to the canine species. Let's delve deeper into their background and features to have a better understanding of these two fascinating dog breeds.  Phu Quoc Ridgeback: The Phu Quoc Ridgeback originates from Phu Quoc Island – a Vietnamese island situated in the Gulf of Thailand. Known for its pristine beaches and impressive wildlife, the island is also famous as the home of these unique dogs. Although not as well-known worldwide compared to other breeds, the Phu Quoc Ridgeback has long been a valuable companion to the island's residents. Appearance-wise, the Phu Quoc Ridgeback is a medium-sized dog with a lean and muscular build. They have short, glossy coats that come in three primary colors: jet black, black with reddish-brown markings, and golden-yellow or tawny. One distinguishing feature of these dogs is the ridge of hair growing in the opposite direction along their back, starting from the shoulders and extending to the hip. The hair-ridge is a characteristic trait shared among three breeds – Rhodesian Ridgeback, Thai Ridgeback, and Phu Quoc Ridgeback. Phu Quoc Ridgebacks are known for being incredibly agile, swift, and resilient. They are excellent hunters and traditionally assisted local fishermen by catching fish and defending their catches from theft. These dogs are said to have a keen sense of smell, which makes them excellent trackers. They are intelligent, independent, and loyal to their owners but can be reserved to strangers. Mudi: The Mudi, on the other hand, originates from Hungary and is a herding dog used for various tasks, including herding livestock, protecting property, and providing companionship. First officially recognized in the 1930s, the Mudi is relatively rare compared to other well-known Hungarian breeds like the Puli and the Komondor. The Mudi is a medium-sized dog with a sporty and robust build. They have moderately long, wavy to curly coats that require minimal grooming. Coat colors can vary from white, black, gray, brown, yellow, or a mix known as \\"blue merle.\\" Mudi have a distinct appearance, characterized by their pointy ears, which stand upright and give them an alert and focused expression. These dogs are highly intelligent, versatile, and adaptable, making them suitable for numerous dog sports and activities like agility, obedience, and search and rescue. Mudis are loyal and loving with their families, and their high intelligence makes them quick learners that thrive on mental and physical stimulation. However, they can be reserved with strangers and may exhibit a strong guarding instinct. In conclusion, both the Phu Quoc Ridgeback and the Mudi are dog breeds with unique characteristics and qualities, stemming from their geographical origins and roles in their respective societies. Despite their differences, their shared canine lineage unites them. Each breed possesses its distinct charm that appeals to dog lovers from all walks of life, and both can make excellent companions when given appropriate care, training, and socialization."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"A woman sitting in a seat with a hat on singing.\\" if \\"the women is homeless trying to get some money by singing\\"?","output":"The statement \\"A woman sitting in a seat with a hat on singing,\\" is a description of a scene, where the focus is on the physical setup and the activity being performed by the woman. It describes the woman's appearance, her position (sitting), the presence of a hat, and the action she is engaged in (singing). On the other hand, the information that \\"the woman is homeless trying to get some money by singing\\" provides context and motivation behind her actions. The woman's homeless status indicates her socioeconomic situation, and her objective of trying to get some money explains the reason why she is singing. It is possible that she is using the hat as a receptacle for passers-by to drop money into, as a form of street performance to attract attention and collect donations. Given the second piece of information and with additional context, we can conclude that there is a connection between the two statements. The woman, who is described as sitting in a seat with a hat on and singing, is the same woman who is homeless and trying to get some money by singing. Her position and actions make sense in the context of her situation, as singing while seated may help her create a more visible presence on the street, while the presence of a hat can serve as a makeshift container for collecting money from people who choose to donate to her. However, it is important to note that, by themselves, the two statements do not explicitly imply each other. Without additional context, it might not be immediately clear that the woman's act of singing while seated with a hat on is a result of her homelessness or a means to obtain money. The scene might also be interpreted in different ways, such as a casual performance or practice session. Therefore, while it is possible to conclude that the two statements are related given further context, it would not be necessarily accurate to assume that one statement implies the other without additional information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Questions About Organic Produce and Sustainability Growers here on the Baja Peninsula, the epicenter of Mexico’s thriving new organic export sector, describe their toil amid the cactuses as “planting the beach.” Del Cabo Cooperative, a supplier here for Trader Joe’s and Fairway, is sending more than seven and a half tons of tomatoes and basil every day to the United States by truck and plane to sate the American demand for organic produce year-round. But even as more Americans buy foods with the organic label, the products are increasingly removed from the traditional organic ideal: produce that is not only free of chemicals and pesticides but also grown locally on small farms in a way that protects the environment. The explosive growth in the commercial cultivation of organic tomatoes here, for example, is putting stress on the water table. In some areas, wells have run dry this year, meaning that small subsistence farmers cannot grow crops. And the organic tomatoes end up in an energy-intensive global distribution chain that takes them as far as New York and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, producing significant emissions that contribute to global warming. From now until spring, farms from Mexico to Chile to Argentina that grow organic food for the United States market are enjoying their busiest season. “People are now buying from a global commodity market, and they have to be skeptical even when the label says ‘organic’ — that doesn’t tell people all they need to know,” said Frederick L. Kirschenmann, a distinguished fellow at the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University. He said some large farms that have qualified as organic employed environmentally damaging practices, like planting only one crop, which is bad for soil health, or overtaxing local freshwater supplies. Many growers and even environmental groups in Mexico defend the export-driven organic farming, even as they acknowledge that more than a third of the aquifers in southern Baja are categorized as overexploited by the Mexican water authority. With sophisticated irrigation systems and shade houses, they say, farmers are becoming more skilled at conserving water. They are focusing new farms in “microclimates” near underexploited aquifers, such as in the shadow of a mountain, said Fernando Frías, a water specialist with the environmental group Pronatura Noroeste. They also point out that the organic business has transformed what was once a poor area of subsistence farms and where even the low-paying jobs in the tourist hotels and restaurants in nearby Cabo San Lucas have become scarcer during the recession. To carry the Agriculture Department’s organic label on their produce, farms in the United States and abroad must comply with a long list of standards that prohibit the use of synthetic fertilizers, hormones and pesticides, for example. But the checklist makes few specific demands for what would broadly be called environmental sustainability, even though the 1990 law that created the standards was intended to promote ecological balance and biodiversity as well as soil and water health. Experts agree that in general organic farms tend to be less damaging to the environment than conventional farms. In the past, however, “organic agriculture used to be sustainable agriculture, but now that is not always the case,” said Michael Bomford, a scientist at Kentucky State University who specializes in sustainable agriculture. He added that intense organic agriculture had also put stress on aquifers in California. Some organic standard setters are beginning to refine their criteria so that organic products better match their natural ideals. Krav, a major Swedish organic certification program, allows produce grown in greenhouses to carry its “organic” label only if the buildings use at least 80 percent renewable fuel, for example. And last year the Agriculture Department’s National Organic Standards Board revised its rules to require that for an “organic milk” label, cows had to be at least partly fed by grazing in open pastures rather than standing full time in feedlots. But each decision to narrow the definition of “organic” involves an inevitable tug-of-war among farmers, food producers, supermarkets and environmentalists. While the United States’ regulations for organic certification require that growers use practices that protect water resources, it is hard to define a specific sustainable level of water use for a single farm “because aquifer depletion is the result of many farmers’ overutilizing the resource,” said Miles McEvoy, head of the National Organic Program at the Agriculture Department. While the original organic ideal was to eat only local, seasonal produce, shoppers who buy their organics at supermarkets, from Whole Foods to Walmart, expect to find tomatoes in December and are very sensitive to price. Both factors stoke the demand for imports. Few areas in the United States can farm organic produce in the winter without resorting to energy-guzzling hothouses. In addition, American labor costs are high. Day laborers who come to pick tomatoes in this part of Baja make about 10 a day, nearly twice the local minimum wage. Tomato pickers in Florida may earn 80 a day in high season. Manuel Verdugo, 42, began organic tomato farming on desert land in San José del Cabo five years ago and now owns 30 acres in several locations. Each week he sends two and a half tons of cherry, plum and beefsteak tomatoes to the United States under the brand name Tiky Cabo. He has invested in irrigation systems that drip water directly onto plants’ roots rather than channeling it through open canals. He is building large shade houses that cover his crops to keep out pests and minimize evaporation. Even so, he cannot farm 10 acres in the nearby hamlet of La Cuenca because the wells there are dry. At another five-year-old organic farm, Rosario Castillo says he can cultivate only 19 acres of the 100 he has earmarked for organic production, although he dug a well seven months ago to gain better access to the aquifer. The authorities ration pumping and have not granted him permission to clear native cactuses. “We have very little water here, and you have to go through a lot of bureaucracy to get it,” Mr. Castillo said. Many growers blame tourist development — hotels and golf courses — for the water scarcity, and this has been a major problem in coastal areas. But farming can also be a significant drain. According to one study in an area of northern Baja called Ojos Negros, a boom in the planting of green onions for export a decade ago lowered the water table by about 16 inches a year. “They were pumping a lot of groundwater, and that was making some people rich on both sides of the border at the expense of the environment,” said Victor Miguel Ponce, a professor of hydrology at San Diego State University. The logistics of getting water and transporting large volumes of perishable produce favors bigger producers. Some of the largest are American-owned, like Sueño Tropical, a vast farm with rows of shade houses lined up in the desert that caters exclusively to the American market. While traditional organic farmers saw a blemish or odd shape simply as nature’s variations, workers at Sueño Tropical are instructed to cull tomatoes that do not meet the uniform shape, size and cosmetic requirement of clients like Whole Foods. Those “seconds” are sold locally. Yet the connection to the United States has brought other kinds of benefits. Del Cabo Cooperative, which serves as a broker for hundreds of local farmers, provides seeds for its Mexican growers and hires roving agronomists and entomologists to assist them in tending their crops without chemicals. As the American market expands, said John Graham, a coordinator of operations at Del Cabo, he is always looking to bring new growers into his network — especially those whose farms draw on distant aquifers where water is still abundant.","output":"The booming organic food export industry in Mexico is contributing to water scarcity and an energy-intensive global distribution chain. The commercial cultivation of organic tomatoes is causing particular strain on the water table, leading to dry wells in some areas. Organic foods, which were once always considered sustainable, are now putting stress on aquifers, with intense organic agriculture causing issues in countries like the US as well. Mexican farmers provide large amounts of organic food to the US, but the environmental impact, including transportation and water usage, detracts from their original sustainable goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: Northern Ireland Moves Towards Banning Smoking in Cars with Child Passengers Introduction The dangers of secondhand smoke have long been established and understood by the general public. However, despite the knowledge of these dangers, smoking in vehicles with children as passengers continues to occur. In an effort to protect the health and well-being of children, Northern Ireland is moving closer to banning smoking in cars while youngsters are on board. Background on Secondhand Smoke Secondhand smoke, also called passive smoke or environmental tobacco smoke, is a dangerous mixture of more than 4,000 chemicals produced by a burning tobacco product. These chemicals are classified as toxic and cancer-causing agents. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to secondhand smoke causes approximately 600,000 premature deaths globally every year.  Children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke due to their developing respiratory systems. In comparison to adults, children breathe in more air relative to their body weight, leading to a greater intake of pollutants. According to the American Lung Association, secondhand smoke is a known cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, ear infections, and asthma attacks in children.  Banning Smoking in Cars with Children: A Global Movement Countries around the world have already proposed and enacted legislation to protect children from exposure to secondhand smoke in vehicles. For example, in 2002, the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador became the first place to implement such a ban. Since then, other provinces in Canada, as well as countries including Australia, France, England, and Wales, have instituted similar legislation. The Proposal in Northern Ireland Northern Ireland is now on the verge of joining this growing list of countries that are addressing the problem of smoking in cars with child passengers. The proposed ban on smoking in cars carrying passengers aged 18 or under has been under discussion and review in Northern Ireland’s Assembly. It is expected that the legislation will be introduced, debated, and enacted in the near future.  The legislation aims to protect the health and welfare of children when they are passengers in vehicles. It acknowledges the heightened vulnerability of young people to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke and reflects the growing concern in society about the public health implications of smoking around children. Public Reaction and Enforcement The proposal has generally been met with widespread public support, as more people recognize the dangers of exposing children to secondhand smoke. However, opponents argue that the ban may be difficult to enforce and might infringe on the personal liberties of those who smoke.  Nevertheless, the ban on smoking in cars with children present aligns with Northern Ireland's broader anti-smoking initiatives. Various methods may be employed to enforce compliance with the legislation, such as fines for drivers caught smoking with a child in the vehicle or signage within the car to remind drivers and passengers of the law. Conclusion The proposed ban on smoking in cars with children passengers in Northern Ireland aligns with the growing global movement to protect vulnerable populations from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke exposure. Legislation such as this demonstrates a commitment to public health by governments and represents a step forward in safeguarding the wellbeing of children. With time and sustained efforts, it is hoped that the exposure of children to secondhand smoke in cars and other confined spaces will become a phenomenon of the past."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most businesses would hate to see their customers running out their doors, but in one suburban strip mall near Denver, Colorado, they are chasing the customers away -- with a chainsaw. \\"We're 'hauntrepreneurs,' we like to do things that are just a little bit different,\\" says KathE Walker, who owns four haunted houses in the Denver area. \\"It's really exciting because you know you've done a good job,\\" Walker says. \\"If they are running out screaming, then the actors have done their jobs, everybody has had a good time because they want to be scared. That's why they come. \\"If they're not scared, they won't come back.\\" KathE Walker -- the capital E isn't a typo, \\"it's a '60s thing,\\" she says -- laughs a lot for a woman in the business of scaring her customers. Walker, 59, runs her haunts with her husband and two grown sons. They spend the rest of the year making props for other haunted houses around the country and they throw a big science fiction convention each spring. Despite the tough economy, Walker says, business is good. She anticipates a total of 40,000-50,000 visitors, each paying 14.95 to get scared. She employs about 175 people for the Halloween season. Three of her haunts are in unused storefronts in suburban strip malls and a fourth operates out of trailers in a field near a state park. Visitors are also asked to contribute a can of food for a local food bank. Larry Kirchner, president of the Haunted House Association, says business is booming across the country for seasonal frightfests. The association says there are 2,000 for-profit haunts across the country, plus another 1,000 houses run for charity. Around 20 million fright-seekers will pay an average of 15 a visit this Halloween season, according to the group. That's a surprising figure to some in these lean economic times. \\"We feel very fortunate,\\" Walker says. \\"I know that the economy is very scary for a lot of people. The people that we aim the haunted houses at are kids in high school and college, kids that have a lot more disposable income. They're still living with their parents. \\"We don't draw a lot of people that are desperate to make their mortgages. ... It's great date-night stuff. Guys love bringing their girlfriends here, they're holding onto them. It's fun.\\" It's fun for Walker, too. While giving a tour of Slaughterhouse Gulch, which features a series of movie monsters, she giggles as a cluster of date-night teenagers scream and run from Leatherface, the villain from the \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" films. \\"You make some money, obviously that's why you keep doing it,\\" she says. \\"But for the most part we put a lot of money back into the haunted house so we can keep making them bigger and better. ... It can be kind of expensive. You cross your fingers each year hoping people will come.\\" Walker says she loves the challenge of scaring people. \\"Some people come in and they say 'Oh you can't scare me,' \\" she says. \\"And they all end up running out of here, just terrified.\\" So what scares Walker? \\"Clowns. I hate clowns. It took me a long time to finally let clowns be in the haunted house.\\" 'Scaring people is really fun' Walker staffs her haunted houses with teens and 20-somethings who seem to have as much fun as the patrons. In the makeup room, Chris Parish is getting ready for his first day on the job. He'll be playing the guy chained in the bathtub from the movie \\"Saw.\\" \\"Today is my first day scheduled, so I actually get to get paid for scaring people,\\" he says. \\"Scaring people is really fun and it's something that I love to do.\\" Halloween is makeup artist Michael Garvin's favorite time of year. He was laid off in July and hasn't been able to find another job, but during October he works days at a costume shop and nights making up the 35-40 actors who fill two of Walker's haunts. \\"When I was really young I fell in love with Halloween and then horror movies,\\" he said. \\"I love this. I'd do this just for the fun of it, but the paycheck at the end of the month is a good thing.\\" Caity Strother is 18 and has had trouble finding a job. It's her second year working in Slaughterhouse Gulch, where she specializes in portraying an undead ghoul. \\"I've filled out probably 50 applications in the last two months and gotten maybe four calls back,\\" she said. Years of Catholic school have given Strother a skill that prospective employers have not been impressed by, but she puts it to good use in the haunted house. \\"I get to yell at people in Latin,\\" she says.

Here is an article: Coming into the final stretch of Season 6 of The Good Wife, \\"Loser Edit\\" felt like a slower-paced episode in the midst of a season that has been full of adrenaline and conspiracy. Yet once the hour concluded, so many things had been set into motion that it was clear the action is nowhere near slowing down. Yet again, Alicia's storyline doesn't feel like the central story — not just because it's not any more compelling than the other characters', but because for only the second or third time this season she isn't getting the majority of the screen time. The illicit emails from last week's FLG hack come back to haunt Alicia. A reporter has received the emails and will take the story public. Eli's plan is, of course, to spin the emails before they're released: Alicia must deny that she had a physical affair, and say that the emails were the product of an office flirtation. The episode opens with Alicia's antagonistic reporter sitting in an edit room cutting the footage of their interview, which starts as a puff piece. We watch the colors of the piece flip as the story spins in a different direction after the emails come to light. During Alicia's campaign, episode after episode focused on the importance of perception, and the difference between what we believe and what the truth is. Alicia's campaign may be over, but she won't be able to leave politics behind her. The episode's closer is the airing of the reporter's story: Instead of the emails, she attacks Alicia with the accusation that she cheated at the polls. This is a crisis for which team Alicia was not prepared. Alicia isn't the only one with an old ghost resurfacing in this episode. The evidence Kalinda faked to prove Carey's innocence has come back to haunt them in the form of the investigator Andrew Wiley. It only takes a couple loose threads for the entire story to unravel, and Wiley finds them and pulls them (with two leashed kids in tow). It's a catastrophic situation, not just for Kalinda, but also for Diane, who could be disbarred for her participation in the fraud. This episode was jam-packed — we haven't even gotten to the C-plot involving Diane and her conservative client Reese Dipple. This was much more \\"case-of-the-week\\" driven than Alicia and Kalinda's stories, but in many ways it was the most satisfying, with Diane getting to stretch her muscles in a hypothetical lawsuit involving gay marriage. \\"The law is supposed to be fair,\\" she tells Dipple when he accuses her of manipulating him by casting his gay nephew as her plaintiff. \\"That doesn't mean it's not supposed to be personal.\\" Things have gotten very personal for Alicia as she's sought the office of State's Attorney, and for Kalinda as she tried desperately to save Carey from paying for a crime he didn't commit. Alicia and Kalinda both strayed from their moral code in their pursuit of a nobler aim, Alicia by lying about her affair with Will and Kalinda by faking evidence. There may not be enough distance for the two of them to outrun their demons, which are drawing closer as we approach the end of Season 6. Have something to add to this story?

The team performed better in the gym than on the field because it was slippery on the","output":"field, which affected their overall performance, whereas the gym provided a more stable and controlled environment, allowing them to showcase their true capabilities.  Firstly, the slippery field conditions posed by wet grass and muddy surfaces could significantly impact the team's ability to execute key maneuvers and maintain their footing. Due to the unpredictable and difficult nature of these conditions, players may have struggled to maintain their balance, speed, and agility, all of which are essential components in achieving peak performance. Slips and falls can lead not only to reduced efficiency during gameplay but can also raise the risk of injury among the team members, discouraging them from giving their all to their game. Consequently, the field conditions were a major impediment to the team's ability to demonstrate their full potential during the match. In contrast, the gym offered an even, dry, and stable surface that enabled the players to execute their movements with greater precision and confidence. The consistent conditions, free from potential hazards found on the slippery field, ensured that the players could invest their entire focus on their gameplay and strategies. This environment encouraged them to push their limits, knowing they would not be hindered by the challenges associated with unpredictable outdoor conditions. Moreover, the indoor environment of the gym may have aided temperature regulation and provided protection from the wind, rain, and other external weather factors that would have further contributed to the team's diminished performance on the field. Additionally, the nature of the gym facilitated a more structured practice and training regimen, which could have contributed to the team's enhanced performance. The availability of specialized equipment and resources that are typically found within a gym setting would have allowed the team to follow a well-rounded exercise program targeting specific muscle groups and skillsets. The systematic approach enabled by the gym environment would have fostered a higher level of teamwork, discipline, and focus within the group, translating into a more cohesive and effective performance during the actual game. In conclusion, the team's superior performance in the gym, as compared to the field, can be attributed to the unfavorable and unpredictable conditions presented by the slippery field, which hindered their gameplay and posed risks to their safety. Conversely, the stable and consistent environment provided by the gym facilitated not only a heightened level of performance but also allowed for targeted training and skill development. As a result, the team thrived under the more controlled conditions of the gym, showcasing their best abilities and true potential."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some possible aspects could be: - Poor food quality - Unfriendly service - Dirty environment - Slow service - Expensive prices Step 3: Write the negative review based on the chosen aspects Title: Disappointing Experience - Better Options Elsewhere I was excited to try out this restaurant after hearing about it from a friend. Unfortunately, the experience was far from satisfactory. To begin with, the service was incredibly slow. It took ages for our orders to be taken, and even longer for the food to arrive. We were starving and frustrated by the time we finally got our meals. Once the food arrived, we hoped that the taste would at least make up for the wait. However, the taste was a huge letdown. The dishes lacked seasoning and were bland, and it was apparent that the chef wasn't using fresh ingredients. Furthermore, the portion sizes were quite small, leaving us feeling unsatisfied and still hungry. To make matters worse, the overall cleanliness of the restaurant was appalling. The tablecloth was stained, the silverware had remnants of previous meals, and the floor seemed like it hadn't been swept in days. This did not help with our appetite and made us question the hygiene standards in the kitchen. On top of all this, the staff didn't seem to care about the guests. The waiter was unfriendly and barely interacted with us, making us feel like an inconvenience. The price we paid for this subpar experience was way too high and not worth it.  In conclusion, I cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant. There are many more dining options nearby that prove to be more enjoyable and worth the money. Save yourself the disappointment – skip this place. Step 4: Review and proofread the generated negative review I have generated the negative review for the restaurant, focusing on slow service, poor food quality, dirty environment, and unfriendly staff. Now, I'll read through the review once more to ensure it flows well and is free of errors before considering it complete."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: What would you do if you were lost in the dark forest at night? The first sensible lesson is that you shouldn't bother trying to find your way in the dark at all, but just stay put until dawn. Because then you won't trip over things? No, mainly because you'll have an idea of direction. The sun rises in the east. But you will be amazed at how many people forget they know that. Apparently, the area underneath a holly bush provides a good makeshift shelter -- they are thick, and evergreen. The next thing to do -- or rather not to do -- is panic, for the obvious reason that unless there is someone there to hear you scream, it will get you nowhere. Just try to think of nice, happy things. There is always a point in films when a person who is lost in the desert or the snow, dehydrated  and exhausted, comes across a set of their own footprints and realizes they have just walked in a huge, round circle. It is wrong to owe it to the unequal strengths or different lengths of your legs. Experiments prove that, without the sun or the moon (or landmarks) as a fixed guide, lots of small errors add up over time so the brain can't correctly identify the \\"straight ahead\\" direction. To just get out of somewhere, pick a spot on the horizon and just head for it. There are several ways to find directions in the dark, and by far the best is to establish north using the stars. Most people can identify the Plough, which is part of Ursa Major. It looks a lot like a saucepan. The Plough rotates through the sky, but let's imagine the saucepan lying horizontally  , with its handle on the left. You need to trace a line from the star at the right-hand base of the pan, through the star at the right-hand rim  , and follow it upwards; the north star is roughly five times the distance between those two \\"pointer\\" stars. Then drop a vertical line from the North Star to the horizon and that's north. \\"Tonight is very cloudy and I can't see the Plough.\\" Maybe luckily, it is quite windy. Keep in mind that almost all of our weather comes from a... Question: Why will people often walk in a circle if they are lost in the desert or the snow? Options: A: Because without anything to refer to for directions, the brain will be confused by errors. B: Because one of the legs is longer and stronger than the other. C: Because the desert or the snow usually covers a large area for people to get across. D: Because people usually feel dehydrated and exhausted in the desert or the snow.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. in fungi the individual filaments of the body are called??","output":"In fungi, the individual filaments that make up the body are called hyphae (singular: hypha). Hyphae are long, thin, thread-like structures composed of fungal cells, and are responsible for growth, nutrient absorption, and reproduction in fungi. Fungi are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that belong to the kingdom Fungi. They are heterotrophic, meaning they obtain their nutrition by breaking down and absorbing nutrients from other organic materials. Fungi can be found in various forms, such as multicellular molds or single-celled yeasts, but all fungi share the common feature of having hyphae as their basic structural and functional units. The hyphae grow and branch out to form an extensive network called a mycelium, which is the main vegetative part of a fungus. The mycelium can be found in various environments such as soil, decaying plant materials, or within living organisms as parasites. The hyphae produce enzymes that break down complex organic substances like cellulose, lignin, and pectin, into simpler compounds that the fungi can absorb and utilize for their growth and development. Hyphae can be classified into two types: septate and aseptate (or coenocytic).  1. Septate hyphae: These are hyphae that possess crosswalls, or septa, which divide the hypha into separate compartments. Each compartment contains one or more nuclei. These septa allow for compartmentalization and can help prevent the spreading of cellular damage or protect the hyphae from harmful substances. Septate hyphae are common in the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. 2. Aseptate (coenocytic) hyphae: In this type of hyphae, there are either no septa or very few of them, resulting in a continuous, multinucleate cytoplasm within a single hyphal filament. Aseptate hyphae are common in the phylum Zygomycota. Hyphae play a crucial role in sexual and asexual reproduction in fungi. During asexual reproduction, structures called conidiophores or sporangia are formed at the tips of specialized hyphae. These reproductive structures produce spores that are released and dispersed into the environment to give rise to new fungal colonies. In sexual reproduction, hyphae from two different mating types fuse together, resulting in the formation of specialized reproductive structures such as fruiting bodies, where sexual spores are produced. In summary, hyphae are the individual filaments that make up the body of fungi. They serve essential roles in growth, nutrient absorption, and reproduction, and are found in both septate and aseptate forms. By branching out into intricate mycelial networks, hyphae enable fungi to explore their habitats, break down and absorb nutrients, and interact with other organisms in various ecosystems."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Malva parviflora -  Malva parviflora is an annual or perennial herb that is native to Northern Africa Europe and Asia and is widely naturalised elsewhere.

Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within.

The album  was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona.

Their unanimous decision not to return to their homes or their tents signifies their commitment to the collective cause. This act underscores the gravity of their decision and the strong sense of community and solidarity that prevails among them. Whether read in lowercase or uppercase, the message of this segment remains clear and impactful. It encapsulates a significant event where people standing together as one voice and deciding not to return to the comforts of their personal homes showcases their unity and shared determination. Lowercase texts are more readable and are recommended for use in most written materials. The primary reason behind this recommendation is that people are accustomed to reading in lowercase. Our eyes have adapted to recognize the shapes of clusters of lowercase letters (also known as bouma shape), which help us to read more quickly and efficiently. Uppercase letters, on the other hand, take up more space visually, which can slow reading speed. They are primarily used for emphasis, titles, or to suggest loudness. In this context, the lowercase variant preserves the impactful message of unity and solidarity within the populace, while maintaining readability and a subtle tone.

A more detailed explanation: This statement highlights the importance of political leaders building and maintaining a positive image in the eyes of their constituents and the international community. A strong reputation as a reliable and honest individual is essential for any leader to establish credibility, trust, and respect from others. Leaders who are seen as trustworthy and forthright are more likely to successfully negotiate with other countries, carry out their policy agenda, and avoid internal and external conflict. In the case of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the statement suggests that he has not embraced this lesson, as he is frequently criticized for his actions and policies that are seen as manipulative, dishonest, or aggressive both domestically and internationally. Accusations of electoral interference, diminished political freedoms, and the annexation of Crimea are just a few examples that have tarnished Putin's reputation on the global stage. By not embracing the importance of cultivating a trustworthy and honest reputation, President Putin may experience challenges in effectively governing Russia and managing its relationships with other nations. This failure to adhere to the principles of transparency, honesty, and reliability could result in consequences that negatively impact Russia and its people in the long run. A leader who does not prioritize these qualities in their leadership may struggle to win cooperation from other governments and may ultimately be seen as an untrustworthy player in international affairs. This can lead to isolation and diminished influence on the global stage. Additionally, a dishonest and unreliable leader can create an environment of mistrust and disloyalty, which can have detrimental effects on the stability and long-term success of a nation's political system and its citizenry. Therefore, the importance of political leaders, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, embracing the lesson of cultivating a reputation as reliable and honest individuals cannot be overstated. Doing so will not only contribute to successful governance domestically but also pave the way for more fruitful relationships and cooperation on the international stage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Grammer received award recognitions for portraying this character in these two shows, in addition to a 1992 one-time appearance in Wings. The character debuts in the Cheers third-season premiere, \\"Rebound (Part 1)\\" (1984), as Diane Chambers's love interest, part of the Sam and Diane story arc. Intended to appear for only a few episodes, Grammer's performance for the role was praised by producers, prompting them to expand his role and to increase his prominence. Context: During the course of the spin-off's run, especially in scenes at Frasier's apartment, Frasier and Martin regularly argue over the living arrangements and each other's personalities: Frasier is sophisticated, intellectual, and erudite, while Martin is a rugged man of simple tastes who speaks (according to Frasier) in words that no \\"sophisticated, educated\\" person could understand. While Frasier has many common interests with Niles and shares adventures (or misadventures) with him, he has little in common with his father, Martin.  In \\"Dinner at Eight\\" (1993), Martin takes Frasier and Niles to a themed steakhouse, where health-conscious, snobby Frasier and Niles criticize the food, the restaurant's customs, and the clientele. Martin becomes frustrated and angry before leaving, remarking upon departing that their mother, Hester, would be disappointed with their behavior. Frasier and Niles try to prove that they are not \\"snobs\\" by finishing their meal, although it takes them until after closing time. Ironically, in the Cheers season seven episode, \\"I Kid You Not\\" (1988), Frasier invites Carla and her son Ludlow to the upper class, expensive restaurant, but Carla and Ludlow criticize and mock it, enraging Frasier.  In \\"Chess Pains\\", Frasier teaches Martin how to play chess, but is horrified when Martin becomes a better player than him, due to Martin's seasoned insight as a police detective. Frasier becomes obsessed with winning against his father until Frasier wins one match and Martin does not want to play with Frasier anymore. One late night, Frasier wakes Martin up and asks him whether he lost the chess match on purpose. Martin responds that Frasier \\"won, fair and square\\" and nothing more.  In an episode of the seventh season \\"A Tsar Is Born\\" (1999), Martin takes an old family clock, which Frasier and Niles consider hideous, to exhibit on the television show Antiques Roadshow. As the boys soon discover, the clock is related to their ancestors and royalty, and may be worth a fortune, and heightens their expectations of being descended from royalty. Unfortunately, when they try to sell the clock later, the brothers learn from an antique specialist that it was stolen from the daughter of Tsar Alexander II. Moreover, their great-great-grandmother was discovered to have been the clock thief and the daughter's scullery maid, and is discovered to have later been a prostitute in New York City. Therefore, the brothers are left without a fortune, a clock, and their royal dreams are crushed, as Frasier puts it, they are descended from \\"thieves and whores\\". Much to their anger, Martin buys a Winnebago RV with money Frasier claimed were the proceeds from selling the clock.  Actress Bebe Neuwirth left Cheers for fear of becoming typecast and to do theatre (mostly Broadway); she did not expect to appear recurrently in Frasier. Cheers and Frasier writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs found chemistry of Frasier and Lilith \\"special\\" enough to compare them with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy on Prozac. In \\"The Show Where Lilith Comes Back\\" (1994), Lilith surprises Frasier by dialing to the radio show. They later make love in a hotel room, but end up regretting it, prompting them to part ways again. They decide to remain friends and help each other raise their son Frederick (Trevor Einhorn), who also appears occasionally in this spin-off. In \\"Adventures in Paradise, Part Two\\" (1994), Lilith gets engaged to her fiance Brian (James Morrison), much to Frasier's dismay. In \\"A Lilith Thanksgiving\\" (1996), Frasier and Lilith have Frederick admitted into a private school after they annoy the administrator (Paxton Whitehead) several times on Thanksgiving. In \\"The Unnatural\\" (1997), Frasier is proven as unathletic and bad at softball, which he reluctantly admits to Frederick. Then Frasier tells him that, when Frasier was a third-grade elementary student, Martin was bad at math.  Much of the intellectual jousting with Lilith that sits alongside the narrative of post-divorce navigation hinges on the fact that in psychological terms Lilith is a behaviorist whereas Frasier is a psychoanalyst.  In \\"Room Service\\" (1998), Lilith is recently divorced from her husband Brian for his gay affair. Frasier attempts to renew the relationship, but changes his mind when he finds out, to his horror, that Lilith and Niles had a drunken one-night stand. Lilith last appears in \\"Guns 'N Neuroses\\" (2003), in which she Frasier are accidentally set up to go on a blind date. Lilith and Frasier are close to restarting a relationship in the hotel room, but they are interrupted by a loud argument between a young married couple next door. Frasier and Lilith are able to resolve the couple's dispute, spend the night together watching television, and finally fall asleep on the couch without intimacy. The next morning, they part ways at their final onscreen moment together. Question: What else happens in the reunion episode? Answer:","output":"In the reunion episode, Frasier and his ex-wife Lilith come back together for a special event or situation. They might have some funny and awkward moments as they spend time together, but they also remember the good times they had in the past. They realize that even though their relationship didn't work out, they can still be friends and support each other in raising their son, Frederick. At the end of the episode, they say goodbye and go their separate ways, but with a better understanding of each other and their shared history."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: With its 190 million inhabitants, Brazil has the largest population in Latin America and ranks fifth in the world.  However, Brazil's population growth rate has dropped greatly and Brazilian women now have only 2.7 children on average. This achievement really becomes the envy of many other Third World countries. Brazil has become one of the developing world's great successes at reducing population growth-----but more by accident than design. While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had a better result without really trying, says George Martine at Harvard. Martine  _ , among other things, soap operas(TV series) and installment  plans introduced in the 1970s. Both played an important, although indirect role in lowering the birth rate. Brazil is one of the world's biggest producers of soap operas. Globo, Brazil's most popular television network, shows three hours of soaps six nights a week, while three others show at least one hour a night. Most TV series are based on wealthy characters living the high life in big cities. \\"Although they have never really tried to work in a message towards the problems of reproduction , they describe middle and upper class values-----not many children, different attitudes towards sex, women working,\\" says Martine. \\"They sent this image to all parts of Brazil and made people conscious of other patterns of behavior and other values, which were put into a very attractive package.\\" Meanwhile, the installment plans tried to encourage the poor to become consumers. \\"This led to an enormous change in consumption patterns and showed that consumption was in contradiction with unlimited reproduction,\\" says Martine.

On the day that France surrenders to Nazi Germany in 1940, Prudence \\"Pru\\" Cathaway a strong-willed young woman from the upper class, joins the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, a military organisation linked to the Royal Air Force, to her family's surprise. Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up.

I eat it but I don’t contemplate it. I do know who Rachael Ray is because I’ve seen her on TV and on the covers of some of her 18 books. What always struck me about her was her overwhelmingly buoyant personality, always on display as she whips things up in her kitchen on the tube. The Rachael Ray who called me last week, though, was a very unhappy, annoyed Rachael Ray. The object of her upset: The New York Times. The cover of the March 14 Dining section carried a boldly-illustrated feature headlined, “I Was a Cookbook Ghostwriter.” The sub-headline said, “Finding the words chefs wish they had.” The reporter, Julia Moskin, started the piece off with a recollection of her days ghosting nine cookbooks. The story then went on to wonder how prodigious cookbook authors like Rachael Ray manage “cookbook production schedules that boggle the mind.” “How, you might ask, do they do it?” the piece asked, then followed with: “The answer: they don’t.” Enter Rachael Ray: “I wrote all my books. I have them in handwritten and digital form,” she told me, and added: “You tell me what part of that makes me not the writer.” Also appearing in the article was Gwyneth Paltrow, a picture of whom carried a caption that said her ghostwriter is Julia Turshen. Like Ms. Ray, Ms. Paltrow took to Twitter to complain: Love @nytimes dining section but this weeks facts need checking. No ghost writer on my cookbook, I wrote every word myself. — Gwyneth Paltrow (@GwynethPaltrow) March 17, 2012 Ms. Paltrow’s publicist, Stephen Huvane, told me that Ms. Paltrow strongly disputes The Times’s account. “Gwyneth is very very upset with the times and rightfully so,” he wrote in an email. “She did NOT use a ghost writer. Julia Turshen was her assistant during the writing of that book and is appropriately acknowledged. Every word of that book was written by Gwyneth. Every recipe of that book was written and developed by Gwyneth.” But The Times has refused to correct the article. I queried Susan Edgerley, editor of the section, and she told me the article “did not say someone else wrote Rachael Ray’s or Gwyneth Paltrow’s books. We said they, like many others, had help.” Ms. Edgerley referred me to a passage in the article that, she indicated, let readers know how the article was defining ghostwriting: Food ghostwriters come in many different flavors, including the researchers who might spend days testing every possible method of cooking beans for Bobby Flay, the aproned assistants at the Food Network who frantically document everything that the “talent” does on camera in order to produce recipes for the Web site, and the (slightly) more literary work of writers who attempt to document a chef’s ideas, memories and vision in glossy cookbooks. And Richard L. Berke, the assistant managing editor who oversees features sections, added, “The article clearly touched a nerve with Ms. Ray and others, but we believe it was utterly fair and accurate.” So who is right here? To me, it comes down to how you define ghostwriting. The everyday definition, and the one I would use, is that a ghostwriter is one who writes a book in the place of the author of record. But The Times, as is evident in the passage above, was using a stretched version of the term (add water and stir). Further complicating things, the article rolled right through the section about Ms. Ray before offering up the caveat of a broader definition for ghosting cookbooks. For a reader (and for Ms. Ray), it certainly seemed to be saying, flat-out, she doesn’t write her own books. Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Rachael Ray and Gwyneth Paltrow Defend Their Cookbook Authorship Amid Ghostwriting Controversy\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\\"The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford.

Courtyards are often associated with palaces and houses formulating a part of the property. The term 'back' suggests a proximity to the king's residential place. Among the options, 'palace' would make the most sense as it is typically where a king resides. However, 'back courtyard' suggests an outdoor space which logically could include a garden, making 'garden' the more fitting answer. 'Country estate' could be a possibility, but it's much more ambiguous, since estates can be far-flung and not necessarily close to the king. 'Large house' might be a potential answer but would not be as typical a residence for a king as a palace. 'Suburbs' is quite unlikely as they denote a residential area, often some distance from the central part of the city, and it is unlikely that a king's palace is situated in such an area.

It involves a handsome man standing outside a young woman's window, singing a love song to her to win her over. However, trying to woo a female with songs is not just something that humans do. A few animals sing love songs as well. Birds and elephants are romantic but the latest animal to  _ a female might surprise you--it is the humble mouse.     You may find it odd to find out that mice sing. We do not hear them because the frequency of their voice is so high. In fact, scientists have known for some time that male mice make special sounds to females, but it has always been assumed that the sounds are produced instinctively   and randomly, with little thought going into the process. But new research suggests otherwise. When male mice with different voices were put in a cage together, scientists found that they would gradually change their pitches   to sound like one another. But when a female mouse was put in the cage with two males, one male would change his pitch to match the other. \\"It was usually the smaller animal changing the pitch to match the larger animal,\\" professor Erich Jarvis, leader of the study, from Duke University, US, told BBC News. This ability, known as vocal learning, is rare in the natural world. It had been thought to be limited to some birds, such as parrots--as well as whales and dolphins. The latest findings challenge the long-held opinion that mice cannot learn to adapt their voices.     Scientists also found the part of the brain that controls the mice's singing ability. In the experiment, they damaged the cells in this part of the mice's brain and found that the animals couldn't keep their songs in pitch or repeat them any more. This also happened when the mice became deaf. Jarvis said that this finding had changed his understanding of the way mice make sound. \\"In mice we find that the pathways that are at least modulating   these vocalizations   are in the forebrain, in places where you actually find them in humans,\\"...

Q: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. South Korean officials said there is possibility that Moon may join Trump in Singapore to help negotiate a nuclear deal with Kim, as the... According to the above context, answer the following question. Why did Trump revive the Singapore summit? Choose from: a). Because Trump desired to use a \\"maximum pressure\\" approach. b).

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Gavin Christopher Newsom was born in San Francisco, California, to Tessa Thomas (nee Menzies) and William Alfred Newsom III, a retired state appeals court justice and attorney for Getty Oil. He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan. His father is of mostly Irish descent; one of Newsom's maternal great-grandfathers, Scotsman Thomas Addis, was a pioneer scientist in the field of nephrology and a professor of medicine at Stanford University. Newsom is the second cousin, twice removed, of musician Joanna Newsom. As mayor, Newsom focused on development projects in Hunters Point and Treasure Island. He signed the Health Choices Plan in 2007 to provide San Francisco residents with universal healthcare. In 2004, Newsom gained national attention when he directed the San Francisco city-county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, in violation of the state law passed in 2000.  Implementation of Care Not Cash began on July 1, 2004. As part of his Care Not Cash initiative, 5,000 more homeless people were given permanent shelter in the city. As of October 21, 2007, about 2,000 people have been placed into permanent housing with support. Other programs initiated by Newsom to end chronic homelessness include the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team (SF HOT), and Project Homeless Connect (PHC). On October 27, 2004, during a strike by hotel workers on a dozen San Francisco hotels, Newsom joined UNITE HERE union members on a picket line in front of the Westin St. Francis Hotel. He vowed that the city would boycott the hotels by not sponsoring city events in any until the hotels agreed to a contract with workers. The contract dispute was settled in September 2006.  In 2005, Newsom pushed for a state law to allow communities in California to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs. He requested that then state senator Jackie Speier introduce a change to then-existing California law, which stated that counties could not target specific breeds of dog. The animal control agency under his direction created a working dog task force report that cited Denver, Colorado, as a best practice for a law in California.  In 2009, Newsom came under attack for the City of San Francisco's policy of illegally harboring juvenile criminal aliens. A sanctuary city, San Francisco had long been circumventing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement by harboring or sending the aliens back to their own native countries.  In 2009, Newsom received the Leadership for Healthy Communities Award along with Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City and three other public officials for his commitment to making healthful food and physical activity options more accessible to children and families. In 2008, he had hosted the Urban Rural Roundtable to explore ways to promote regional food development and increased access to healthy affordable food, and he secured 8 million in federal and local funds for the Better Streets program, which ensures that public health perspectives are fully integrated into urban planning processes. He signed a menu-labeling bill into law, requiring that chain restaurants print nutrition information on their menus. In 2010, Newsom was named \\"America's Most Social Mayor\\" by Samepoint, based on analysis of the social media profiles of mayors from the 100 largest cities in the United States. That same year, Newsom was removed from the San Francisco County Democratic Central Committee, because, according to SFCDCC chairman Aaron Peskin, Newsom no longer resided in the city. What city is Gavin Newsom mayor of?","output":"Gavin Newsom was the mayor of San Francisco, California.

This is the one day of the year when people around the world care about their sleep and ask themselves a lot of questions about sleep. Why do we need sleep? Nobody as yet can give a correct answer to this question. However, tests have shown that lack of sleep over about four weeks leads to a strong drop in body temperature, great weight loss and finally sickness. Different people need different amounts of sleep. Eight hours a night is considered the average amount of sleep. For teenagers the least number of sleeping hours advised by doctors are ten hours for primary school students, nine for junior highs and eight for senior highs. Some people seem to get along just fine with very little sleep at night. Leading American scientist Thomas Edison said that sleep was a waste of time. He did, however, take naps during the day. On the other hand, Albert Einstein, another great scientist, said he needed at least ten hours' sleep a night. Here are some of the most useful suggestions, for a good night's sleep. Go to bed regularly. Use your bed only to sleep. Don't exercise in the evening. Keep the bedroom dark and quiet. Drink a glass of milk before sleep.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Teenaged brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World, a dinosaur theme park at the original Jurassic Park site on Isla Nublar. Their aunt, Claire Dearing, is the operations manager. Claire assigns her assistant, Zara, as the boys' guide but they soon evade her. Elsewhere on the island, U.S. Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady has been training and researching four Velociraptors. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, Vic Hoskins, the head of InGen Security, believes the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant Barry strongly oppose. Prior to its opening, Claire and park owner Simon Masrani inspect the park's newest attraction, Indominus rex, a genetically-engineered dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure. Owen warns Claire the Indominus lacks social skills, making it more dangerous and unpredictable. When it appears the Indominus has escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. The Indominus, which can camouflage itself and mask its heat signature, suddenly appears. Owen survives the attack, but it kills the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Owen tells Masrani to have the Indominus killed; to protect his company's investment, Masrani instead dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with non-lethal weaponry.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

Article:","output":"Title: How to Catch a Mole: A Simple Guide for Little Explorers Have you ever seen tiny hills of dirt in your yard or garden? Those little bumps are called molehills, and they happen because moles dig tunnels under the ground. Moles are small animals that live underground, and they can make a big mess in our gardens. So sometimes we need to catch them in a safe and friendly way. In this article, I will tell you three simple steps to catch a mole. 1. Find an active tunnel First, we need to find out where the mole is living. To do this, you should look for the fresh molehills in your yard or garden. When you find a molehill, carefully flatten it down with your hands or feet. After doing this, check back after a day or two. If the molehill pops up again, that means the mole is still using that tunnel! Now we know we've found an active tunnel. 2. Use a mole-specific trap The next step is to catch the mole using a special trap. Make sure to ask a grown-up to help you with this part because it can be a bit tricky. The grown-up should go to a store to find you a trap that is made just for catching moles. This trap will be really good at catching moles without hurting them. After getting the trap, ask the grown-up to place it in the active tunnel you found earlier. Now, wait for the mole to get caught in the trap! 3. Call a professional pest control service After the mole is caught, it's essential to be gentle and kind to the captured mole because they are just little animals that didn't mean to cause any trouble. Instead of trying to deal with the mole by yourself, ask a grown-up to call a professional pest control service. These professionals know how to handle captured moles properly and where to release them safely back into nature. And that's how you catch a mole, my little explorers! Remember to be patient, gentle, and kind to these small animals, even if they're causing a mess in our gardens. After all, they're just trying to live their lives underground.

Translate to English English:","output":"Millions of the community's money has been paid illegally or, as in the case of cigarette smuggling, lost from revenues. In this sentence, the speaker brings attention to the fact that a significant amount of money, amounting to millions, either has been paid illegally or has been lost due to certain illicit activities. One such activity mentioned is cigarette smuggling. Cigarette smuggling, also commonly known as tobacco smuggling or bootlegging, refers to the illegal transportation and trade of tobacco products, primarily cigarettes, which are aimed at avoiding taxation and other regulatory control measures. This illegal trade results in lost revenue for the affected community, as the smugglers do not pay taxes on the products they sell. Cigarette smuggling is a widespread, global issue, as it affects both developing and developed countries across the world. The main reason behind this illicit trade is that it often offers high profits for the smugglers. This is mainly due to the fact that through smuggling, they can avoid the heavy taxes imposed on tobacco products, as well as the restrictions on their supply, distribution, and sale. Consequently, smuggled cigarettes can be sold at a much lower price compared to the legal market, which makes them more attractive to consumers, especially those with lower incomes. Several factors contribute to the thriving business of cigarette smuggling. One of the major drivers is the discrepancy in taxes imposed on tobacco products across different countries and regions. For example, a pack of cigarettes can be significantly cheaper in one country due to lower taxes than in another country with high taxes. This creates an incentive for smugglers to acquire cigarettes in the low-tax country and transport them to the high-tax country, where they can be sold at a reduced cost while still allowing the smugglers to make a significant profit. Another factor is the high demand for such low-priced cigarettes among consumers. The attractiveness of these cheaper options has led to a significant portion of the global cigarette market being dominated by illicit products. This further exacerbates the issue, as it results in an increase in both the supply and demand for smuggled cigarettes. The consequences of cigarette smuggling are manifold. For one, it impacts the economies of the affected countries, as it results in a loss of crucial tax revenue that could have been used for funding public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Moreover, the illegal nature of this activity often leads to the involvement of organized crime groups, thereby fostering corruption, violence, and other criminal activities. Efforts to combat cigarette smuggling range from international cooperation between law enforcement authorities to the implementation of stricter regulations regarding the production, sale, and distribution of tobacco products. One important measure involves the introduction of effective tracking and tracing systems that can help authorities better monitor the movement of cigarette products, making it easier for them to identify and prosecute those involved in smuggling activities. In summary, cigarette smuggling is a complex issue that causes significant financial losses for communities through lost tax revenues. This illegal activity is driven by various factors, such as discrepancies in taxes and high consumer demand for low-priced cigarettes, and it results in negative consequences for the affected countries’ economies and public safety. To address this problem, various efforts and measures are being implemented by governments across the world, including collaboration between law enforcement agencies, the introduction of stricter regulations, and the implementation of effective tracking systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River.  - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison.  - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States.

Background: You Bet Your Life is an American comedy quiz series that aired on both radio and television. The original and best-known version was hosted by Groucho Marx of the Marx Brothers, with announcer and assistant George Fenneman. The show debuted on ABC Radio on October 27, 1947, then moved to CBS Radio debuting October 5, 1949, before making the transition to NBC-TV and NBC Radio on October 4, 1950. Because of its simple format, it was possible to broadcast the show simultaneously on radio and television. Context: The mid-1940s was a lull in Groucho Marx's career. His radio show Blue Ribbon Town, sponsored by Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, had begun in March 1943 and had failed to catch on. Groucho left the program in June 1944, replaced by vocalist Kenny Baker until the show's end two months later. He also reluctantly appeared in two movies with brothers Chico and Harpo Marx, A Night in Casablanca and the lackluster Love Happy.  During a radio appearance with Bob Hope in March 1947, Marx ad-libbed most of his performance after being forced to stand by in a waiting room for 40 minutes before going live on the air. John Guedel, the Hope program's producer, formed an idea for a quiz show and approached Marx about the subject.  After initial reluctance by Marx, Guedel was able to convince him to host the program once Marx realized the quiz would be only a backdrop for his contestant interviews and the storm of ad-libbing that they would elicit. Guedel also convinced Marx to invest in 50% of the show, in part by saying that he was \\"untouchable\\" at ad-libbing, but not at following a script.  As Marx and the contestants were ad-libbing, he insisted that each show be filmed and edited before release to remove the risque or less interesting material. The show for the studio audience ran longer than the broadcast version. The president of Film Craft Productions, which did the filming, cited it as the first television show filmed before a live audience as part of a lengthy essay about production procedures. Question: How was You Bet Your Life started? Answer:","output":"You Bet Your Life started when John Guedel, the producer of Bob Hope's radio program, came up with the idea for a quiz show after witnessing Groucho Marx's ad-libbing skills during a radio appearance with Bob Hope in March 1947.

Guedel convinced Marx to invest in 50% of the show and ensured that each episode was filmed and edited before release to remove any risqué or less interesting content. The show debuted on ABC Radio on October 27, 1947, before transitioning to other networks and eventually television."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"What did it form?\\"  Context: \\"The archipelago is formed by high points on the rim of the caldera of a submarine volcano that forms a seamount. The volcano is one part of a range that was formed as part of the same process that formed the floor of the Atlantic, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The top of the seamount has gone through periods of complete submergence, during which its limestone cap was formed by marine organisms, and during the Ice Ages the entire caldera was above sea level, forming an island of approximately two hundred square miles.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The archipelago was formed as a result of various geological processes associated with the formation of the floor of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The caldera of the submarine volcano, which forms a seamount, had multiple high points along its rim. These high points eventually developed into the islands that make up the archipelago. During its geological history, the top of the seamount experienced various episodes of submergence and emergence. In periods of complete submergence, the limestone cap on the seamount was formed by the accumulation of marine organisms like corals and shellfish. These organisms secreted calcium carbonate to build their hard shells or external structures, which, upon their death, accumulated and eventually formed the limestone layers we see today. Limestone is a sedimentary rock that takes thousands of years to form, illustrating the lengthy span of time during which the seamount was submerged. During the Ice Ages, significant changes in global climate and sea levels caused the entire caldera to be exposed above the sea level, forming a considerably large island of approximately two hundred square miles. The exposure to weathering and erosion processes during these times further shaped the features of the archipelago, contributing to the development of distinct ecosystems and unique landscapes. Over time, as tectonic plates shifted and the ocean floor changed, the archipelago was formed. The ongoing interaction of tectonics, volcanic eruptions, and radial fissure systems contributed to the formation of the islands we see today. The complex geological history of the region has also played a significant role in the development of diverse landforms, habitats, and ecosystems across the archipelago. In summary, the archipelago was formed by high points on the rim of a submarine volcano's caldera as part of the geologic processes associated with the formation of the Atlantic Ocean floor and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The limestone cap on the seamount was formed during periods of submergence through the accumulation of marine organisms, while the Ice Ages allowed the formation of a large island due to the exposure of the entire caldera above sea level. The interplay of submergence and emergence, as well as influences of tectonic and volcanic activity, resulted in the formation of the archipelago and its distinct features."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: An undated photo of the Russian battleship Dmitrii Donskoi. / Courtesy of the Asia-Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics.            By Park Si-soo            A South Korean treasure hunter, who recently found a sunken Russian \\"treasure ship\\" off Ulleung Island, will host an international press conference next week to unveil what it claims to be \\"part of things that will surprise the world.\\"                  Shinil Group, a South Korean treasure-hunting company, said the event is planned for July 25 or 26. The location is not yet fixed. The company said details will be announced on its website ( http://donskoi.kr/main/main.php ).                  The Dmitrii Donskoi was said to be loaded with gold. / Courtesy of Shinil Group ||||| Divers off the South Korean island of Ulleungdo have discovered the fabled wreck of the Dmitrii Donskoi, a Russian warship that was sunk in 1905 and is rumoured to still contain 5,500 boxes of gold bars and coins said to be worth US133 billion.      The badly damaged Russian Imperial Navy cruiser was located by manned submersibles at a depth of 434 metres about 1.3km off Ulleungdo on Sunday morning.      The Seoul-based maritime salvage company Shinil Group has been searching for the precise site of the wreck for several years and put together a team of experts from South Korea, China, Britain and Canada for this year’s effort.      Video footage released by the company shows images of extensive damage to the 5,800-tonne warship, which was scuttled after an encounter with Japanese warships in May 1905.      The footage also shows cannons and deck guns encrusted with marine growth, as well as the anchor and ship’s wheel.      The divers were finally able to positively identify the ship when floodlights on one of the submersibles picked out the name in Cyrillic characters on its stern.      “The body of the ship was severely damaged by shelling, with its stern almost broken, and yet the ship’s deck and sides are well preserved”, the company said in a statement on its website.      Built in St Petersburg and launched in August 1883, the Dmitrii Donskoi was designed to serve as a commerce raider and was fitted with both a full set of sails and a coal-fired engine.      The ship spent most of its operational career in the Mediterranean Sea and the Far East and was ordered to sail from the Baltic to join Imperial Russia’s Second Pacific Squadron after the Japanese fleet destroyed the majority of Russia’s naval power in the Far East in the opening encounters of the 1904-05 Russo-Japanese War.      The squadron was met by the Japanese fleet in May 1905 and decimated at the Battle of Tsushima. Assigned to protect the transport ships sailing at the rear of the formation, the Dmitrii Donskoi managed to evade the attacking force, but was later intercepted as Captain Ivan Lebedev steamed for the Russian port of Vladivostok.      Around 60 of the 591 crew were killed and further 120 injured before Captain Lebedev anchored off the island of Ulleungdo and ordered his men ashore.      The following morning, May 29, 1905, the ship was scuttled offshore and the crew were taken prisoner by Japanese landing parties. Captain Lebedev subsequently died of his wounds.      There are reports that the Dmitrii Donskoi was carrying the funds that the Russian fleet required to pay for fuel, port fees and the crews of its ships and that it was scuttled with 5,500 boxes containing gold coins and bars still in its holds so that the Japanese would not seize the prize.      Some South Korean media have speculated the value of the gold to be worth about US133 billion (HK1.044 trillion).      The Shinil Group says it aims to raise the ship in October or November. It added that it has reached an agreement with the Russian government to hand over half of the gold that is found aboard the vessel.      Around 10 per cent of the remaining bullion would be spent on tourism projects on Ulleungdo Island, including a museum dedicated to the ship and its crew.      A percentage of the rest of the gold will be donated to joint projects designed to promote development in northeast Asia, the company added, such as a railway line linking Russia and South Korea through North Korea. ||||| A South Korean salvage team has discovered the wreck of a Russian warship that was sunk in a naval battle 113 years ago and is believed to still contain a trove of gold bullion and coins worth 150 trillion won, or £100 billion.

Passage:Tropical Storm Fay was a strong and unusual tropical storm that moved erratically across the state of Florida and the Caribbean Sea. The sixth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay formed from a vigorous tropical wave on August 15 over the Dominican Republic. It passed over the island of Hispaniola, into the Gulf of Gonâve, across the island of Cuba, and made landfall on the Florida Keys late in the afternoon of August 18 before veering into the Gulf of Mexico. It again made landfall near Naples, Florida, in the early hours of August 19 and progressed northeast through the Florida peninsula, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Melbourne on August 20. Extensive flooding took place in parts of Florida as a result of its slow movement. On August 21, it made landfall again near New Smyrna Beach, Florida, moving due west across the Panhandle, crossing Gainesville and Panama City, Florida. As it zigzagged from water to land, it became the first storm in recorded history to make landfall in Florida four times. Thirty-six deaths were blamed on Fay. The storm also resulted in one of the most prolific tropical cyclone related tornado outbreaks on record. A total of 81 tornadoes touched down across five states, three of which were rated as EF2.

If \\"Three women are sitting in front of computers while people stand in front of them with small papers.\\", does this mean that \\"three girls are using some computers\\"?","output":"Yes, the phrase \\"Three women are sitting in front of computers while people stand in front of them with small papers\\" does indeed imply that 'three girls are using some computers'. However, there are some subtle differences in terms of the context and details between the two phrases to consider. Firstly, the original phrase uses the term 'women' which normally refers to more mature or adult females, whereas the latter term 'girls' is often used to describe younger females or children. Unless we know the ages of the subjects involved, we cannot definitively say that 'girls' and 'women' are interchangeable in this context. Secondly, the full context of the original phrase tells us not only that these women are sitting in front of computers, but it also suggests that some sort of interaction or transaction might be occurring, since there are people standing in front of them with small papers. This setting could be associated with an office environment or some kind of public service area where the women are providing a service or support.  The phrase 'Three girls are using some computers,' on the other hand, is more vague. It doesn't give a definite impression of the context or circumstances, which could range from a social setting to a study environment. It simply indicates that there are three girls who are using computers, without further details provided in the original phrase. In conclusion, while both phrases highlight the fact that there are females using computers, the first statement provides a richer and more specific scene compared to the latter. Therefore, while you could argue that 'three girls are using some computers' is a somewhat oversimplified interpretation of the original phrase, it lacks the detail and precision of the initial description."},{"instruction":"Process: - Grass and small plants grow in an area - These plants die - The soil gains organic material - The soil becomes more fertile - Larger plants are able to be supported - Trees eventually grow.

You are given a new situation: Michael lives near a cliff overlooking the sea. Because of this he has an amazing view of the sunset. One day Michael decides to head out to the cliff and notices the sky looks much more red than normal. He also remembers that on the previous day he couldn't see his shadow at all.  and a hint : When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.  Please answer this question : Given Michael goes out one day and notices he can't see his shadow, which is the most likely weather, clear skies or overcast? A:","output":"Given that Michael goes out one day and notices he can't see his shadow, the most likely weather is overcast.

The use of the word \\"probably\\" in the premise indicates that there is a higher probability of the individuals not having access to or using birth control. However, it is essential to consider the context in which this statement is made to better understand the probability of the hypothesis being true or not. It is important to note that the premise does not provide a definitive or absolute statement about the availability or usage of birth control.

Let's find the value of q in this equation: 0 = 393*q + 1871 - 17984. First, we need to simplify the equation by combining the numbers that don't have q. So, we'll subtract 1871 from 17984.

To do that, we'll subtract it from both sides: 0 - 16113 = 393*q -16113 = 393*q Now, we want to find q on its own. So, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 393: -16113 ÷ 393 = q When you divide -16113 by 393, you get: q = -41 And that's it! The value of q is -41.

The close race eventually came down to the deciding state of Ohio. There are several key takeaways from the 2012 election. 1. The GOP has a Latino problem: Republican strategist Ana Navarro emphasized that if the Republican Party doesn't improve its standing with Hispanic voters, it could struggle to recapture the White House. In the 2012 election, GOP campaign and allied super PACs supporting the nominee flooded Pennsylvania’s airwaves in the final weeks with a flurry of TV ads. However, the Republican Party did not perform well with the Latino demographic. This is an issue the party needs to address in order to achieve broader electoral success in the future. 2. The power of social media: The 2012 election saw the widespread use of social media tools like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit to discuss and disseminate information about the candidates. This spawned many hashtag campaigns and underscored the growing importance of digital platforms in engaging with the public and shaping their perceptions of the candidates. 3. The impact of super PACs: The 2012 election also highlighted the vast sums of money being contributed by super PACs (Political Action Committees) to support their preferred candidates. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, spending by outside groups reached over 1 billion in the 2012 election cycle. This trend has continued to grow in subsequent elections and has raised concerns about the influence of money in politics. 4. The fight for the swing states: Ohio played a critical role in the 2012 election but so did other swing states such as Pennsylvania, Florida, and Virginia. These states have increasingly become the focus of presidential campaigns in recent years, as they often decide the outcome of the election. The intense campaigning efforts and resources allocated to these states by both parties underscore their importance in the electoral map. 5. The persistence of political polarization: The 2012 election displayed the ongoing divide between the Democratic and Republican parties, with each side holding starkly different visions for the future of the country. This divide has only deepened in recent years, with both parties becoming increasingly antagonistic towards each other. This has made it difficult for lawmakers to collaborate on bipartisan legislation and has led to a more polarized political environment. In conclusion, the 2012 presidential election offered several key lessons on the role of demographics, money, social media, and political polarization in shaping electoral outcomes. These factors remain influential today and continue to evolve as the US political landscape undergoes further changes. The race for the White House is always a fiercely contested battle, with each election offering new insights into the workings of the American political system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea human rights advocates are considering more practical ways to reform the repressive practices of the Kim Jong Un government, as denuclearization talks continue to end the country’s economic and diplomatic isolation. Rights activists hold out hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will confront Kim at their expected Singapore meeting in June about ongoing atrocities in North Korea, including a network of political prison camps and widespread government sanctioned abuses in the country. Benedict Rogers, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a religious freedom oriented organization, urges President Trump to emulate former President Ronald Reagan who once publicly called on the leader of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall that separated democratic West Germany and the Communist East. “Mr. Trump’s message should be, Mr. Kim if you seek peace, come to the gates of the prison camps, open the prison camps, tear down the walls of the prison camps,” said Rogers at a North Korea human rights conference in Seoul on Thursday. It is unclear if human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit, if it happens. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol have been meeting this week in New York to overcome the main obstacle to the summit; the gap between the U.S. demand for rapid and complete denuclearization and North Korea’s more phased in approach that would provide early sanctions relief. Brad Adams, the Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday, “Whatever the outcome of nuclear talks, human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea changes the way it treats its people.” The United Nations has passed 13 resolutions addressing human rights abuses in North Korea, most recently in March of this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what happens when animals and plants evolve to environmental conditions?\\" is \\"rapid expansion\\", given that  specialization occurs when animals and plants evolve to environmental conditions? Options:  (a). Yes.  (b). No. The answer is:","output":"(b). No. When animals and plants evolve to environmental conditions, the process is generally called adaptation. Through adaptation, organisms become better suited to their environment, which in turn enhances their survival and reproduction. While specialization can indeed occur during adaptation, it is not synonymous with rapid expansion. Specialization refers to the process by which animals and plants develop specific traits or behaviors to deal with particular environmental challenges. This may lead to a more narrow range of suitable habitats or resources, ultimately making them more efficient at exploiting those specific conditions. However, such specialization may also make them vulnerable to changes in their environment and limit their ability to expand rapidly. Rapid expansion typically occurs when organisms can reproduce quickly, possess generalist traits (i.e., not specialized), or can adapt to a wide variety of environmental conditions, allowing them to thrive and expand their range. Thus, while specialization is related to adaptation, it doesn't necessarily equate to rapid expansion in the context of your question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which leader served for the second longest number of years?","output":"Title: Which Leader Served for the Second Longest Number of Years? Introduction In the vast timeline of human history, several notable leaders have ruled their nations with lengthy tenures, often driving significant change and growth. This article aims to answer the question: which leader served for the second longest number of years? To accomplish this, we will examine the tenures of leaders throughout history, while also discussing their achievements and influences.  Step 1: Identify the longest-serving leader in history Before identifying the second longest-serving leader, we need to establish which leader holds the title for the longest-serving ruler. According to historical records, the longest-serving leader in history is Fidel Castro, who was the Prime Minister of Cuba from 1959 to 1976 and the President of Cuba and First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1976 to 2008, totaling 49 years in power. Step 2: Identify contenders for the second longest-serving leader Now, let's determine which historical rulers may contend for the title of the second longest-serving leader. Some potential contenders include: 1. Kim Il-sung: President of North Korea from 1948 to 1994 (46 years) 2. Emperor Hirohito (Emperor Showa): Emperor of Japan from 1926 to 1989 (62 years) 3. King Bhumibol Adulyadej: King of Thailand from 1946 to 2016 (70 years) 4. Elizabeth II: Queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 1952 to present (69 years) Step 3: Assess and compare the tenures of contenders For an accurate assessment, the time ruling must be considered continuous and uninterrupted. 1. Kim Il-sung, who served as the President of North Korea for 46 years, is considered the third longest-serving leader. 2. Emperor Hirohito, although having served for 62 years, cannot be considered the second longest-serving leader due to Japan's constitutional monarchy system, which limits the power of the emperor, making him more of a figurehead than a ruler. 3. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who ruled for 70 years, similarly cannot be considered due to the Thai monarchy's limited political power and being a constitutional monarchy. 4. Elizabeth II, with 69 years in her position, is also in a constitutional monarchy that limits her powers, making her an unfit contender for the second longest-serving leader. Conclusion After thorough assessment and comparisons, we can conclude that Kim Il-sung, the President of North Korea from 1948 to 1994, served as the second longest-serving leader in history. Kim Il-sung held power for 46 years, following Fidel Castro's record 49-year tenure as the longest-serving leader. It is important to note the difference, however, between the longest-serving leaders and longest-reigning monarchs who might hold limited political power in their respective nations."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

ACTION2 - refusing to pay my ex-child support: This action implies that someone is not fulfilling their legal and moral responsibility to financially support their child(ren) after a separation or divorce. This action is generally considered unethical, as it potentially harms the well-being of the child(ren) by not providing them with the necessary financial resources.

(Photo: Inez van Lamsweerde & Vinoodh Matadin for V Magazine) Kristen Davis knows a few things about what Scarlett Johansson has been going through this week. Five years ago, Davis was a Global Ambassador for the international aid group Oxfam. She was also working as a spokesperson for Ahava, a cosmetics company located in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, which Oxfam deems to be illegally occupied by Israel. Oxfam said she had to choose between Ahava and them. After much pushing and pulling, Davis decided to stick with Oxfam and sever her ties with Ahava, and her contract with them was allowed to expire. Fast forward to this week, when Oxfam announced Johansson's support of the Israeli company SodaStream, operating in a West Bank settlement, was incompatible with her role as an Oxfam Global Ambassador. This time around, the actress chose to stay with her company and part ways with Oxfam. Johansson announced Wednesday that she was resigning her Oxfam role because of a \\"fundamental difference of opinion.\\" Oxfam said it accepted her resignation. The international humanitarian organization said Thursday that it believes SodaStream and other businesses operating in Israeli settlements in the West Bank contribute to the \\"denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support.\\" The charity said it opposes all trade from the Israeli settlements, \\"which are illegal under international law.\\" Pro-Palestinian activists who advocate consumer boycotts of goods produced in Jewish settlements — which are deemed illegal by much of the international community — have encouraged the public to shun SodaStream. The company's main plant is in an Israeli industrial zone next to the settlement of Maaleh Adumim in the West Bank. Approximately 500 Palestinians work at the SodaStream factory in the West Bank. Some 550,000 Israelis live in settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in 1967, along with the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians seek all three territories for a future state. Johansson, who is Jewish, has become a global brand ambassador for SodaStream, and she recently appeared in an attention-grabbing commercial for the company, which has been gaining attention on YouTube and social media sites, and will air on the Super Bowl this Sunday. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Are there any waterproof inks for fountain pens? This question is asking if there are special inks that don't get washed away with water and can be used in fountain pens. The answer is yes, there are waterproof inks made just for fountain pens, like Noodler's Ink or Platinum Carbon Ink. They dry quickly and don't smudge when they get wet. 2. How do I make fountain pen ink? This question is about how to create ink for a fountain pen by yourself. It's a bit like asking how to make a cake. To make fountain pen ink, you need special ingredients like dye, distilled water, and a humectant, which helps the ink flow smoothly. You mix them together, and then you have your homemade ink! Just remember that making ink can be a bit tricky and messy, so it's always a good idea to ask a grown-up to help you.

Summarize this article: Imagine this situation for a moment. You are a pilot preparing for landing. You’ve checked airspeed, alerted cabin and crew, and are all set to make your final descent when all of a sudden you see a guy flying right outside the cockpit window.      However surreal, that’s what the pilots of one early summer flight have reported seeing high above the town of Macclesfield, in the United Kingdom; now tentatively dubbed by the public as the “Superman of Macclesfield.”      According to the UK’s Daily Mail, the mystery man soared within 320 feet of the massive Airbus A320 on June 13; though at no point during visual contact did he ever appear on radar or deploy a parachute of any sort.      PHOTOS: Nissan raced its 370Z NISMO sports car against a wingsuit      The UK’s Airprox Board, which investigates airborne near misses, claims the pilots “first sighted the object a few hundred meters in the 11 o’clock position 200 to 300ft above.” The unidentified flying man then proceeded to descend beneath the plane, within 300 to 600 feet of the fuselage, with other crew members glimpsing the spectacle for only a moment while cruising 3,500 feet above terra firma.      Subsequent flight data for the day revealed no paragliders, hot-air balloons, or skydivers in the immediate area, which suggests that the airborne man used some sort of wing suit. The official report for the close call found there was “no way of corroborating what they had reported,” though if it was an extreme sports wingsuiter – we’ll probably see footage on YouTube eventually.

Aviation experts admitted they were baffled by the sighting of the human UFO, who has been dubbed Superman of Macclesfield.      He appeared from nowhere as the Airbus 320 passed the Cheshire town while it was coming in to land at Manchester Airport.

In April a figure was filmed flying over people in Qutub Minar, India, and the video quickly went viral on the internet.      Closer to home in Staffordshire, another man was spotted soaring over Cannock Chase in February 2009.      Five people contacted the local newspaper and described it as a “Superman” moment, with one believing he was using a James Bond-style jetpack.      In 1969 US Marine Corps private Earl Morrison and two friends saw a strange “winged” figure with a “greenish glow” crossing the night sky near Da Nang, Vietnam.      He said: “After it got close enough we could see what it was. It looked like a woman, a naked woman.” ||||| Pilots of a passenger plane over England were stunned recently, when an object they describe as a “flying man” buzzed past their aircraft, at a height of 3,500 feet.      The bizarre incident took place as the Airbus 320 was preparing to land at Manchester Airport on July 13, according to The Mirror. Appearing seemingly from nowhere, the mystery man passed within a hundred feet of the aircraft. The pilot and first officer, astounded after sighting the human UFO, reported the incident to air traffic control around 1:30 p.m. At first, they believed that the object was a paraglider, but did not observe a canopy. Controllers were unable to detect any sign of the flying man on radar, and a check of the area failed to turn up any paragliders, parachutists, or ­balloonists at the time of the sighting.      The flying man has since been dubbed the “Superman of Macclesfield,” as the Daily Mail notes. Observers have speculated that the flying man was utilizing a wingsuit, though there is no way to accurately assess the possibility. As The Inquisitr reported in 2012, wingsuits have been successfully utilized by skydivers to land without a parachute, though the practice is not common.      Is it a plane? Is it a bird?

According to their report, the pilot and co-pilot first sighted the man when he was about 200 to 300 meters above the plane, in the 11 o’clock position. Flying past the left hand side of the aircraft, the man was only briefly observed by the flight crew, who had no time to take any evasive action.

Help as much as you can. Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A new United Nations report shows that fish farming may soon be the world's most important provider of fish. The Food and Agriculture Organization says fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year. Fish farming now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish. That represents a forty-three percent increase from 2006. The report also said fish farming earned more money in 2008 than traditional fisheries. In fish farming, fish are raised in tanks or small bodies of water called ponds. They are also raised in cages or nets in oceans, lakes and rivers. The report says increased fish farming has helped people around the world eat record amounts of fish. The FAO says each person ate an average of almost seventeen kilograms of fish last year. However, the FAO says the current yearly wild-fish harvest of ninety million tons shows no improvement. Decreasing numbers of fish and stronger catch limits have reduced the possibilities for catching wild fish. The FAO report says about thirty-two percent of world supplies are overfished. It says these supplies of fish need to be rebuilt at once. Some scientists have criticized fish farming. They say the nets and cages permit fish diseases and pests to spread. Some fish farming critics doubt whether fish farming can keep growing at the current rate. But Wally Stevens of the trade group Global Aquaculture Alliance says the industry must continue developing to feed growing populations. Mr. Stevens says a one hundred percent increase in fish farming over ten years is necessary to keep providing for people at the current level. He notes that fish farming creates jobs and wealth, especially for people in coastal areas of China. Question: What does Wally Stevens think of fish farming?

Then, the reviewer questions the author's academic credentials, which undermines the author's credibility and suggests that they may not have the proper expertise to write about the subject matter. The reviewer also points out that the author provides few facts, which further impacts the credibility and quality of the content. This sentiment is reinforced as the reviewer states the work is \\"plenty in the way of opinions,\\" which implies that the material is more subjective rather than being based on well-established knowledge or research. Moreover, the reviewer claims that the author's economic growth philosophy has been \\"thoroughly discredited among leading economists,\\" which is another negative assertion that diminishes the legitimacy and value of the material.

Shortly after pleading not guilty Tuesday to charges related to sensational allegations of hush money payments and lying to federal agents, former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert stood in a packed federal courtroom in downtown Chicago looking extremely uncomfortable.      As the judge left the bench and Hastert's high-powered attorneys conferred with prosecutors, Hastert, once one of Illinois' most prominent politicians, remained by himself near the lectern, his shoulders hunched, arms hanging limp at his sides. After a moment, he turned toward the gallery where dozens of reporters and spectators were filing out and pursed his lips.      Minutes later, a wild scene unfolded as Hastert and his attorneys were whisked through the lobby of the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse amid a crush of television news cameras and photographers. Escorted by about a dozen federal Homeland Security agents, Hastert didn't say a word to the media, ducking into a black Lincoln Town Car that sped north on Dearborn Street as passersby stopped to stare. His lawyers had no comment either.      The frenzy surrounding the 73-year-old Republican powerhouse's first court appearance since his stunning indictment nearly two weeks ago stood in stark contrast to the routine proceedings in court, where Hastert formally acknowledged the charges and entered a not guilty plea through his attorneys.      Standing at the lectern in a dark gray suit and blue tie, Hastert answered, \\"Yes, sir,\\" several times in a barely audible voice as U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin asked him if he understood the charges and the terms and conditions of his bail.      The answers marked Hastert's first public words since the indictment was unsealed May 28 alleging he had agreed to pay 3.5 million to a longtime acquaintance to conceal wrongdoing from Hastert's days as a high school teacher and wrestling coach in Yorkville. According to the charges, Hastert had already paid 1.7 million to the acquaintance, identified only as Individual A, then lied about it when the FBI questioned him in December.      Former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert through the years.      His withdrawals from banks caught the attention of authorities. The indictment alleges that Hastert made 15 withdrawals of 50,000 apiece over nearly two years but then began illegally structuring the withdrawals in increments of less than 10,000 to avoid federal reporting requirements.      While the carefully worded, seven-page indictment only hinted at Hastert's dark past, federal law enforcement sources have said Hastert was making the payments to conceal sexual abuse of a Yorkville High School student. The FBI also interviewed a second person who raised similar allegations of sexual abuse against Hastert, corroborating the account of Individual A, sources said.      Since the charges were filed, a onetime Yorkville resident took to national television to allege Hastert sexually abused her now-deceased brother while he was a student. None of those allegations are part of the indictment.      As the details have trickled out, Hastert remained silent and away from public view for 12 days. Even the identity of his attorney wasn't confirmed until Monday afternoon when Thomas Green and John Gallo of the law firm of Sidley Austin LLC filed their official appearances with the court.      Dennis Hastert arrives at Sidley Austin in Chicago on Tuesday morning. (Jeff Coen, Chicago Tribune) Dennis Hastert arrives at Sidley Austin in Chicago on Tuesday morning. (Jeff Coen, Chicago Tribune) SEE MORE VIDEOS      Hastert's long-awaited day in court began about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, when he was spotted by reporters leaving his sprawling estate in far west suburban Plano in the hired black Lincoln. About an hour later, he arrived at Sidley Austin's Loop offices two blocks north of the courthouse, ignoring reporters who shouted questions through the vehicle's closed window.      Shortly before 1 p.m., the Town Car pulled up in front of the courthouse and Hastert emerged amid a scrum of cameramen and reporters, with Gallo clearing the way with a forearm. Several Homeland Security officers escorted Hastert through the revolving doors and the line for the metal detector. The former speaker did not respond to shouts for comment, including one person who yelled, \\"Who is Individual A?\\"      As Hastert neared the elevator bank, a national television news reporter stopped one of his lawyers to talk, leaving Hastert standing by himself. After briefly getting in an elevator car with a Tribune and Sun-Times reporter, Hastert exited the car when another attorney motioned to him that they needed to go to the 11th floor to meet with the pretrial services department.      Outside Durkin's 14th-floor courtroom, meanwhile, a long line of people stretched down the hall hoping to attend the arraignment. A nearby courtroom was set up to handle the overflow crowd.      Shortly after members of the media had been ushered in, filling up the jury box and at least one half of the gallery, Hastert walked into the courtroom about 1:45 p.m. For 15 awkward minutes before the hearing began, Hastert sat at the defense table, his eyes darting to the ceiling and then down to his hands as reporters observed him and scribbled notes. Later, as the attorneys conferred with each other, Hastert sat by himself, staring straight ahead.      The 20-minute arraignment hearing was highlighted by Durkin addressing head-on some potential conflict-of-interest issues that arose after he was randomly selected as the judge to hear the high-profile case.      The judge noted — as reported by the Tribune last week — that he had made two donations totaling 1,500 to Hastert's campaign more than a decade ago while he was a private attorney at the Mayer Brown law firm in Chicago. He also said he had written an email in the mid-1990s to a Hastert staffer as part of his effort at the time to be appointed to the federal bench. \\"But nothing came of it,\\" said Durkin, who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama only a few years ago.      Durkin acknowledged his brother is Jim Durkin, the current Republican leader of the Illinois House, but he said Hastert \\"is not a personal friend of my brother\\" and the relationship would have no bearing on him overseeing the case.      In addition, the judge said he had worked at the same law firm as Hastert's son, Ethan, including working closely on one matter together in 2011. \\"We were friendly business colleagues, but I do not consider him a personal friend,\\" Durkin said.      The judge said he had \\"no doubt\\" he could be impartial in the case.      Still, federal statute calls for him to step aside if his impartiality \\"might reasonably be questioned,\\" he noted. By that standard, Durkin said he would recuse himself from the case unless both sides agree to keep him on as judge. He asked the parties to make that decision by Thursday afternoon.      \\"I will not be offended whatever the result, I assure you,\\" the judge said.      If Durkin was disqualified — a rare step in federal court — another judge would then be randomly assigned to the case. ||||| CHICAGO — After days of silence, J. Dennis Hastert, a former speaker of the House of Representatives, on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to federal charges that he illegally structured bank withdrawals and lied to the authorities about millions of dollars he had promised to pay someone for misconduct that occurred decades ago.      In a dark pinstripe suit and with his familiar helmet of gray hair, Mr. Hastert, 73, stood slightly stooped before the judge, flanked by lawyers, quietly answering the judge’s questions with a simple “yes” or “yes, sir.” It was the first time the once-powerful former congressman had appeared in public since the charges were announced last month, and he was met with a chaotic crush of news media in the federal courthouse here.      Aside from entering a not guilty plea, Mr. Hastert and his lawyers offered no further sense of their response to the charges, which are narrowly focused around financial transactions but which have raised a cloud of allegations of sexual misconduct for a man who had receded from public life.      The provisions of his release were routine yet stark for a man whose career arc had carried him from revered, small-town wrestling coach to the Illinois Statehouse and on to one of the top leadership posts in Congress. In addition to posting a 4,500 bond, Mr. Hastert was ordered to surrender his passport, remain in the continental United States, advise the court of any change in his address, and remove guns from his home within two weeks. ||||| Hastert pleads not guilty The former House speaker emerged after more than a week in seclusion.      CHICAGO — After more than a week in seclusion, former House Speaker Dennis Hastert pleaded not guilty Tuesday to two criminal charges that he violated federal banking law and lied to FBI agents as they investigated his alleged agreement to pay 3.5 million in hush money to cover up a past transgression.      Hastert, who became the longest-serving Republican speaker before the GOP lost the House in 2006, was released after entering the plea in front of U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin at an afternoon hearing, which raised questions about whether Durkin will continue or the case will be reassigned to another judge.      Story Continued Below      Hastert, 73, looked much as he did during the height of his power, slightly stooped and with a shock of gray hair as he trudged into the packed courtroom clad in a dark pinstripe suit and blue tie. He stood in front of the judge’s bench throughout the roughly 15-minute hearing, softly answering the judge’s questions — usually with “Yes, sir.”      Hastert’s lead defense attorney, Tom Green, spoke for Hastert when it came time to offer a plea.      “The defendant enters a plea of not guilty to both counts of the indictment, your honor,” Green said.      Before the hearing, the ex-speaker turned criminal defendant spent more than an hour behind closed doors on another floor of the courthouse, going through the usual booking process, which involves fingerprinting, mug shots and providing a swab of DNA for a massive federal database. The well-traveled Hastert also surrendered his passport, Green said.      Durkin, who was randomly assigned to the case, announced at the hearing that he was provisionally recusing himself due to several personal and family ties to Hastert, Hastert’s relatives and the Republican Party, as well as lawyers on both the defense and prosecution teams.      Reading for several minutes from a prepared statement, Durkin outlined the links created by Illinois politics and his professional history as a prosecutor and lawyer in private practice.      “As far as I can recall, I have never met the defendant,” the judge said. He quickly noted that — as POLITICO first reported — he made donations to Hastert’s reelection campaigns in 2002 and 2004.      “These contributions were made while I was a private citizen, after leaving the U.S. attorney’s office and before I became a federal judge,” Durkin said. He said the donations were “made through” a fellow lawyer at Mayer Brown, the law firm where Durkin then worked.      The judge went on to note that he worked for a time with Hastert’s son Ethan, who is also a partner at Mayer Brown. Durkin said there was “one matter” they were both assigned to that resulted in he and Ethan Hastert taking three or four work trips together. Their relationship was “friendly,” but they are not “personal friends,” the judge said.      Durkin also disclosed that he emailed one of Dennis Hastert’s staffers in the mid-’90s in a bid to secure a judgeship. Durkin’s nomination to the bench did not come until about 20 years later, when President Barack Obama tapped him in 2013.      The judge also noted that his brother Jim is the Republican minority leader of the Illinois House. “I’ve never met the defendant through Jim,” the judge said. “The defendant is not a good friend of my brother.”      After outlining his ties to the lawyers on both sides of the case, Durkin said all the connections he listed wouldn’t affect his judgment in the case. “I have no doubt I can be impartial in this matter. If I had any such doubt, I would have disqualified myself on the day it was assigned to me,” the judge said.      However, the judge went on to say he was “not so naive” as to think that others might not question his impartiality, so he officially recused himself from the case.      Still, the recusal could turn out to be short-lived. Durkin said such recusals can be waived if both sides agree. He also set up a confidential process for them to weigh in that should keep him from knowing who effectively vetoed his involvement, if either or both sides do.      The judge set a tight deadline of Thursday afternoon for the defense and prosecution to make up their minds. “I don’t want this issue to linger,” Durkin said. Many lawyers expect both sides to agree to keep the judge on the case.      Durkin set a 4,500 unsecured bond as a condition of release for the former speaker, instructing Hastert to surrender his passport and firearms within two weeks, as well as to provide a DNA sample and avoid others associated with the case.      On his way in and out of the courthouse, Hastert faced a chaotic maelstrom of TV cameras and journalists pressing him to comment on news reports that the “misconduct” he allegedly was trying to cover up involved sexual misconduct with a student when Hastert worked decades ago as a high school teacher and wrestling coach.      AP photo      On the eve of the hearing, Hastert shifted his legal team by tapping D.C. white-collar specialist Green and a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, John Gallo. The two attorneys, both with the law firm Sidley Austin, replaced another prominent defense lawyer, Barry Levine of Dickstein Shapiro — the same firm Hastert resigned from as a lobbyist when the charges were announced late last month.      While Green is known for high-profile defense roles in the Iran-Contra investigation, legal insiders say that if the case moves toward a plea bargain, Gallo and other former prosecutors at Sidley’s Chicago office could play key roles in negotiating a deal.      Gallo’s familiarity with the prosecutors on the case, Steven Block and Carrie Hamilton, was evident as the lawyers chatted informally before the hearing began. Green’s novelty to the case and the prosecution team was clear Tuesday as he introduced himself to the prosecutors for the first time.      Hastert sat quietly at the defense table during that wait, alternately folding his hands and laying them flat on the table. The atmosphere was awkward as dozens of journalists — some, because of limited space, seated in the jury box directly facing the former speaker — watched Hastert intently and silently for about 15 minutes as everyone awaited the scheduled start of the hearing.      Neither the former speaker nor his lawyers commented as they entered and left a federal courthouse that in recent years has seen the prosecution and conviction on corruption charges of a slew of major Illinois political figures, including former Govs. George Ryan and Rod Blagojevich.      Aside from the not guilty pleas he offered Tuesday, Hastert has not publicly addressed the charges since his May 28 indictment. But in a brief interview with POLITICO several days before the charges were filed, he denied wrongdoing and maintained that his finances were not the subject of a federal investigation.      At Tuesday’s hearing, the defense waived a formal reading of the indictment, which alleges Hastert agreed to pay 3.5 million to an undisclosed individual and forked over 1.7 million of that before the charges were filed. Nearly 1 million of that was withdrawn from the former speaker’s bank accounts in increments of just under 10,000 after bankers warned him that larger cash withdrawals would trigger reports to the authorities, the indictment claims.      Prosecutors said little during the session, but when the judge asked for details of the potential penalties, Block noted Hastert could face up to five years in prison and a 250,000 fine on each of the two felony counts. However, judges usually impose sentences in accordance with federal guidelines that call for more lenient punishment for offenders with no serious criminal record.      A plea deal could also reduce Hastert’s sentence.      Many criminal defense lawyers believe such a deal is probable because a jury is not likely to look favorably on a defendant trying to cover up alleged sexual abuse of a student.      One of the charges brought against Hastert — structuring cash transactions to avoid federal reporting requirements — is unpopular among defense lawyers and libertarians because it can render routine cash banking transactions in increments of just under 10,000 illegal even if the reason for the cash payments or withdrawals is lawful.      Critics contend that prosecutors use the structuring law to bring charges or force guilty pleas from defendants when the government lacks proof to make a case for drug trafficking or tax evasion. Some judges have reacted skeptically when the feds have brought cases in which there is no charge that the underlying conduct was illegal.      The nature of Hastert’s reported relationship with the acquaintance who allegedly received the hush money is unclear, but experts say the statute of limitations in Illinois for a criminal prosecution on sexual abuse from the 1970s expired long ago.      Hastert, who as speaker was once second in line to the presidency, resigned his House seat in 2007 after he lost the speaker’s post due to the Democrats’ victory in 2006. He is the highest-ranking current or former federal official to face criminal prosecution since Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned in 1973 and pleaded guilty to a felony tax evasion charge.      Nick Gass contributed to this report from Arlington, Virginia. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"On Tuesday, former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert pleaded not guilty to charges related to allegations of hush money payments and lying to federal agents. The 73-year-old Republican, once one of Illinois' most prominent politicians, was in a packed federal courtroom in downtown Chicago, looking very uncomfortable. The frenzy surrounding Hastert's first court appearance since his indictment nearly two weeks ago stood in stark contrast to a routine hearing in which he formally acknowledged the charges and entered a not guilty plea through his attorneys. Hastert answered, \\"Yes, sir,\\" several times in a barely audible voice as U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin asked him if he understood the charges and the terms and conditions of his bail. This marked Hastert's first public words since the indictment was unsealed on May 28, alleging he had agreed to pay 3.5 million to a longtime acquaintance to conceal wrongdoing from his days as a high school teacher and wrestling coach in Yorkville. According to the charges, Hastert had already paid 1.7 million to the acquaintance, identified as Individual A, and then lied about it when the FBI questioned him in December."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While wearing the appropriate uniform is important, as it reflects school unity and sophistication, success in secondary school goes beyond just the clothing students wear. Here is a comprehensive guide to achieving success in English secondary schools: 1. Develop strong study habits: Start by creating a well-organized study schedule that prioritizes different subjects. Ensure you allocate enough time to each subject according to its difficulty level and your personal strengths and weaknesses. Consistency in studying is key, so try to stick to your schedule as much as possible. 2. Get involved in extracurricular activities: Participating in clubs, sports, or other activities will help you develop various skills, such as teamwork, leadership, and time management. These skills will not only contribute to your success in school but also prepare you for future endeavours. 3. Build good relationships with teachers: Communicate effectively with your teachers and show a genuine interest in learning. Ask questions when you need clarification and seek extra support when necessary. Maintaining a positive relationship with your teachers will make it easier for you to approach them for help or advice. 4. Stay organized: Keep track of your assignments, deadlines, and exam dates. Use a planner or digital calendar to help you stay organized and manage your time effectively. Break down bigger tasks into smaller, manageable ones and set realistic goals to complete them on time. 5. Take care of yourself: Getting sufficient sleep, eating healthily, and engaging in regular exercise are crucial for maintaining optimal physical and mental health. Proper self-care will ensure that you are energized and focused when you need to study or participate in class. 6.

This will help you stay motivated and focused on your objective of excelling in secondary school. 8. Seek support when needed: If you find yourself struggling with a particular subject or concept, don't hesitate to ask for help. You can turn to teachers, school counsellors, peers, and even online resources for support. 9. Develop a growth mindset: Embrace challenges and view failures as opportunities to learn and grow. Believe in your ability to improve and develop new skills. Adopting a growth mindset will help you persevere through difficult situations and promote overall academic success. 10. Manage stress: Finding healthy ways to cope with stress is essential for maintaining a balanced life. Develop coping strategies, such as practicing mindfulness, engaging in hobbies, or talking to someone about your feelings, to help manage stress and prevent burnout. In conclusion, while wearing an appropriate uniform in secondary school in England is part of adhering to the school's expectations, it is not the sole determinant of success. Focusing on developing strong study habits, participating in extracurricular activities, staying organized, seeking support when needed, and building relationships with teachers and classmates are just a few of the many strategies that students can employ to succeed in secondary school."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable.

WHITE HOUSE — A controversial clothing choice is overshadowing a surprise visit by U.S. first lady Melania Trump to a Texas facility to meet immigrant children separated from their families because of her husband's \\"zero-tolerance\\" immigration policy. Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer.

Q:William White sat across from me, fidgeting nervously with an empty packet of artificial sweetener while his coffee went cold, ignored on the table in front of him. He rolled the torn yellow paper up like a tight little spliff, then unrolled it, smoothed it out flat, and then rolled it again. I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh.

His most notable works include \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\", which was later adapted into the movie \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"The Man in the High Castle\\", \\"A Scanner Darkly\\", among others.  Dick is often recognized for his exploration of sociological, political and metaphysical themes in novels dominated by monopolistic corporations, authoritarian governments, and altered states. In many of his works, the line between reality and illusion is blurred, siding with the reality of subjective perception over objective \\"truth\\".  In this particular context, William White is providing some biographical information about Dick, particularly about the death of his twin sister Jane shortly after their birth and her impact on Dick's life and work. This information serves to give more insight into Dick's life, perhaps hinting at some of the themes in his writing and personal struggles, including his battle with drug abuse and his untimely death at age 53. However, it doesn't seem like either protagonist in the story personally knew Philip K. Dick, so none of the options provided (B: Their teacher, C: Their neighbor, D: Their mutual friend) are correct, and option A: not enough information isn't applicable because there is adequate information to identify who Philip K.

I have been in S&M clubs like this, and so too has Monica Bonvicini. Since the 1990s such places have provided inspiration for her art. So too has the building site, the power tool and hardware store. As fetishistic as it is fun, muted as it is aggressive, her art is a kind of invitation. Her Baltic exhibition is a series of rumpus rooms, dark corners and sudden shocks. What are we waiting for? But where have all the kinksters gone? Perhaps they have taken the advice given by the sculpture Bonvicini made for the 2012 London Olympics. The outdoor sculpture, in huge mirrored and LED-lit letters, just said “RUN”. Boys and their toys are a consistent focus for Bonvicini. A hanging cluster of conjoined chainsaws hangs from steel chains; a hammock, entirely made of a super-abundancy of chains, with decorative little black leather tassels, hovers over a black carpet. The aesthetic here is a kind of industrial rococo. All that’s missing is the perfume of machine-oil lubricant. Galvanised and nickel-plated, chains hang in catenary curves, spool on to the floor, and sit in a rough wedge on top of a mirrored cube. They spell out the word Prozac and decorate a staircase made from scaffolder’s poles that leads to nowhere. Everyone has their thing – Bonvicini’s is chains. Outside, guys in hi-vis jackets, helmets, tool-belts and abseiling gear are battling the wind and the rain, affixing metal lettering on the exterior north wall of Baltic. Below, a river the colour of stewed tea flows past. Satisfy Me, the signage says. In this weather? You must be joking. The same words are printed across a table under strong, hot lights behind a sturdy barrier inside the Baltic, in a corner of a labyrinthine installation of false rooms and corridors. This bleak entreaty could be some sort of institutional critique of the art gallery, and the promises it makes but so often fails to deliver. Expectation and disappointment are a constant. Maybe that’s why we keep going back. Behind glass, a hammer and a handsaw are sewn into body-hugging, tight leather suits. There’s no chance of a sniff or a lick. They have the menace of dozing reptiles; ordinary things that can be turned to malicious intent or unlikely pleasures. Telescopic steel props lean against the walls, like bystanders. One has gold watches dangling from its handle. Another carries a little leather pouch. Is this some sort of dress code? Nearby, a drill slung from the ceiling suddenly starts up, capering and spinning on its wires, a deadly dancer impotent in a sealed room, visible through a glass wall. A minimal black rhomboid is all strapped-up with belts, and so is the couch. This is art in bondage, but only to itself. Wherever she shows, Monica Bonvicini gets apprentice builders to build their fragments of architecture. Anything can be art, and art often looks a bit like this. Their structures are ranged about the floor, like slapdash rearrangements of Carl Andre’s infamous bricks. In 1999 Bonvicini also began sending out questionnaires to building workers in the various towns and cities where she was due to have exhibitions. ‘What does your wife/girlfriend think of your rough and dry hands?’, she asks, and goes on to enquire why construction workers are almost always men, and whether respondents think there is anything erotic about construction. Heaven forfend, they reply, or something like it. She asks for building-site jokes (the answers invariably lewd), and whom the workers would like to wall up, and how do you get along with your gay colleagues? An entire wall at Baltic is taken up with a selection of 234 framed replies, in various languages, the most recent coming from builders in Newcastle and Gateshead. “She loves it rough”, answers one about his calloused hands. There are no complaints in the bedroom, according to the writers, and no problem with gay colleagues, though many claim not to have any. One respondent is the lone lesbian on an all-male crew, while another woman says that all the girls want to wear her tool-belt. All this is amusing, and mostly lives up to the often depressing stereotypes of a predominantly masculine workforce, though Bonvicini’s sample, and her questions, are hardly scientific. Bend over. This is the only way, unless you are a child or very short, to look through the little spyholes set in the gallery wall. Each is a little magnifying lens, giving a view of a distant room, a tiny fish-eye distorted image of a gallery where a show is either going up or coming down, stuff piled up between bare white walls. Rooms, then, waiting for something to happen. Squinting through the peephole I feel like a peeping tom, but then I always do. We are all voyeurs here. But no one comes and no one goes. We could be waiting a long time. One minute you are blasted by a hanging arrangement of dazzling white strip-lights, the next you find yourself in a quiet, dark cul-de-sac where an oversized image of a partly open door is projected on to the end wall. Suddenly the static video image comes to life and the door slams. Bonvicini wants to give us a jolt. It works the first time, but then I am inured. Bonvicini’s is an art of diminishing returns. In any case, you can get used to anything. It leads to an ever more extreme and eccentric quest for a thrill. “I defy any amateur of paintings to love a canvas as much as a fetishist loves a shoe,” wrote Georges Bataille. When people say they love art I often wonder what they mean. If I’m an art lover, I am still looking for that perfect object of my desire. Don’t tell me it doesn’t exist.

Write an article based on this summary: A man who killed his parents after telling police they had been replaced with imposters like in the film Face/Off has failed in a bid to have his sentence reduced. Article:","output":"Title: Man Fails in Attempt to Reduce Sentence for Killing Parents, Claiming They Were Replaced by Imposters Introduction: A recent court case involving a man who killed his parents after believing them to be replaced with imposters as portrayed in the film \\"Face/Off\\" has attracted significant attention. The individual sought to have his sentence reduced, but ultimately failed in his endeavor. This article will delve into the details of the case and provide insight into the reasons behind the court's decision. Step 1: Provide Background Information In order to understand the context of the case, it is essential to provide information on the events leading up to the tragic event. The man, who remains unnamed for legal reasons, reportedly began to believe that his parents were imposters after watching the 1997 action film \\"Face/Off.\\" This film, directed by John Woo and starring Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, tells the story of a dangerous criminal and a heroic cop who literally swap faces, thereby fooling those around them. Step 2: Explain the Crime and the Man's Actions Despite the clear fantastical nature of the film, the man became convinced that his parents had been replaced by imposters. In a desperate attempt to stop these perceived threats, the man took matters into his own hands and murdered his parents, later telling the police about his actions and the supposed reason behind them. Step 3: Detail the Court Proceedings and Decision The court case focused on the man's mental health and his ability to differentiate between reality and fiction. Expert witnesses were brought in to provide their opinions on the man's state of mind at the time of the murders. Ultimately, the court ruled that the man was fully aware of his actions and their potential consequences, making him liable for his crime. Step 4: Discuss the Attempt to Reduce the Sentence In a subsequent appeal, the man's legal team attempted to have his sentence reduced, arguing that the case involved circumstances that were not typical of a premeditated murder and that their client was suffering from a delusional disorder. However, the court rejected this argument, maintaining that the man's actions were deliberate, and that his mental state did not absolve him of responsibility for the crime. Step 5: Analyze the Implications of the Court's Decision The court's decision has numerous implications for the way mental health issues are addressed in criminal cases. While the man's belief that his parents were imposters might be indicative of mental illness, the court ruled that this did not absolve him of responsibility for his actions, even if it influenced his motivations. This suggests that, in the eyes of the law, there may be limits to the extent to which mental health issues can be considered as a mitigating factor in violent crimes. Conclusion: The case of the man who killed his parents after believing them to be imposters based on the film \\"Face/Off\\" has drawn attention to the challenges faced by courts in handling cases involving mental health issues. While the court acknowledged the influence of his delusional beliefs, it did not consider them sufficient grounds for a reduced sentence. As legal systems continue to evolve, this case may serve as an example of the complexities that arise when mental health concerns intersect with the criminal justice system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? I am thankful to the aircrew.","output":"Yes, the next sentence \\"I am thankful to the aircrew\\" can be considered as following the preceding text, albeit with a slight change in focus. The preceding text seeks to extend gratitude to various groups involved in maintaining the safety and security of the south shore region. It mentions numerous organizations and personnel involved in emergency response services, including the aircrew as one of the groups, to whom the speaker is expressing personal gratitude and also representing the gratitude of all Nova Scotians. In the following sentence, the speaker narrows down the focus on their own personal appreciation specifically for the aircrew. By emphasizing their gratefulness for this particular group, the speaker implies that they either have a connection to that particular role or recognizes the aircrew's significant contribution to the overall safety and security of the region. To make the connection between the two sentences more seamless and coherent, you could consider adding a transition phrase or providing more context: \\"While I have expressed gratitude to all these teams and individuals, I would like to especially emphasize my thankfulness to the aircrew. Their courage, dedication, and professionalism make an enormous impact on the well-being of our community, ensuring that emergency assistance is always available from the skies.\\" Or simply by saying: \\"In particular, I am thankful to the aircrew for their unwavering dedication and commitment to keeping the south shore safe from above.\\" These additions provide a more fluid connection between the preceding and following messages, while still emphasizing the importance of aircrew and their contributions to the community's welfare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lee is now the bodyguard for his friend Ambassador Han, the former Consul from the first film. Lee is still upset with Carter about an incident in New York City when Carter accidentally but not fatally shot Lee's ex-girlfriend in the neck, Secret Service agent Isabella Molina.During the World Criminal Court discussions, as the Ambassador addresses the importance to fight the Triad, he announces that he may know the whereabouts of Shy Shen.

When Lee hesitates to shoot Kenji, Carter shows up driving towards the two and accidentally nearly runs Lee over, allowing Kenji to escape.In the hospital, Lee learns that Han will make a full recovery. Han's daughter, Soo Yung (Zhang Jingchu), now grown up, arrives and makes Lee and Carter promise to capture the one behind the shooting. She then informs Lee and Carter that her father gave her an envelope which contains important information regarding the Triad, and that the envelope is in her locker at the martial arts studio where she works. Lee and Carter make their way to the martial arts studio where they battle a giant, (Sun Ming Ming), but find out that a gang of armed men had already arrived and taken the contents from the locker.

Answer:","output":"\\"Rush Hour: Brotherhood in Arms\\" The title clearly connects the film to its prequels \\"Rush Hour\\" and \\"Rush Hour 2\\" while also introducing a new element of the story. \\"Brotherhood in Arms\\" is a double entendre referencing both the physical battles that Lee and Carter will engage in, as well as the emotional battle Lee must fight against his “brother” Kenji. It implies the complex relationship between Lee and Kenji, hinting at the intense conflict to come, while also suggesting the strong bond between Lee and Carter, echoed in their collaborative efforts to protect Han and Soo Yung, and defeat the Triad. The title insists on the suspenseful and action-filled encounters the movie is filled with, adding to the intrigue and attracting an audience interested in action-packed plots and complex relationships. It also emphasizes the theme of 'brotherhood', not just in blood but in bond, hinting at the emotional depth that will be explored between the characters amidst the adrenaline-fuelled plot. “Rush Hour: Brotherhood in Arms” suggests to the viewer that this movie will be a suspenseful and action-packed ride, featuring familiar characters in unfamiliar and dangerous situations, forced to confront their past and protect their loved ones. The 'In Arms' suggests a considerable amount of action and conflict that these 'brothers' in the action will face, adding to the allure for fans of action and drama.

And we are left with the ultimate conclusion that where true love is concerned at least, the answer is a resounding \\"Yes\\" to a Grand Design. An easy-going garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins), meets Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), a successful Princeton University mathematics doctoral candidate, as she comes into the garage, accompanied by her resistant and critical English fiancÃ©, acerbic experimental psychology professor James Moreland (Stephen Fry). There is an immediate \\"electric\\" connection which Ed recognizes, but she is not yet aware. Ed sees his future, briefly, and Catherine is a major part of it; they are married, and have children together. \\"How long will all of this take?\\" asks Catherine, referring to the car repair, and Ed, thinking about their future life together, replies, \\"That's up to you\\". His life purpose has suddenly been decided by a force of nature greater than himself. Finding a watch she left at the garage, Ed travels to her address and finds himself face to face with Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau), who is Catherine's uncle.[1] Albertâportrayed as a fun-loving geniusâand his mischievous friends, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht (Joseph Maher), Kurt GÃ¶del (Lou Jacobi), and Boris Podolsky (Gene Saks), see Ed as someone who would be better suited for Catherine. The four of them try to help Ed look and sound like a scientist (i.e., a \\"wunderkind\\" in physics) temporarily, in order to garner Catherine's attention for Ed, while at the same time trying to convince Catherine that life is not all about the mind, but is also about the heart. James's heart is virtually non-existent, while Ed's heart is virtually limitless.

What is the answer: Which great guitarist had the first names Aaron Thibodaux?","output":"The great guitarist with the first names Aaron Thibodaux was Aaron Thibeaux \\"T-Bone\\" Walker. T-Bone Walker, born on May 28, 1910, in Linden, Texas, was an American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter who was a pioneer in his field, significantly influencing the development of electric blues guitar. Aaron Thibeaux Walker was born to musically inclined parents, who both played instruments. He started his music career at a young age - initially playing the banjo, guitar, and piano. Later in his career, T-Bone adopted a new sound by using the electric guitar, a relatively new instrument at the time, and became one of the first to successfully employ the instrument in blues music. T-Bone Walker began performing in the 1920s and gained recognition for his innovative guitar techniques, which influenced generations of blues and rock guitarists. He used the guitar not only to produce melodic lines but also to create distinctive rhythmic patterns. His signature playing style included single-string picking, bent notes, and the use of vibrato, which later became common among blues and rock guitarists. Apart from his guitar skills, T-Bone Walker was also known for his smooth vocal delivery and engaging stage presence, often combining flashy showmanship with his guitar performances. One of his most famous recordings was the 1942 hit \\"Mean Old World\\" produced by Capitol Records. The song, with Walker's smooth vocals and dazzling electric guitar solo, became a template for many blues songs that followed. However, T-Bone Walker's most significant contribution to blues and guitar music came with his 1947 hit \\"Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just as Bad)\\" or simply \\"Stormy Monday.\\" This song is now considered a blues standard and has been covered by numerous artists throughout the years, including the Allman Brothers Band and Eric Clapton. T-Bone Walker went on to enjoy a successful career that spanned four decades, and he continued to tour and record until just a few years before his death in 1975. His influence can be heard in the music of guitar icons such as B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, to name just a few. In conclusion, Aaron Thibeaux \\"T-Bone\\" Walker is considered one of the most influential guitarists in the history of blues music. His innovative playing style, including the use of the electric guitar, affected not only the direction of blues but also rock music. Walker provided a foundation for countless future guitar legends, thanks to his extraordinary talent, creativity, and passion for music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The North American fur trade was the industry and activities related to the acquisition, trade, exchange, and sale of animal furs in North America. Aboriginal peoples in Canada and Native Americans in the United States of different regions traded among themselves in the Pre-Columbian Era, but Europeans participated in the trade beginning from the time of their arrival in the New World and extended its reach to Europe. The French started trading in the 16th century, the English established trading posts on Hudson Bay in present-day Canada in the 17th century, and the Dutch had trade by the same time in New Netherland. The 19th-century North American fur trade, when the industry was at its peak of economic importance, involved the development of elaborate trade networks. Deerskin trade was at its most profitable in the mid-18th century. The Creeks rose up as the largest deerskin supplier, and the increase in supply only intensified European demand for deerskins. Native Americans continued to negotiate the most lucrative trade deals by forcing England, France, and Spain to compete for their supply of deerskins. In the 1750s and 1760s, the Seven Years' War disrupted France's ability to provide manufactures goods to its allies, the Choctaws and Chickasaw. The French and Indian War further disrupted trade, as the British blockaded French goods. The Cherokees allied themselves with France, who were driven out from the southeast in accordance with the Treaty of Paris in 1763. The British were now the dominant trading power in the southeast.  While both the Cherokee and the Creek were the main trading partners of the British, their relationships with the British were different. The Creeks adapted to the new economic trade system, and managed to hold onto their old social structures. Originally Cherokee land was divided into five districts; however, the number soon grew to thirteen districts with 200 hunters assigned per district due to deerskin demand.  Charleston and Savannah were the main trading ports for the export of deerskins. Deerskins became the most popular export, and monetarily supported the colonies with the revenue produced by taxes on deerskins. Charleston's trade was regulated by the Indian Trade Commission, composed of traders who monopolized the market and profited off the sale of deerskins. From the beginning of the 18th century to mid-century, the deerskin exports of Charleston more than doubled in exports. Charleston received tobacco and sugar from the West Indies and rum from the North in exchange for deerskins. In return for deerskins, Great Britain sent woolens, guns, ammunition, iron tools, clothing, and other manufactured goods that were traded to the Native Americans.","output":"This text is about the North American fur trade, specifically focusing on the deerskin trade and its impact on various Native American tribes, European trading powers, and the development of trade networks in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don’t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I’m very intrigued to properly analyse it. The first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious 😉 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they’ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame.

Thirty years old and single, Pauline \\"Poppy\\" Cross shares a London flat with her best friend Zoe, a fellow teacher. Poppy is free-minded, high-spirited and kind-hearted. The film opens with Poppy trying to engage a shop employee in conversation. He ignores her, yet his icy demeanour does not bother her. She maintains her good mood even when she discovers her bicycle has been stolen. Her main concern is not getting a new one or finding the bicycle, but that she did not get a chance to say goodbye to it. This prompts her to decide to learn how to drive. When Poppy takes driving lessons for the first time, her positive attitude contrasts starkly with her gloomy, intolerant and cynical driving instructor, Scott. He is emotionally repressed, has anger problems and becomes extremely agitated by Poppy's casual attitude towards driving. As Poppy gets to know him, it becomes evident that Scott believes in conspiracy theories. His beliefs are partly attributable to his racist and misogynistic views, which make it hard for him to get along with others. Scott seems to be angered by Poppy's sunny personality and what he perceives as a lack of responsibility and concern for driving safety. Scott is exceptionally irritated by Poppy's choice of footwear (a pair of high-heeled boots), which he feels compromises her ability to drive. From the outset, he feels Poppy does not take her lessons seriously and is careless. Poppy, however, does have the capacity to be responsible. At school, Poppy observes one of her pupils bullying one of his classmates. Rather than becoming angry, she worries about him and takes the appropriate action. After speaking with her student, she comes to the correct conclusion that her student is being abused at home. A social worker, Tim, is brought in to handle the boy's case.

Background: Jean-Marie Le Pen (French pronunciation:  [Za ma.Ri l@.pen]; born 20 June 1928) is a French politician who has served as Honorary President of the National Front since January 2011 and a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from France since 2004, previously between 1984 to 2003. He previously served as President of the National Front from 1972 to 2011. Context: Le Pen is often nicknamed the \\"Menhir\\", due to his \\"granitic nature\\" as he is perceived as someone who does not give way to pressure or who cannot be easily knocked down. It also connects him to France's Celtic origins. Le Pen is often described as one of the most flamboyant and charismatic orators in Europe, whose speech blends folksy humour, crude attacks and rhetorical finesse.  However, Le Pen remains a polarizing figure in France: opinions regarding him tend to be quite strong. A 2002 IPSOS poll showed that while 22% of the electorate have a good or very good opinion of Le Pen, and 13% an unfavorable opinion, 61% have a very unfavorable opinion.  Le Pen and the National Front are described by much of the media and nearly all commentators as far right. Le Pen himself and the rest of his party disagree with this label; earlier in his political career, Le Pen described his position as \\"neither right, nor left, but French\\" (ni droite, ni gauche, francais). He later described his position as right-wing and opposed to the \\"socialo-communists\\" and other right-wing parties, which he deems are not real right-wing parties. At other times, for example during the 2002 election campaign, he declared himself \\"socially left-wing, economically right-wing, nationally French\\" (socialement a gauche, economiquement a droite, nationalement francais). He further contends that most of the French political and media class are corrupt and out of touch with the real needs of the common people, and conspire to exclude Le Pen and his party from mainstream politics. Le Pen criticizes the other political parties as the \\"establishment\\" and lumped all major parties (Communist, Socialist, Union for French Democracy (UDF) and Rally for the Republic (RPR)) into the \\"Gang of Four\\" (la bande des quatre - an allusion to the Gang of Four during China's Cultural Revolution). Question: What are the opinions about him?. Whats the answer?","output":"The opinions about Jean-Marie Le Pen are quite polarized in France.

He looked at two different states of the patient's diaphragm, state A and state B. In state A the the diaphragm contracted, but in state B the diaphragm relaxed. He now needs to figure out other phenomena related to this.  Hint: Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure below ). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon. The answer to this question is:","output":"The ribcage would contract during state B. In state A, the diaphragm contracts, leading to the ribcage expanding and increasing chest volume, resulting in inhalation. In state B, the diaphragm relaxes, causing the ribcage to contract, decreasing chest volume, and leading to exhalation as air flows out of the lungs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: TO BUNDLE UP is not manly. Sure, that’s a generalization, but it’s undeniably true that many guys will simply grit their teeth through the cold—until things reach a dangerous point. (Foolishly losing a finger to frostbite isn’t the height of masculinity, either.) They’ll rely on just a wool muffler with a suit when the rest of the world has armed itself in proper coats. They’ll make do with just an overcoat when everyone else has graduated to bulbous parkas. But the advent of sleeker down jackets that are still as cozy-warm as their Michelin Man-size predecessors has made it possible to defy the cold without looking like a wimpy 5-year-old. When sandwiched between your sweater or suit and a beautifully tailored wool overcoat, these so-called “diet-down” jackets are a true sartorial win-win. This fashion-meets-function layering technique has already earned dedicated fans. “With a topcoat or pea coat, the insulating factor is just not there,” said Dominick Volini, 34, a partner in new fast-casual Manhattan restaurant Inday. And so, in deep winter, Mr. Volini wears his black Patagonia down sweater—really a jacket but so-named because it takes up no more room than a cardigan—under his trim navy Armor Lux pea coat. Though a number of brands—from premium ones like Norse Projects to Japanese fast-fashioneer Uniqlo—now make a version of these pieces, Patagonia was among the first to crack the code in the early aughts. The company’s design team, comprised heavily of climbers and hikers, was tired of bulky, overstuffed outerwear. So they decided to tackle the challenge of creating a lighter jacket without sacrificing warmth. Patagonia designer Eric Rice found the answer, explained Kristo Torgersen, the company’s global product line director of alpine and snow. Mr. Rice reduced the size of each individually quilted section on the lightweight nylon shell. He then plumped the smaller quilts with an 800 fill-power goose down whose big plumes provide warm with less density. And thus was born Patagonia’s down sweater (229), now available in a hooded version (279) and a range of colors, from neons to neutrals. From brand to brand, these jackets truthfully vary little, but consider color carefully. You can quite easily go the stealth route, choosing a shade that discreetly echoes your overcoat’s hue. When you layer black under black or navy under navy, few people need be any the wiser that you’re packing sporty nylon-and-feathers beneath that dashing cashmere-and-wool. If you’re feeling more adventurous, an acid green or cherry-red jacket can provide a satisfying hit of color on dismal December days. Play around a bit, especially when it comes to weekend ensembles. Try a camel coat with a kelly green or slate-grey puffer or a dark tweed topper with an olive nylon layer. The lighter look of these jackets also makes them more attractive when worn alone. “It’s a very different silhouette than the ’90s North Face,” said Brad Bennett, 34, a marketing consultant. “It’s not like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle shell.” Mr. Bennett, who lives in the Hudson Valley in New York, and works in Manhattan, particularly appreciates the versatility. “If you’re walking the dog, you just throw on a puffer and go,” he said. “If you need to look nice, put a jacket on top. You can have that coziness and not look like a schlub.” And if it turns out that you don’t need that layer at all? Many of these slender jackets come with a little matching pouch into which the jacket can be stowed. If you’re keeping track at home, that’s a win-win-win.","output":"Title: \\"Slim Down Jackets: The Stylish Solution to Men's Cold-Weather Dilemmas\\""},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you will be presented with a question in Dutch language, and you have to write the location names from the question if present.

Definition: In this task you are given a disfluent question, a proper question and a context. A disfluent question is a question that has some interruptions in it while framing and a proper question is the correct form of the question without any disfluency. Classify whether the question is answerable or not based on the given context. Input: proper question: When did Khan establish the Great Yuan?   disfluent question: What year no wait When did Khan establish the Great Yuan?   context: In 1271, Kublai Khan imposed the name Great Yuan (Chinese: 大元; pinyin: Dà Yuán; Wade–Giles: Ta-Yüan), establishing the Yuan dynasty. Dà Yuán (大元) is from the sentence 大哉乾元 (dà zai Qián Yuán / Great is Qián, the Primal) in the Commentaries on the Classic of Changes (I Ching) section regarding Qián (乾). The counterpart in Mongolian language was Dai Ön Ulus, also rendered as Ikh Yuan Üls or Yekhe Yuan Ulus. In Mongolian, Dai Ön (Great Yuan) is often used in conjunction with the Yeke Mongghul Ulus (lit. Great Mongol State), resulting in Dai Ön Yeke Mongghul Ulus (Mongolian script: ), meaning Great Yuan Great Mongol State. The Yuan dynasty is also known as the Mongol dynasty or Mongol Dynasty of China, similar to the names Manchu dynasty or Manchu Dynasty of China for the Qing dynasty. Furthermore, the Yuan is sometimes known as the Empire of the Great Khan or Khanate of the Great Khan, which particularly appeared on some Yuan maps, since Yuan emperors held the nominal title of Great Khan. Nevertheless, both terms can also refer to the khanate within the Mongol Empire directly ruled by Great Khans before the actual establishment of the Yuan dynasty by Kublai Khan in 1271.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the drink made from sorghum and urwagwa in the cuisine that is based on local staple foods?  The cuisine of Rwanda is based on local staple foods produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and urwagwa,  made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.

The duo consists of Alison Goldfrapp (vocals, synthesizer) and Will Gregory (synthesizer). Despite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, their 2000 debut studio album Felt Mountain did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synthpop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. Supernature, Goldfrapp's third album, was released in August 2005. The album comprises pop and electronic dance music prominently featured on Black Cherry, but focuses more on subtle hooks instead of the large choruses that made up its predecessor. The band never intended to create dance music, however, previous releases were popular across nightclubs in North America and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album. Supernature debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum in the UK. As of February 2008, it had sold one million copies worldwide. The album received a Grammy Award nomination in 2007 for Best Electronic/Dance Album and \\"Ooh La La\\" was nominated for Best Dance Recording. The song was used for the iPhone 5S's commercial in 2013.  \\"Ooh La La\\", the album's lead single, became Goldfrapp's first UK top five single. The song was chosen as the lead single \\"because it was up and in your face and carried on the theme of the glammy, discoey beat from the last album\\". \\"Ooh La La\\" became the first song performed by the band to feature the electric guitar and was cited as a highlight of the album by Allmusic. \\"Number 1\\" was released as the album's second single. Constructed around a synthesiser and bass arrangement, it was written about the importance of relationships. The album's third single \\"Ride a White Horse\\" was inspired by the disco era and reached number 15 in the UK. \\"Fly Me Away\\" was released as the album's fourth single, but did not perform as well as its predecessors.  In 2006, Goldfrapp released We Are Glitter, a North American-only compilation of remixes from Supernature. It included a Flaming Lips remix of \\"Satin Chic\\", the band's favourite song from the album.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: When was it released?","output":"Supernature, Goldfrapp's third album, was released in August 2005."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Jorge Posada days as Yankees full-time DH seem to be over as he sits vs. A's for Andruw Jones BY Mark Feinsand DAILY NEWS SPORTS WRITER Wednesday, June 1st 2011, 4:00 AM OAKLAND - Jorge Posada's days as a full-time designated hitter appear to be over. The veteran was out of the lineup again Tuesday night, as Joe Girardi started Andruw Jones at DH against lefthander Brett Anderson. Posada won't start again Wednesday against southpaw Gio Gonzalez, as Girardi hinted that Alex Rodriguez would get a turn as the DH. Girardi stopped short of calling his DH situation a platoon, although he acknowledged that \\"you could look at it that way\\" given Posada's 0-for-26 skid against lefties this season. Posada's last start against a lefty came on May 7 in Texas against Derek Holland. \\"Jorge hasn't had success right-handed this year, but he's had success in the past,\\" Girardi said. \\"It's just kind of worked out that way. (Brett Gardner) has hit lefthanders as well and Andruw Jones has hit them lately. I guess you could look at it that way, but when a lefty was in there, I let Jorge face the lefthander (Monday) night. It's not that I'm going to completely take every at-bat against Jorge against lefthanders.\\" Girardi hasn't sat Posada down to tell him he won't see any action against lefties, although the manager isn't committing to giving him any such at-bats, either. \\"I can't say that I won't, but I can't say that I necessarily will,\\" Girardi said. \\"I don't want to get boxed in here.\\" Asked how long the Yankees can wait for struggling hitters such as Posada (.169) and Nick Swisher (.213) to turn things around, Brian Cashman said it's a \\"feel\\" thing. Swisher went 1-for-4 with a walk against the A'sÂ Tuesday night. \\"You have to give it some time, get a feel and make some decisions when we feel they're appropriate - if we think they need to be made,\\" Cashman said. \\"We're worried about anybody who is struggling. When we get those guys going, we'll focus on whoever else is struggling. Swish had a good series in Seattle, so hopefully that's a sign that he's on the come for us.\\" LEADING MANFor all the talk about Derek Jeter's .259 batting average this season, the captain has been getting the job done as a leadoff hitter. Jeter has gotten on to lead off the first inning 21 times in 42 games this season, including a single to start Tuesday night's contest. Jeter entered Tuesday night hitting .375 with a .430 on-base percentage when leading off any inning. \\"That's pretty good,\\" Girardi said before Jeter went 2-for-4 with three runs scored Tuesday night. \\"That's giving your team an opportunity to score in the first inning. I think he's playing pretty well.\\" WELCOME BACKRussell Martin returned to the lineupÂ Tuesday night and went 0-for-4 after missing the past two games with a sore left big toe... The Yankees and A's will finish up their three-game series with a matinee at the Coliseum Wednesday. The Yankees are 13-3 in day games this season, the best record in the majors.

The United States has lost the war on drugs. Substance D, a powerful and dangerous drug that causes bizarre hallucinations, has swept the country. Approximately 20% of the total population is addicted. In response, the government has developed an invasive, high-tech surveillance system and a network of undercover officers and informants. Bob Arctor is one of these undercover agents, assigned to immerse himself in the drug's underworld and infiltrate the supply chain. Sometime in the past, Arctor abandoned his wife and two children, leaving him alone in a now-rundown suburban house in Anaheim, California; the house has since been repopulated by Arctor's two drug-addicted, layabout housemates: Luckman and Barris. The three spend their days intoxicated and having long, paranoiac conversations. At the police station, Arctor maintains privacy by wearing a \\"scramble suit\\" that constantly changes every aspect of his appearance and he is known only by the code name \\"Fred.\\" Arctor's senior officer, \\"Hank\\", and all other undercover officers, also wear scramble suits, protecting their identities even from each other.

Investigation advances as more remains recovered from MH17 site A coffin containing more remains from the MH17 crash site touches down in the Netherlands. (AAP) A plane carrying remains of victims from the MH17 crash site in eastern Ukraine has flown back to the Netherlands as Malaysian experts joined the international probe at the crash site. Ukraine's government said the plane was taking the latest remains found by the search operation, as well as DNA and belongings that had been kept in the rebel-held city of Donetsk for some time. Before Monday's flight, 227 coffins had been taken to the Netherlands -- which suffered the most casualties in the July 17 crash -- for the painstaking identification process. But Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, head of the Dutch police mission in Ukraine said Sunday: \\"We expect that there will be more flights to the Netherlands in the near future.\\" A total of 298 passengers and crew were killed when the Malaysia Airlines jet -- flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur -- was blown out of the sky almost three weeks ago. The probe into the crash -- the second plane disaster involving Malaysia Airlines this year -- has been repeatedly delayed because of fighting in the region between government forces and pro-Moscow separatist fighters. The US says insurgents shot down the plane with a surface-to-air missile likely supplied by Russia, but Moscow and the rebels blame the Ukrainian military. Malaysian experts have also joined Dutch and Australian police for the first time as they continued combing the area for traces of the victims, according to a statement from the Dutch security and justice ministry. The experts were briefly prevented from accessing the rebel-held site but eventually let through, according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has been monitoring the situation in Ukraine and has monitors accompanying the experts. \\"Work has resumed at the MH17 crash site by 100-plus experts,\\" it tweeted. Sniffer dogs were accompanying the experts, it had said. In all, 124 experts were present at the scene and \\"planned to explore two fields west of the crash site,\\" the government in Kiev said in separate statement. In a statement posted on his Facebook page, Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai vowed that arrangements to repatriate the bodies of its citizens killed in the crash would be made \\"once bodies have been identified and the necessary forensic work completed\\". \\"Efforts to locate and identify victims of the MH17 tragedy continue,\\" he added, noting that a national day of mourning would be organised once all remains of the Malaysian victims have returned home.

Process: - A satellite&#x27;s need is determined - A group of people work to design a satellite capable of accomplishing the need - A team designs the physical structure of the satellite - A crew builds the physical satellite - The satellite is packed into a capsule - The satellite capsule is loaded onto a rocket - The rocket is launched into space.  Question: suppose a bigger satellite is designed happens, how will it affect MORE or LARGER satelites in space.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"Suppose a bigger satellite is designed, this will likely have the following effects on MORE or LARGER satellites in space: 1. Space congestion: More larger satellites could lead to space congestion, as they occupy more volume in their orbits. This could increase the risk of space collisions between satellites and other space debris. As a result, there could be a need for better tracking and management of satellites. Effect: More. 2. Signal interference: Larger satellites might have more powerful transmitters or receivers. This could potentially cause signal interference with other satellites operating on similar frequencies if not managed properly. Effect: More. 3. Launch costs: Bigger satellites generally require larger, more powerful rockets to launch them into orbit. This could lead to increased launch costs for these bigger satellites. Effect: More. 4. Maintenance and decommissioning: Larger satellites might have more complex systems and components that may require additional maintenance or could be more difficult to decommission once their operational life is over. This could lead to added costs and logistical challenges. Effect: More. 5. Orbit availability and allocation: If more, larger satellites are launched into space, this might limit the availability of desired orbits and require stricter allocation of orbits to accommodate these larger satellites. Effect: More. Perturbation in the design or size of a bigger satellite can influence the second effect mentioned—signal interference. For example, if the size and design of the satellite cause it to have a more powerful transmitter or receiver, the potential for signal interference with nearby satellites may increase, particularly if the frequencies used by these satellites are not managed properly. In this case, the perturbation in the design can lead to a \\"more\\" effect on signal interference. However, if proper frequency management and coordination are implemented, signal interference can be minimized or avoided, leading to \\"no effect\\" on this specific consequence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The drives may let you down. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review is negative. The reviewer is expressing their dissatisfaction and disappointment with the Maxtor drives they purchased for various reasons. Firstly, the reviewer mentions that their 160GB Maxtor one-touch firewire drive suddenly stopped working after only 14 months of use. The fact that it died in such a short time indicates that the product may not be durable or reliable. Additionally, the reviewer's negative experience with Maxtor's response further supports the negative tone of the review, as they were left feeling unsupported and unassisted by the manufacturer. Secondly, the reviewer also reported issues with their 300GB Maxtor One-touch II drive, specifically mentioning a software bug in the Windows XP drivers that crashes their computer frequently. This not only highlights possible technical issues with the product but also results in major inconvenience and frustration for the reviewer. Moreover, the reviewer points out that while the drives appear stylish and are easy to use, these factors don't make up for the reliability issues they experienced. By stating, \\"don't get lulled into a false sense of security,\\" the reviewer is essentially warning potential buyers not to be deceived by the product's aesthetics and superficial qualities. In summary, the overall tone of this product review is negative, as the reviewer is sharing their negative experiences and dissatisfaction with the Maxtor drives they have purchased. Their experiences with both the product and the manufacturer's response have led them to caution potential buyers about the reliability and quality of these drives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pressing down on the gas pedal gives the car more gas and causes the car to speed up. Letting up on the gas pedal gives the car less gas and causes the car to slow down. Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force.  Paragraph: Eric is driving on a highway. His exit is coming up soon so he let's up on the gas a little and makes a left turn onto the exit. After a short way he pulls into a parking lot reaching his destination.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the album \\"Death of a Clown\\" was on?  The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\". The songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \\"Death of a Clown\\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \\"Autumn Almanac\\", in early October. Backed with \\"Mister Pleasant\\", the single became another Top 5 success for the group.... The answer is:","output":"The album that the song \\"Death of a Clown\\" is on is called \\"Something Else By The Kinks\\". This album, released in 1967, developed the musical progressions of a previous album by the group, \\"Face to Face\\". \\"Death of a Clown\\" was a significant UK chart success for Dave Davies, who co-wrote the song with bandmate Ray Davies.

I know that the answer to the question \\"what was william gladstone considered?\\" is in \\"The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke \\"a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America\\" and in his diary recorded: \\"Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine\\". The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \\"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \\"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site\\".

Summarize this article: Check with your state or national government's business regulatory agency to find out what type of licensing is required for you to practice as an independent sales rep in your area. Make your business as professional as possible:  Design a simple logo or ask for help from graphic designer friends. Hand out business cards and other informational materials that are appropriate for your industry. Create a website that lists your available products, credentials, and contact information. Set up and manage social networking accounts. Contribute to industry-related online forums, and create a blog. Be sure to include a link back to your website in all of your forum, blog and social networking posts. Always be on the lookout for more potential buyers and new markets. Keep yourself educated about your chosen industry so that you can be a more competitive and attractive potential sales agent for both manufacturers and buyers.  Attend conferences, seminars and trade shows related to the industry you are interested in and approach vendors about possible independent sales opportunities. Attend networking events. Find events related to your industry in the local classifieds, in the community section of classifieds sites like Craigslist and on websites like Meetup.com. Meet as many people as you can, hand out business cards and follow-up with useful contacts. Advertise your independent sales rep offerings in newspapers, magazines, trade publications, classifieds websites and industry-related web directories. For example, if you choose to represent a computer hardware manufacturer, you can advertise in technology magazines and in the technology section of your local newspaper.

Use these estimates to decide how many sub-agents you should hire. Set specific goals for your new hires and their assigned accounts. Using your past income, forecast conservative expectations for commissions generated. When added sub-agents to your business, focus on customer service. Make sure that anyone you add to your team will deliver the same high quality service that brought you success.

Out of all the given options (grocery store, refrigerator, freezer, plate, and supermarket), a freezer is the most appropriate choice to achieve this purpose by preserving the cabbage's freshness and preventing spoilage. When comparing the options, the grocery store and supermarket are not suitable choices, as the question assumes that the individual already possesses the cabbage and does not need a location to purchase it from. These options also do not provide any means to maintain its freshness or prevent spoilage. A plate is also not the right choice since leaving the cabbage on a plate at room temperature would not actively contribute to preserving its quality. Over time, the cabbage may begin to deteriorate and spoil. Between the refrigerator and the freezer, the freezer is the preferred option in this context. While the refrigerator does provide a cool environment suitable for storing various foods, it may not be sufficient to prevent spoilage over an extended period. Refrigerators maintain a temperature above freezing, meaning that the cabbage will remain fresh for a shorter time compared to when it is stored in the freezer. In contrast, a freezer typically keeps the temperature below the freezing point, which helps slow down the processes that lead to spoilage, such as bacterial growth and enzymatic reactions in the cabbage. Freezing the cabbage also preserves its texture, color, and nutritional value for extended periods – often months or even longer if properly wrapped and sealed. In conclusion, a human would choose the \\"freezer\\" option when trying to find the best solution to prevent cabbage spoilage. The freezer's ability to maintain a temperature below the freezing point aids in preserving the freshness and prolonging the cabbage's shelf life, making it the most effective choice among the options provided."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Euroopan unionin on tällä hetkellä noudatettava useita kansainvälisiä sopimuksia, jotka sääntelevät yhteisön laivaston toimintaa eri merialueilla. Näiden sopimusten tarkoituksena on varmistaa kestävä kalastus sekä suojella merellistä ympäristöä, luonnonvaroja ja monimuotoisuutta.

Mikäli Euroopan unioni joutuisi luopumaan näistä sopimuksista äkillisesti, seuraukset olisivat merkittävät sekä Euroopan että kansainvälisellä tasolla.

Your USB flash drive should plug into one of the rectangular or oval USB or USB-C ports on your computer's housing. Traditional flash drives only fit one way, so don't force the drive if it doesn't fit.  If your Mac uses USB-C ports, your USB-C flash drive should fit any way in which you insert it. The USB flash drive should be at least 8 gigabytes in space so that it can accommodate most operating system installation files. If you want to create a bootable USB drive on a Mac, you'll need to have an ISO file (or an image file, if you're backing up your computer's hard drive) ready to drag and drop into Terminal. This is different than how Windows handles bootable flash drives, since you can make a flash drive bootable and then save it for later when using Windows. Click the magnifying glass icon in the top-right corner of the screen. A search bar will appear. This will search your Mac for the Terminal application. It's a black box in the middle of the Spotlight search results. Doing so will open Terminal. Type diskutil list into Terminal, then press ⏎ Return. Look for the USB drive that you plugged into your computer, then look at the USB drive's name under the \\"IDENTIFIER\\" heading. You'll usually find your USB drive under the \\"(external, physical)\\" heading near the bottom of the Terminal window. Your USB flash drive's name under the \\"IDENTIFIER\\" heading will normally be something like \\"disk1\\" or \\"disk2\\". Type diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disknumber—making sure to replace \\"disknumber\\" with the disk's \\"IDENTIFIER\\" name and number (e.g., disk2)—into Terminal, then press ⏎ Return. Type in sudo dd if= but don't press the ⏎ Return key just yet. Click and drag the ISO file (or disk image file) that you want to boot into using the USB drive into the Terminal window. This will copy the file's address into the Terminal command. You can also type in the folder path to the ISO file. This will put a space at the end of the file's address, making room for the next command. Type in of=/dev/disknumber bs=1m, again making sure to replace \\"disknumber\\" with the USB flash drive's number (e.g., disk2), and press ⏎ Return. This is the password that you use to log into your Mac. As you type, you'll notice that the letters don't appear in Terminal; this is normal. Doing so submits your password and prompts your Mac to begin creating a bootable USB flash drive with your selected ISO or image file. This process can take several hours to complete, so just leave Terminal open and your Mac plugged in. Summary:","output":"This article provides step-by-step instructions on creating a bootable USB flash drive on a Mac using Terminal and an ISO or image file, with a minimum requirement of an 8GB USB flash drive to accommodate most operating system installation files."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a new situation: Big continent used more air polluting substances, while Small continent was very protective towards the environment. Big continent got a hole in its ozone layer as a consequence of their actions.  But I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  What is an answer for this question: Which continent used more chlorine gasses?

Abstract: Systematic literature reviews are widely used as an aid to evidence based decision making. For example, reviews of randomised controlled trials are regularly used to answer questions about the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. The high profile of systematic reviews as a cornerstone of evidence based medicine, however, has led to several misconceptions about their purpose and methods. Among these is the belief that systematic reviews are applicable only to randomised controlled trials and that they are incapable of dealing with other forms of evidence, such as from non-randomised studies or qualitative research.   The systematic literature review is a method of locating, appraising, and synthesising evidence. The value of regularly updated systematic reviews in the assessment of effectiveness of healthcare interventions was dramatically illustrated by Antman and colleagues, who showed that review articles failed to mention advances in treatment identified by an updated systematic review.1  It is nearly a quarter of a century since Gene Glass coined the term “meta-analysis” to refer to the quantitative synthesis of the results of primary studies.2 The importance of making explicit efforts to limit bias in the review of literature, however, has been emphasised by social scientists at least since the 1960s.3 In recent years systematic reviews have found an important role in health services research, and the growing interest in evidence based approaches to decision making makes it likely that their use will increase. Not everybody accepts that systematic reviews are necessary or desirable, and as one moves further away from the clinical applications of systematic reviews cynicism about their utility grows. Several arguments are commonly used to reject a wider role for systematic reviews, and these arguments are often based on major misconceptions about the history, purpose, methods, and uses of systematic reviews. I have examined eight common myths about ….

The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since.

He ignored them and instead followed the advice of his mentor, the Dalai Lama, who told him to meditate. It took the better part of a year, but the gangrene eventually disappeared. Now, a group of doctors at NYU has begun studying the lama's brain as he meditates to see if they can shed light on any possible connections. The lama is expert at Tsa Lung meditation, whose practitioners visualize a wind moving through the body and removing impurities, writes Maureen Seaberg. A medical anthropologist involved in the study writes: Research shows that mental imagery directed to sites of the body, both superficial as well as deeper tissues, can with practice eventually lead to increased local blood flow, metabolic activity, and oxygenation. Such increases could in principle combat even powerful bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, which not only can be the cause of gangrene, but is now often times resistant to antibiotics.” Full story here.","output":"Doctors in New York University are studying the brain of a Tibetan lama whose gangrene miraculously disappeared after he meditated instead of amputating his leg, as three American doctors advised.

Because the discs were read optically instead of magnetically, no physical contact needs to be made between the player and the disc, except for the player's clamp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read. As a result, playback would not wear the informationbearing part of the discs, and properly manufactured LDs would theoretically last beyond one's lifetime. By contrast, a VHS tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which is in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum, causing progressive wear with each use (though later in VHS's lifespan, engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact). Also, the tape was thin and delicate, and it was easy for a player mechanism, especially on a low quality or malfunctioning model, to mishandle the tape and damage it by creasing it, frilling (stretching) its edges, or even breaking it.

Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow.

With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by nowabandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas.

France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India.

Context: Translation is the process by which a mature mRNA molecule is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein.:6.2 Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must folds to their active threedimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.:3; Question: How many unpaired bases does each tRNA have?; Answer","output":"Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon."},{"instruction":"Goal: mechanical pencil Which is the correct ending? is much more visible on paper than any glue is much more visible on paper than any highlighter Answer","output":"Neither ending is related to the goal of a mechanical pencil.
