Would \\"Research suggests that pedophilia may be correlated with several different neurological abnormalities, and often co-exists with other personality disorders and psychological pathologies.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"The question seems to be asking about the age of a child involved in a pedophile crime and whether the provided statement about research on pedophilia is a reasonable answer to that question. The question's phrasing is unclear, but I will try to address both the age and research aspects separately. First, let us address the age of a child involved in a pedophile crime. Pedophilia is the primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children, typically under the age of 13. A pedophile crime occurs when an adult engages in sexual activity, grooming, or exploitation with a child who falls within that age range. Laws and age limits related to child sexual exploitation can vary depending on the country, but generally, any case where an adult engages in inappropriate sexual conduct with a minor falls under this category. As for the research statement provided: 'Research suggests that pedophilia may be correlated with several different neurological abnormalities, and often co-exists with other personality disorders and psychological pathologies.' This is indeed a reasonable statement, as multiple studies have shown correlations between pedophilia and neurological abnormalities or other psychological conditions. Pedophilia is considered a paraphilic disorder, which means that it is characterized by persistent and intense sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors that involve unusual situations, objects, or activities. Although the exact causes of pedophilia are still not completely understood, several factors and conditions have been associated with it. Research has shown that pedophiles may have structural differences in the brain and exhibit abnormal brain circuits that can influence their sexual attraction to children. Some studies have reported that pedophiles have lower IQs, higher rates of head injuries during childhood, cognitive impairments, and altered neurodevelopmental pathways compared to non-pedophilic individuals. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that pedophiles may have been exposed to physical, emotional, or sexual abuse during their childhood. This may contribute to the development of personality disorders or other psychological issues that can coexist with pedophilia, such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. In conclusion, while the provided statement does not directly address the age of a child involved in a pedophile crime, it is a reasonable answer in terms of discussing research on the possible causes and associations of pedophilia. It is important to understand the underlying factors that contribute to pedophilic tendencies in order to better address the issue and create more effective prevention and intervention strategies."},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: The Japanese Touring Car Championship, was a former touring car racing series held in Japan, the series was held under various regulations during its existence, including international categories such as Group A, was a set of motorsport regulations introduced by which organization, covering production-derived vehicles intended for outright competition in Touring car racing and Rallying?

Amy loved being around people but Maria found it exhausting, so","output":"they often found it challenging to balance their differing social tendencies. Amy thrived in social connections, whereas Maria cherished solitude and quiet moments. Despite these differences, their bond was strong. They were inseparable throughout college and after graduation, they chose to live together. Yet their contrasting personalities often led to an interesting dynamic in their shared space. Amy would frequently invite friends over for lively gatherings. These get-togethers were a rainbow of laughter and chatter, of opinions colliding and ideas being shared, and Amy reveled in them. She would be at the center of the action, cooking up a storm, her laughter booming, her hands continuously moving, whether expressing a point or pouring another round of drinks. When she was around people, Amy's energy was unstoppable. She loved listening to her friends' stories, loved being the person people turned to, and most of all, she loved the exhilarating charge she got from being in the middle of it all. Maria, on the other hand, found it draining. She equated her energy levels to the drained battery symbol she'd see on her phone after a long day. Unlike Amy, she found the constant company of others tiring. She needed time to recharge, time to be by herself and with her thoughts. Maria often found solace in the calm glow of a reading lamp, accompanied by the rustle of turning pages of her favorite book, the soft hum of her playlist playing in the backdrop, and the occasional sips of her hot tea. Their shared apartment began to symbolize a blend of these starkly contrasting worlds. One half of it brimmed with liveliness, echoes of which could be heard in the hearty laughs that filled Amy's room. The other half was a sanctuary of serenity, with the silence occasionally broken by the flipping of pages and soft melodies in Maria's space. Regardless of their differences in temperament, Amy and Maria possessed a remarkable understanding of each other's needs. Amy, although she loved parties, understood Maria's need for personal time. Instead of forcing Maria to mingle, Amy allocated a quiet room during her parties or occasions where Maria could retreat to whenever the social activities got too intimidating. This empathetic gesture helped maintain a comfortable environment for Maria even during Amy's bustling gatherings. Maria, in return, respected Amy's need for social interplay. Even if she found it draining, she would make an effort to attend Amy's parties and engage in small moments of interaction. She would chip in with the cooking or setting up the party, offering her support to Amy. They had a rule - if Maria felt overwhelmed, Amy would not hold it against her if she needed to leave the party early. They found a rhythm, an ebb and flow, that turned their seemingly opposite personalities into harmonious coexistence. After all, differences do not always lead to discord. More often, they lead to learning, understanding, and mutual respect, something Amy and Maria learned to embody. They made room for each other's preferences, creating an environment that was equally comforting for both - something Amy loved and something from which Maria did not withdraw into exhaustion. Living with someone so different had its challenges, but Amy and Maria found ways to balance their differing social tendencies, proving that the basic foundation of any relationship relies on the ability to understand, respect and value each other's individuality."},{"instruction":"Read this: Jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets.

Six teams from each of the league's two conferences qualify for the playoffs based on regular season records, and a tie-breaking procedure exists in the case of equal records. The tournament ends with the Super Bowl, the league's championship game, which matches the two conference champions. Is it true that can two teams from the same division play in the super bowl?","output":"It is not true that two teams from the same division can play in the Super Bowl. The reason for this lies in the structure of the playoffs and how the teams are organized within the NFL. The NFL is divided into two conferences: the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC). Each conference consists of four divisions with four teams in each, totaling 16 teams per conference and 32 teams in the league. The Super Bowl is the championship game that is played between the winner of the AFC and the winner of the NFC. The playoffs are organized to ensure that the AFC and NFC champions represent different divisions and conferences, making it impossible for two teams from the same division to face each other in the Super Bowl. The playoff structure is as follows: 1. The six teams that qualify for the playoffs from each conference include the four division winners and two representatives with the best records among the remaining non-divisional winners, called wildcard teams. 2. The playoffs begin with the first round, called the Wild Card round, where the third-seeded division winner plays the sixth-seeded wildcard team, and the fourth-seeded division winner plays the fifth-seeded wildcard team in each conference. 3. The two winning teams from the Wild Card round move on to the Divisional round. In the Divisional round, the first-seeded division winner (with the best overall record) hosts the lowest-seeded team from the Wild Card round, and the second-seeded division winner hosts the other team from the Wild Card round. 4. The winners of the Divisional round advance to the Conference Championship games, where the remaining teams in the AFC face off in the AFC Championship, and the remaining teams in the NFC face off in the NFC Championship. 5. The winners of the AFC Championship and the NFC Championship then compete in the Super Bowl to determine the NFL champion. Given the structure of the playoffs, it would not be possible for two teams from the same division to meet in the Super Bowl. They may, however, face each other during the earlier rounds of the playoffs if they both qualify, but once a team moves to the Conference Championship game, it is guaranteed that the team it faces in the Super Bowl comes from the other conference."},{"instruction":"For their last road game of the season, in week 16 the Lions traveled west to San Francisco to play the San Francisco 49ers.

Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East.

Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse.

Article: \\"Avoid the rush hour\\" must be the slogan of large cities all over the world. Wherever you look it's people, people, people. The trains which leave or arrive every few minutes are packed. The streets are so crowded; there is hardly room to move on the pavements. It takes ages for a bus to get to you because the traffic on the roads has almost come to a standstill. Even when a bus does at last arrive, it's so full, it can't take any more passengers. The smallest unexpected event can bring about conditions of complete chaos. The strange thing is not that people stand these conditions, but that they actually choose them in preference to anything else. Large modern cites are too big to control. People living there are forced by their environment to take a wholly unnatural way of life. They lost touch with the land and rhythm of nature. It is possible to live in such an air-conditioned existence in a large city that you can hardly tell the season. A few flowers in a public park may remind you that it is spring or summer. All the simple, good things of life like sunshine and fresh air are hard to find. Even the distinction between days and nights is lost. The funny thing about it all is that you pay dearly to live in a city. The demand for accommodation is so great that it is often impossible for ordinary people to buy a house of their own.

Here are possible answers to this question: - china - town - texas - new york - japan I believe the correct choice is \\"japan\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice indeed is Japan. Here's why: Kobe steak refers to a luxury beef product that comes from the Tajima-gyu cattle, a specific strain of the Japanese Black breed. These cattle are raised and produced exclusively in the Hyogo Prefecture of Japan, in which Kobe city is the capital. The name \\"Kobe\\" itself is an internationally renowned term for this highly sought-after and memorable product that originates from this specific region in Japan. Therefore, choosing \\"Japan\\" as the source of steakhouse Kobe from the options given is an accurate answer. The distinct taste and quality of Kobe steak can be attributed to various factors, such as stringent breeding and raising practices, the cattle's genetics, and the environment they are raised in. The thorough care and attention given to these cattle result in a well-marbled, tender, and succulent meat, which melts in the mouth and has a unique flavor that distinguishes it from other types of beef. Now, let's rule out the other options: 1. China: Although China does produce and consume a significant amount of beef, it does not have the specific Tajima-gyu cattle that are required to produce Kobe steak. Therefore, steakhouse Kobe cannot originate from China. 2. Town: This option does not provide a clear or specific location, making it an invalid choice for determining the source of steakhouse Kobe. 3. Texas: While Texas is known for its cattle ranching and beef production in the United States, it is not the source of Kobe steak. Although some high-quality Wagyu (Japanese beef) genetics have been imported into the United States, the Tajima-gyu strain that is required for creating Kobe steak is exclusive to Japan. Additionally, while Texas may serve Kobe-style or American Wagyu beef, it cannot be labeled as authentic Kobe steak from Japan. 4. New York: Similar to Texas, New York is not the source of steakhouse Kobe, given that the meat is a product exclusive to the Hyogo Prefecture in Japan. It is possible that high-end restaurants in New York may serve Kobe-style or American Wagyu, but the actual Kobe steak can only come from Japan. In conclusion, out of the available options, it can be confidently stated that Japan is the correct choice for the source of steakhouse Kobe. The combination of the Tajima-gyu cattle, unique raising practices, and the specialties of the Hyogo Prefecture make this region the only place where authentic Kobe steak can be produced."},{"instruction":"Jürgen Melzer (born 22 May 1981 in Vienna) is an Austrian tennis player.

In a multi-pitch route, climbers ascend by individually climbing separate sections, or pitches, to reach the summit. Each pitch is usually between 30 to 60 meters (100 to 200 feet) long, limited by the length of the climbing rope and available anchor points. After completing a pitch, the leader sets up an anchor and belays the second climber (or follower) who ascends and removes the protection gear placed by the leader.

The setting then changes to the present day, where Deloris (now going by the surname Van Cartier) is a lounge singer in a 1960s-themed act called The Ronelles (a parody of The Ronettes), who sing at The Moonlite Lounge of the Nevada Club in Reno, Nevada, run by her boyfriend, the mobster Vince LaRocca. After Deloris walks in on Vince having his chauffeur Ernie executed for betrayal, Vince orders his two henchmen Joey and Willy to kill her as well. Deloris flees Vince's casino to the local police station where Lieutenant Eddie Souther suggests she testify against Vince if he can be arrested and tried, but for now, she should go into witness protection until the time comes. Deloris is taken to St. Katherine's Parish in a seedy, run-down neighborhood of San Francisco, where Souther suggests she take refuge in the attached convent. Both Deloris and the stoic Reverend Mother object, but are convinced by Souther and Monsignor O'Hara to go ahead with it. Deloris 'becomes' a nun â habit and all â under the hand of Reverend Mother, who gives her the religious name 'Sister Mary Clarence' to complete the disguise. Mary Clarence objects to following the strictures and simple life of the convent, but comes to befriend several of the nuns, including the forever jolly Sister Mary Patrick, quiet and meek Sister Mary Robert, and the elderly deadpan Sister Mary Lazarus. After sneaking into a nearby bar, Mary Clarence is chastised by Reverend Mother and put into the choir, which she has seen to be dreadful.

Among the possible answers you've provided, the most fitting one is \\"failure.\\" Here's why: 1. Success: While some individuals might be afraid of the consequences of being successful, in the context of the question, fear of success is not a common cause of stress for the majority of students preparing for final exams. 2. Graduation: Graduation symbolizes the completion of an educational program and is typically a source of pride and accomplishment. In the context of final exams, one may worry about not meeting graduation requirements, but the fear of graduation itself is not the critical stress factor. 3. Failure (correct choice): Many students, while studying for final exams, might be afraid of failing their tests. This fear predominantly arises from concerns about academic performance, the potential for negative consequences (e.g., delayed graduation, loss of scholarship, or impact on future job prospects), or feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy. 4. Anxiety: Anxiety could be both a cause and a result of the stress associated with studying for final exams. While the fear of anxiety itself might contribute to the stress, it is not the central reason for students' nervousness when preparing for finals. Instead, anxiety is typically caused by deeper concerns, such as a fear of failure. 5. Studying: Some students may not enjoy the process of studying, but the act itself is not the main cause of the stress related to final exams. Rather, the stress comes from the desire to perform well on the tests, meet expectations, and avoid negative outcomes. In summary, the fear of failure is the most appropriate choice, as it encompasses the core reason why students feel stressed and nervous about their final exams. The fear of failure links to concerns about personal and academic repercussions resulting from poor performance on these crucial assessments."},{"instruction":"Data: name = Wildwood, eatType = pub, food = Fast food, priceRange = £20-25, customer rating = high.

A good headshot is critical to getting roles. Casting directors may see your headshot and call you in for auditions. Look online for photographers that specialize in headshots in your area and give them a call to schedule an appointment. Headshots exist to inform the casting director of your look, age, and who you are. Make sure to get makeup and hair done before the headshot so you look your best. Consider including a shot that shows your natural apprentice too. Professional level headshots can be expensive and range anywhere from 400 - 1,200 (US Dollars) Be as natural as you can in your headshot, and avoid over-editing or makeup so the casting director knows what to expect when you audition. A good agent will have existing network connections in the industry and be able to get you auditions for roles that you wouldn't be able to get yourself. Set up meetings with management agencies and talk to different people in the industry to get referrals. Agents also negotiate pay in some circumstances as well. Many agents charge you 10% of your earnings. Agents also help you prepare for auditions and can impart useful knowledge about a career in acting to you. Make sure to thoroughly look through any contract with an attorney or similar qualified professional before signing any agreements or contracts. Networking in the acting industry is critically important and it can help you land roles if you know the right people. Make sure to keep in touch with directors and other actors and actresses and you may be the first in mind for a specific role. Remember to be pleasant and be easy to work with and talk with. If you get a bad reputation, it may make it harder for your to get auditions. Many actors will continue to work with the same people through their career. Never turn down the opportunity to attend a meeting to talk about a potential role or a new project someone is working on. You won’t get all of the roles you audition for, but it doesn’t mean you should throw in the towel. Continue to hone your craft and network in the industry, and you’ll eventually you’ll be able to become a famous actress. Matt Le Blanc struggled to land a role for years before he ended up on the hit show “Friends” in 1994. If you keep getting rejected for the same roles, try to switch up the types of roles you’re auditioning for. Agent workshops or showcases are opportunities for actors to showcase their skills in front of casting directors or producers. Actors attend these workshops and do read scripts to potentially land roles in the future. Make sure that when you attend one of these workshops you’re dressed well and you’ve prepared a monologue. There are sometimes open opportunities for actors to land a role in a movie or play depending on where you live. Most open casting calls require the actor have a head shot, and a resume of past performance. Starting as an extra will give you insight into film production and performance. Don’t turn these opportunities down. Don’t turn down opportunities to do commercials. Dakota Fanning, Farrah Fawcett, and Jodie Foster all starred in commercials before hitting the big screen.","output":"To become a famous actress, invest in a professional headshot, secure a good agent, network within the industry, attend auditions and workshops, be open to various roles such as commercials and extras, and continuously hone your craft."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: On my first day in America, I was excited, but nervous as well.

Analyze the words and phrases in the sentence and their connotations. 2. Assess the context (if available) in which the sentence is used. 3. Determine the overall sentiment based on the analysis. Step 1: Analyze the words and phrases in the sentence and their connotations. - The word \\"torrent\\" usually implies a large or overwhelming amount, which can be neutral or negative in context. - The phrase \\"of emotion\\" suggests strong feelings, which can be neutral but indicates intensity. Step 2: Assess the context (if available) in which the sentence is used. - There is no context available for this sentence, so I cannot use it to determine whether it refers to positive or negative emotions. Step 3: Determine the overall sentiment based on the analysis. - Based on the analysis in Step 1, the sentiment of the sentence might lean towards a negative connotation due to the overwhelming nature of a \\"torrent.\\" However, without context, it still remains somewhat neutral, as the emotion could be of any kind. Conclusion: The sentiment of the sentence \\"a torrent of emotion\\" is neutral with a slight tendency towards negative, as it conveys an overwhelming amount of emotion but does not specify whether that emotion is positive or negative."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Bunker Hill Military Academy has just concluded another school year.

Bache also reflects on the time when he was a West Point cadet (Moreland's intended college), as well as a graduate of BHMA prior to that, and how he dreads civilian life with his forthcoming retirement. Moreland is congratulated first by his best friend Cadet Captain Alex Dwyer (Sean Penn), as well as his other friends: Cadet Captain David Shawn (Tom Cruise) and Cadet Lieutenant Edward West (Evan Handler). Shawn leads a celebration in the hallway. The commencement is celebrated by a parade and pass and review. Following the ceremonies, General Bache announces that BHMA's board of trustees is selling the school to real estate developers; however, they will remain open for one more year in order to allow the seniors to graduate and give the underclassmen time to apply to other schools. The delay gives many cadets hope that BHMA - which many of them consider home - can be saved. Bache also expresses his hope that the institute can be saved, as he wryly remarks to Moreland \\"We are here, and the condos are not\\". The graduation ceremony is also honored with a ball that evening.

Premise: - The artist's tomb was installed in the church in 1919. According to the premise, an artist's tomb was placed within the church in 1919. The fact states when and where the tomb was installed, but it does not provide additional details such as the artist's identity, level of fame, or the reason behind the artist being commemorated in such a manner. Therefore, while it can be confirmed that the church has an artist's tomb from 1919, further data is needed to draw further conclusions about the tomb's significance or level of attraction. Hypothesis: - The church has an artist's tomb, a popular attraction. The hypothesis stipulates that the artist's tomb is a popular attraction at the church. While this hypothesis may be plausible, it is essential to evaluate additional factors to confirm its validity. Popularity and attractiveness could be determined by the artist's reputation, artistic achievements, or connection to the church. The tomb's design and characteristics could also play a role in its popularity. Based on the available information from the premise alone, it is not possible to conclusively state that the hypothesis is true.

The imagery may be regal enough – but the so-called ‘blood’ is in fact a magical ‘paint’ designed to resemble the ancient body-colouring, wode. Within seconds it fades and disappears, leaving only a scent behind. The promotion has been created, in fact, to showcase ‘Wode’, the new perfume from the British designers of Boudicca, the avant-garde label which takes its name from Queen Boudicca (aka Boadicea). Boudicca, Queen of the Iceni tribe, is famous for having led an uprising against the occupying force of the Roman Empire in AD 60/61 and legend has it she and her tribe of warriors wore a cobalt blue paint on their skin, which gave them a ferocious and mythical look when advancing into battle. When finally defeated by the Romans, Boudicca killed herself by swallowing hemlock – an extract of which is actually included in the new Boudicca perfume. ‘Wode’, given its ancient, tribal inspirations, is suitably strange and spicy, containing herbal notes of juniper berry, cardamon, nutmeg, clary sage, coriander seed, angelica root, hints of black hemlock extract, saffron, treemoss and tuberose, among others. ‘Wode’, packed in a classic spray paint can, is available in a ‘paint’, a lighter version of the scent, at £65, and as a scent, £75, from Browns Focus, South Molton Street, London, W1; 020 7514 0063; and from www.boudiccawode.com The Boudicca label was started by the London-based design duo of Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby in 1997 and began showing at London Fashion Week in 2001. Boudicca then became the first independent British fashion house to be officially invited to be a guest member of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in Paris.

One of the existing programs is at Georgia Tech's Tennenbaum Institute, which has a primary focus on enterprise solutions for the health care and manufacturing sectors, but also offers a sports analytics track. Lewis believes the growth curve will accelerate. Lewis explained that in the history of sports analystics, at least in its early days, candidates came from consulting and other industries where they already worked with analytics and could show how their expertise could be applied to sports. An oft-cited example goes all the way back to the 1980s when San Francisco 49ers guru Bill Walsh hired a Bain executive to bring data into the world of player analysis. Lewis, who worked at the NBA league office before joining the Nationals, said that the basketball league was early among sports' head offices in disseminating data analytics and best practices, but other league offices have now emulated it, with data-driven decision-making tied to main revenue drivers. They include ticket pricing and sales, attendance, in-game purchases and sponsorships—not to mention the player analysis side. (Read more: Sexiest Job of the 21st century: Data analyst) \\"The goal of the class is to show the contribution that can be made with analytics, making the best informed decisions,\\" Lewis said. \\"On the player statistics side of the business, analytics has been fairly prominent and then there is the business side. That's the challenge of this class, to show the valuable contribution that can be made, if students do want to go down this route professionally,\\" Lewis added. In Lewis' previous sports marketing course, the focus was typically on how to message fans and advertise to them—building on traditional customer relationship management to grow individuals as fans and customers. Sports analytics, though related to that goal, focuses on hard data. \\"You could have an entire course just on 'Moneyball,' \\" Lewis said, but the goal is to take what's already been done on the player management side of the business and create case studies for the consumer side of the business. Customer profiling is something that has already paid for the Nationals—knowing who their fans are and knowing how they define value is not only critical, but it's something that changes faster than you think, Lewis said. Analytics allows the team to know how and where to most effectively reach the fan. And ultimately, a person has to sift through numerous data points. Even though there are systems set up to recommend certain prices for a ticket—what is known as dynamic pricing—Lewis said it is still very important to look at a number of factors that tie into attendance and whether any price should be changed, and the variables change as a game approaches. \\"We could have an entire discussion about games we were able to predict well and games that caught us by surprise attendance-wise,\\" Lewis said. In Las Vegas, profiling of the casino patron to increase their buying behavior is already a major focus of companies like Caesars Entertainment. \\"We are the youngest professional franchise in the MLB and for us the emphasis is on building a fan base. We have grown our fan base at a double-digit percentage three straight years,\\" Lewis said. A growing fan base translates into a growing revenue base. Yet Lewis says one of the biggest challenges will be gauging the return on investment from sports analytics. If it is to become a serious discipline with business schools and a significant career opportunity for MBAs, the ROI question will have to be answered with, no surprise, hard data. Nascar, for example, which has implemented what it dubs a \\"big data\\" initiative, says it is not even looking at the effort as a \\"bottom line\\" item yet. The bottom line will meet somewhere between the data and the human analyst interpreting it. \\"The human element is still important. No system can run on its own,\\" Lewis added. \\"I believe this about all industries: There is a lack of appreciation for impact that people on 'the line' can have to the bottom line of the company,\\" Jennings said. And on the sidelines of professional sports fields, too.

Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The given data presents various information about Alvah Sabin and his connection to Vermont, specifically its 3rd congressional district. The data also provides details about Vermont's largest city and Alvah Sabin's birth and death places. In the following paragraphs, I will provide a detailed description of this data. Alvah Sabin was an American political figure who was born on November 21, 1793, in Georgia, Vermont. Georgia is a town located in the northern part of the state, within Franklin County. The data indicates that Alvah Sabin was associated with Vermont's 3rd congressional district where he held the position of a representative. The 3rd congressional district of Vermont was a historical district which existed from 1813 to 1843, during which the state sent three separate representatives to the U.S. House of Representatives. Alvah Sabin was elected as a Whig from 1843 to 1847, and then as a member of the Free Soil Party from 1847 to 1849. During his time in office, Alvah Sabin would have participated in the legislative process, representing the interests of the constituents in his district. The data also highlights that Vermont's largest city is Burlington. Located in Chittenden County on the shores of Lake Champlain, Burlington is the most populous city in the state, with a population of approximately 42,000 residents. It is known for its vibrant arts scene, historic architecture, and beautiful natural surroundings. Some of the major attractions in Burlington include the Church Street Marketplace, the University of Vermont, and the ECHO, Leahy Center for Lake Champlain. As the largest city in Vermont, Burlington serves as an economic and cultural hub, providing residents and visitors with numerous opportunities for recreation, education, and employment. Returning to Alvah Sabin, the data points out that he was a resident of the state of Vermont throughout his life. Given his birthplace in Georgia, Vermont, and his involvement in Vermont's 3- congressional district, it can be inferred that Alvah Sabin had strong connections with the state. He would have been familiar with the geographical, political, and socio-cultural landscape of Vermont during his time, and his work as a representative would likely have focused on the needs and concerns of its residents. Lastly, the data provided states that Alvah Sabin passed away in Sycamore, Illinois, on November 15, 1869. This suggests that towards the end of his life, Alvah Sabin moved away from Vermont, possibly for personal or health-related reasons. Sycamore is a city in DeKalb County, Illinois, and has a rich history that dates back to the early 19th century. Although Alvah Sabin's connection to Sycamore is not explicitly explained in the data, his final resting place stands as a testament to the life of a prominent political figure who left a lasting impact on Vermont and its people."},{"instruction":"Question 1: Will there be any difference in battery consumption of a dual sim Mobile phone if single sim or both sims are put in into it?

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\". Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Feminism\\" correctly answer the question \\"What does femme refer to?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Feminism\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"What does femme refer to?\\" based on the paragraph. In this context, 'femme' does not refer to the feminist movement or feminist theories. Instead, it is used to describe a character archetype, particularly in film noir and literature, called the 'femme fatale.' The femme fatale is typically depicted as a seductively beautiful woman whose charms ensnare her lovers and lead them into dangerous and often deadly situations. In the provided paragraph, 'femme' is being used to describe the character, Madame White Snake, in her various incarnations. Her portrayal as an enchantingly beautiful woman who holds a certain power over men, causing them to be spellbound and led astray due to her appearance and sexual allure, aligns her with this archetype. Therefore, 'femme' in this context refers to the dangerous, seductive woman archetype rather than the concept or theories of feminism. The depiction of Madame White Snake captures elements of the femme fatale archetypal character: she is dangerously attractive, lures men with her sexual attractiveness, and her beauty often results in the male characters' downfall or distraction. She embodies a complex characterisation that often leaves the male characters and the audience in a state of bewilderment regarding her true nature, a characteristic feature of the femme fatale character as noted by Christine Gledhill in her feminist analysis of noir film. So, based on the given paragraph, the 'femme' aspect of Madame White Snake clearly refers to her embodiment of the femme fatale archetype in noir, rather than to any aspects of feminism as a socio-political movement or theoretical framework."},{"instruction":"(1) BareMetal OS has a build script to compile the latest code , make the needed changes , and then pull C code using the Newlib C standard library .

Sensing this, Monica quickly added, \\"But don't worry, there are other methods as well.\\" Intrigued, Katrina leaned in as Monica explained the second approach, which involved using an ad-blocking web browser. \\"There are several browsers out there, like Brave or Firefox Focus, that have built-in ad blockers,\\" Monica said, tapping her screen a few times to showcase the different browsers. \\"These web browsers prevent ads from loading when you watch a YouTube video, which means you won't see any popups.\\" Katrina seemed pleased with the alternative, but still, Monica wasn't finished yet. \\"Another option would be to use a third-party ad-blocking app or extension for your web browser. Although YouTube won't officially endorse these, they can be effective in removing popups as well.\\" Monica showed Katrina a few popular options, such as AdBlock and AdGuard. Emphasizing caution, Monica added, \\"However, you must be careful when choosing an ad blocker. Always pick a trusted, reputable one, as some might have hidden malware or other unwanted consequences.\\" \\"Now, let's explore a more specific approach,\\" Monica said with a grin. \\"You might have noticed how some videos on YouTube have a direct link to a popup-free version in the description. You can use that link to enjoy a smoother experience. If there aren't any, you can try searching for the video's title followed by 'no ads' using the YouTube search bar.\\" As Monica reached the final method, Katrina appeared eager to try them all. \\"Lastly,\\" Monica said, \\"you can download YouTube videos to your device using various apps or websites. This way, you can enjoy your favorite content offline, without any popups to bother you. Just remember to respect the creator's rights and only use this method for personal use.\\" As the tutorial concluded, Katrina thanked Monica for her thorough demonstration. \\"I didn't realize there were so many ways to avoid popup ads on YouTube!\\" Katrina exclaimed. Monica smiled and replied, \\"It's always great to have options, and now you know how to create a tailored, ad-free experience for your viewing pleasure. Just remember to watch responsibly and consider alternative ways to support creators, like engaging with their other content or purchasing merchandise.\\" With Monica's guidance, Katrina was no longer troubled by popup ads on YouTube. She was excited to explore her new-found knowledge, eager to delve into a world of uninterrupted entertainment. And as she shared her discoveries with friends and family, they, too, rejoiced in the simplicity of watching their favorite videos without distraction."},{"instruction":"If the wages of 15 workers for 6 days is 9450.

Later that day, when Sylvie's father (Tom Skeritt) picks her up, Ivy asks for a ride. At first Darrel, Sylvie's father, is reluctant, but grudgingly compromises. Ivy tells Sylvie she gets car sick and asks to ride in the front (a ruse to get near Darrel, Ivy has a bit of a fetish for older men).

The world No. 1 said he would join Nadal in boycotting the Madrid tournament next year if organizers did not restore standard red clay to the courts. \\"I want to forget this week as soon as possible and move on to the real clay courts,\\" Djokovic said. \\"It took me at least a week to try to get used to this surface and somehow find a way to win matches and play a decent level of tennis. \\"There is no discussion in my eyes, it's very simple. No blue clay for me.\\" Nadal lost to fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco on Thursday for his earliest exit in a clay-court tournament in eight years. Verdasco was routed 6-1, 6-2 by Tomas Berdych in Friday's quarterfinals. The blue clay is the brainchild of tournament owner Ion Tiriac, who claims it helps fans see the ball and creates a better viewing experience. And while Djokovic and Nadal have crashed out, Roger Federer has thrived at the tournament, beating David Ferrer 6-4, 6-4 on Friday to advance to the semifinals. The 16-time Grand Slam champion, president of the ATP Players' Council, said he sympathized with Nadal and Djokovic. \\"Yes of course, I said it from the start. It's not something we actually wanted,\\" he said. \\"I understand their frustrations. It's a bit tricky for everyone and we definitely have to look into things for next year.\\" Federer will replace Nadal at No. 2 in the rankings if he wins the tournament, thereby increasing his chances of being seeded second for the French Open. Federer, who didn't face a single break point against Ferrer, will play Tipsarevic in the semifinals, while Juan Martin del Potro meets Berdych in the other after a comfortable 6-3, 6-4 win over Alexandr Dolgopolov. Serena Williams, too, has been in blistering form in Madrid and won a battle of former No. 1s in typically ruthless style, thrashing Maria Sharapova 6-1, 6-3 . Both players were unbeaten on clay coming into the match, but Williams extended her winning streak over the Russian to seven while winning her 10th straight match. Williams said the clay was \\"extremely slippery\\" but she wouldn't join the top men's stars in skipping Madrid next year. \\"If I'm not here next year, it won't be because of the clay,\\" said the 13-time Grand Slam champion. \\"I don't think there's been any improvement in the courts over the week, but every clay court is different. \\"This is not the best court -- definitely not what they play like at Roland Garros -- but it's what they use at Madrid.\\" Williams will face Lucie Hradecka for a place in the final after the Czech qualifier upset fifth-seeded Sam Stosur 7-6 (8), 7-6 (6).

Given the question \\"What will Taylor want to do next?\\", is \\"sleep\\" a valid answer? Possible answers: a). Yes. b). No. A:","output":"a). Yes. While we cannot read Taylor's mind and know their exact intentions or desires, it is valid to assume that \\"sleep\\" could be a potential answer to the question, \\"What will Taylor want to do next?\\" There are a few reasons as to why \\"sleep\\" could be considered a valid option for Taylor after going to the gym with Kai: 1. Physical exhaustion: Engaging in a workout session, especially when trying to lose weight, can be physically challenging. Taylor and Kai may have pushed themselves during the workout, leading to fatigue and a desire to rest afterwards. 2. Muscle recovery: Sleep is crucial for muscle recovery and growth. After a workout, the body needs time to repair the muscle tissue that was stressed during the exercise. A good night's sleep can aid this process, allowing Taylor to make the most of their workout and see the results they desire. 3. Mental relaxation: Working out can be mentally taxing as well, especially if Taylor and Kai are trying to keep each other motivated and maintain focus on their weight loss goals. Some relaxation and mental downtime can be beneficial in staying committed to a long-term fitness plan. 4. Health benefits: Sleep offers numerous health benefits, including improved memory, increased focus, and better overall health. Given that Taylor is prioritizing their health by attempting to lose weight, it's reasonable to assume that they might also want to prioritize sleep for its benefits.

Many foreign armies warred against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces, yet many volunteer foreigners fought in both sides of the Russian Civil War. Other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist Green Army, the Ukrainian anarchist Black Army and Black Guards, and warlords such as Ungern von Sternberg. The most intense fighting took place from 1918 to 1920. Major military operations ended on 25 October 1922 when the Red Army occupied Vladivostok, previously held by the Provisional Priamur Government. The last enclave of the White Forces was the Ayano-Maysky District on the Pacific coast. The majority of the fighting ended in 1920 with the defeat of General Pyotr Wrangel in the Crimea, but a notable resistance in certain areas continued until 1923 (e.g., Kronstadt Uprising, Tambov Rebellion, Basmachi Revolt, and the final resistance of the White movement in the Far East).

The premise doesn't clearly state that Stephanopoulos emphasized the rape charge need to be considered at face value. The sentence suggests that Stephanopoulos rephrased the rape charge, but it doesn't clarify what his stance was on the matter or how he presented it in his rephrasing. Stephanopoulos is only mentioned as changing the format of the rape charge from a straightforward accusation to a question form. Hence, the nature of his rephrasing alters the approach, making it rather inquisitive than assertive. Rather than placing emphasis on the rape charge itself, Stephanopoulos is portrayed as questioning the pertinence of candidates' private lives. He aimed to incite a discussion or considerations about how much a candidate's personal life should matter, if at all, in their ability to serve in a public role or how such charges might impact the overall perception of the candidate. In doing so, Stephanopoulos steers away from echoing the charge verbatim or emphasizing on the gravity or the truth value of the rape charge, and focuses more on how it fits into the broader scope of evaluating a political candidate. Thus, the claim that Stephanopoulos emphasized the rape charge in such a way that it must be addressed at face value does not align with the given premise. Additionally, the premise indicates Stephanopoulos's aim to bring relevance to the broader issue of candidate's private life in relation to their public life which again makes the hypothesis incorrect. Also, the premise doesn't provides any direct evidence to support the hypothesis that \\"Stephanopoulous emphasized that the rape charge must be considered at face value.\\" In conclusion, based on the provided premise, the hypothesis is incorrect as the information from the premise cannot be used to support it, neither does the premise provide any clear indication of Stephanopoulos's stance on the rape charge. The premise clearly suggests that he questioned the relevance of candidates' private life rather than focusing on the rape charge at face value."},{"instruction":"Summarize: The photo shows the Queen with her son Prince Charles in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle.

Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools. From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.\\" Answer: A:","output":"Monks usually live in monasteries. The context indicates that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side. The reasoning behind this answer comes from directly interpreting the provided context. The narrative talks about the existence and practices of Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks, clearly indicating that these monks lived together in monasteries.

Vaughan Williams' program note for A Sea Symphony discusses how the text was to be treated as music. The composer writes, \\"The plan of the work is symphonic rather than narrative or dramatic, and this may be held to justify the frequent repetition of important words and phrases which occur in the poem. The words as well as the music are thus treated symphonically.\\" Walt Whitman's poems inspired him to write the symphony, and Whitman's use of free verse became appreciated at a time where fluidity of structure was becoming more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. This fluidity helped facilitate the non-narrative, symphonic treatment of text that Vaughan Williams had in mind. In the third movement in particular, the text is loosely descriptive and can be \\"pushed about by the music\\", some lines being repeated, some not consecutive in the written text immediately following one another in the music, and some left out entirely.Vaughan Williams was not the only composer following a non-narrative approach to his text. Mahler took a similar, perhaps even more radical approach in his Eighth Symphony, presenting many lines of the first part, \\"Veni, Creator Spiritus\\", in what music writer and critic Michael Steinberg referred to as \\"an incredibly dense growth of repetitions, combinations, inversions, transpositions and conflations\\". He does the same with Goethe's text in Part Two of the symphony, making two substantial cuts and other changes.Other works take the use of text as music still further. Vaughan Williams uses a chorus of women's voices wordlessly in his Sinfonia Antartica, based on his music for the film Scott of the Antarctic, to help set the bleakness of the overall atmosphere. While a chorus is used in the second and third movements of Glass's Seventh Symphony, also known as A Toltec Symphony, the text contains no actual words; the composer states that it is instead formed \\"from loose syllables that add to the evocative context of the overall orchestral texture\\". A:","output":"The name of the song where there is a chorus of women's voices wordlessly by the composer who was inspired by Walt Whitman is Vaughan Williams' Sinfonia Antartica.

Stream of thoughts:","output":"Given the premise, \\"Four boys jumping into a swimming pool,\\" the hypothesis \\"The boys are having fun swimming during summer break\\" may be plausible but cannot be confirmed with absolute certainty based solely on the given statement. The premise simply states that four boys are jumping into a swimming pool, which could be interpreted as an indication of enjoyment. It is a common assumption that people generally swim or engage in water-based activities for leisure and recreation. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the boys are likely having fun while swimming. However, the hypothesized context - \\"summer break\\" - cannot be confirmed by the information presented in the premise. There is no indication of when this scenario is taking place, nor that it is specifically during a summer break or holiday period. Similarly, there is no evidence clearly demonstrating that the boys' activity is purely recreational and not part of, for example, a training exercise, competition, or a simple gathering unrelated to summer break. In conclusion, while the hypothesis could be relevant based on common assumptions and experiences, we cannot definitively conclude that it is entailed by the premise without additional information."},{"instruction":"Background: Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, songwriter, singer, and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. Context: When Starr married Maureen Cox in 1965, Beatles manager Brian Epstein served as best man, with Starr's stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison as witnesses. Soon afterwards, the couple's matrimony became the subject of a US novelty song, \\"Treat Him Tender, Maureen\\", by the Chicklettes. Starr and Maureen had three children together: Zak (born 13 September 1965), Jason (born 19 August 1967) and Lee (born 11 November 1970). In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon's former home, Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there. Following Starr's repeated infidelities, the couple divorced in 1975. Maureen died from leukaemia at age 48 in 1994. In 1980, while on the set of the film Caveman, Starr met actress Barbara Bach; they were married on 27 April 1981. In 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak Starkey is also a drummer, and during his father's regular absences, he spent time with The Who's Keith Moon. Zak has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. In total, Ringo Starr has eight grandchildren - one from Zak, four from Jason and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather. Starr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh, Surrey; Los Angeles; and Monte Carlo. In the Sunday Times Rich List 2011, Starr was listed at number 56 in the UK with an estimated personal wealth of PS150 million. In 2012, Starr was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world. In 2014 Starr announced that his 200-acre Surrey estate at Rydinghurst, with its Grade II-listed Jacobean house, was for sale. However, he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King's Road, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles. In December 2015, Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items to the public via Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles. Highlights of the collection included Starr's first Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl drum kit; instruments given to him by Harrison, Lennon and Marc Bolan; and a first-pressing copy of the Beatles' White Album numbered \\"0000001\\". The auction raised over 9 million, a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation, a charity founded by Starr and Bach. In 2016, Starr expressed his support for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, explaining: \\"I thought the European Union was a great idea, but I didn't see it going anywhere lately.\\" In 2017 he described his impatience for Britain to \\"get on with\\" Brexit, declaring that \\"to be in control of your country is a good move.\\" Question: Was he ever married?.

After he removes his clothes, Marty is surprisingly exposed to a group of students who tease him in several ways, including jabbing at his crotch with a javelin, giving him an electric shock, and dunking his head into a toilet bowl. This prank ends when the students's coach comes in to find out what is happening. The students are forced to perform a vigorous workout in the gymnasium. Still, two students give Marty a marijuana joint laced with poison, which he smokes in the science lab where he is working on a chemistry project. The joint makes him so sick he runs to the men's room to vomit. While he is gone, one of the popular kids named Skip rigs the experiment to explode in Marty's face. Upon Marty's return, the set up works, causing Marty to panic and a great fire to erupt in the lab after he knocks over a Bunsen burner. In the struggle, Marty accidentally bumps into a shelf where a precariously placed jug of acid sits and causing the jug to fall and break, splashing acid on Marty's face and leaving him horribly disfigured. The sound attracts the attention of the students, who stand by the door in shock. Years later, those behind the prank are mysteriously invited back to the school for a reunion.

Neither of the women caught it and it landed on the ground . One of them picked it up from the ground at their feet whereupon it exploded in her hands with a very loud noise and a massive flash of flames and light . Question What may have caused it to explode ? Answer:","output":"There could be several factors that led to the explosion of the object. Based on the provided context, I will analyze the possible causes step-by-step: 1. Initial examination: The object is small, round, black, and has a Louis Vuitton logo. It resembles a Magic 8 Ball in size. The designer label indicates that it may be a fashion item or accessory. 2. Consideration of possible contents: As it is not clear what exactly the object is, we should consider what could be inside of it. It may contain a pyrotechnic element (such as flash powder or a small firework), electronics or batteries, or even a tiny, intentional explosive device. 3. Triggering mechanism: The object exploded when one of the women picked it up from the ground. This suggests that it could have had a mechanical, electronic, or pressure-sensitive triggering mechanism that activated upon being handled. 4. Possibility of improper handling: It's also possible that the explosion was caused by mishandling, which could result in damage to the object's internal contents and their subsequent reaction. Based on my analysis, the explosion may have been caused by: - A pyrotechnic element or firework inside the object, which was triggered by being picked up. - Electronics or batteries overheating, causing a short circuit and subsequent explosion. - An intentional explosive device, designed to detonate upon being handled. - Improper handling of the object, resulting in damage to its contents and the explosion. Further investigation and examination of the object's remains could provide more definitive answers to what caused the explosion."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: when did nypd blue go off the air?","output":"NYPD Blue, a critically acclaimed police drama television series, went off the air on March 1, 2005. The show originally premiered on September 21, 1993, and enjoyed a successful run for 12 seasons, comprising 261 episodes. Created by Steven Bochco and David Milch, NYPD Blue aired on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and featured an ensemble cast that included actors such as Dennis Franz, David Caruso, Jimmy Smits, and Mark-Paul Gosselaar. The series was lauded for its realistic depiction of the professional and personal lives of police officers working for the New York City Police Department (NYPD)'s 15th Precinct. NYPD Blue garnered numerous awards throughout its run, including several Primetime Emmy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards, highlighting its impact on the television landscape during the 1990s and 2000s. NYPD Blue was known for pushing the boundaries of the police drama genre, incorporating graphic language, nudity, and violence. These elements allowed the creators to explore deeper and more complex storylines and character arcs. The show's groundbreaking approach also paved the way for future television dramas that adopted similar techniques in storytelling. After NYPD Blue went off the air, its influence continued to resonate with audiences and critics alike, cementing its legacy as one of the most notable and important television dramas of all time.

He received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of both the Royal Academy of Music (1920) and the Royal College of Music (1923). Jacobs lists 26 compositions dedicated to Wood, including, in addition to the Vaughan Williams Serenade to Music, works by Elgar, Delius, Bax, Marcel Dupré and Walton. The Poet Laureate, John Masefield, composed a poem of six verses in his honour, entitled \\"Sir Henry Wood\\", often referred to by its first line, \\"Where does the uttered music go?\\". Walton set it to music as an anthem for mixed choir; it received its first performance on 26 April 1946 at St Sepulchre's, on the occasion of a ceremony unveiling a memorial stained-glass window in Wood's honour.Wood is commemorated in the name of the Henry Wood Hall, the deconsecrated Holy Trinity Church in Southwark, which was converted to a rehearsal and recording venue in 1975. His bust stands upstage centre in the Royal Albert Hall during the whole of each Prom season, decorated by a chaplet on the Last Night of the Proms. His collection of 2,800 orchestral scores and 1,920 sets of parts is now in the library of the Royal Academy of Music. For the Academy he also established the Henry Wood Fund, giving financial aid to students. The University of Strathclyde named a building at its Jordanhill campus after him.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The mountainous terrain and geographic features of El Hatillo have made it difficult to extend the Caracas Metro to southeast Caracas, so the main transportation methods in the municipality are private vehicles and road public transportation. An extension of the Metro – Line 5 – has been proposed, but construction has not been initiated as of 2007; phase 2 of Line 4 is still under construction. Urban planning in the municipality has been unorganised; news archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have been complaining about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial construction, yet new or enhanced alternative roads to resolve the traffic problems have not been completed. A south beltway suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to its high cost. However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay – a neighborhood in northeast Caracas – is under construction and is planned to be completed in 2010; according to Mayor Catalán, 23% of El Hatillo's inhabitants will eventually use this transit way. Its cost was estimated in early 2006 as US19,572,000.Local solutions – such as the proposed Metro extension line and the road connecting La Lagunita and Macaracuay – may improve the traffic congestion around El Hatillo, but the traffic issue affects all of Caracas. It is estimated that one million vehicles transit Caracas daily, causing a collapse of the transportation network. Automobiles travel at an average speed of 15 km/h (9 mph) on the streets and highways of Caracas. There are numerous factors contributing to the traffic problem in Caracas.

The Independent Commission for the Location of Victim's Remains (ICLVR) has made headway in resolving other cases of missing persons during the Troubles but has yet to uncover the full story of Robert Nairac's disappearance. This article explores the background of Nairac's fateful disappearance and the commission's ongoing search for his remains. Background: Captain Robert Nairac was an undercover British Army officer assigned to Northern Ireland during the tumultuous late 1970s. He was abducted, interrogated and, ultimately, murdered by suspected members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) on May 15th, 1977. Though four people have been convicted in connection with his murder, his remains have yet to be recovered. The location of his body is one of the central mysteries still unresolved pertaining to the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. ICLVR's Mission: The ICLVR was established through a mutual agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1999 to locate the remains of those who disappeared during the Troubles. To date, the ICLVR has successfully secured the recovery of 13 out of the 16 total individuals classified as the Disappeared. However, the remains of three individuals, including Captain Nairac, are still missing. In their continued efforts, the commission heavily relies on the information and cooperation of the local population. The Appeal for Help: The ICLVR is urging anyone with information about the location of Robert Nairac's remains to come forward and assist in bringing closure to his family's decades-long quest for answers. Many years have passed since the brutal events that claimed Nairac's life, and memories may have faded, but the commission remains steadfast in its pursuit of justice. Breaking the silence surrounding Nairac's burial site is crucial for providing the answers that his loved ones have been seeking for over 40 years. Protection of Informants: To encourage individuals to come forward, the ICLVR stresses that the information provided will be treated with the utmost confidentiality. Legislation has been enacted to ensure that any information shared with the ICLVR cannot be used in criminal prosecutions. This legal provision is aimed at easing potential anxieties of informants and encouraging more people to provide valuable intelligence. Conclusion: The recovery of Robert Nairac's remains is a vital and necessary step towards healing the wounds that the Troubles inflicted on numerous families, both in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. As the ICLVR continues its mission to locate the victims of the Disappeared, the public's help is invaluable in bringing peace and solace to the loved ones of those who have been lost. The appeal to locate Robert Nairac's remains demonstrates an unwavering commitment to solving these tragic cases and highlights the need for healing and mutual understanding in a region that has long been marred by conflict."},{"instruction":"Q:What is the answer for the question: What was the name of the album that was not a \\"classic\\" record? from the following article ?

Question: What else caused consternation in the community? Context: There were serious scientific objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Karl von Nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.

Furthermore, Fleeming Jenkin's calculations showed that blending inheritance could not accumulate useful traits, as it mixed traits, which also raised concerns.

First, we need to combine the three numbers on the right side of the equation: -22, -147, and -201. Here's a simple way to do it: -22 and -147 are both negative numbers. Imagine we have a big jar of \\"sad\\" candies, with each candy representing -1. If we have 22 sad candies and then put another 147 sad candies in the jar, we will have 22 + 147 sad candies. That's 169 sad candies, so we can represent this as -169, with the \\"minus\\" sign indicating the \\"sad\\" candies. Now, we have -169 - 201. We still have our jar with 169 sad candies, and we are going to put 201 more sad candies in it. This gives us a total of 169 + 201 sad candies, which is 370 sad candies in all. So we can represent this as -370. Now our equation looks like this: 37 * o = -370 Next, we need to figure out what to multiply 37 by so that it will equal -370. To do this, we will divide -370 by 37. -370 divided by 37 equals -10. Here's one way to visualize this: Imagine we have 370 cookies that we want to share with a group of 37 people. But, each person gets -1 cookie. This is a bit weird since we normally don't give negative cookies, but just pretend these are special \\"sad\\" cookies that take away happiness. So, we give 10 sad cookies to each person, and that makes everyone at the party 10 times sadder. So, now we can say o = -10. That means that if you take 37 and multiply it by -10, you will get -370. And that's our answer: o equals -10."},{"instruction":"Q:Article: Ever wonder why sometimes a hug is all you need ?

Muscle loss in particular is one of the major side effects of aging , with our bodies losing up to 5 percent of our muscle mass each decade past our 30s . In the study , published in the journal Nature Communications , researchers injected oxytocin into older mice with muscle damage . The older mice had lower levels of the homeone than younger mice initially . But after nine days , the older mice who were given the hormone healed better than those who did not .

Sources say Wynn’s 1943 Picasso self-portrait, “Le Marin,” was severely damaged while stored at the auction house, as a metal extension pole for a wall paint roller allegedly fell on the canvas, creating a “significant hole” in the masterpiece. The catastrophe uncoiled as Christie’s staff prepared to exhibit the artwork ahead of the auction. This comes years after Wynn put his elbow through another Picasso masterpiece, “Le Rêve,” in 2006, leaving a silver-dollar-size hole. It was repaired and sold in 2013 for 155 million. Wynn, 76, fears “Le Marin” is so badly damaged that it may be beyond repair. He also believes Christie’s may be low-balling him by valuing it at 70 million, while he insists it could have fetched more than 100 million at the May 15 auction. Wynn’s adviser, private-wealth lawyer and Pillsbury partner Michael Kosnitzky, told Page Six, “To say that Mr. Wynn is upset is an extreme understatement. This was clearly an act of gross negligence on the part of Christie’s employees.” Wynn is represented by litigators from his firm, while restorers and loss adjusters survey the damage. Kosnitzky added, “We hope and anticipate that the painting can be properly restored. We also hope this matter can be amicably resolved with Christie’s. The other issue is the value they ascribe to the work — 70 million. We strongly disagree with it. Mr. Wynn contends it would have sold for over 100 million, and would have been the most significant work in the show. “There may be a debate among art and insurance experts for some time, but Mr. Wynn’s new art dealership expects to be fully compensated for the cost and time to repair the painting, and the diminution in its value, following this flagrant act of gross negligence by Christie’s staff.” Wynn stepped down from his casino empire in February in the wake of multiple allegations of sexual harassment spanning decades, but strongly denied any wrongdoing. The Picasso was one of three works going under the hammer to launch his new business Sierra Fine Art, LLC, through which the experienced collector intends to become the world’s most prominent art dealer to the wealthy, despite his eyesight problems. Christie’s did not comment on how decorating equipment allegedly came into contact with valuable artwork, reiterating their statement that the Picasso was “accidentally damaged.” ||||| The chairwoman of a Wynn Resorts Ltd. committee investigating allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against Steve Wynn said more than 100 people have been interviewed so far. Casino mogul Steve Wynn on March 15, 2016 during a news conference in Medford, Mass. Facing investigations by gambling regulators and allegations of sexual misconduct, Wynn has stepped down as chairman and CEO of the resorts bearing his names. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) The chairwoman of a Wynn Resorts Ltd. committee investigating allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against Steve Wynn said more than 100 people have been interviewed so far. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, Pat Mulroy said committee members hope to finish the investigation by the third quarter of this year. “Since we began our work, we have interviewed 114 people and have reviewed 3 million documents in order to reach our conclusions,” Mulroy said. “We are not going to leave a single stone unturned and we are going to finish our work with the same diligence and energy level that we have been deploying for the last three months.” Allegations first emerged in late January that founder and former chairman Steve Wynn sexually harassed female employees over decades. Steve Wynn has denied accusations that he assaulted or harassed workers, but stepped down in February, saying that the barrage of complaints was minimizing his leadership efforts. Mulroy said Jason Schwartz of the labor and employment law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher is the committee’s lead investigator. “When our chairman resigned, the scope of the special committee was altered and expanded dramatically so not only are we looking into the particulars of the allegations that have been raised, but we are also looking at this company with very much of a forward-looking glance,” Mulroy said. “We’re looking at policies, procedures and protocols and hoping to create best-in-kind structures in preventing or avoiding future discrimination or harassment in this company.” D. Boone Wayson, a Wynn director since 2003 who became board chairman with Steve Wynn’s resignation, said the committee is working quickly. “As shareholders, we have endured — and in some cases tolerated — the last four months,” Wayson said at the meeting. “But I’m here to say that I feel the board and the company has rapidly and decisively responded to some of the matters that have occurred over the past 120 days.” The Wynn Resorts board formed the special committee investigating the allegations the last week of January and selected independent counsel to assist in the investigation.

When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water. and the situation: Bobby and Ned are two neighbors who both have medium sized gardens in their backyards. They regularly talk to each other about what they are growing and share gardening tips. Bobby is out working in his garden when Ned comes over to chat.

Answer the following question: Whose garden is losing oxygen more slowly?","output":"Bobby's garden is losing oxygen more slowly, as it is not currently flooded. Ned's garden, which is flooded, would lose oxygen more quickly due to the decreased rate of diffusion of oxygen in water compared to air."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Process: - You must decide the purpose of the satellite - You must draw up a plan to what kind of orbit the satellite will travel - You make preparations for the rocket that will travel into space - Prepare the crew that will send it there - You begin the countdown date for the rocket - And then you send the rocket carrying the satellite into space - Once in orbit the satellite will be placed where it was planned. Question: suppose less earth surface occurs happens, how will it affect Nasa intervenes and demands smaller satelite. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's go through the steps as mentioned and then evaluate the impact of less Earth surface and NASA's demand for a smaller satellite on the process. 1. Decide the purpose of the satellite: The purpose of the satellite will determine its size, design, and orbit. If the Earth's surface area is less, it might affect the coverage area of the satellite but not necessarily the purpose. 2. Draw up a plan for the satellite's orbit: If the Earth's surface is less, the required orbit might change. This could have an impact on the satellite design and size. However, the orbit will still be designed to serve the intended purpose. 3. Make preparations for the rocket that will travel into space: If NASA demands a smaller satellite, the rocket's payload capacity can be adjusted accordingly. A smaller satellite might require a smaller rocket, which could be more cost-effective. 4. Prepare the crew that will send it there: The preparation of the crew is largely independent of the satellite's size or Earth's surface area. They will still need to be trained and ready to execute the mission. 5. Begin the countdown date for the rocket: This step will not be affected by the smaller satellite or Earth's surface area. 6. Send the rocket carrying the satellite into space: A smaller satellite might require less energy to launch into space, making the process more efficient. 7. Place the satellite in its planned orbit: With less Earth's surface area, the satellite may have less ground to cover. This could result in more efficient use of resources and potentially a longer operational lifespan. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of less Earth surface has some effect on the process, mainly at steps 2 and 7, and potentially benefits from a smaller satellite. The influence of NASA's demand for a smaller satellite has more effect since it impacts steps 3, 6, and indirectly 2."},{"instruction":"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans. E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals. Known as \\"e-cigarettes,\\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum. While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. \\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA. CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them. The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said. The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \\"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\\" Do you have any questions?","output":"As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or questions. However, I can help you come up with some questions based on the information provided in the text: 1.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Twenty Palaeolithic sites have been identified in the Mendips, of which eleven represent faunal remains and lithic artefacts recovered from caves. The remaining eight sites refer to surface lithic discoveries, and the artefacts found include points, scrapers, and handaxes. Twenty-seven Mesolithic finds are represented by flint and chert lithics. Large numbers of artefacts have been found near Neolithic, Iron Age, and Bronze Age features, such as the barrows and forts around Priddy and at Dolebury Warren. The caves of Cheddar Gorge have yielded many archaeological remains, as flood waters have washed artefacts and bones into the caves and preserved them in silt. The Cheddar Man, Britain's oldest complete skeleton, was found in Gough's Cave, part of the Cheddar Complex.Within the Mendip Hills AONB, good evidence exists for 286 definite examples of round barrows, including the Priddy Nine Barrows and Ashen Hill Barrow Cemeteries. The Historic England Archive holds over 1,200 entries for the area, and there are over 600 listed buildings, in addition to over 200 scheduled ancient monuments. These protected monuments range from prehistoric barrows and hillforts to the Black Down bombing decoy from the Second World War.Settlement on the Mendip Hills appears to fall into two types. The first, apparent in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain periods, and repeated on a small scale in the Middle Ages and post-medieval era, comprised occupation by self-sufficient groups in small communities or isolated farms. The second was represented in the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods by large sites with specialist functions, existing by virtue of their ability to exert power over lowland producers. From the Iron Age onward the ownership of land took on increasing importance, with large landholdings based on the mines or on stock grazing, denying settlers access to the plateau or forcing them off the hills.There is evidence of mining dating back to the late Bronze Age, when there were technological changes in metal-working... The answer to this question is:","output":"The Roman culture's invasion of the hills that were occupied by two types of settlements was most likely for silver. The context provided suggests that the Mendip Hills have a rich and diverse history with numerous archaeological sites dating back to the Paleolithic era. However, it is during the Iron Age and Roman periods that the hills experienced the most significant changes in terms of settlements and land use patterns. Specifically, large sites with specialist functions emerged, focusing on exerting power over lowland producers and exploiting the region's rich mineral resources. One of the primary reasons for the Roman invasion of Britain was to gain access to its valuable resources, such as metals and minerals, to fuel their growing empire. The Mendip Hills were known to be rich in lead and silver, which were used extensively in Roman construction, coinage, and various other applications. As a result, the Roman culture's incursion into the region targeted these valuable resources, propelling the development of large-scale mining operations throughout the Mendip Hills. Furthermore, the Roman conquest of Britain led to the establishment of extensive trade networks, connecting the Mendip Hills to other parts of the empire. This allowed the Romans not only to benefit from the extraction of silver from the hills, but also to exploit other resources, such as stock grazing, that were crucial to supporting their military campaigns and maintaining overall control of the region. Overall, the Roman culture's invasion of the hills occupied by two types of settlements was most likely driven by the desire to access and exploit the region's rich silver deposits. This incursion led to significant changes in the way the land was used, resulting in the development of large sites with specialist functions that came to dominate the landscape, ultimately transforming the entire socio-economic structure of the region."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: isabella's last name from phineas and ferb?","output":"Isabella's last name from Phineas and Ferb is Garcia-Shapiro.

Translate to Romanian Romanian:","output":"Este, de asemenea, un fapt trist că există o penurie de donatori și că acest lucru alimentează unele activități criminale dezgustătoare. În lumea de astăzi, problema lipsei de donatori pentru organe, sânge și alte resurse vitale este, fără îndoială, una de mare îngrijorare. Această lipsă afectează în primul rând pacienții care așteaptă transplanturi de organe sau alte proceduri medicale menite să le salveze și să le îmbunătățească viața. Numărul mare de persoane care așteaptă să primească un organ pentru transplant este în mare contrast cu numărul redus de donatori disponibili. Este important să luăm în considerare o serie de factori care contribuie la penuria de donatori. În primul rând, lipsa de informații și conștientizare despre procesul de donare, precum și importanța și beneficiile pe care le poate aduce, poate duce la o lipsă de disponibilitate pentru donarea de organe. De asemenea, există o varietate de probleme de sănătate care pot impiedica o persoană să devină donator, cum ar fi bolile cronice și infecțiile. De asemenea, unele persoane pot avea îngrijorări sau convingeri religioase și culturale care le pot împiedica să facă donații de organe. Trist este că, în unele cazuri, lipsa de donatori duce la creșterea activităților criminale legate de traficul de organe și sânge. Aceste activități implica abuzuri teribile și încălcarea drepturilor omului, precum vânzarea ilegală a organelor și sângelui, exploatarea persoanelor vulnerabile și chiar răpirea și uciderea victimelor pentru a le extrage organele. Combaterea acestor activități criminale este esențială pentru protejarea sănătății și siguranței comunităților noastre. Este important să se consolideze legile și reglementările care vizează prevenirea și pedepsirea traficului de organe și sânge, precum și să se promoveze conștientizarea și educația cu privire la importanța și beneficiile donării de organe și sânge. În concluzie, penuria de donatori contribuie la creșterea activităților criminale dezgustătoare și afectează viețile multora. Este imperativ să ne unim eforturile pentru a face față acestei probleme și a promova donarea voluntară și legală de organe și sânge. Sporind conștientizarea și educând publicul cu privire la beneficiile și importanța donării, putem spera să contracarăm activitățile criminale și să salvăm mai multe vieți în cele din urmă."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The person knew what he had to do to achieve his dreams, so what did he do?

Students are graduating with larger and larger debts. So is a college degree really worth it? In 2006, the UK government started to allow universities in England and Wales to charge British students tuition fees. As a result, more than 80 percent of students in England and Wales now take out a student loan in order to go to university. They use the loan to pay for tuition fees and living expenses. Although the interest on student loans is quite low, it begins as soon as the student receives the loan. The average student in England and Wales now graduates from university with a debt of around PS12,000 (122,952 yuan). It means graduates have to struggle to pay rent on a flat, because they have to start paying back the student loan when they reach April after graduating. If you start to earn over PS15,000 (153,630 yuan) a year, the government takes repayments directly from your monthly salary. You might think that a person with a degree would find it easy to get a well-paid job. However, most people in \\"white collar jobs\\" seem to have a degree, so there is a lot of competition. Also, British companies tend to value work experience over . All of the above is beginning to make British people question whether a university degree is really worth the money. Even before the credit crisis started, the BBC stated: \\"The number of British students at UK universities has fallen for the first time in recent history, from 1.97 million in 2007 to 1.96 million last year.\\" Meanwhile, the British universities offer more and more of the available places to richer international students rather than poorer British students.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation.

The Arctic ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which ocean experiences less cooling of hot molten rock? Hint: At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.

Option 1: Taking stock of your approximate sleep cycle can be useful, but this option does not provide clear steps on how to improve sleep quality. Option 2: Sticking to your typical bedtime is essential, but the provided times (8 am and 2:00 pm) seem to be an error and are not appropriate for a good night's sleep. Option 3: Keeping your bedroom well lit at night might not be helpful and might disrupt your sleep instead. In fact, a dark environment is more conducive to sleep. Option 4: This option suggests calculating your bedtime and wake-up time based on the time you need to be up for work or school. Based on this evaluation, it appears that Option 4 would be the best way to achieve a good night's sleep. Step 2: Implementing Option 4 To follow Option 4, you should: 1. Determine the time you need to be awake for work or school (e.g., 6:00 am). 2. Calculate the number of hours of sleep you need. Most adults require 7 to 9 hours of sleep. 3. Count backwards from your wake-up time to find your ideal bedtime. For example, if you need to wake up at 6:00 am and require 8 hours of sleep, your bedtime should be at 10:00 pm. 4. Establish a consistent sleep schedule by always going to bed and waking up at these times, even on weekends. Additional steps to improve sleep quality: 1. Create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or practicing mindfulness exercises. 2. Make sure your sleeping environment is cool, dark, and quiet. 3. Avoid caffeine and heavy meals close to bedtime. 4. Limit exposure to screens and electronic devices before bed as the blue light emitted from these devices can disrupt sleep.

Well, if you're planning to check bags you'd better bring some extra cash. American Airlines announced Wednesday that it will start charging passengers 15 next month to check a bag. The airline -- like many others -- had already announced plans to charge 25 to check a second bag. But just because these airlines are charging you for what was once free, don't expect any improvements in service. Airline experts said there will still be plenty of lost bags. Ray Neidl, an airline analyst with Calyon Securities, said because of high gas prices the airlines need cash and passengers shouldn't expect any change in how their bags are handled. Sign Up for Our RSS Feed and Get the Latest Business Headlines From ABC News \\"The systems are still going to be the same,\\" Neidl said. Basically, he added, fuel prices are forcing the airlines to do something they might have done anyway. \\"People want bare-bones ticket prices. They don't want to be subsidizing other passengers checking in bags,\\" Neidl said. Rick Seaney, CEO of FareCompare.com and an ABCNEWS.com columnist, also cast doubt about any improved baggage service. \\"Sure they'll charge 15 to check a bag, but if you think this will get your bag to your final destination … in your dreams,\\" Seaney said. \\"I doubt this new 15 first check bag fee is going to come with a money-back guarantee if/when your bag doesn't make it to your destination.\\" Robert Crandall, former CEO of American Airlines, said today on \\"Good Morning America\\" that the new fee is \\"a reflection of the desperation of the industry.\\" He noted that baggage \\"weighs a good deal\\" and therefore burns a lot of costly fuel. But he said his former company's move might not have been the best approach. \\"I think frankly the industry might be better off if it raised fares and had everybody contribute,\\" Crandall said. But in the past when airlines have raised fares there have been times when one refused to go along with the hike, he said, undermining others. Crandall also said that more government regulation of the airlines might solve some of the industry's perils. Struggling With the Economy? What can ABC News do or tell you that would help you live your life? It is not clear whether other airlines will follow American's lead. Delta released a statement Wednesday saying: \\"Though record-breaking fuel prices are causing us to look at costs in every area of our business, we have no plans at this time to charge for a first checked bag.\\" Other airlines took a similar wait-and-see approach.

Let's discuss the entire process in detail and outline the final step. 1. Blood sugar drops: The cells in our body constantly utilize glucose as an energy source to perform various physiological functions. When we don't consume food for a certain period, the glucose levels in our blood begin to decline. 2. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon: Once the blood sugar levels start dropping, specialized cells called alpha cells in the pancreas recognize this change and release the hormone glucagon. Glucagon is secreted to stimulate the process called glycogenolysis to maintain an optimal glucose concentration in the bloodstream. 3. The liver turns glucagon into glucose: When glucagon reaches the liver, it binds to specific receptors present on hepatic cells, activating a signaling cascade that promotes the breakdown of glycogen (a stored form of glucose) into its simpler glucose units. This biochemical process is called glycogenolysis. Besides this, glucagon also stimulates gluconeogenesis, the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as certain amino acids and glycerol. 4. Liver releases glucose into the blood: After the liver converts glycogen into glucose molecules or produces new glucose via gluconeogenesis, it releases the glucose into the bloodstream. As a result, the blood sugar levels start increasing to maintain and restore glucose homeostasis. Final Step: Regulation of blood glucose levels - The rise of blood glucose levels due to the action of glucagon is sensed by specialized cells called beta cells, which are also located in the pancreas. These cells secrete another hormone called insulin, which helps to regulate glucose levels by promoting glucose uptake and utilization by the cells and also by inhibiting glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. This intricate balance and coordination between insulin and glucagon secretion allow the body to maintain blood glucose within a narrow range, ensuring the proper functioning of physiological processes. In summary, when blood sugar levels become too low, glucagon is released, the liver converts and releases glucose, and ultimately, the blood glucose levels are regulated to maintain homeostasis. The final step in this process is the regulation of blood glucose levels through the action of insulin and other related factors to maintain homeostasis and ensure an optimal energy supply for the body."},{"instruction":"Es ist zulässig, Elemente unter Quellenangabe herunterzuladen oder auszudrucken.

Is \\"The film set the Egyptian box office record at the time, and focused on Nasser during the Suez Crisis.\\" the correct answer? Choices: (a). yes (b). no","output":"(b). No While the statement is correct that the film \\"Nasser 56\\" is about the Suez Crisis and achieved significant success in Egypt, it does not fully capture the essence and details of the film. \\"Nasser 56,\\" released in 1996, is an Egyptian historical-biographical film directed by Mohamed Fadel. The film stars the renowned Egyptian actor Ahmed Zaki, who portrays the late President Gamal Abdel Nasser. As the statement indicates, the film dwells on the events of the Suez Crisis, but it particularly focuses on the pivotal year of 1956 that transformed both Nasser's leadership and modern Egyptian history. The Suez Crisis, also known as the Second Arab-Israeli War, Tripartite Aggression, or the Sinai War, was an international conflict that took place in 1956. The crisis began when Nasser, in a bold move, nationalized the Suez Canal, a strategic international waterway connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas. In response, Israel, France, and the United Kingdom decided to invade Egypt with the aim of regaining control over the canal and removing Nasser from power. \\"Nasser 56\\" delves not only into the politics and military maneuvers but also into the personal challenges and decisions faced by President Nasser during the Suez Crisis. The film showcases his determination, strategic mind, and unwavering commitment to Egyptian sovereignty through a blend of historical facts and creative interpretation. Beyond Nasser's personal experiences, the film serves as a historical narrative of Egypt's struggle against colonialism and imperialism, epitomized by the Suez Canal nationalization. This conflict highlighted the dynamics of power and politics in the Middle East during the Cold War era, as the Suez Crisis had major international repercussions. The eventual withdrawal of foreign forces from Egypt marked a major victory for Nasser and Egyptian nationalism, further solidifying his status as a pan-Arab leader. In conclusion, the statement about \\"Nasser 56\\" is accurate in terms of the film's success and the central focus on Gamal Abdel Nasser during the Suez Crisis. However, it misses the depth and richness of the film's exploration of Nasser's personal experiences, Egypt's struggle for sovereignty, and the broader historical implications of the Suez Crisis in the region and the world."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Akita Museum of Art, country, Japan; Akita Museum of Art, location, Akita, Akita; Akita, Akita, isPartOf, Akita Prefecture; Japan, ethnicGroup, Vietnamese people in Japan","output":"The Akita Museum of Art, situated in the city of Akita within Japan's Akita Prefecture, showcases diverse artworks and celebrates the cultural contributions of Vietnamese people in Japan."},{"instruction":"Process: - A virus enters a host body - The virus has receptors that lock onto a target cell - The virus enters the cell - The virus uses the cell like a factory to make new copies of the virus - The new copies of the virus leave the cell - Infect other cells - The host gets sick as its cells are damaged.

Step 2: Analyze the effects of COPD on the body Since the patient has compromised lung function, the airways are inflamed, and the alveoli responsible for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide are damaged. Step 3: Consider the virus's ability to enter cells In the given information, the virus has receptors that lock onto a target cell, which allows it to enter the cell. Step 4: Analyze the effects of COPD on the virus's ability to enter cells With the presence of COPD, the lung's airways are inflamed, and there's a possibility of an excess production of mucus.

Choices: - hemoglobin - insulin - vasopressin - oxytocin A: Answer:","output":"Oxytocin During childbirth, oxytocin is the hormone that plays a vital role in driving the process forward through a positive feedback mechanism. It is responsible for initiating and enhancing uterine contractions, which help the fetal head move towards the cervix. Oxytocin is produced by the hypothalamus, a small region at the base of the brain, and is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. Its primary function, in the context of childbirth, is to stimulate smooth muscles, such as those found in the uterus. As labor progresses, the production and release of oxytocin increase, leading to stronger and more frequent contractions of the uterus. The positive feedback loop works as follows: as the fetal head presses against the cervix, it stimulates nerve endings in the area that, in turn, send signals up to the brain, particularly to the hypothalamus. This stimulus increases the production of oxytocin, which is then released into the bloodstream by the pituitary gland. As oxytocin levels rise, uterine contractions become stronger and more frequent, causing the cervix to dilate and the fetus to move further down into the birth canal. As this process continues, the pressure on the cervix gradually intensifies, leading to even more oxytocin production and subsequent release. This self-reinforcing mechanism, driven by increasing oxytocin levels in the mother's bloodstream, helps in the progression of labor from early contractions to full cervical dilation and, eventually, to the birth of the baby. In summary, among the given choices, oxytocin is the hormone that is continually released during childbirth through a positive feedback mechanism and prompts uterine contractions to help the fetal head progress towards the cervix. The essential role of oxytocin in this physiological process highlights its importance as one of the critical hormones involved in the complex and interconnected process of giving birth."},{"instruction":"What is the solution?

First, we look for all the \\"g\\" friends in the equation: 59*g + 0*g = -4*g - 567 Now, we can help 0*g to go away because anything multiplied by 0 is just 0. So the equation becomes: 59*g = -4*g - 567 Next, let's help -4*g to join 59*g on the left side of the equation by adding 4*g to both sides: 59*g + 4*g = -567 Now, we add 59*g and 4*g together, which gives us 63*g: 63*g = -567 Finally, to find the value of g, we need to share the -567 equally among the 63 g's. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 63: g = -567 ÷ 63 When we divide -567 by 63, we get -9: g = -9 And there we have it! The value of g is -9.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose it is not rainy season happens, how will it affect HELPING the dishwasher to clean better. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis presented - that it is not rainy season - does not necessarily have a direct effect on the dishwasher's ability to clean dishes better. Dishwashers work independently of external factors like weather and are designed to perform their intended purpose under various conditions. However, there may be indirect effects that could help the dishwasher clean more efficiently under non-rainy conditions. Here are a few potential indirect effects: 1. Relative humidity: During non-rainy seasons, the relative humidity in the air is usually lower than during rainy seasons. A dryer environment could help the dishwasher's drying cycle to be more efficient, as the warm air directed towards the dishes would have more capacity to absorb the moisture present on the dishes. This could lead to quicker and more thorough drying of the dishes. 2. Water quality: In some areas, rainy seasons may lead to increased runoff into water sources, potentially leading to a higher concentration of dissolved minerals and other impurities in the water supply. This could affect the water entering the dishwasher, possibly requiring more detergent or additional cleaning cycles to achieve the same level of clean. In contrast, during non-rainy seasons, the water quality may be better, allowing the dishwasher to clean more effectively. 3. Energy consumption: Depending on the design of a particular dishwasher and the heating/cooling systems in a home, it is possible that having a dryer and cooler environment from the non-rainy season allows for better energy efficiency when the dishwasher is in use. This is because the dishwasher would not have to work as hard to maintain the hot water temperature or dry the dishes. Improved energy efficiency could lead to better performance and, subsequently, better cleaning. 4. Ventilation: In non-rainy seasons, people are more likely to open their windows and doors to let in fresh air. Improved air circulation in the home can help to dissipate any residual moisture left by the dishwasher, preventing the growth of mold or mildew on the dishes. This may help maintain a more hygienic environment inside the dishwasher, which could improve the overall cleaning process. Overall, while the non-rainy season does not have a direct effect on the dishwasher's ability to clean, it could have indirect effects that help the dishwasher achieve more efficient and thorough cleaning and drying of dishes. However, these effects would vary depending on the local environment and the quality of the dishwasher in use."},{"instruction":"Which entity is this text about? Allan David Bloom (September 14, 1930 - October 7, 1992) was an American philosopher, classicist, and academician. He studied under David Grene, Leo Strauss, Richard McKeon, and Alexandre Kojeve. He subsequently taught at Cornell University, the University of Toronto, Yale University, Ecole Normale Superieure of Paris, and the University of Chicago. Bloom championed the idea of Great Books education and became famous for his criticism of contemporary American higher education, with his views being expressed in his bestselling 1987 book, The Closing of the American Mind. Allan Bloom was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1930 to second-generation Jewish parents who were both social workers. The couple had a daughter, Lucille, two years earlier. As a thirteen-year-old, Bloom read a Readers Digest article about the University of Chicago and told his parents he wanted to attend; his parents thought it was unreasonable and did not encourage his hopes. Yet, when his family moved to Chicago in 1944, his parents met a psychiatrist and family friend whose son was enrolled in the University of Chicago's humanities program for gifted students. In 1946, Bloom was accepted to the same program, starting his degree at the age of fifteen, and spending the next decade of his life enrolled at the University in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood. This began his lifelong passion for the 'idea' of the university. In the preface to Giants and Dwarfs: Essays, 1960-1990, he stated that his education \\"began with Freud and ended with Plato\\". The theme of this education was self-knowledge, or self-discovery--an idea that Bloom would later write, seemed impossible to conceive of for a Midwestern American boy. He credits Leo Strauss as the teacher who made this endeavor possible for him. Bloom graduated from the University of Chicago with his Bachelor's Degree at the age of 18. One of his college classmates was the classicist Seth Benardete. For post-graduate studies, he enrolled in the University of Chicago's Committee on Social Thought, where he was assigned Classicist David Grene as tutor, and went on to write his thesis on Isocrates. Grene recalled Bloom as an energetic and humorous student completely dedicated to studying classics, but with no definite career ambitions. The Committee was a unique interdisciplinary program that attracted a small number of students due to its rigorous academic requirements and lack of clear employment opportunities after graduation. Bloom earned his Ph.D. from the Committee on Social Thought in 1955. He subsequently studied under the influential Hegelian philosopher Alexandre Kojeve in Paris, whose lectures Bloom would later introduce to the English-speaking world. While teaching philosophy at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, he befriended Raymond Aron, amongst many other philosophers. Among the American expatriate community in Paris his friends included leftist writer Susan Sontag.","output":"This text is about Allan David Bloom, an American philosopher, classicist, and academician."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following article and select the best answer.

Johnny Hooker, a grifter in Joliet, Illinois, cons 11,000 in cash (187,600 today) in a pigeon drop from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to teach him \\"the big con\\". Unfortunately, their victim was a numbers racket courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hookerâs cut. Having already spent his share, Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills. Lonnegan's men murder both the courier and Luther, and Hooker flees for his life to Chicago. Hooker finds Henry Gondorff, a once-great con-man now hiding from the FBI, and asks for his help in taking on the dangerous Lonnegan.

Question: What was the other subject in the letter to the National Assembly? Context: In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\". Answer:","output":"The other subject in the letter to the National Assembly was an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Burke criticized Rousseau severely, claiming his personality was dominated by vanity to a degree close to madness.

Although thoroughly institutionalized, Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world. Prior to his release, he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter, to whom he recounts committing the murders with a Kaiser blade, saying, \\"Some folks call it a sling blade. I call it a kaiser blade.\\" Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother. When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair, he killed her also. Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization (James Hampton), Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised. He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), as well as her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), the manager of the dollar store where she is employed. Despite Vaughan's concerns about Karl's history in the mental hospital, Linda allows him to move into her garage, which angers Linda's abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam). Karl bonds with Linda, who makes him biscuits to eat, and also with Vaughan, who tells Karl that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America.

Here is a step-by-step guide to help you accomplish this: 1. Gathering the Necessary Equipment: The first step is to get all the tools you will need to measure your dog. This includes: - A tape measure: This should be a flexible one, which is often used in sewing or tailoring, so it can be easily wrapped around your dog's body. - A flat surface: For example, a wall or door can be used to measure your dog's height. - A notepad or your phone: To jot down the taken measurements. - A scale: to measure your dog's weight. This step is crucial because having the right tools at hand will make the measurement process easier and more accurate. 2. Measuring the Height: To measure your dog's height, have your dog stand against the flat surface. With your dog standing straight, measure from the ground to the top of your dog's shoulders (the withers), not to the top of the head because head movements can make the measurements inaccurate. This is a crucial measurement if you're getting things like doggy doors, crates, or if your dog competes in agility events. 3. Measuring the Length: To find the length, measure from the base of your dog's tail to the front of his chest. Alternatively, for puppies that are still growing, measure from the base of the tail to the tip of the nose. This could be important for buying pet clothing or beds. 4. Measuring the Chest Girth: Wrap the tape measure around the largest part of your dog's chest. This is usually right behind the front legs. This measurement helps in getting the right size of harnesses and clothing. 5. Measuring the Neck Size: To get the neck size, simply wrap the tape measure around your dog's neck where a collar would comfortably sit. It's important not to tighten it too much. It should be snug, allowing for movement. This measurement is useful for choosing the correct size collar or protective cones. 6. Weighing Your Dog: Lastly, it's important to know your dog's weight. For small dogs, it's often easiest to weigh yourself on a bathroom scale without the dog, then weigh yourself holding the dog, and subtract the first number from the second to get your dog's weight. For heavier dogs, you might need special dog scales or a trip to the veterinarian's office. Each step has to be taken carefully to avoid hurting the dog and to get the most accurate measurements possible. Now that you have all the measurements and weight, you can ensure you get the right equipment, clothing, and nutrition for your dog, among other things."},{"instruction":"This is some data: A.S.

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation. - The Nile ( \\"en-Nl\\", \\"an-Nl\\" \\"P(h)iaro\\"; Ancient Egyptian: \\"'p\\" and \\"Iteru\\"; Biblical Hebrew: , \\"Ha-Ye'or\\") is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world, however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America. The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an \\"international\\" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan. - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism. - Geb was the Egyptian god of the Earth and later a member of the Ennead of Heliopolis. He had a snake around his head and was thus also considered the father of snakes. It was believed in ancient Egypt that Geb's laughter created earthquakes and that he allowed crops to grow. - Osiris (alternatively Ausir, Asiri or Ausar, among other spellings), was an Egyptian god, usually identified as the god of the afterlife, the underworld, and the dead, but more appropriately as the god of transition, resurrection, and regeneration. He was classically depicted as a green-skinned man with a pharaoh's beard, partially mummy-wrapped at the legs, wearing a distinctive crown with two large ostrich feathers at either side, and holding a symbolic crook and flail. Osiris was at times considered the oldest son of the earth god Geb, though other sources state his father is the sun-god Ra, and the sky goddess Nut, as well as being brother and husband of Isis, with Horus being considered his posthumously begotten son. He was also associated with the epithet Khenti-Amentiu, meaning \\"Foremost of the Westerners\\", a reference to his kingship in the land of the dead. As ruler of the dead, Osiris was also sometimes called \\"king of the living\\": ancient Egyptians considered the blessed dead \\"the living ones\\". - Menes (probably pronounced *; ) was a pharaoh of the Early Dynastic Period of ancient Egypt credited by classical tradition with having united Upper and Lower Egypt and as the founder of the First Dynasty. - Tefnut is a goddess of moisture, moist air, dew and rain in Ancient Egyptian religion. She is the sister and consort of the air god Shu and the mother of Geb and Nut. - Egyptian mythology is the collection of myths from ancient Egypt, which describe the actions of the Egyptian gods as a means of understanding the world. The beliefs that these myths express are an important part of ancient Egyptian religion. Myths appear frequently in Egyptian writings and art, particularly in short stories and in religious material such as hymns, ritual texts, funerary texts, and temple decoration. These sources rarely contain a complete account of a myth and often describe only brief fragments. - Upper and Lower Egypt also referred to as The Two Lands is a name used for Ancient Egypt. The concept appears in titles of Egyptian Kings and Queens and appears in scenes in temples and tombs. The concept also refers to an innate sense of duality in the Ancient Egyptian culture. - Isis (original Egyptian pronunciation more likely \\"Aset\\" or \\"Iset\\") is a goddess from the polytheistic pantheon of Egypt. She was first worshiped in ancient Egyptian religion, and later her worship spread throughout the Roman Empire and the greater Greco-Roman world. Isis is still widely worshiped by many pagans today in diverse religious contexts; including a number of distinct pagan religions, the modern Goddess movement, and interfaith organizations such as the Fellowship of Isis. - Nephthys or Nebthet was a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion. A member of the Great Ennead of Heliopolis in Egyptian mythology, she was a daughter of Nut and Geb. Nephthys was typically paired with her sister Isis in funerary rites because of their role as protectors of the mummy and the god Osiris and as the sister-wife of Set. - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - The Ennead (meaning \\"group of nine\\") was a group of nine deities in Egyptian mythology. The Ennead were worshipped at Heliopolis and consisted of the god Atum, his children Shu and Tefnut, their children Geb and Nut and their children Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys. - Lower Egypt (\\"\\") is the northernmost region of Egypt: the fertile Nile Delta, between Upper Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea from El Aiyat, south of modern-day Cairo, and Dahshur. - Narmer was an ancient Egyptian king of the Early Dynastic Period. Probably the successor to the Protodynastic kings Scorpion and/or Ka, some consider him the unifier of Egypt and founder of the First Dynasty, and in turn the first king of a unified Egypt. - Hu ( w ) , in ancient Egypt , was the deification of the first word , the word of creation , that Atum was said to have exclaimed upon ejaculating or , alternatively , his self - castration , in his masturbatory act of creating the Ennead . Hu is mentioned already in the Old Kingdom Pyramid texts ( PT 251 , PT 697 ) as companion of the deceased pharaoh . Together with Sia , he was depicted in the retinue of Thoth , with whom he was also occasionally identified . In the Middle Kingdom , all gods participated in Hu and Sia , and were associated with Ptah who created the universe by uttering the word of creation . Hu was depicted in human shape , as a falcon , or as a man with a ram 's head . In the New Kingdom , both Hu and Sia together with Heke , Irer and Sedjem were members of the fourteen creative powers of Amun - Ra . By the time of Ptolemaic Egypt , Hu had merged with Shu ( air ) . - The history of ancient Egypt spans the period from the early prehistoric settlements of the northern Nile valley to the Roman conquest, in 30 BC. The Pharaonic Period is dated from the 32nd century BC, when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified, until the country fell under Macedonian rule, in 332 BC. - Atum, sometimes rendered as Atem or Tem, is an important deity in Egyptian mythology. - The prehistory of Egypt spans the period from earliest human settlement to the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt in c. 3100 BC, starting with the first Pharaoh Narmer (also known as Menes). This Predynastic era is traditionally equivalent to the Neolithic period, beginning c. 6000 BC and including the Protodynastic period (Naqada III).

Stream of thoughts:","output":"Based on the given premise, we can infer certain aspects of the situation, but not all of the assumptions made in the hypothesis can be directly deduced from it. From the premise, we can gather the following: 1. There is a male musician. 2. He is dressed in black. 3. He has a guitar pick in his mouth, which suggests he may be playing the guitar or preparing to play. 4. The musician is performing during a concert, meaning there is an audience. 5.

In conclusion, while the hypothesis suggests a plausible assumption about the man's feelings, we cannot definitively say whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as there is not enough information to determine the man's emotions or specific motivations for performing."},{"instruction":"As Julie kept asking question after question, all I could think of was how desperately I needed a normal, healthy relationship. As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more. And like every great ride, Julie was beautiful, fast, and could turn on a dime in the blink of an eye. \\"I don't understand, Dingo.\\" I couldn't tell if it was the 12 stitches over my eye giving me the headache or Julie's prattling. I bit off a stretch of red tape and put it over the empty socket where my taillight should have been while I balanced the phone between my shoulder and swollen cheek. \\"Julie, I told you. Darby took the box.\\" \\"I get that, but--.\\" \\"The box my dad hand-carved just before he died.\\" I could feel the two edges of skin stitched together pull at each other every time my jaw moved. \\"Yes, yes, and the box protects your family's dirty little secret or your mother's pride and joy or whatever the hell it is you're calling it this week.\\" \\"Hey, I told you not to go digging--. \\" \\"I don't care what it is, Dingo! I couldn't give a shit about that damn box or what's inside. The only thing I want to know is what the fuck your ex-wife was doing there.\\" So there it was. And I thought she was jealous just because somebody else got to beat the living crap out of me for a change. \\"Julie, I didn't even know she was in town until after I was in the hospital.\\" Question: What was in the box? === The answer to the above question is","output":"not explicitly stated in the given passage. However, it is evident that the contents of the box hold significant value to the protagonist, Dingo. The box itself has an emotional attachment as it was hand-carved by his father just before he passed away. Furthermore, the context suggests that the contents may represent a closely guarded secret or something precious that could potentially impact Dingo's family or his mother's reputation. Despite the numerous questions and conversations alluding to the box, the actual contents remain a mystery. It is clear, though, that the box and its contents serve as a point of contention and curiosity in Dingo's relationships, particularly with Julie and his ex-wife, Darby. Julie's apparent disinterest in the contents of the box highlights the idea that their relationship is primarily based on sex and that genuine emotional connections are lacking. In contrast, the fact that Darby took the box indicates that she might have a deeper understanding of its importance or perhaps seeks to exploit its value for her own personal gain. In this complex scenario, the box serves as a symbol of the struggle between Dingo's emotional world and his tumultuous relationships. While it may be tempting to dig deeper into the mystery of the box's contents, perhaps the more crucial aspect is the role it plays in shaping Dingo's connections and experiences with the people around him."},{"instruction":"8D She 's a fashion design major and a Junior and really nice and cool and stuff . Loves itOh oh oh ! The bathrooms are so weird . They have a bunch of toilets with stalls , but the stalls are so short you can see over them just by standing next to them . Answer the following question: Why does the narrator feel a bit violated from a privacy standpoint at school ?","output":"Step 1: Identify the source of the narrator's discomfort In this text, the narrator mentions that \\"the bathrooms are so weird\\" and specifically points out the short stalls in the restrooms. Step 2: Understand the importance of privacy in restrooms Restrooms are typically designed with privacy in mind, using stalls with doors or partitions that provide a private space for individuals to use the facilities. The height of stalls is an important aspect in ensuring this privacy. Step 3: Analyze the narrator's experience in the restroom The narrator experiences a lack of privacy when using the restroom at school because the stalls are short, and people can see over them by simply standing next to them. This means that the narrator cannot use the facilities without potentially being in view of others, leading to a feeling of vulnerability and exposure. Step 4: Relate the restroom layout to the narrator's feeling of violation The design of the restrooms, lacking in adequate privacy, leaves the narrator feeling violated. The lack of respecting personal boundaries within a space where privacy is generally expected leads to this uncomfortable experience. In conclusion, the narrator feels a bit violated from a privacy standpoint at school because the restroom stalls have been poorly designed, leading to a lack of privacy and personal space. This leaves the narrator feeling exposed and vulnerable when using the facilities."},{"instruction":"Article: Because the moral is the center of a fable, it’s often helpful to begin outlining your fable by determining the moral. The moral of a fable should relate to or reflect on a culturally pertinent issue that will resonate with many people. Some examples of famous fable morals to help inspire you include: \\"Like will draw like.\\" \\"The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.\\" \\"Advice prompted by selfishness should not be heeded.\\" \\"Fine feathers don't make fine birds.\\" \\"Strangers should avoid those who quarrel among themselves.\\" For a complete listing of the morals of Aesop's Fables and links to the stories in which they appear, go here. The problem is what will drive the action of the fable, and it will be the primary source for the lesson to be learned. Because the nature of fable is to convey culturally-relevant lessons and ideas, the central problem works best when it’s something to which many people can relate. For example, in \\"The Tortoise and the Hare,\\" we are are quickly introduced to what will be the central problem or conflict of the story when two characters decide to hold a race. Determine who or what the characters in your fable will be and what traits will define them. Because fables are meant to be simple and concise, don’t aim for complex or multi-faceted characters. Rather, aim to have each character embody a single human trait and keep the characters within those specific limits. As the characters will be the primary vehicle for the fable’s moral, choose characters that will most clearly relate to that moral. In \\"The Tortoise and the Hare\\" the characters are, as the title indicates, a tortoise and a hare. Because a tortoise is easily associated with things that are slow-moving and the hare with things that are swift, the characters already have what will be their key traits in the story built-in. Though the kind of animal or object you choose for your character will have objective traits built-in, as above, you'll also need to craft the subjective qualities attached to those traits. In \\"The Tortoise and the Hare,\\" the tortoise's slowness is associated with level-headedness and persistence, while the hare's swiftness is associated with rashness and over-confidence. There are a number of classic archetypal characters used in fables that are broadly recognized and associated with particular human traits. Choosing two characters with opposing traits is often useful in setting up a clear conflict for the story. Some of the most common archetypes and their characteristics include: The lion: strength, pride The wolf: dishonesty, greed, rapaciousness The donkey: ignorance The fly: wisdom The fox: cleverness, trickiness, cunning The hawk: bossiness, absolutism The hen: conceitedness The lamb: innocence, shyness Where will the events of the story take place? As when choosing the moral and the problem, choose a setting that will be simple and recognizable to most people. The setting should also lend itself to the characters and their particular relationships. Try to make the setting simple but vivid--it should be a place readers can easily recognize and understand, which will save you having to explicitly lay out the details of the surroundings. For example, in the well known fable of the tortoise and the hare, the setting is simply a road through a forest, which sets the stage for the action (a race down the road) and lends itself to the kinds of characters in the story (woodland creatures). The resolution should be satisfying as well as relevant to the other components of the story, including the characters, their relationships, and the setting. Consider how the characters will resolve the conflict and how that resolution will support the lesson and moral to be taken from the story. For example, in \\"The Tortoise and the Hare\\" the resolution is simple--the hare, in his rashness, loses the race through the forest to the persevering tortoise. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to outline and create a fable. A fable is a short story that teaches a moral or a lesson. To make a fable, you need to think of the moral, choose characters with specific traits, and decide on a simple setting.

Jim is hired as night cleanup boy at Target. On his first shift at his new job, Jim is locked alone in the store by his boss, the head custodian, who leaves him there until his shift ends at 7 am. He encounters Josie McClellan (Jennifer Connelly), a stereotypical \\"spoiled rich girl\\" who he has known all his life from school, though they were worlds apart. Josie had spent the past several hours asleep in a dressing room after backing out of shoplifting some merchandise in a half-hearted attempt to run away from her abusive father, Roger Roy McClellan (Noble Willingham). Josie and Jim begin to connect with each other, realizing they are not so different, and Josie convinces Jim to run away with her.

The women allegedly smeared a deadly chemical over Kim Jong-nam's face at a Malaysia airport earlier this month. They have said they thought they were taking part in a TV prank. \\"They will be charged in court under Section 302 of the penal code,\\" the attorney general said, which is a murder charge with a mandatory death sentence if found guilty. He said no decision had yet been taken on whether to charge a North Korean man, Ri Jong Chol, who is also being held over the killing. That \\"depends on the outcome of the police investigation, which is still ongoing\\", Mr Apandi was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. The two women - Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam and Siti Aisyah from Indonesia - are among some 10 suspects identified by Malaysia as being involved in the killing. The other suspects include a senior official at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur and a staff member of the state airline. South Korea believes at least four suspects are North Korean spies. A high-level delegation from North Korea - led by the former ambassador to the UN - arrived in the Malaysian capital on Tuesday. They said they were seeking the retrieval of the body and the release of Ri Jong Chol, as well as the \\"development of friendly relationships\\" between North Korea and Malaysia. North Korea has not confirmed that the person killed on 13 February at Kuala Lumpur airport was Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of leader Kim Jong-un, saying only he was a North Korean travelling on a diplomatic passport. Kim Jong-nam, 42, was at a check-in desk for a flight to Macau, where he lives, when he was accosted. He was smeared with a very high amount of the toxic nerve agent VX and died in pain within 15-20 minutes, Malaysia's health minister said on Sunday. Little is known for definite about Doan Thi Huong and Siti Aisyah except that they had left their homes in different parts of Asia and were trying to make a living in Malaysia. Malaysian police officials described Ms Huong, a 28-year-old from Vietnam, as an \\"entertainment outlet employee\\" while Ms Siti, 25 from Indonesia, was working in a hotel massage parlour. It is clear they lived precarious existences, reports the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes who has been researching the story. Ms Huong's Facebook page, in which she posted under the name Ruby Ruby, showed her posing in a number of selfies and glamour shots. There are rumours she once auditioned for Vietnam's version of Pop Idol. Her family said she left her home village in north Vietnam at 17 to study in the capital Hanoi, and had rarely returned home since. They said they were surprised to learn she was in Malaysia. Her stepmother told BBC Vietnamese that the family were fed up with all the attention they had received but were grateful for the support of their neighbours. \\"They are sympathetic because they don't understand how a daughter of a family with high moral values like us could become like that,\\" Nguyen Thi Vy, 54, said. Siti Aisyah was arrested for the killing along with her 26-year-old Malaysian boyfriend, who was later released on bail. She told the Indonesian embassy officials that she thought she was taking part in a reality TV show, and had been paid 400 Malaysian ringgit (90; Â£72) to smear what she thought was baby oil on to Mr Kim's face. Ms Siti was out partying with her friends the night before the killing. A friend, who spoke anonymously, said they had been celebrating her birthday, which had been the day before. Film footage purportedly from the evening shows her talking with friends about becoming an internet star. Ri Jong Chol, 47, is a North Korean who has lived in Malaysia for the last three years. He is in Malaysian detention. The Malaysian boyfriend of Siti Aisyah, Muhammad Farid Jalaluddin, was arrested but police said he would be released on bail. Hyon Kwang Song, 44, second secretary at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur is being sought by police. He is believed to be in the embassy in Kuala Lumpur.

The answer is:","output":"To accurately answer the question about when the Niue Hotel was destroyed by a cyclone, we would require specific information about which Niue Hotel is being referred to and from which time period, as there might be several instances of hotels on Niue Island being damaged due to various cyclones in the past. However, I can provide some background on Niue Island, its cyclone history, and possible methods to find the exact date of the event. Niue Island is a small island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean. It is situated approximately 2,400 kilometers northeast of New Zealand and is often referred to as 'The Rock of Polynesia.' The climate of Niue is tropical with a rainy season from November to April and a dry season from May to October. Cyclones are natural hazards in this region, mainly occurring during the rainy season. There have been several instances of cyclones affecting Niue, causing damage to infrastructure, homes, and hotels. Some notable cyclones that have impacted Niue Island include: 1. Cyclone Ofa in February 1990 2. Cyclone Heta in January 2004 3. Cyclone Wilma in January 2011 4. Cyclone Tino in January 2020 However, this information may not precisely pinpoint the specific cyclone and date on which the Niue Hotel was destroyed. To find exact information about the event, some possible methods are: 1. Historical records and archives: Researching historical documents, newspaper articles, and reports from Niue Island or neighboring countries might hold information about the cyclone that destroyed the Niue Hotel and the date of the event. 2. Government sources and disaster management organizations: Contacting reliable sources such as the government departments or disaster management organizations in Niue or nearby countries could provide information about cyclones that affected the island, including the date when the hotel was destroyed. 3. Online articles and forums: Searching the internet for articles, online forums, or blogs about Niue's history or its cyclones might lead to information about the exact event. 4. Academic research: Some academic researchers focus on the history, climate, and disasters of particular regions. Identifying and reaching out to such an expert in the South Pacific region could potentially yield information about the cyclone destruction date. Once the specific cyclone and related details are identified, the elaborate answer to the question would include the cyclone's name, the date when the cyclone formed, and any additional details such as the cyclone strength or its consequences on Niue Island."},{"instruction":"Q: A text is given in Hindi.

And I was wondering How would Kai feel as a result? Available choices: A). happy; B). loved; C). upset; Answer:","output":"C). Upset Kai is likely to feel upset for several reasons following the incident with Robin slamming the door behind him and locking it. Here is a detailed explanation of why Kai would feel this way: 1. Suddenness of the action: The abruptness of Robin slamming the door and locking it can startle Kai and put him in a defensive state of mind. People generally do not react well to sudden, aggressive actions, especially when they are directed towards them. 2. Lack of communication: People often have a hard time processing events when there is no clear communication or explanation accompanying those events. If Robin did not give any reason for their actions, Kai might feel confused and frustrated. 3. Feeling of rejection: The act of slamming the door and locking it can be perceived as a strong sign of disapproval or dismissal. This can lead to feelings of rejection or unworthiness for Kai, as he might interpret this behavior as a way to distance himself from Robin. 4. Aggressive behavior: Slamming a door and locking it could signal anger or hostility from Robin. This might further trigger feelings of unease, anxiety, or even fear in Kai, depending on the nature of their relationship and past experiences. 5. Disruption in the relationship: Whether Kai and Robin are friends, family members, or romantic partners, this type of behavior can drive a wedge between them. It is a sign that there is some unresolved conflict or deep-seated issue affecting their connection. This disruption can create feelings of uncertainty, insecurity, and sadness in Kai. 6. Loss of control: Being locked out without any warning or understanding can make Kai feel helpless and victimized. This loss of control can be emotionally challenging to navigate, potentially leading to a cascade of negative emotions. In conclusion, Kai would most likely feel upset because of Robin's actions: slamming the door and locking it behind him. This response is rooted in the suddenness and lack of communication, leading to feelings of rejection, exposure to aggressive behavior, disruption in their relationship, and a loss of control. These aspects all contribute to a complex emotional response that encapsulates the underlying reasons why Kai would not feel happy or loved after this experience."},{"instruction":"(EL) Arvoisa puhemies, pyysin puheenvuoroa selventääkseni, että alustavassa mietinnössäni sivuutin asian, jota myöskään kollegani täällä eivät ole vielä maininneet.

In my preliminary report, I focused on several key aspects concerning our current situation, analyzing the relevant facts and discussing potential solutions. Unfortunately, I failed to address a significant topic, which I would like to bring to your attention now. To provide some context, the report dealt primarily with economic, social, and environmental aspects that require our immediate attention and effort. As we know, these issues are crucial for the sustainable development and prosperity of our society. My colleagues have also addressed these aspects during their interventions, highlighting the importance of collaboration and strategic planning in order to tackle these challenges effectively. However, there is another aspect that was left unmentioned – the importance of education and the role it plays in fostering innovation and creativity. The rapid development of modern technologies and the evolving nature of our economy call for a new educational approach that can accommodate these changes. Investing in education is not only essential for the personal development and wellbeing of our citizens but also instrumental in building an educated and skilled workforce that can contribute to and maintain our economic growth. As our world continues to advance, the demand for highly skilled professionals in various sectors increases. We need individuals who possess the knowledge, skills, and critical thinking abilities necessary to adapt to a constantly changing landscape. To address this unmentioned issue, I propose a comprehensive approach that considers the key aspects of educational reform: 1. Modernizing educational infrastructure: This would involve upgrading schools, colleges, and universities to ensure that they have access to the latest technologies and resources. This includes improving access to digital tools for both teachers and students, providing adequate training and continuous professional development. 2. Reinforcing teacher training and development: To provide high-quality education, it is necessary to have well-prepared educators who can adapt to new methodologies and strategies. Offering ongoing training and professional development opportunities can enhance their skills, and consequently, improve the overall educational experience for students. 3. Curriculum reform: It is vital to revise the existing educational programs to ensure they align with the current and future demands of our society and the labor market. This involves incorporating subjects such as digital literacy, entrepreneurship, and environmental sustainability, which are crucial for our future success. 4. Developing a culture of lifelong learning: Encouraging and supporting the pursuit of lifelong learning beyond formal education can help individuals adapt to the ever-changing demands of the job market, facilitating their reintegration into the workforce and promoting their growth on a personal and professional level. 5. Enhancing collaboration between educational institutions and businesses: Establishing strong connections and partnerships between schools, colleges, universities, and businesses can help create valuable synergies. This collaboration paves the way for internships, mentorship programs, and professional opportunities, providing students with real-world experiences to complement their theoretical grounding. In conclusion, it is essential that we recognize the importance of education in shaping our society's future and generating sustainable growth. The unmentioned aspect in my preliminary report and the speeches of my colleagues should be a focal point in our discussions moving forward. By investing in and prioritizing education, we are not only preparing our citizens for the challenges of an ever-changing world but also ensuring our success and prosperity as a society."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Japanese.

Eight months later he meets a Norwegian fisherman, Captain Alstad, in a sailors' bar, where a scuffle breaks out between British and Norwegian sailors (singing \\"Rule Britannia\\", egged on by Metcalfe) and German ones (singing the Nazi Party anthem the \\"Horst-Wessel-Lied\\"). Alstad takes him aboard his boat during a sea voyage in Norway's territorial waters, during which they sight the Altmark and are fired upon by a German U-boat, despite Norway's neutrality. They then come back to his home port of Langedal, and Metcalfe goes to Oslo to report this to the British embassy there, despite the best efforts of the German Kommandant and the German-sympathising local police chief Ottoman Gunter. There Metcalfe meets Frank Lockwood en route back to England from the Winter War in Finland. It was Lockwood who had got him the foreign correspondent job at the outbreak of war, but he now passes on the news to Metcalfe that he has been fired from it for sailing out with the fisherman rather than staying on dry land where the paper can contact him. Metcalfe informs the embassy, and also warns his paper of signs that a German war on Norway is imminent. Alstad's daughter Kari (who had accompanied them on their voyage) also meets him to tell him of suspicious German merchant ships at Bergen which her father suspects have troops on board.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"A smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream due to the unavailability of plants would be classified as indirectly impacting a step of the process. Plants play a crucial role in producing oxygen through the process of photosynthesis, where they convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose. A reduction in plants would mean a decrease in oxygen levels in the atmosphere, which would then affect the amount of oxygen available to be inhaled by humans and animals. However, the process of inhaling air, passing it through the lungs and bronchial tissue, and transporting oxygen to the body cells remains unchanged. The issue arises due to a decreased concentration of oxygen in the air we breathe, rather than a failure or alteration in the steps of the respiratory process itself.

Big Star was an American rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1971 by Alex Chilton, Chris Bell, Jody Stephens, and Andy Hummel. The group broke up in early 1975, and reorganized with a new lineup 18 years later following a reunion concert at the University of Missouri. In its first era, the band's musical style drew on the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Byrds. Big Star produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s. Before it broke up, Big Star created a \\"seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations,\\" in the words of Rolling Stone, as the \\"quintessential American power pop band,\\" and \\"one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock & roll\\".Big Star's first album—1972's #1 Record—was met by enthusiastic reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records, and limited distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration took its toll on band relations: Bell left not long after the first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1 Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales—Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution. After a third album, recorded in the fall of 1974, was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled Third/Sister Lovers, it found limited commercial success, but has since become a cult classic. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was killed in a car accident at the age of 27.

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo.

He was also called Abu Muhammad and Ibn al-Ridha. Because Samarra, the city where he lived, was a garrison town, he is generally known as al-Askari (Askar is the word for military in Arabic). Al-Askari married Narjis Khatun and was kept under house arrest or in prison for most of his life, until, according to some Shia sources, he was poisoned at the age of 28 on the orders of the Abbasid caliph Al-Mu'tamid and was buried in Samarra. Hasan al-Askari was born during a period when his father Ali al-Hadi, the tenth Imam, was suspected of being involved in a conspiracy against the Caliph Al-Mutawakkil. There is doubt as to whether al-Askari was born in Medina or Samarra. According to authentic shia hadith he was born in Medina on the 8th of Rabiul Akhar 232 Hijri (4 December 846 AD) and died in Samarrah Iraq on the 8th of Rabiul Awwal 260 Hijri (4 January 874) aged 28. The period of his imamate was 6 years. He was taken along with his family to Samarra in the year 230, 231 or 232 A.H., and was kept there under house arrest. In Samarra, al-Askari spent most of his time reading the Quran and the Sharia. According to Donaldson, al-Askari must also have studied languages, for in later years it was known that he could speak Hindi with the pilgrims from India, Turkish with the Turks, and Persian with the Persians. According to Shia accounts, however, it is part of the divine knowledge given to all Imams to be able to speak all human languages. It is said that even as a child, al-Askari was endowed with divine knowledge. One day a man passed by him, and saw that he was crying. The man told him he would buy a toy that he might play with. \\"No!\\" said al-Askari, \\"We have not been created for play.\\" The man was amazed at this answer and said, \\"Then, what for have we been created?\\" \\"For knowledge and worship.\\" answered the child. The man said \\"Where have you got this from?\\" Al-Askari said, \\"From the saying of God, Did you then think that We had created you in vain.\\" The man was confused, so he said, \\"What has happened to you while you are guiltless, little child?\\" al-Askari said, \\"Be away from me! I have seen my mother set fire to big pieces of firewood, but fire is not lit except with small pieces, and I fear that I shall be from the small pieces of the firewood of the Hell.\\" Al-Askari's mother, as in the case of the majority of The Twelve Imams, was a slave girl who was honoured after bearing children with the title Umm walad (mother of offspring). Her given name was Hadith, though some say she was called Susan, Ghazala, Salil, or Haribta. Al-Askari had other brothers, and among them was Ja'far who was also known as Ja'far al-Zaki or Jaffar-us-Sani. His other brother was Husayn, and together he and al-Askari were known as \\"as-Sibtayn\\", after their two grandfathers Hasan and Husayn, who were also called as-Sibtayn. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Who is the slave girl?","output":"The slave girl mentioned in the article is al-Askari's mother.

Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, expressed support for raising taxes only on households earning 1 million or more, a higher threshold than the 250,000 dividing line backed by President Obama. Eventually, Schumer and Pelosi declared their support for the president's position. But the 1 million proposal might serve as the basis for a bipartisan agreement. A number of Republicans, led by Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, have called for raising tax revenue by capping deductions at 50,000, a proposal that would leave virtually all middle-income households untouched while substantially raising average tax rates on households in the top 2% of the income distribution. A deduction cap is expected to raise roughly 800 billion in revenue above current policy, which is only half of the 1.6 trillion the Obama administration hopes to raise from high-earners. It is, however, an amount that many congressional Republicans appear to have deemed acceptable. Politics: The road to fiscal cliff paved with good intentions. One of the central problems with a deduction cap, however, is that it is likely to be opposed by politically influential charitable organizations, which recognize that it will greatly undermine the incentive for high earners to make large charitable donations. Moreover, President Obama has insisted that tax rates on high earners will have to increase, though he has not made an explicit commitment to the Clinton-era statutory top rate of 39.6% (which compares to today's top rate of 35%). So, is there a way out of this impasse? Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, along with Reps. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, Bob Dold, R-Illinois, and Mary Bono Mack, R-California, have called on congressional Republicans to back legislation that would extend all the Bush-era tax cuts except for the high-income rate reductions, which would be allowed to expire. This remains a minority view among congressional Republicans, but it may well gain support in light of the popularity of allowing the high-income rate reductions to expire. Another possibility is that congressional Republicans will embrace the Schumer-Pelosi proposal. That is, rather than embrace expiration for the high-income rate reductions for households earning 250,000 or more, they would accept it for households earning 1 million or more. This would shield a large, politically influential constituency of affluent households, a disproportionately large share of whom live in high-cost metropolitan areas in blue states, while allowing Democrats and Republicans to take a politically popular stand. Opinion: A tax we could learn to love. To raise somewhat more revenue, this threshold could be set at 500,000 or 410,000, the latter of which would more precisely target the top 1% of households by annual income. Rather than set the tax rate for this new top bracket at 39.6%, Congress could set a rate of 36% or 37%, a face-saving gesture that would contribute to an appearance of moderation. Back in 2007, Alan Viard, a tax economist at the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute, offered a detailed explanation of why increasing taxes on high-income households alone is unlikely to raise enough revenue to reach ambitious deficit reduction goals. At the time, he estimated that raising 1 trillion in additional revenue relative to the Bush-era tax code from households earning 1 million or more (500,000 for singles) would require raising the tax rate from 35% to 57%. If the goal of a millionaire's tax bracket is not to raise revenue in the most efficient manner but rather to make a political point, as seems at least somewhat plausible, it is easy to imagine it as the basis of a political compromise. The Obama administration is eager to secure more fiscal stimulus for the coming year in light of sluggish global economic growth. So a tax compromise that raises relatively little revenue is arguably desirable, at least in the short term, as it would help forestall an economic contraction. Homes, cars, jobs: Americans already making big decisions over fiscal cliff. If some small number of Republican senators from swing states are willing to cross the aisle to back a millionaire's tax bracket, President Obama will be able to claim he has a bipartisan consensus in favor of his broad approach to resolving the fiscal cliff. This in turn will make it very difficult for House Republicans to resist. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Reihan Salam. Highlights:","output":"1. Some politicians want to raise taxes only for families that earn 1 million or more. 2. Other politicians think taxes should be higher for families making 250,000 or more. 3. One idea is to limit how much people can lower their taxes using deductions. 4. This might make fewer people want to give money to charities. 5. A final decision needs to be made to help the country's money situation."},{"instruction":"Dirda on Books Each week Dirda's name appears -- in unmistakably big letters -- on page 15 of The Post's Book World section. If he's not reviewing a hefty literary biography or an ambitious new novel, he's likely to be turning out one of his idiosyncratic essays or rediscovering some minor Victorian classic. Although he earned a Ph.D. in comparative literature from Cornell, Dirda has somehow managed to retain a myopic 12-year-old's passion for reading. He particularly enjoys comic novels, intellectual history, locked-room mysteries, innovative fiction of all sorts. These days, Dirda says he still spends inordinate amounts of time mourning his lost youth, listening to music (Glenn Gould, Ella Fitzgerald, Diana Krall, The Tallis Scholars), and daydreaming (\\"my only real hobby\\"). He claims that the happiest hours of his week are spent sitting in front of a computer, working. His most recent books include \\"Readings: Essays and Literary Entertainments\\" (Indiana hardcover, 2000; Norton paperback, 2003) and his self-portrait of the reader as a young man, \\"An Open Book: Coming of Age in the Heartland\\" (Norton, 2003). In the fall of 2004 Norton will bring out a new collection of his essays and reviews. He is currently working on several other book projects, all shrouded in the most complete secrecy. Dirda joined The Post in 1978, having grown up in the working-class steel town of Lorain, Ohio and graduated with highest honors in English from Oberlin College. His favorite writers are Stendhal, Chekhov, Jane Austen, Montaigne, Evelyn Waugh, T.S. Eliot, Nabokov, John Dickson Carr, Joseph Mitchell, P.G. Wodehouse and Jack Vance. He thinks the greatest novel of all time is either Murasaki Shikubu's \\"The Tale of Genji\\" or Proust's \\"A la recherche du temps perdu.\\" In a just world he would own Watteau's painting \\"The Embarkation for Cythera.\\" He is a member of the Baker Street Irregulars, The Ghost Story Society, and The Wodehouse Society. He enjoys teaching and was once a visiting professor in the Honors College at the University of Central Florida, which he misses to this day. Michael Dirda: Welcome to Dirda on Books! I\\"m in the public library in Virginia Beach, where I've spent the past three days with my family, swimming, eating seafood, riding bicycles on the boardwalk and in general behaving like a normal American on vacation. I'll be back in DC this evening, and am rather looking forward to it. After a while the sun starts to get to me and I find myself daydreaming about going native. In these daydreams I am, of course, just slightly older than my own sons and I have their swimmer's builds and muscles. I wear sunglasses and draw admiring glances from women of all ages. And . . . Well, we don't really want to go here, do we? So it's probably wise that I get back to work soon. Anyway, let's go to this week's questions (gosh, I sound like talk show host). Lenexa, Kan.: Mr. Dirda: In your \\"Bound to Please\\" essay on the great Brazilian writer, Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, you write: \\"Yet like Samuel Beckett or Thomas Bernhard, Machado covers his pessimism with a cloak of high spirits--the kind touched with gallows humor and an Olympian resignation before the sheer foolishness of mankind.\\" Jog my memory. I can't think who \\"Thomas Bernhard\\" is? (I'll probably regret displaying my ignorance.) I hope to get to Machado's \\"Dom Casmurro\\" in a year or two (your synopsis made it sound interesting). Professor Burt had the novel in his second hundred. Thanks much. Michael Dirda: Thomas Bernhard was the great Austrian novelist and playwright, who famously loathed his country for its Nazi sympathies and Catholic consevativism. Many of his books were reprinted by the University of Chicago, the best known being Correction, Concrete, The Loser (which features a fictinoalized Glenn Gould), and Extinction. I reviewed Extinction and thought to include it in Bound to Please. Fact is, I thought it was in the book, but I must have left out that essay at the last minute because the book was already so long. Boston, Mass.: I've gone into a variety of new bookstores lately, and I've noticed something a bit peculiar. The stock of a good bookstore can seem fairly close to a mediocre bookstore, but something in the good store (layout, organization, displays, browsing happy customers) makes me want to move into the store and set up camp, exploring new books for the rest of my life. Yet if motivated, I could probably find many of the same books in the dull, mall- ish Barnes and Nobles down the street. Michael Dirda: Well, independent booksellers know that what they offer is a place that reflects their own tastes, not that of some corporate headquarters. They know their stock, read books themselves, and hand-sell favorites. This isn't to say that you don't find some of this in a Borders or B and N, but smaller places can offer you individual attention, make you feel as if your passion for books made you part of the literary scene in your town and not just a consumer plunking down cash for a best seller. Jonesborough, Tenn.: Have you read the debut novel of Rufus Hill's called THAD DUVAL FROM ROBERTSON? I'm right excited about it. It's laid in the South in the early '60s (before the \\"sexual revolution\\" AND before the most active part of the civil rights movement in the South). It's essentially a love story. But early in the book it presents a moral dilemma of the protagonist (I won't call him a hero)if he shoud go to a brothel to \\"become a man\\" (things were kinda different 40 years ago!). And later there is the moral dilemma of whether the young lawyer protagonist should defend his family's cook's 16-year-old son in court, after the boy tries to integrate the town's high school ostensibly alone(which was courageous) but who is caught lying twice and even seems threatening to the young lawyer who has bailed him out of jail. One can get the book on Amazon.com or in your area, Mr. Dirda, at Politics and Prose in DC. Michael Dirda: Thank you for the recommendation. It does sound interesting, if only for its linking of the two kinds of revolution for which the 60s are known. Philadelphia, Pa.: What is your opinion of John Fowles (particularly \\"Daniel Martin\\"). Is he still actively writing? Michael Dirda: I've not read Daniel Martin, but I do know it's a book that divided Fowles' admirers. Some found it flat and uninvolving after the excitements of The Magus and The Collector, for instance. Fowles' journals were recently published in England and a biography appeared earlier this year. But the novelist suffered a stroke a few years back and his fiction writing days are apparently over. Indeed, it's possible he may have died without my knowing it. It's even possible that he may have died and I never saw the notice. Apparently Fowles the private man was fairly disagreeable and exploitatitve of those around him. But isn't that the way of artists? twin cities: New Michael Chabon or new John Irving? Any idea if author Geln Gold of Carter Beats the Devil has any plans for a new novel? Michael Dirda: Chabon. Don't know about a new Glen Gold. Poor guy, he must spend his time explaining that he's not the pianist. If you like books about magic, you might try the three or four Houdini detective novels by Dan Stashower. There's also an apepaling recent book on the history of the famous Indian Rope Trick. And of course you should check out Christopher Priest's wonderful The Prestige and the nonfiction albums of Ricky Jay. Dirda Fan: Hi Michael, Just finished John Le Carre's THE CONSTANT GARDENER, which I very much enjoyed. Le Carre's still at the top of his craft and it's a fairly compelling read. I'm actually looking forward to seeing the film adaptation later this month as well. But what struck me about the book is the overarching timeliness of the subject: multinational pharmaceutical corporations running amok, bribing politicians, attacking or even killing whistleblowers, all the while letting new drugs be tested on people that clearly are dangerous to them due to the inadequancy of clinical trials. Throw in the AIDS situation in Africa and have you a highly volatile mix that makes me wonder if art is imitating life or vice versa. My question: can you think of any of other recent novels that so expertly definined a topical issue at the time of their publication that made the book resonate with readers? Many thanks. Michael Dirda: Hmm. There must be plenty, but I\\"m drawing a blank---too much time lying on a blanket recently--so maybe others can offer suggestions. Colorado Springs, Colo.: There's been a bit of buzz surrounding Paul Anderson's 12-years-in-the-writing, 1300 page debut novel. Have you read it? Should jaded readers assume any correlation between book and hype (a la Donna Tartt's first novel)? Michael Dirda: I've seen the book--it's the one about Sor Juana de la Cruz, right? (Sor Juana was a Mexican nun from very early in the European conquest of the Americas, who became a major poet, much admired by Carlos Fuentes among others). It could be great, but I couldn't face reading it. There was a time when I read and reviewed lots of meganovels--I admire the ambition that tries to embrace a nation or a time period in a single volume--and so wrote pieces on Harold Brodkey's Runaway Soul, Pychon's Mason and Dixon, Gass's The Tunnel, DeLillo's Underworld, and several others, most recently Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell and even The Historian. I've jsut read a longish fantasy novel by Paul Park too. So I can't advise you on this new Anderson book. Michael Dirda: By the way, folks, I'll need to relog on at 2:30, so don't go away when I temporarily stop typing to do so. I\\"ve jsut been alerted that I have less than 10 minutes left for now. Annapolis, Md.: Hello Michael and Fellow Bibliophiles, I've just discovered a new to me author that I just adore, Charles de Lint. I've finished his novels \\"Someplace to be Flying\\" and \\"Trader\\" and I am just in awe; provocative plots, fantastic writing, I could go on and on. I am also slowly savoring his short story collection \\"Dreams Underfoot.\\" I feel I need to pace myself or I'll run through his catalogue too fast and be feeling bereft too soon. I did also stumble on another book with a similar urban fantasy flavor, \\"Child of a Rainless Year\\" by Jane Lindskold. She's not quite as good as de Lint, but still several notches above most modern fiction. Any leads to other authors in this direction? Michael Dirda: I only know De Lint from his column in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, but he's been around for quite a while as contemporary practitioner of a kind of urban fantasy. YOu might enjoy Tim Powers or James Blaylock, though they do tend to set many of their books in the 19th century, but not all. In one Powers book the Tarot and Las Vegas are somehow melded. (Melded, quite tha apposite word, if I do say so for books about cards. Sigh--has it come to this, Dirda, that you've sunk to congratulating yourself on your diction? Pitiful.) Washington, DC: Hi there Michael. Do you have an opinion of author Mordecai Richler? I sometimes find his work quite humorous, any thoughts? Michael Dirda: Yes, he's very funny. Duddy Kravits, Solomon Gursky, St. Urbain's Horseman are all very fine novels about Jewish-Canaidan life. Casa de Oro, Calif: Michael, you have let us know about your musical favorites as well as the books. I am listening to my iTunes selections while I sit here today and I think about how my emotions can be manipulated with music, but not so much with reading. Do you find this to be true also? Michael Dirda: My computer time will be out in less than two minutes. So please stick around while I re-sign on. I'll stick my answer to the music question on to the next reply I send, along with that reply. If this is clear. Michael Dirda: Okay, I'm back. Favorite music? I have a little section on this in my forthcoming book from Holt, but in general I like a lot of classical music, especially the Mozart operas Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni, as well as Wagner's Tristan and lots of Puccini. That betrays my sentimental side, and so I also find myself growing weepy over 60s oldies, and lots of American songbook standards, especially those sung by Ella Fitzgerald, and not least I also like country and western heartbreakers, in particular songs like \\"Maybe it was Memphis\\" sung by Pam Tillis, George Strait's \\"Nobody in his right mind would've left her\\" and lots of Lorrie MOrgan and REba McEntire. I don't follow contemporary rock or hip-hop. Brooklyn, NY: Do you think there's a trend towards mega-novels? So many seem to be coming out, and I can't quite deal with it. There's no way to take a long walk in the park with a 1300-page novel. Michael Dirda: Oh, there's always been a place for the meganovel--think of Thomas Wolfe or John Dos Passos. Back in the Fifties we had Gaddis' The Recognitions and in the 60s John Barth wrote some famous essays about the literature of plenitude. Jonesborougn,TN & Anderson, S.C.: TO THE DIRDA FAN ASKING FOR RESONATING TOPICAL NOVEL: Recently in \\"STYLE\\" in your newspaper, Mr. Dirda, the \\"Washington Post\\" there was an article about a Brit whose novel about a subway in London's being bombed was published on August 7th -- day of first terror bombing in London. But I can't remember his name or title of the book. Michael Dirda: Many thanks. This is similar to the scicnce fiction author who described the making of the atomic bomb just a few months befoe the U.S. finished making one. Mount Desert Island, Maine: Last week, someone wrote in asking about books about the coast of Maine and mentioned The Secret Life of Lobsters, Trevor Corson's account of the lives of lobsters, lobstermen, and lobster scientists on Cranberry Island, just off Mount Desert Island. I work in a local bookstore on the Island and would also recommend Colin Woodard's Lobster Coast: Rebels, Rusticators, and the Struggle for a Forgotten Frontier and Philip Conkling's Lobsters Great and Small. Also new this season is Geoffrey Wolff's The Edge of Maine and John Gillis' Islands of the Mind, which encompasses stories about nearby Gotts Island and those that Odysseus encountered; the book is a cultural history of the idea of islands. In recent \\"coast of Maine\\" fiction, try Joe Coomer's Pocketful of Dreams and Beth Gutcheon's Leeway Cottage. There's also a book of wonderful local history, Jock Herron's Summer Restoration: Rosie Dresser and The Cobbler's, the story of his aunt's restoration of a dilapidated house in the summer of 1947. If that proves to be too many islands the reader could go upstairs (to Biography) and peruse Michael Dirda's An Open Book, or remain downstairs (in Collections and Essays) and look over Readings and Bound to Please. And if books prove too much the reader could pay homage to Marguerite Yourcenar by visiting her grave, just a few blocks away. Michael Dirda: Thank you for the guidance to recent books about Maine. The mention of Islands of the Mind makes my mind remember that John Fowles--whose name came up earlier today--wrote a long essay on Islands for a picture book about them. Also, whatever happen to the Maine novelist Carolyn Chute? And I would be remiss if I didn't point out that Elizabeth Hand, the fine fantasy novelist, lives in Maine. Schoeneck, Pa.: RE: Mega Novels I've SEEN the network TV coming attractions for the fall. I've LOTS of use for mega novels. Michael Dirda: TV?! Here on vacation I've channel-surfed through the motel's cable offerings and discovered that you can have 72 channels and still nothing better to watch than a marathon offering of James Bond films. Of course, there aren't many things in life better than a James Bond marathon. Minnetonka, Minn.: Michael, What is your opinion of Book Art? We have The Minnesota Center for Book Art and I recently visited the Getty Center Library and viewed their exhibit. I don't get the art object but would pay anything for an English Hound with dust jacket. Michael Dirda: Would you settle for a German dachshund in lederhosen? Getting silly here, are we? I am of two minds about book art. I like pretty books, and I like illustrated books where the pictures are the sort that work for me. (I hate most of the Jane Austen illustrations that you used to see in things like the Heritage Press.) I've also studied bookbinding and have bound a couple of books, once commissioned a design binding (for a Nonesuch edition of Jeremy Taylor's Holy Living and Holy Dying), and my wedding invitation of lo these many years was done by Sheila Waters and her son Julian Waters. Sheila made the front of the invitation--caliigraphied interlocking initials--and Julian wrote out in his beautiful hand the actual details of when and where. (Sheila Waters was then widely regarded as the greatest living calligrapher; her son has been the White House calligrapher, anong other things. The, alas, late Peter Waters, husband and father, was one of the world's greatest bookbinders, having worked with Roger Powell on the rebinding of the Book of Kells and later overseen book conservation after the Florence Flood. Quite a family--the Arts and Crafts Movement in one household.) Anyway, I used to think of modern children's albums as our equivalent to the livre d'artiste and often approached them in this vein. So I guess I do approve of Book Art. Washington, D.C.: Re: Bond - Are Kingsley Amis's critical works on 007 worth checking out? Michael Dirda: Yes, he was a great fan, knew the oeuvre well, and is always fun and provocative to read. I didn't like his Bond novel, Colonel Sun, all that much. I love the fact that Amis and Larkin both adored the locked room mysteries of John Dickson Carr, these Bond books, and Dick Francis thrillers. Of course their close friend at unviersity was the the terrifically funny and witty mystery novelist Edmund Crispin. Great Falls, Va.: RE: Casa de Oro, Calif. saying that reading doesn't affect one's emotions, I strongly disagree. I can't tell you how many times I have gotten caught up in a book where it affected my mood! Two examples: as a young woman, Jane Eyre made me feel (and still does!) that I could do anything, while more recently, The Kite Runner left me feeling quite sad, and a little wiser to the ways of the world ... Just food for thought. Michael Dirda: Oh, books are terribly affection. I have a little chunk in my new book--sorry, two advertisements--about the perils of fiction. I just find reading novels, particularly sad one, like going through an emotional wringer. It takes me a long time to recover. Oscar Wilde said that he had never recovered from the death of Balzac's Lucien de Rubempre. Casa de Oro, Calif: Michaael, I had to respond to the fact that you like some country music. When I was a young kid I used to sit in front of the radio and cry over the country stuff. When my mom died recently, listening to Red River Valley allowed me to finally cry about it! Michael Dirda: Ah, Red River Valley--just about the only tune I can play on the harmonica. Of course, for many it is probably the only tune they've ever heard played on the harmonica. Washington, DC: Have you read Coleridge's Biographia Literaria (sp?). I love C's poetry and notebooks, and am thinking of dipping into this one. Thanks. Oh, and for anyone out there interested in the English Romantics, Richard Holmes's biography of Coleridge is amazing. I just finished it. Michael Dirda: Yes, I've read BL. The first half is fascinating, but the later sections grow more theoretical and philosophical and German philosophical at that. Some of the one volume selections from Coleridge's work contain long extracts and that's probably the way to approach the book. The Holmes biography--in two voluems--is splendid, and very moving. Wordsworth comes across as a first-class louse, at least in later life. And till I read volume 2 I had no idea how much Coleridge suffered from his opium addiction. I somehow used to think it was just a kind of social drugging, not realizing how physically debilitating it was (ie. an inability to evacucate the bowels, requiring constant enemas.) Holmes Shelley biography The Pursuit is also very good, as are his collections of essays Footsteps and one other the title of which escapes me. Lenexa, Kan.: I've just looked--\\"Extinction\\" is in a later (European) section of \\"Bound to Please.\\" I see you also cover Sebald who I do know and have read. I'm turned 65 today--been retired for ten years (pretty much read the ten years away). Thank you for the great help this forum has been (as was the earlier version of the Post's Book Club) to my furthering education. Hope you can keep it going for the next ten years. Best always. Michael Dirda: Happy Birthday! And many more to come. I hope we'll spend a few of them together, at least on line. Boston, Mass.: After The Great Gatsby, what F Scott Fitzgerald should one read? I've only read the classic. Michael Dirda: Tender is the Night. I actually like it more than Gatsby, though GG is pretty nigh perfect and TN has its flaws. Beyond that you might dip into the notebooks collected as The Crack Up. Brooklyn, NY: Michael, Any thoughts on Norman Cantor's biography of John of Gaunt? I loved Cantor's book on the Middle Ages, which I knew nothing about, and was excited to see this work, also on a subject about which I know nothing. But I admit to being put off by the amazon.com reviews, which claimed that it wasn't up to his usual standards. Michael Dirda: Cantor's Inventing the Middle Ages--about the modern historians who rediscovered or championed the Middle Ages--was wonderfully lively and gossippy, and as you know opinionated. Cantor writes fast, sometimes I think too fast, and he does tend to be a bit swasbuckling. This may account for the negative reviews. On the other hand, he is a knowledgable and passionate historian and fun to read. Bel Air, Md: I am currently reading \\"A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters\\" by Julian Barnes. The book purports to be a novel, but each chapter is wholly unrelated to the next and there is no chronologic, geographic, or character similarities amongst the chapters. They share similar themes and will often allude to something in another chapter, but each chapter is a self-contained story. Wouldn't this more accurately be a collection of short stories? Isn't the author just trying to be clever (and cheeky) by calling it a novel? While each story is a worthwhile read, trying to consider it a novel has left me not enjoying it as much as I might have. Michael Dirda: I reviewed the book and as I recall there are links and echoes among the stories that give the book a kind of unity. I suppose that one must expect a certain amount of heterogeneity in a history of the world. That said, Barnes is nothing if not clever in his early books--see Flaubert's Parrot--and so there is a show-offy element in them. But he's fun to read, no? Kilpen House: A few chats back, you mentioned that when asked at a public gathering which literary character you'd like to be, you said \\"Bond, James Bond.\\" My response to you was I'd have chosen Travis McGee, but it got me to thinking that although I've read much detective fiction, I'd never read the Bond series so I started on that. I've only gone though about 5 books, but I have to say I'm surprised anyone would want to be Bond. At least the Bond of the books. I think they're great, very entertaining reads, but man, the guy gets his butt kicked a ton, he's beat up looking (scars on his face), he is very introspective and not always sure of himself, there are a lot of other issues but perhaps most of all, he doesn't always get the girl. Anyway, I'm enjoying them a bunch so no complaints here, I just had no idea how different the Bond books (both the Bond character and the plots) were from the movies. Moonraker? It's not a space base but an ballistic missile. The Spy Who Love Me? It is written from a woman's point of view, takes place in a mountain resort in Up-State NY, and only had Bond in about 1/2 of the chapters. I guess no real question, just can't get over my surprise in the difference between the books and movies. Michael Dirda: Yes, after the frist three Bond movies, the producers took liberaties galore and often merely used a book title as the springboard to a movie plot. The Bond of the novels is a much more hard-boiled character than the smooth urbane spy of the films. I like both avatars of the character. What I suppose I admire most about Bond is his omnicompetence and determination. Arlington, Va.: What is your opinion of Reading Lolita in Tehran? I'm reading it, and at first I really liked it, but half way through I'm losing motivation to continue... Michael Dirda: Never had any interest in reading it. I like reading Lolita in Silver Spring. Oklahoma City, Okla.: At the end of last week's chat you noted that you \\"easily tire of fiction,\\" and that you were working on a book section on the \\"perils of fiction.\\" That struck a chord with me: I, too, often turn from reading fiction to biographies or nonfiction, and I think I know why. Nonfiction is essentially journalism, which only asks us to absorb fact, while fiction simply demands more of a reader. We are expected to envision scenes and characters, discern motives, anticipate plot elements . . . a true interaction between writer and reader. A \\"peril,\\" perhaps, but also a mental stimulant, no? Michael Dirda: Yes. Plus there's the emotional commitment demanded by a serious novel. Rockville, Md.: Posting early since I will be returning a child to college today. It was too late last week to respond to the one poster who was derogatory of Jim Dale and his reading of the Harry Potter books, even though he had never listened to them. I have been commuting between Rockville and northern Virginia for 9 years and books on tape have saved my sanity. I sometimes listen to two in one week. I have heard all the readers that that individual mentioned, but none of them have ever come close to Jim Dale's reading of Harry Potter. He is in a league, a class of his own. Listening to them, you can tell which of hundreds of characters is speaking from how Jim is reading it. I have no idea how he does it - pure talent. If you have never heard him, you really can have no idea how much better he is than everyone else. David Ogden Stiers' reading of Tom Wolfe's \\"A Man in Full\\" was closer than most but he still has a ways to go. I don't generally listen to mysteries, so there may be a reader or two who just focuses on that genre who might be better. But I doubt it. Michael Dirda: Thank you for this informed posting. As I've only read the first two Potters, it sounds--oh no, not another time, Dirda--as if I should listen to the Dale readings of the others. And with that, friends, it's time to bid you adieu before the library kicks me off this computer. And so, till next week, at Wednesday, keep reading! Oh yes, I'm sorry I didn't get to all the postings. Please try again.

They soon run into trouble, first narrowly avoiding another motorist, then having a sudden scare as the bridge near the cabin begins to collapse as they cross. That night, while Cheryl is making a drawing of a clock, her hand becomes violently possessed by a mysterious entity, causing her to draw a picture that looks like a book with a deformed, evil face. She fails to mention the incident to the others, dismissing it as her imagination. When the trapdoor to the cellar mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scotty go down to investigate and find the Naturom Demonto, a Sumerian version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, along with a tape recording of incantations in which, when played by Ash then Scotty, unleashes demons and evil spirits. Cheryl becomes hysterical when a tree crashes through the window, and she runs to her room. Later, she hears strange voices and goes outside to investigate. She is attacked and raped by demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape. The others do not believe her story, but Ash agrees to drive her to town where she can find a place to stay for the night. However, they find that the only bridge connecting the cabin to the rest of the world has been destroyed. Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more of the tape and while the girls play cards, Cheryl then becomes demonically possessed, telling them that the demons will kill them. She then stabs Linda in the ankle with a pencil, and Scotty locks her in the cellar. Shelly is the next to become possessed; she attacks Scotty, who eventually dismembers her with an felling axe. They bury her, and a shaken Scotty leaves to find an alternate trail through the woods. Checking on Linda, Ash discovers that she too became possessed. Scotty...

Here is a detailed and long negative review: Title: Disappointing Experience at Tasty Terrace I recently dined at Tasty Terrace with my family, and I regret to say that we had an utterly disappointing experience. I had heard mixed reviews about this place from friends and online reviewers, but I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, the food, service, and overall ambiance fell short of our expectations. To begin with, we entered the restaurant with a warm welcome from the hostess, who seated us promptly despite being busy. However, this was the only positive aspect of our visit. It took our server approximately 10 minutes to acknowledge our presence and offer us water. We ordered our drinks and appetizers straight away, as we had enough time to review the menu while waiting. The appetizers arrived well ahead of our drinks, making it difficult to enjoy them fully without something to sip on. Besides the poor timing, the appetizers themselves were lackluster. We had ordered the garlic bread and stuffed mushrooms, and unfortunately, the garlic bread was under-toasted and lacked any garlicky flavor, while the stuffed mushrooms were soggy and unappetizing. By the time our drinks arrived, we were ready to order our main courses. The menu seemed promising, but what we received was far from it. My spouse ordered the linguine with clams, which turned out to be a disaster – the pasta was overcooked and drowned in a watery, flavorless sauce. Not only that, but some of the clams were raw and inedible. My dish, the chicken alfredo, was equally disappointing. The chicken was dry and rubbery, and the alfredo sauce tasted suspiciously like it was from a jar, lacking any hint of creaminess or depth of flavor. Aside from the food quality, the overall service at Tasty Terrace left a lot to be desired. Not only did our server seldom check on us, but they also failed to clear away our dirty appetizer plates to make room for our main courses. Additionally, when we requested more water or a refill on our drinks, it ended up taking an inordinate amount of time and multiple reminders for our requests to be fulfilled. The ambiance of the restaurant also failed to impress. The dining area was dimly lit, making it difficult to see the menu, and it was also uncomfortably warm. While this may not typically be a category of criticism, in conjunction with the numerous other issues we faced during our visit, the uncomfortable atmosphere further added to our already tarnished experience. In conclusion, my family and I were extremely disappointed with our dining experience at Tasty Terrace. As much as I wanted to enjoy our night out, the terrible food, slow and inattentive service, and unpleasant ambiance left us feeling unsatisfied and frustrated. Sadly, we will not be returning, and I cannot recommend Tasty Terrace to anyone looking for a quality dining experience."},{"instruction":"Article: Anti-cheating ring brands I'M MARRIED into the flesh of your finger With Arnold, Tiger and two timing IMF guy in mind, we have created this wedding ring for people intent on cheating.

Japan, a country long regarded by the Chinese as little more than an upstart nation of pirates, annihilated the Qing government's modernized Beiyang Fleet, then deemed to be the strongest naval force in Asia. The Japanese victory occurred a mere three decades after the Meiji Restoration set a feudal Japan on course to emulate the Western nations in their economic and technological achievements. Finally, in December 1894, the Qing government took concrete steps to reform military institutions and to re-train selected units in westernized drills, tactics and weaponry. These units were collectively called the New Army. The most successful of these was the Beiyang Army under the overall supervision and control of a former Huai Army commander, General Yuan Shikai, who used his position to build networks of loyal officers and eventually become President of the Republic of China. Who beat the Chinese in the First Sino-Japanese War?","output":"The Japanese defeated the Chinese in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895.

Answer:","output":"It's difficult to predict exactly what Remy will want to do next, as individual actions and desires can vary greatly. However, based on the information provided, we can hypothesize a few possible scenarios for Remy's next actions. 1. Reflect on the situation: After teaching his older brothers a lesson, Remy might want to take some time to reflect on the situation and consider whether his actions were justified or if there might have been a better way to handle the teasing. This could help him develop better conflict resolution skills for future situations. 2. Communicate with his brothers: Remy may choose to have an open and honest conversation with his brothers about their teasing and how it affects him. He can express his feelings, explain the reasons behind his actions, and work together with them to find a solution so that they all treat each other with respect. 3. Strengthen family bonds: Having addressed the issue with his brothers, Remy might seek to strengthen their relationships by spending more time together and engaging in activities they all enjoy. This can help ensure that the teasing doesn't continue and that they build a strong, positive bond as siblings. 4. Seek advice from a trusted adult: If Remy is unsure of how to handle the situation or is, perhaps, still struggling with his brothers' teasing, he may decide to reach out to a trusted adult, such as a parent, teacher, or counselor, for guidance and support. 5. Focus on personal growth: Lastly, Remy might take this experience as an opportunity to focus on his own personal growth, building self-confidence and resilience to better handle similar situations in the future. Ultimately, the next steps for Remy will depend on his individual personality, values, and circumstances, but the scenarios provided above offer a range of possible actions he may take following his confrontation with his older brothers."},{"instruction":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? a polished and vastly entertaining caper","output":"This review has a positive opinion of the movie.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process in the given scenario involves the owl preparing to embark on its nocturnal hunting expedition. This initial phase is crucial for the owl's survival, as it relies on its extraordinary adaptations to successfully hunt and capture prey in the darkness of the night. Before the owl takes flight, it must mentally and physically prepare for the task ahead. Several factors play a role in this preparation, ensuring that the owl is ready and primed to hunt effectively. Some of these factors include: 1. Assessing environmental conditions: The owl gauges the ambient lighting, weather conditions, and possible hazards in its hunting area before venturing out. This information helps the owl in choosing the best time and place to hunt, maximizing the chances of a successful catch. 2. Evaluating energy levels and hunger: The owl takes into account its energy reserves and how hungry it is before deciding to embark on a hunt. Hunting is a demanding activity requiring strength, agility, and endurance, so the owl must ensure it has adequate energy stores before starting its pursuit of prey. 3. Grooming and preening: Just like other birds, owls meticulously groom their feathers before flight. This routine process of preening helps maintain the owl's feathers in optimal condition, ensuring its flight remains silent while improving its aerodynamic efficiency. A well-groomed owl is better equipped to navigate the night in search of prey. 4. Sharpening senses: Before embarking on a hunt, the owl fine-tunes its keen senses (sight, hearing, and touch) to effectively detect and locate prey in the dark. This process may involve adjusting its head position to enhance its auditory perception, focusing its eyes with precision to perceive minute movements, and heightening other sensory faculties essential for hunting. 5. Stretching and flexing muscles: The owl engages in a series of stretches and wing movements to warm up its muscles and ensure optimal performance during the hunt. This pre-flight routine minimizes the risk of injury and enables the owl to execute sudden bursts of speed and agility required to catch its prey. Once these preparatory steps are completed, the owl is ready to fly out into the night and begin its hunt. Employing its unique set of adaptations, including its incredible stealth, keen eyesight, and exceptional hearing, the owl is perfectly equipped to navigate the challenges of nocturnal predation and, with luck and skill, secure a meal that will sustain it through the night."},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - TriStar Pictures (spelled as Tri-Star until 1991) is an American film production/distribution studio of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, owned by the Sony subsidiary Sony Pictures Entertainment. - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California.

Firstly, the user had a particular preference for products manufactured in Japan, but was disappointed to find that the product was actually made in China. This wouldn't necessarily be an issue for every potential customer, but within the context of this review, it suggests that the user values the perceived quality associated with Japanese-manufactured goods and was let down by what they saw as false advertising from Amazon. Secondly, the user criticizes the physical quality of the product. They suggest that the product feels \\"very plastic\\" and almost breakable, which doesn't correlate with their perceived cost and expectation of the product. Thirdly, they seem to be underwhelmed by the product's functionality - particularly the carafe or vacuum lined container. The user explains that it does a basic job of keeping liquids hot for about three hours, but nothing more. They mention that it \\"serves the purpose\\" but does not excel or stand out in any way. Additionally, the user addresses the price of the product, stating that they find it expensive for what it delivers, especially being labeled as Made in China and only capable of keeping liquids hot for a short time. Considering all these points, although the user does not directly state that they would not recommend the product, their overall dissatisfaction with their purchase suggests that it's unlikely they would endorse others to buy the product.

It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - Country pop is a subgenre of country music and pop music that was developed by members of the Country genre out of a desire to reach a larger, mainstream audience. By producing country songs that employed many styles and sounds found in pop music, the country music industry was effective in gaining new listeners without alienating its traditional country audience. It is a continuation of similar efforts that began in the late 1950s originally known as Nashville sound and later on Countrypolitan. By the mid-1970s, many country artists were transitioning to the pop-country sound which led to some records charting high on mainstream top 40 as well as country \\"Billboard\\" charts. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - I 'm Leaving It All Up to You is the debut album by Donny & Marie Osmond , released in 1974 . Two singles were released from the album : \`\` I 'm Leavin ' It ( All ) Up to You '' ( US Pop # 4 , Country # 17 ) and \`\` Morning Side of the Mountain '' ( US Pop # 8 ) . - Donald Clark \\"Donny\\" Osmond (born December 9, 1957) is an American singer, actor, radio personality, and former teen idol. Osmond has also been a talk and game show host, record producer and author. In the mid-1960s, he and four of his elder brothers gained fame as the Osmonds. Osmond went solo in the early 1970s, covering such hits as \\"Go Away Little Girl\\" and \\"Puppy Love\\". - A doll is a model of a human being, often used as a toy for children. Dolls have traditionally been used in magic and religious rituals throughout the world, and traditional dolls made of materials such as clay and wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe. The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome. The use of dolls as toys was documented in Greece around 100 AD. They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, going back to the 15th century. With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced. During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles. - Olive Marie Osmond (born October 13, 1959) is an American singer, actress, doll designer, and a member of the show business family the Osmonds. Although she was never part of her family's singing group, she gained success as a solo country music artist in the 1970s and 1980s. Her best known song is a cover of the country pop ballad \\"Paper Roses\\". From 1976 to 1979, she and her singer brother Donny Osmond hosted the television variety show \\"Donny & Marie\\". - · \\"Paper Roses\\" is a popular song written and composed by Fred Spielman and Janice Torre. It first was a top five hit in 1960 for Anita Bryant with Monty Kelly's Orchestra and Chorus. Marie Osmond later covered it in 1973 and took her version to number one on the US country chart. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. - The Osmonds are an American family music group with a long and varied career a career that took them from singing barbershop music as children to achieving success as teen-music idols, from producing a hit television show to continued success as solo and group performers. The Osmonds are devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and their religious values have influenced their careers. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats.

Article: Jack London had endured more hardships by the age of twenty-one than most people experience in a lifetime. His struggles developed in him sympathy for the working class and a lasting dislike of hard work and provided inspiration for his career as a writer. London grew up in San Francisco in extreme poverty. At an early age, he left school and supported himself through a succession of un skilled jobs ----working as a paper boy, in bowling alleys, on ice wagons, and in canneries and mills. Despite working long hours at these jobs, London was able to read constantly, borrowing travel and adventure books from the library. The books London read inspired him to travel, and his job experiences led him to become active in fighting for the fights of workers. He sailed to Japan on a journey aiming at catching seals and joined a cross-country protest march with a group of unemployed workers. After being arrested for vagrancy near Buffalo, New York, London decided to educate himself and reshape his life. He quickly completed high school and entered the University of California. After only one term, however, the appeal of fortune and adventure proved uncontrollable. London gave up his studies and traveled to the Alaskan Yukon in 1897 in search of gold. Jack London was among the first of these miners. He may have searched for more than gold, however. London once commented, \\" True, the new region was mostly poor; but its several hundred thousand square miles of coldness at least gave breathing space to those who else would have choked at home.\\" Although he was unsuccessful as a miner, London's experiences in Alaska taught him about the human desire for wealth and power and about humankind's inability to control the forces of nature. While in Alaska, London also absorbed memories and stories that would make him known one hundred years later. Once back in California, London became determined to earn a living as a writer.

In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. I am facing a new situation today: People from two villages ate lots of salt. People from Salt village used regular salt, while people from Sand village people used iodized salt in their diets, after talking to specialists. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which village had fewer people experience developmental difficulties? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the information from the background article The background article states that before the development of iodized salt, some people experienced developmental difficulties due to problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. Adding iodide anion to the diet can help treat these conditions, and one easy way to get iodide is through iodized salt. Seaweed and saltwater fish are also sources of iodide. Step 2: Analyze the situation in the two villages In Salt village, people consumed regular salt, which is not iodized and does not contain the iodide anion. In Sand village, people consumed iodized salt, which contains the iodide anion their body needs to maintain proper thyroid function and prevent developmental difficulties. Step 3: Compare the two villages in terms of potential developmental difficulties Since people in Sand village consumed iodized salt, which contains the iodide anion necessary to prevent developmental difficulties, they are less likely to experience these problems. Meanwhile, people in Salt village consumed regular salt, which does not provide any iodide anion, making them more likely to face developmental difficulties due to iodine deficiency. Step 4: Answer the question Based on the information provided, the village with fewer people experiencing developmental difficulties is Sand village, as they consumed iodized salt in their diets, which helps to prevent the issues associated with iodine deficiency."},{"instruction":"Question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Caribu island, inhabited by more natives, hunted a few of the animal species there, contributing to the extinction of a few. People from Hiji island, were pescotarian, and hardly ever fished. Which island experienced more environmental degradation? Hint: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] A:","output":"Based on the given information, Caribu island experienced more environmental degradation compared to Hiji island. Caribu island has a larger native population that hunted some of the animal species present on the island, leading to the extinction of a few species. The extinction of these species can have significant impacts on the food web and the food chain of the island's ecosystem. As one species disappears, it can lead to coextinction or adverse effects on the other species that are dependent on it, either directly or indirectly. This, in turn, results in a reduction of biodiversity on Caribu island, negatively affecting its ecosystem services and stability. On the other hand, Hiji island inhabitants were pescotarian, primarily consuming fish, and hardly ever fished. Thus, they did not significantly contribute to the local reduction or loss of species in their habitat. By maintaining a more stable and less impacted ecosystem, Hiji island likely experienced less environmental degradation compared to Caribu island. While global extinction is irreversible and has more dramatic consequences, even small changes in species composition at local levels can lead to diverse ecological effects. In the case of these two islands, the difference in human activities (hunting and fishing habits) has led to a higher level of environmental degradation on Caribu island due to the loss of biodiversity resulting from hunting."},{"instruction":"Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

Tibetan Antelopes Tibetan antelopes are medium-sized animals. They mainly feed on grass. They are usually found in groups of about 20. They are killed for their wool, which is warm, soft and fine and can be made into expensive clothes. Although people can get the wool without killing the animals, people simply kill them before taking the wool. The number of them is dropping year by year. There are less than 75,000 Tibetan antelopes left in the world, down from a million 50 years ago. Golden Monkeys Golden monkeys are mainly found in Sichuan, Gansu, Shanxi provinces and Shengnongjia mountainous area of Hubei Province. Golden monkeys have golden-orange fur. They move around in the daytime, usually in groups of as many as 100 to 200 heads, or 20 to 30 heads. They feed on fruits and young leaves of bamboos. But people are destroying the environment where they live. Trees and bamboos are disappearing, so golden monkeys have less and less to eat. Elephans ks5u Elephants are very big and strong.

The hardware was designed by Asus and Google together, and it just can’t be matched in terms of 7-inch tablet value. For one thing, it’s the world’s only quad-core 7-inch tablet, and it will sell for 200 with 8GB of storage and 250 with 16GB of storage. The Google Play storefront has the tablet on pre-order now for shipment in mid-July. Inside is Nvidia’s Tegra 3 quad-core processor, a 12-core Nvidia GPU and 1GB of RAM. These internals give the Nexus 7 plenty of speed and processing power. When I first turned on the tablet, and logged into my Google account and began downloading content, swiping between different home screens was a bit stuttery. It wasn’t any worse than what I’ve experienced on other tablets, but I didn’t get the feeling the Nexus 7 was brimming with category-leading components. That, however was a temporary problem. After just a few minutes — and after the Nexus 7 had finished downloading a ton of content, all at the same time — the tablet’s speed was apparent. I’ll put it simply: The Nexus 7 is a wicked fast tablet that can effortlessly switch between apps, stream HD video, play songs, and launch magazines. On top of all that, everything looks good on the Nexus 7’s 1280 x 800 touchscreen — books, movies, magazines, games and apps. The main home screen features a widget called My Library that shows books, magazines, music, TV shows and movies you’ve recently read, watched or listened to. If you haven’t yet purchased anything from the Google Play storefront, you’ll still discover content in these buckets, as Google is giving away some items for free with its Nexus 7 launch. These include the movie Transformers: Dark of the Moon, a few songs, a copy of the Bourne Dominion novel, and a few magazine trials — Esquire, Popular Science, and Family Circle. A 25 credit to spend in Google Play is included as well. On the other home screens, there are widgets for the specific types of content Google sells — My Movies, My Music, My Books and My Magazines. Kindle Fire, much? Below those widgets, distributed across the five home screens, are recommendation widgets that Google has built in to suggest what other movies, music, books or magazines you might like based on what you’ve already purchased. The widgets are nicely designed, showing off movie posters, album covers, and magazines in inviting detail. A tap on any image sucks you directly into that piece of content to read or play back quickly. The widgets are removable, but the design is attractive, and the hardware allows for quick recommendation updates without slowing down the device. Before the Nexus 7, these widgets didn’t exist. Make no mistake, Google wants consumers to understand that it’s very easy to read, watch, listen to, and buy digital media on this tablet. The Kindle Fire won over consumers with a low price, ease of use, and a focus on entertainment. It was essentially a portable doorway into Amazon’s online storefront, which is the largest in the world. Google wants consumers to see the Nexus 7 the same way — easy and fun to use. The operating system, Google’s Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, runs smoothly and quickly. There’s no hesitation when launching apps or playing games. And, this being a Nexus device, all of Jelly Bean’s new features are here in the Nexus 7, including Google voice search, which talks back to you in a new challenge to Apple’s Siri. Time will tell if the Asus-Google collaboration is able to convince consumers to hop on board. I still have plenty of testing ahead with the Nexus 7 — I haven’t even yet tried out the front-facing camera or NFC features. But already I’m finding the latest Android tablet to be very easy to use, and even fun. I think Asus and Google have a winner here. ||||| After a week of successful introductions to the new Asus-built Nexus 7 tablet, the latest version of Android (nicknamed Jelly Bean), and its first self-manufactured hardware product in the Nexus Q, Google’s week is ending on a sour note. Apple has reportedly won an injunction against the Samsung Galaxy Nexus smartphone, Google’s flagship Android handset. Jelly Bean is supposed to make its public debut on the Nexus 7 and the Galaxy Nexus in mid-July. But on Friday, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh granted a preliminary injunction that will halt U.S. sales of the Galaxy Nexus, according to a Reuters report. The decision closely follows Koh’s Wednesday ruling that won Apple an injunction against another Android-powered Samsung device, the Galaxy 10.1 tablet. Though not a party in the lawsuit, Google emailed Wired a statement on the injunction, saying: “We’re disappointed with this decision, but we believe the correct result will be reached as more evidence comes to light.” Samsung and Apple did not respond for comment by the time of publication. And the official court ruling is not yet publicly available. According to Dan Levine, a Reuters reporter on site at the ruling, Judge Koh handed out paper copies of her decision to issue the temporary sales ban to both Apple’s and Samsung’s attorneys on Friday afternoon. ||||| Apple's ridiculous patent assault against Samsung finally hits Google, which suddenly looks genius for choosing Asus to manufacture the Nexus 7 tablet. On Friday, US District Judge Lucy Koh issued a preliminary injunction against Galaxy Nexus, which is Google's flagship, stock Android smartphone. Days earlier she barred Galaxy Tab 10.1. For the preliminary injunction to go into effect, Apple must first put up 96 million. What timing. To preview Android 4.1 Jellybean, the company gave one to each of more than 5,000 developers during Google I/O earlier this week. The new OS releases to Motorola XOOM tablets and Galaxy Nexus in mid-July, making the smartphone the first to get the important upgrade. The preliminary injunction would somewhat stymie Jellybean distribution ahead of iO6, which Apple is months from releasing. New features include voice response, that in BetaNews testing smoke Apple's Siri. If you're thinking about buying Galaxy Nexus, don't wait! The injunction hinges on rather vague US Patent no. 8,086,604 -- a \\"universal interface for retrieval of information in a computer system”. From the patent: The present invention provides convenient access to items of information that are related to various descriptors input by a user, by means of a unitary interface which is capable of accessing information in a variety of locations, through a number of different techniques. Using a plurality of heuristic algorithms to operate upon information descriptors input by the user, the present invention locates and displays candidate items of information for selection and/or retrieval. Thus, the advantages of a search engine can be exploited, while listing only relevant object candidate items of information. Apple looks desperate from the looks of things, as it wants to restrict sales of old products. While Galaxy Nexus will initially be the main device for Jellybean, it's not considered a top-seller and Google and Samsung jointly launched the phone in October. In the United States, Sprint and Verizon sell the LTE model locked and subsidized, while Google offers the HSPA+ Galaxy Nexus unlocked. Judge Koh granted the injunction, accepting Apple claims of irreparable harm because of \\"long-term loss of market share\\". These words speak for themselves in this case. Apple claims that the Galaxy Nexus has dented their market share, which is really laughable, considering Samsung Galaxy S II is by measure of many millions the bigger seller. The lawyers must be pleased with their finding, as it took them 7 months to find it. Maybe they're laughing, too, at their snookering the judge. The fact that Apple is going for products that don’t have much market time left in them also speaks volumes about the philosophy of CEO Tim Cook. On one hand, during last quarter's earnings conference call, he claims that he doesn’t like to go to court; but, on the other hand, he sues a competitor to get an injunction for a 7-month old product, which is close to its end-of-life. Apple got the preliminary injunction after failing to bar Samsung Galaxy S III and gaining temporary ban against HTC One X. That Samsung has done so poorly in the courts might be one explanation Google chose Asus for the Nexus 7 tablet. Samsung is Apple's largest competitor and, and as such, takes the most legal attacks -- all while iPhone and iOS fall behind Android. Apple's patent lawsuits can only hurt their public image and align people against them. Earlier this month my colleague Joe Wilcox boycotted Apple for being a \\"patent bully\\". Apple’s behavior looks more like continuation of late-Steve Jobs personal vendetta against all Android phone manufacturers basically and it’s an appalling way to gain temporary increase in market share. The only ones affected are, as always, the fans of Google/Samsung that want to buy the Galaxy Nexus. Apple is subtly telling the world that it doesn’t matter what anyone wants and that they’ve got the resources to find any possible reason to stop them from getting what they want. And they’re doing a great job at it, too. ||||| Hugo Barra, director of product management of Google, holds a Samsung Galaxy Nexus mobile phone during Google I/O 2012 Conference at Moscone Center in San Francisco, California June 27, 2012. SAN JOSE, California A U.S. judge on Friday granted Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) request for a pre-trial injunction against the sale of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's (005930.KS) Galaxy Nexus phone, handing the iPhone maker its second legal victory against Samsung in a week. Apple and Samsung, the world's largest consumer electronics corporations, are waging legal war in several countries, accusing each other of patent violations as they vie for supremacy in a fast-growing market for mobile devices. Friday's decision, by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, comes days after she also slapped a pre-trial ban on sales of Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1, a tablet computer that runs on Google Inc's (GOOG.O) Android and goes toe-to-toe with the iPad. The back-to-back triumphs - significant because pre-trial injunctions are rarely granted - meant Apple had a better week in court than last week, when Chicago federal court judge Richard Posner ruled the iPhone maker could not pursue an injunction against Google's Motorola Mobility, effectively ending that case. \\"Apple has made a clear showing that, in the absence of a preliminary injunction, it is likely to lose substantial market share in the smartphone market and to lose substantial downstream sales of future smartphone purchases and tag-along products,\\" Judge Koh said in Friday's ruling. Koh scheduled a hearing on Monday to consider whether to put the Galaxy Nexus injunction on hold pending appeal. And she said in court that she might rule on Sunday whether or to similarly put on hold the earlier injunction on the Galaxy Tab. Apple has waged an international patent war since 2010 as it seeks to limit the growth of Google's Android system, the world's most-used mobile operating platform. Opponents of Apple say it is using patents too aggressively in a bid to stamp out competition. Spokeswoman Kristin Huguet reiterated her previous statement, accusing Samsung of copying the look and feel of its products. Samsung was not immediately available for comment. As a condition of the injunction, Apple was ordered to post a bond of more than 95 million, to secure payment of damages sustained by Samsung should the injunction be deemed a wrongful decision later. The order shall become effective upon posting of the bond. The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, is Apple Inc v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al, 12-00630.

He says that \\"slime molds are fungus-like protists commonly found on rotting logs and compost\\" and \\"sludge composts are also fairly high in nutrients\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"Slime molds can be found in various environments, notably those rich in organic material and moisture. Although they are often linked to rotting logs, they are not exclusive to this habitat. As your teacher hinted, slime molds are also commonly found in compost. This is likely due to the high nutrient content present in compost, which provides an ideal environment for the growth and proliferation of these organisms. In addition to these locations, slime molds can also be found in leaf litter, soil, and dung of herbivores. They survive and proliferate in these areas as they consume bacteria, yeast, and fungi which are abundant there. It is essential to note that they thrive particularly well in moist and cool environments, which are typically abundant in organic matter. So, besides rotting logs, slime molds can be found in compost, leaf litter, soil, and dung of herbivores."},{"instruction":"Please write a short summary for the following article: Building Spiritual Capital Lisa Miller is a professor of psychology and education at Teachers College, Columbia University. One day she entered a subway car and saw that half of it was crowded but the other half was empty, except for a homeless man who had some fast food on his lap and who was screaming at anybody who came close. At one stop, a grandmother and granddaughter, about 8, entered the car. They were elegantly dressed, wearing pastel dresses and gloves with lace trim. The homeless man spotted them and screamed, “Hey! Do you want to sit with me?” They looked at each other, nodded and replied in unison, “Thank you” and, unlike everybody else, sat directly next to him. The man offered them some chicken from his bag. They looked at each other and nodded and said, “No, thank you.” The homeless man offered several more times, and each time they nodded to each other and gave the same polite answer. Finally, the homeless man was calmed, and they all sat contentedly in their seats. Miller was struck by the power of that nod. “The nod was spirituality shared between child and beloved elder: spiritual direction, values, taught and received in the loving relationship,” she writes in her book “The Spiritual Child.” The grandmother was teaching the granddaughter the wisdom that we were once all strangers in a strange land and that we’re judged by how we treat those who have the least. Miller’s core argument is that spiritual awareness is innate and that it is an important component in human development. An implication of her work is that if you care about social mobility, graduation rates, resilience, achievement and family formation, you can’t ignore the spiritual resources of the people you are trying to help. Miller defines spirituality as “an inner sense of relationship to a higher power that is loving and guiding.” Different people can conceive of this higher power as God, nature, spirit, the universe or just a general oneness of being. She distinguishes spirituality, which has a provable genetic component, from religious affiliation, which is entirely influenced by environment. I’d say Miller doesn’t pay sufficient attention to the many secular, this-world ways people find to organize their lives. Still, it does seem true that most children are born with a natural sense of the spiritual. If they find a dead squirrel on the playground, they understand there is something sacred there, and they will most likely give it a respectful burial. They have a natural sense of the oneness of creation, and a sense of a transcendent, nonmaterial realm. Miller cites twin studies that suggest that the strength of a child’s spiritual awareness is about 29 percent because of broad genetic heritability, 24 percent because of family environment and 47 percent because of a person’s unique individual environment. Spiritual awareness, she continues, surges in adolescence, at about the same time as depression and other threats to well-being. Some level of teenage depression, she says, should be seen as a normal part of the growth process, as young people ask fundamental questions of themselves. The spiritual surge in adolescence is nature’s way of responding to this normal crisis. “Taken together,” Miller writes, “research supports the idea of a common physiology underlying depression and spirituality.” In other words, teenagers commonly suffer a loss of meaning, confidence and identity. Some of them try to fill the void with drugs, alcohol, gang activity and even pregnancy. But others are surrounded by people who have cultivated their spiritual instincts. According to Miller’s research, adolescents with a strong sense of connection to a transcendent realm are 70 percent to 80 percent less likely to engage in heavy substance abuse. Among teenage girls, having a strong spiritual sense was extremely protective against serious depression. Adults who consider themselves highly spiritual at age 26 are, according to her research, 75 percent protected against recurrence of depression. Innate spiritual capacities can wither unless cultivated — the way innate math faculties can go undeveloped without instruction. Loving families nurture these capacities, especially when parents speak explicitly about spiritual quests. The larger question, especially in this age of family disruption, is whether public schools and other institutions should do more to nurture spiritual faculties. Public schools often give short shrift to spirituality for fear that they would be accused of proselytizing religion. But it should be possible to teach the range of spiritual disciplines, in order to familiarize students with the options, without endorsing any one. In an era in which so many people slip off the rails during adolescence, we don’t have the luxury of ignoring a resource that, if cultivated, could see them through. Ignoring spiritual development in the public square is like ignoring intellectual, physical or social development. It is to amputate people in a fundamental way, leading to more depression, drug abuse, alienation and misery. Summary:","output":"Lisa Miller, professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, argues that spiritual awareness is an innate part of human development and affects factors such as social mobility, graduation rates, and resilience. Miller differentiates spirituality from religious affiliation and highlights that spirituality has a genetic component. Her research reveals that adolescents with a strong sense of connection to a transcendent realm are less likely to engage in substance abuse and are protected against depression. While public schools may avoid addressing spirituality to prevent accusations of endorsing religion, nurturing spiritual development can offer a valuable resource for the well-being of youth."},{"instruction":"If a storey contained many small restaurants, what type of structure would it be in?

Mathayus aims to avenge the death of his father at the hand of Sargon, now king of Akkad, by taking service in his Black Scorpions squad. After completing his training he is tasked by Sargon to kill Noah, Mathayus's own brother. He saves him and escapes the city, but a magic arrow follows them and kills Noah. Mathayus boards a ship to Egypt, accompanied by his childhood friend Layla. He intends to get the Spear of Osiris in Egypt, which he believes will be able to pass through Sargon's black magic protection. A fellow traveller, Greek poet Aristophanes, tells Mathayus and Layla that the Spear only kills Egyptian creatures, but the Sword of Damocles will work. The trio travels to Greece, where they can enter the Underworld to retrieve the Sword of Damocles. On the way, they fall into a cell and are surrounded by men left as sacrifices for the Minotaur. Some of the sacrifices are mercenaries who owe allegiance to Mathayus' father, so they help him and Layla to defeat the Minotaur, with help from a Chinese captive named Fung. The enlarged group travel to the Underworld, where they are attacked by the goddess Astarte. Layla and Astarte fight, while Fung and Ari search for and find the sword. Astarte tries to send Layla to hell, but Mathayus frees her, and they all escape to the human realm. Astarte orders Sargon to get her sword back, and he asks for more dark powers.

(1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;","output":"(1). Yes The hypothesis \\"There is need for legislation that addresses multi-pollutants\\" can be deemed true, based on the premise of \\"The Need for Multi-pollutant Legislation.\\" This detailed and long answer will further expand on the reasons that support this assertion. Air pollution caused by various contaminants has long proven to have adverse impacts on environmental and human health. Pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and others significantly contribute to the deterioration of air quality. They also play a substantial role in the occurrence of respiratory infections, cardiovascular diseases, and other health issues. In the past, legislative efforts have primarily focused on regulating individual pollutants, usually involving the establishment of emission control measures and guidelines for industries and other significant contributors. While this approach has led to some improvements in air quality, it has become increasingly evident that tackling the problem of air pollution requires a more comprehensive, multi-pollutant perspective. The need for multi-pollutant legislation arises from the following factors: 1. Interactions between pollutants: Many pollutants tend to interact with one another in the atmosphere, often causing a cascading effect on air quality. For instance, NOx and VOCs can react together to form ground-level ozone, which is a harmful air pollutant. It is impossible to predict the outcomes of these interactions by merely focusing on individual pollutant control. 2. Integrated pollution control: Single-pollutant legislation may lead to a narrow approach when it comes to managing emissions. Multi-pollutant regulation, on the other hand, encourages industries and other pollution sources to adopt integrated pollution control strategies that not only reduce the emission of one pollutant but also contribute to the overall improvement of air quality. 3. Co-benefits: Addressing multiple pollutants simultaneously can lead to potential co-benefits, such as reduced health costs, improved ecosystem health, and enhanced agricultural productivity. This is due to the inherently linked nature of pollutants and their effects on the environment and human health. 4. Cost-effectiveness: Implementing multi-pollutant legislation can lead to more cost-effective solutions for industries. For example, they can invest in technologies that reduce multiple pollutant emissions at once, resulting in improved operational efficiencies and cost savings for both the industries and the regulatory authorities. 5. Global impact: Pollutants know no boundaries; they can travel across continents and impact regions far away from their sources. Addressing multiple pollutants through legislation can help in curbing the global impacts of air pollution, fostering international collaboration and coordination in pollution control efforts. In conclusion, the hypothesis that there is a need for legislation that addresses multi-pollutants is true, as backed by the premise of \\"The Need for Multi-pollutant Legislation.\\" Incorporating a multi-pollutant approach to legislative efforts will enable more effective and efficient measures to combat air pollution, ultimately leading to improved air quality and better protection of human and environmental health."},{"instruction":"The War of the Limburg Succession, was a series of conflicts between 1283 and 1289 for the succession in the Duchy of Limburg. The cause of the War of the Limburg Succession was the death of Waleran IV, Duke of Limburg in 1280, and his only daughter Ermengarde of Limburg in 1283. Waleran IV had no sons and Ermengarde had no children. Ermergarde had married Reginald I of Guelders, who now claimed the Duchy of Limburg. However, Waleran's nephew Adolf VIII of Berg, son of his elder brother Adolf VII of Berg, also claimed the Duchy. Unable to assert his claims, he sold them in 1283 to the mighty John I, Duke of Brabant. Between 1283 and 1288, several smaller confrontations occurred between both sides, none of them decisive. Meanwhile, most of the other local powers chose sides. Siegfried II of Westerburg, the Archishop of Cologne and ruler of the Electorate of Cologne, traditional enemy of the Duke of Brabant, forged an alliance with Reginald I, joined by Henry VI, Count of Luxembourg, and his brother Waleran I of Luxembourg, Lord of Ligny, as well as by Adolf, King of Germany. On the other side the Counts of Mark took the chance to affirm their independence from the Archbishop of Cologne and together with the Counts of Loon, Tecklenburg, and Waldeck allied with Brabant and Berg. The citizens of the City of Cologne, eager to emancipate themselves from the Archbishop's rule, also joined this alliance. After the decisive Battle of Worringen in 1288, won by Duke John I of Brabant and his allies, the Duchy of Limburg came in the possession of the Duke of Brabant. The City of Cologne gained its independence from the Archbishopric and finally the status of an Imperial city in 1475.

Step 4: Outline the issues encountered It's crucial to detail the problems as specifically as possible when writing a negative review. In this case, let's mention the quality of food, service, and ambiance. Issue 1 - Food Quality: We ordered the chef's special pizza and a pasta dish. Both dishes were served lukewarm and tasted bland. The pizza had undercooked dough and the pasta was overcooked, making for a rather unsatisfying meal. Issue 2 - Service: The service we received was slow and inattentive. It took almost 40 minutes for our food to arrive, and we had to remind our server multiple times to bring us the side dishes we ordered, as well as condiments. Our server seemed uninterested in our needs and did not apologize for any delays or mistakes. Issue 3 - Ambiance: The overall ambiance of the restaurant was disappointing. It was not clean, the music was too loud, and the lighting was too dim to read the menu properly. The tables were too cramped, making it uncomfortable for us to dine together. Step 5: Finish with a conclusion and personal recommendation In conclusion, our experience at Hungry Heights was highly disappointing. The poor quality of food, subpar service, and uncomfortable ambiance made it a night to forget. Unfortunately, we cannot recommend this restaurant to others and will not be returning."},{"instruction":"Q: What does the tree live on?

Title: Disappointing Dreams: A missed opportunity Disappointing Dreams had so much potential with its intriguing concept and promising cast, but unfortunately, it fell short in execution. The storyline was riddled with clichés and inconsistencies, making it difficult to maintain interest throughout the film's duration. As a viewer, witnessing these plot holes within an otherwise captivating premise was truly disheartening. Furthermore, the actors, despite their reputable talent, struggled to bring depth and substance to their characters, mainly due to a poorly written script. The dialogue felt forced and unnatural, which led to a lack of emotional investment in the characters' journeys. This botched effort in character development resulted in the failure to create the empathic connection necessary for a compelling narrative. Lastly, the film's pacing was painfully slow, causing the audience to feel restless and unengaged. Despite several visually striking scenes, Disappointing Dreams ultimately fell short as the disjointed editing led to muddled transitions between sequences and confusing subplots. In summary, Disappointing Dreams is a missed opportunity with a captivating concept, marred by clichés, underwhelming performances, and a lack of coherence. This film does not deliver on its potential and is, unfortunately, a disappointment for both fans of the genre and casual viewers alike."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

Please write the text above using proper case.","output":"Perhaps because you are controlling it virtually, being a manager is considered the coolest thing. In this position, you do not get your hands dirty, and only need to click images. This perspective highlights the appeal of a management role, which often involves overseeing and delegating tasks rather than directly performing manual labor. The emphasis on virtual control also suggests that technology plays a significant role in modern management, enabling professionals to perform their duties more efficiently and effectively. In the contemporary business world, managers are often responsible for making key decisions, delegating responsibilities, and ensuring that projects run smoothly. This requires a plethora of skills, including communication, leadership, planning, and problem-solving abilities. As a result, many individuals may view management roles as attractive and desirable, as they offer opportunities for professional growth and the chance to make a significant impact on an organization's success. Moreover, the virtual aspect of management, enabled by advances in technology, has transformed the way that managers interact with their teams, allocate resources, and monitor progress. Remote work, video conferencing, and digital communication platforms now allow managers to stay connected with their teams from anywhere in the world, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, flexibility, and embracing technological innovations. Indeed, the aspect of \\"only clicking images\\" may be seen as a figurative expression of the ease and efficiency with which managers can make decisions and delegate tasks in a tech-driven environment. At the same time, however, this phrase may also mask the complexity and challenges that managers face daily. From managing diverse teams and navigating workplace politics to handling tight budgets and meeting stringent deadlines, management can be a demanding and high-pressure role. As such, this perception of virtual control may only be one small aspect of what makes management truly fascinating and rewarding. In summary, the idea that being a manager is \\"the coolest thing\\" due to its virtual control and lack of manual labor is a multifaceted concept that encompasses various factors, including the appeal of leadership roles, the impact of technology on management, and the unique challenges faced by professionals in this field. Although the notion of merely \\"clicking images\\" simplifies the duties and responsibilities of managers, it does highlight the role that technology plays in streamlining tasks and connecting managers with their teams, potentially making this profession more appealing and accessible to a broader range of individuals."},{"instruction":"Alges-X/Alges-X forte has not been tested for use in children under 12 years old.

As the car door closed and she settled into the plush leather seat, she felt a shiver go down her spine - a potent mix of fear and excitement. Blake had always been an unpredictable character, and this situation was no different. She glanced over at him, his intense gaze fixed on the officer standing outside the car, and realized that she had voluntarily chosen to put her fate in the hands of this enigmatic man. The sports car's interior was far more luxurious than the exterior had initially suggested. The dashboard boasted advanced technology with sleek designs and various buttons whose purposes she could only guess at. The soundproofing was a definite bonus, but she still couldn't help but feel her heart race with nerves as she watched the officer and Blake exchange heated gestures through the reinforced glass. Despite the unsettling confrontation taking place outside, her mind started to wander. She thought about their journey together until this point, the highs and the lows. The memories came flooding back - the stolen glances, the laughter, the clandestine meetings. She began to puzzle over how things had ever escalated to this point, with Blake, herself, and the law caught in a high-stakes face-off. Had they always been destined for this? Or was it a series of choices that led them down this precarious path? As if picking up on her thoughts, Blake suddenly shifted his attention from the officer to meet her eyes. Even though she couldn't hear him, she could almost feel the intensity of his words as he verbally sparred with the law enforcement official. She found herself hanging onto his every unspoken phrase, watching the way his mouth formed words she couldn't decipher. And yet, when his eyes returned to hers, she could see something in them that struck a chord within her – a reckless determination to protect her, no matter the cost. Those eyes. Those terrifying, beautiful eyes. They danced with danger and intrigue, but deep down, she knew she could trust him. Strangely, that assurance brought her both comfort and trepidation. Did she want to stay with this man who could seemingly outwit the law on a whim? The thrill of it was indisputable, but the lurking dangers were never far from her thoughts. In that moment, as she stared into Blake's eyes and felt the unspoken connection between them, she needed to decide whether the risks were worth pursuing a life with him, a life in the shadows. The consequences were more than a simple matter of heartbreak; it was a choice between safety and passion, between the mundane and the extraordinary. She knew, deep down, that no matter the risks involved, she would be more afraid of living a life without the exhilaration and connection they shared than the challenges that came with sharing a life with Blake. And as the officer's lips moved in tandem with Blake's impassioned retorts, she realized that she wouldn't trade their shared moments for anything else. The thought of escaping with Blake in this luxurious, technologically advanced sports car filled her with an anticipation she had never felt before. She understood that the road ahead was paved with uncertainty and danger, but the promise of an adventure with a man who excited, infuriated, and enticed her all at once was more than she could resist. As the silent standoff outside the car continued, she braced herself for whatever may come, hoping that the wild journey they were about to embark on would be just as bulletproof as the car that harbored them."},{"instruction":"What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of Connors' ward? from the following article ?

Did you know that sometimes grown-ups have special friends, called \\"partners\\"? These partners are like the best teammates who help and support each other.

Today, we will talk about a study that says if people have a partner that once belonged to someone else, their relationship might not be a good one. The study found that these \\"stolen partners\\" can cause problems in relationships. People who were once someone else's partner may cheat and want more attention than others. Cheating means not being loyal, like breaking the promises of a team. Wanting too much attention can be like someone hogging the ball in a game and not playing nicely with others.

Falling in love means really, really liking someone, like how we might love our favorite toy, show, or snack. Tracey doesn't believe people can't help who they fall in love with.

The SNP - which has tabled a motion that would delay the bill - and Liberal Democrats are opposed, but Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has ordered his MPs to vote with the government. However some Labour MPs are expected to defy Mr Corbyn. The government remains determined to trigger negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the European Union by the end of March. But the SNP's amendment to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill criticises the government for failing to consult effectively with the devolved administrations on the plans for Brexit. It also says the government has yet to publish a White Paper detailing its policy proposals, has refused to give a guarantee on the position of EU nationals in the UK, and has provided no assurance that a future parliamentary vote will be anything other than irrelevant. Speaking as he outlined the amendment, SNP MP Stephen Gethins said triggering Article 50 would have a major economic impact on Scotland. He argued that the only detailed plans for Brexit had been published by the Scottish and Welsh governments. And he said Scotland had voted to Remain and was now being taken out of the EU by a Conservative Party that just posted its worst general election result since 1865 in Scotland. Mr Gethins said: \\"Passing this bill and turning your back on our amendment would turn its back on the progress made and disrespect the devolution settlement. \\"I'd urge members to vote for our amendment, otherwise this is a backward and damaging step and it is an act of constitutional and economic sabotage.\\" Mr Gethins found an unlikely ally in former Tory Chancellor Ken Clarke, who said he would be \\"voting with his conscience\\" and backing the SNP amendment. Mr Clarke described visions of a post-Brexit future as a \\"wonderland\\" fantasy. He also mocked the government's hopes for free trade after leaving the single market, and claimed that \\"no sensible country has referendums\\". The government had resisted having a vote in the Commons, but was forced to seek parliament's approval for its plans by a Supreme Court ruling last week. Its Brexit secretary, David Davis, told the debate that MPs would not be able to vote to block Brexit, telling them the \\"point of no return\\" had already passed. He added: \\"This is not a bill about whether the UK should leave the EU or indeed how it should do it. \\"It is simply about parliament empowering the government to implement a decision already made, a point of no return already passed. \\"We asked the people of the UK if they wanted to leave the EU. They decided they did. So at the core of this Bill lies a very simple question. Do we trust the people or not? \\"We will respect the will of the people and implement their will by 31 March.\\" The debate is due to last two days, with the government expected to win the final vote - although the size of the rebellion by Labour MPs against their instructions to vote with the government is not yet clear. Labour's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, said two thirds of Labour MPs represented constituencies that voted to leave the EU, and one third where people voted to stay in. \\"This is obviously a difficult decision,\\" he said. \\"I wish the result had gone the other way. I campaigned passionately for that. But as democrats our party has to accept that result and it follows that the prime minister should not be blocked from starting the Article 50 negotiations.\\" Summary:","output":"The House of Commons, a group of people who help make laws in the United Kingdom, is talking about a new law. This law would help start a process called \\"Article 50\\", which means the UK would leave a big group of countries called the European Union (EU). Some people, like the SNP and the Liberal Democrats, don't want this to happen yet. But the leader of another group, called Labour, wants his team to vote for the new law. Some people in the Labour group might not listen to their leader. The UK government wants to start leaving the EU before the end of March. The SNP doesn't agree with how the government is planning all this. They want more information and help for people who are from the EU but live in the UK. They also want the different parts of the UK, like Scotland and Wales, to have a say in the plan.

The founding of CPI marked a significant moment in the history of India's freedom struggle and its political and social development. The party emerged as a response to the growing influence of socialism and communism across the world, and particularly in the Soviet Union in the wake of the October Revolution of 1917. The formation of the Communist Party of India was facilitated by a group of revolutionaries, trade unionists, and intellectuals under the guidance of two prominent figures: Satyabhakta, an Indian revolutionary leader, and M.N. Roy, a Marxist theoretician who played a crucial role in the founding of the Communist International (Comintern) in 1919. In the early years, the party faced numerous challenges, including the lack of organizational structure, internal disagreements, and harsh repression from British colonial authorities. Nevertheless, the CPI managed to progressively grow, opening branches in several major cities, like Bombay (now Mumbai), Calcutta (now Kolkata), Lahore (now in Pakistan) and Madras (now Chennai). It also started publishing newspapers and magazines to disseminate its ideas and attract followers. Throughout the years, the CPI played an active role in the Indian National Congress-led struggle for independence. The party's influence was particularly visible in struggles for workers' rights, trade union activities, and peasant uprisings. During India's freedom movement, some CPI leaders aligned themselves with the Congress Party, whereas others actively critiqued the Congress Party's policies, considering them insufficient. The CPI subsequently went on to contest elections as an independent party after India attained independence in 1947. Post-independence, the CPI has held various roles in local, regional, and national politics. Its political influence has been notable in states like West Bengal, Kerala, and Tripura. The CPI gave birth to other parties and formations, including the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M) which emerged in 1964 after an ideological split within the party. To this day, the Communist Party of India remains a significant part of the Indian political landscape, advocating for social justice, workers' rights, and the protection of the marginalized sections of society."},{"instruction":"Changzi Deng was charged with aggravated assault after the incident in Austin, Texas. A man obsessed with his ex-girlfriend flew more than 7,000 miles from China to Texas to plead for a second chance, but stabbed her in the face with a fork when she rejected him. Changxi Deng was arrested last Wednesday on the University of Texas campus after being held by other students who witnessed the attack. The 22 year old had traveled to the US from his home in China in the hope of persuading his former girlfriend to rekindle their relationship. But after she rejected his advances, he allegedly pulled out a fork from his pocket and plunged it into his ex's face. Other students heard the girl, who has not been named, screaming and rushed to help. U.T. freshman Joe Thometz was the student who pushed Deng off the woman. 'I ran out and grabbed the guy's wrist and pushed him into the wall to get him off the girl and another guy ran over and separated the girl', Thometz told Kxan.com. Deng was held at the scene in Austin, Texas, and the bloody fork recovered. The girl suffered puncture wounds to her nose and was treated in hospital. Deng told investigators he had been in a relationship with the woman while they were both studying at university in China. He said his girlfriend enrolled in a Masters degree course at the University of Texas in Austin. Deng researched the masters program for himself so he could find out what classes his ex-girlfriend would be taking. Freshman Joe Thometz (pictured) broke up the assault by grabbing Deng's wrist and pushing him against a wall at the university campus. He then traveled to the U.S. and waited outside various classrooms at the university until he finally met up with her outside the Engineering-Science building. Investigators say the victim attempted to evade Deng and warned him that she would call police if he didn't leave her alone. 'They had studied similar classes for undergrad studies and so he had a good idea of what classes she was going to be taking,' said Sergeant Charles Bonnet. Deng was booked into jail and charged with aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury.

As EV technology progresses, it is expected that the market share of diesel and gasoline (petrol) vehicles will gradually decrease. Nonetheless, these internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles can still become more efficient and environmentally friendly in parallel with the growth of the EV industry. Here, we will discuss the ways by which electromobility can contribute to the efficiency of diesel and gasoline vehicles. 1. Technology innovations: The developments in the field of electrification technology, including batteries, charging infrastructure, and power electronics, will promote further improvements in overall vehicle efficiency. These innovations can be applied to both EVs and ICE vehicles, potentially resulting in advanced battery-assisted hybrid vehicles that can better manage energy consumption and optimize performance. 2. System integration: As the overall transportation network becomes more electrified, vehicles powered by diesel and gasoline can be integrated into a smarter, cleaner, and more efficient ecosystem through state-of-the-art technology such as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems and smart charging. This interconnected system can potentially optimize ICE vehicle performance, reduce peak electricity demand, and curb emissions. 3. Energy diversification: An EV-dominated automotive sector can encourage the diversification of energy sources, which can also ultimately impact ICE vehicles. For instance, as renewable energy production increases and the grid becomes more sustainable, diesel and gasoline vehicles can reap the benefits of cleaner electricity production, lower carbon footprint, and environmentally friendlier fuels synthesized from renewable electricity. 4. Aftermarket modifications: As electromobility becomes more accepted, automakers and third-party manufacturers may invest in aftermarket modifications and retrofits for ICE vehicles. These adaptations might include electric components for better fuel economy, regeneration systems for energy recovery and clean energy supplements for the combustion engine. 5. Stricter emissions standards: Driven by the advancements in EV technology and the increasing public concern for the environment, governments may implement stricter emissions standards for ICE vehicles. In turn, this may prompt automakers to improve the efficiency and eco-friendliness of diesel and gasoline vehicles, ensuring their competitiveness within an increasingly green market. 6. Competition driving innovation: The growth of the EV market, and the competition that it brings, will push automakers to think more creatively about maximizing the efficiency of traditional ICE vehicles. This competitive landscape will likely result in technological leaps that translate into smaller, more efficient engines, better aerodynamics, and advanced materials that reduce vehicle weight, ultimately benefiting ICE vehicle efficiency. 7. Production optimization: As the auto-manufacturing sector shifts towards EV production, there will likely be increased investments in advanced manufacturing technologies and improved production methods. This will ultimately lead to a more efficient and sustainable automotive production process, benefiting the construction of both EVs and ICE vehicles. In summary, while electromobility is set to revolutionize the transportation sector by accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles, it can also contribute to making diesel and gasoline vehicles even more efficient. Through technology advancements and innovations, stricter emissions standards, competition, and optimized production methods, the overall efficiency of ICE vehicles may increase in parallel with the growth of the electric vehicle market, leading to a more sustainable and eco-friendly transportation system."},{"instruction":"The New Clinton Democrats A Journal editorial notes “an impressive performance by Hillary Clinton Tuesday, announcing her presumptive presidential nomination as an historic first for womankind and something new and wonderful for American democracy. Watching her arms outstretched like Moses, you could almost forget that she first came to national prominence 25 years ago and is the very soul of the Washington status quo.” Yet this attempt to restore the Clinton dynasty, says the editorial board, is “no mere replay of the 1990s. This time America is being offered the familiar Clinton ethics, but without Bill Clinton’s bow to center-right policy. This time we are getting the grasping and corner-cutting of the Clinton entourage with economic policies somewhere to the left of President Obama’s.” Our columnist Daniel Henninger writes, “The real claim to Democratic Party history belongs to Bernie Sanders. Sen. Sanders has recentered the Democrats, once and for all, as a party of the political left. He has reimagined the Democrats—almost with the force of his personality—as a party of the state, of government and of redistribution. Period.” On Wednesday President Obama vetoed a bipartisan bill to block the Labor Department’s new fiduciary regulation. The editorial board notes, “The new rule, which requires every financial adviser to act as a fiduciary, will now remake that industry the way the Administration has so many others. One result is likely to be much less or no advice for average investors who can’t afford a ‘personal wealth’ manager.” With the rise of China, “the passing of the Cold War and the emergence of a scorching war against Islamist terror, India and the U.S. share an existential foxhole,” writes Tunku Varadarajan. He notes on the occasion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s U.S. visit that India “offers a strategic partnership that could invigorate America, an alliance of fortifying possibilities for an otherwise ugly 21st century.” Speaking of China, “Tuesday’s midair intercept of the U.S. Air Force RC-135 over the East China Sea is the second such incident in less than a month, after two Chinese jets came within 50 feet of a U.S. Navy EP-3 flying over the South China Sea,” observes the editorial board. “Far from apologizing for the incidents—or denying them—the Chinese foreign ministry accused the U.S. of provoking them by flying ‘in China’s relevant airspace.’ On both occasions the U.S. planes were flying in international airspace.” What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the transformation of the Democratic Party in the United States with the rise of Hillary Clinton as the presumptive presidential nominee and the impact of Bernie Sanders on the party's policies. It emphasizes that this new era of Clinton Democrats is not simply a replay of the 1990s but rather a shift towards more leftist policies. The article then moves on to discuss President Obama's veto of a bill to block the Labor Department's new fiduciary regulation, which in turn echoes the stance of the Democratic Party leaning more towards the political left. Additionally, the article considers important international geopolitics including the new partnership opportunities between India and the United States, and recent incidents involving China intercepting US air force flights in the East China Sea. The core theme remains the recentering of the Democratic Party as a party of the political left, driven by the increased prominence of politicians like Bernie Sanders and the shifting policies of established figures like Hillary Clinton."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Here's a question: What does reckless driving lead to on a person?

First of all, the story was so slow, just like the snail! It was super boring and made us want to take a nap, too. The movie lasted for 2 hours, but we wished it was shorter so that we wouldn't be as tired. Next, the colors in the movie did not look pretty. They were very dark and dull, making it hard for us to enjoy the beautiful forest where the snail lived. It felt like the snail was having a sad time even when it was supposed to be having fun. Also, the characters were not very friendly or funny. They didn't make us laugh or teach us any cool lessons. We had a hard time remembering their names because they all seemed the same! Lastly, the music did not make us want to dance or sing along. It was very quiet and made us feel sleepy instead of excited to see what would happen to the little snail.

Keep in mind that it is the immune system and not the allergen that causes the allergy symptoms. Allergy symptoms can be treated with medications such as antihistamines. Severe allergic reactions may require an injection of the hormone epinephrine. These treatments lessen or counter the immune system’s response. Please answer this question : Which group had more people that could be treated with antihistamines? The answer to this question is:","output":"Both Group D and Group C could have individuals treated with antihistamines. This is because antihistamines are a type of medication used to treat allergy symptoms, regardless of their severity. However, it's important to note that the use of antihistamines would likely have been more effective for the mild allergy symptoms experienced by individuals in Group D. That's because antihistamines are typically used to alleviate milder symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as sneezing, runny nose, or itchy eyes. On the other hand, the members in Group C with severe allergy symptoms would likely need more immediate and intensive medical intervention, like an injection of epinephrine, as suggested in the background information. This is because severe allergic reactions can cause difficulty in breathing, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, while members from both groups may receive antihistamines, they could potentially be more effective for those in Group D with milder symptoms. As for the severe cases in Group C, while antihistamines could potentially be part of their treatment plan, they would most likely need additional measures like an epinephrine shot to immediately manage the hazardous symptoms. It's always advisable these decisions are made by a healthcare professional."},{"instruction":"Write a subject line for this message: I tried to call you back today, but was told that you had left the office.

By 1934, Stefan has established an investment bank; in gratitude, he provides the capital that Nicole needs to set up her own business and become a successful dress designer (though she insists on paying him back). British diplomat Anthony Wayne romances Nicole and wins her heart. However, when Stefan's crooked schemes start to unravel, he asks Nicole to marry him without divulging his main motive: the attendance of her influential friends at the well-publicized ceremony would bolster public confidence in him and buy him time. She agrees, out of friendship alone, much to the distress of her friend and assistant, Suzanne. It is too late. At their wedding, Stefan's closest confederate, Francis Chalon, is taken away by the police for questioning, and the other guests hastily depart. Knowing that Chalon can incriminate him, Stefan goes into hiding at a remote chateau. However, he makes a mistake, sending a letter to Nicole asking her to join him. She does so, despite Anthony's protests. Nicole gets Stefan to admit the truth, though he insists he does love her. When he sees that the police have followed Nicole and have surrounded the chateau, he excuses himself. To spare her from being dragged down with him, he goes outside.

Born on May 30, 1934, in Listvyanka, Siberia, Leonov was selected as part of the Soviet Union's Air Force Group One in 1960, which consisted of the first group of cosmonauts. The historic event took place during the Voskhod 2 mission, an ambitious step in the rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States during the Space Race. The primary purpose of the Voskhod 2 mission was to perform the first-ever spacewalk and further demonstrate the technological prowess of the Soviet space program. During the mission, Alexei Leonov, along with his fellow cosmonaut Pavel Belyayev, piloted the Voskhod 2 spacecraft into orbit. As the designated spacewalker, Leonov wore a specially designed EVA suit and prepared to enter the vacuum of space. After completing the necessary safety checks, Leonov exited the Voskhod 2 and entered the void of space, secured by a tether. As he stepped into the abyss, Leonov became the first human to walk in space, a title that would go down in the annals of history. Leonov's spacewalk lasted approximately 12 minutes and 9 seconds, during which he used a handheld camera to take photos of Earth, the spacecraft, and himself. Additionally, Leonov conducted a few basic tasks in space, including maneuvering around the airlock and testing the limitations of his EVA suit. While the spacewalk itself was a momentous achievement, the Voskhod 2 mission was not without challenges. When attempting to reenter the airlock, Leonov found that his suit had ballooned due to the lack of atmospheric pressure, making it difficult to move and fit back through the hatch. After partially depressurizing his suit, he was finally able to enter the spacecraft, albeit with immense difficulty. Despite the unforeseen problems, Leonov and Belyayev managed to return to Earth safely, with their harrowing experience illustrating the dangers and challenges of space exploration. The mission successfully showcased the Soviet Union's progress in space travel and, most importantly, cemented Alexei Leonov's place in history as the first human being to walk in space. Alexei Leonov's pioneering spacewalk laid the groundwork for future missions that would push the boundaries of human exploration. His extraordinary feat expanded the understanding of what was possible and set the stage for manned lunar landings, space station construction, and eventually, the pursuit of interplanetary travel."},{"instruction":"Solve this math problem Solve -1032 - 829 = -33*f - 1432 for f.","output":"Let's solve the equation step by step: 1. The given equation is -1032 - 829 = -33*f - 1432. 2. First, let's simplify the equation by combining the constant terms on both sides. Combine -1032 and -829, which equals -1861. This simplifies our equation to: -1861 = -33*f - 1432. 3. Now, let's isolate the term with the variable f by moving the constant term from the right-hand side to the left-hand side. We do this by adding 1432 to both sides of the equation. The new equation is: -1861 + 1432 = -33*f. 4. Calculate the sum on the left-hand side: -1861 + 1432 = -429. So the equation is now: -429 = -33*f. 5. Finally, let's solve for f by dividing both sides of the equation by -33: -429 / -33 = f. 6. Calculate the division: -429 / -33 = 13.

Options: - moody - happy - meet - being entertained - sit Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"Going to play for a child might lead to several different outcomes, and it is important to analyze each option step by step, considering the nature of play and its effects on children. 1. Moody: Although play can sometimes involve challenges or frustrations, it is unlikely that it will primarily make a child moody. When children engage in play, they typically experience positive emotions, learn social skills, and develop emotional resilience. 2. Happy: Play provides opportunities for children to have fun, enjoy their free time, and explore their interests. As a result, going to play is likely to make a child happy, as it allows them to engage in an activity that brings joy and nurtures their social and emotional well-being. 3. Meet: When children engage in play, they often interact with other children and forge connections. Going to play can lead to a child meeting new friends and developing important social skills, such as cooperation and communication. So, this option is quite plausible. 4. Being entertained: Play is essentially a form of entertainment for children. Through various activities, play stimulates a child's imagination and keeps them engaged. Therefore, going to play can lead to a child being entertained, as they actively participate in enjoyable and stimulating activities. 5. Sit: Sitting is not directly related to the act of playing, as play usually involves physical or mental engagement in activities. While sitting can be a part of certain games or activities, it is not the primary outcome of going to play. In conclusion, considering the options provided, going to play for a child may lead to them being happy, meeting new friends, and being entertained.

She is a soprano and has a vocal range of three octaves. Turunen studied singing at Sibelius Academy and Hochschule fur Musik Karlsruhe. She is a professional classical lied singer, and the former lead vocalist of the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, which she founded with Tuomas Holopainen and Emppu Vuorinen in 1996. Turunen's voice is described by critics as remarkably powerful and emotional. Sometimes it is stated that her voice is too trained or operatic for metal music, but even critics who do not like classical voices admit that her voice suits the kind of metal songs she sings unusually well. Until the end of their collaboration, Turunen's singing was a trademark of Nightwish. She was known as the face and voice of Nightwish while bandleader Holopainen was the soul. Turunen was seen as a key to Nightwish's success. She is respected by other musicians of the metal genre and is an influence on their work; for instance, Simone Simons of Epica names her as her inspiration to study classical music and apply that vocal style to a metal band. Turunen receives most of her media attention in Europe, especially in her home of Finland. In December 2003, she was invited by Finnish president Tarja Halonen to celebrate the Finnish Independence Day at the Presidential Palace together with other Finnish celebrities. The event is televised annually live by the state-owned broadcaster, the Finnish Broadcasting Company. In December 2007, she performed different versions of the Finnish national anthem \\"Maamme\\" (Finnish: \\"Our country\\") accompanied by the Tapiola Sinfonietta, to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Finnish independence. The concert was televised by the Finnish Broadcasting Company for 2 million Finnish viewers. In December 2013, Turunen was the invited soloist at the Christmas Peace event in the Turku Cathedral, Finland, with the presence of Finnish president Sauli Niinisto. The concert aired on Yle TV1 at the Christmas Eve. During her solo career, Turunen has sold over 100,000 certified records in Finland, which places her among the top 50 of best-selling female soloists. In Europe, her popularity is mainly limited to the hard rock and metal scene. She had a broader exposure on November 30, 2007, when she was invited to open the farewell fight of Regina Halmich. Her performance of \\"I Walk Alone\\" was televised live by the German television station ZDF for 8.8 million viewers. Turunen will be one of the star coaches in the fourth season of The Voice of Finland in the spring of 2015 on Nelonen.

The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why. Before the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day. Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter. I’m not going to pick apart the PURE study for its flaws. Such issues are consistent across all observational studies no matter if the conclusions support consensus views or not.

The 300-millimeter silicon wafers -- about the size of a standard pizza -- are shuttled around the facility in enclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks. They drop down from wires automatically into machines, sheathed in stainless steel and glass, for each stage of processing and fabrication. Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair. Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency. Because each of the hundreds of processing machines is self-enclosed, and essentially airtight, the uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip plants, which looked like space suits. The operators at the East Fishkill factory wear light nylon uniforms, light blue shoe coverings and translucent hair nets made of paper. They look more like workers in a bakery.

While virtual reality is already making a significant impact in the fields of education, gaming, and training, there is a growing interest in understanding the potential of VR for enhancing collaboration and communication among teams in various industries, especially fields that require remote work or have a distributed workforce. Hypothesis: Virtual reality technology can significantly improve collaboration and communication among teams in industries that require remote work or have a dispersed workforce, by providing immersive and realistic virtual workspaces that facilitate seamless interaction, decision-making, and problem-solving. To explore and support this hypothesis, several key aspects can be analyzed, such as: 1. Realism and Immersion: Virtual reality technology can create highly realistic and immersive digital environments, enabling team members to feel as if they were physically present in the same location, even when separated by considerable distances. This could foster more effective communication and make working together easier and more enjoyable, by replicating the benefits of face-to-face interactions. 2. Enhanced communication tools: Virtual reality offers unique ways to convey ideas and emotions through immersive and interactive means, beyond standard video conference calls. For example, a VR workspace could enable 3D visualization of complex concepts, shared whiteboards, haptic feedback for non-verbal communication, and real-time translation of spoken languages. These tools could help teams to share ideas and find solutions more efficiently, especially when dealing with complex scenarios. 3. Customization and personalization: Virtual reality workspaces can be fully customized to fit the needs and preferences of individual users and diverse teams. They can be designed to accommodate users with accessibility requirements and adapted to the specific tasks and goals of each project. This level of flexibility could lead to more productive and enjoyable working experiences, ultimately resulting in better output quality. 4. Increased engagement and motivation: Virtual reality technology has the potential to create a more engaging and motivating work environment, where team members look forward to interacting and collaborating. This could lead to increased creativity, problem-solving, and even reduced employee turnover, as individuals genuinely enjoy working together in their virtual environment. 5. Real-time feedback and evaluation: Virtual reality systems can collect data on user activities and interactions, providing detailed information about individual and group performance. This could allow organizations to collect and analyze data to identify areas for improvement, as well as recognize and reward top performers, thus helping guide and develop their teams more effectively. Overall, the potential of virtual reality technology to enhance collaboration and communication among remote and distributed teams seems promising, as it could offer incredible new opportunities for fully immersive, highly realistic virtual workspaces that break down geographical barriers and transform the way people work together. Of course, further research and development will be crucial to understand and utilize this technology optimally, addressing potential challenges such as cost, usability, and user acceptance."},{"instruction":"Write a text based on this summary: britain and commonwealth defense partners hold talks in malaysia Text:","output":"Title: Britain and Commonwealth Defense Partners Gather in Malaysia for Crucial Talks In a significant move to bolster defense ties and cooperation, Britain and member states of the Commonwealth have converged in Malaysia for a series of high-level defense talks.

It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System. - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth . - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, . - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers. Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground. - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9). - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain. - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space. - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973. - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus. - Mount Olympus (also transliterated as Olympos, and on Greek maps, Oros Olympos) is the highest mountain in Greece and the second highest mountain in the Balkans. It is located in the Olympus Range on the border between Thessaly and Macedonia, between the regional units of Pieria and Larissa, about southwest from Thessaloniki. Mount Olympus has 52 peaks, deep gorges, and exceptional biodiversity. The highest peak \\"Mytikas\\", meaning \\"nose\\", rises to . It is one of the highest peaks in Europe in terms of topographic prominence. - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world. - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva. - Tarshish occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, most frequently as a place (probably a large city or region) far across the sea from the Land of Israel and Phoenicia. Tarshish was said to have supplied vast quantities of important metals to Israel and Phoenicia. The same place-name occurs in the Akkadian inscriptions of Esarhaddon (the Assyrian king, d. 669 BC) and also on the Phoenician inscription on the Nora Stone, indicating that it was a \\"real\\" place; its precise location was never commonly known, and was eventually lost in antiquity. Legends grew up around it over time so that its identity has been the subject of scholarly research and commentary for more than two thousand years. Its importance stems in part from the fact that Hebrew biblical passages tend to understand Tarshish as a source of King Solomon's great wealth in metals - especially silver, but also gold, tin and iron (Ezekiel 27). The metals were reportedly obtained in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre (Isaiah 23), and the fleets of Tarshish-ships. However, Solomon's Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians, thus archaeological evidence has been difficult to uncover.

'We only start breeding our bulls when they reach three years old, so it's taken just over a year for him to have that many children. 'Because he's such a massive specimen, coupled with the fact he's a record breaker, people come from far and wide to get some of his genes. 'People are always amazed when they see him - no other farmer that's met him knows of a bigger bull.' In the last year Barnsford, pictured with his owner Charlie Boden, has fathered 150 calves. Barnsford cost Mr Boden around £3,500 in 2011, a then record fee for a Charolais breed. Then in 2013 the huge white bull won two awards at the Royal Welsh, including the individual supreme award in the interbreed beef awards. He lives alongside 20 other bulls, but despite living off the same diet, Barnsford absolutely dwarves them. 'He doesn't get anything special to eat,' said Mr Boden. 'He's got all the grass he can eat in the fields and about 10-15lb of concentrate per day which is the same as the other bulls. 'He's always been a big lad, and he's just getting bigger - he's a monster. 'Barnsford's a real ladies man. 'As long as he's got his cows around him he's chuffed. 'Having said that though, you get him round any of the other bulls and he puffs out his chest and asserts his macho dominance.

The bull named Barnsford Ferny is Britain's largest, with a weight almost equal to that of an adult hippopotamus at nearly two tonnes. 2. Barnsford Ferny is double the weight of most other bulls and has enough meat on him that it could be converted into 45,000 Big Mac burgers. 3. Standing at 7ft in height, Barnsford Ferny is a breeding bull and has fathered 150 calves in the last year. 4. The bull is owned by Charlie Boden, a farmer from Stockport, Greater Manchester. Despite the bull's massive size, Boden insists that the four-year-old bull is very gentle. 5. Barnsford Ferny fathered 50 calves on Boden's farm, while the rest were bred from him by farmers from across the country, either directly or through artificial insemination. 6. Barnsford Ferny was bought by Mr. Boden for around £3,500 in 2011, which was a record fee for a Charolais breed at that time. 7. In 2013, the giant bovine won two awards at the Royal Welsh, including the individual supreme award in the interbreed beef awards. 8. Despite sharing the same diet as the other 20 bulls on the farm, Barnsford Ferny outgrows them significantly. He feeds on field grass and around 10-15 lbs of concentrate daily. 9.

Eat when you’re hungry Eat what you want Eat consciously Stop when you are full The difference lies in the approach and the detail. I will discuss each step in this four part series. ————————————————— EAT WHAT YOU WANT DOES YOUR FOOD SING TO YOU? Have a look in your fridge and cupboards. Does the food in there sing to you, does it call your name, and are you looking forward to eating it? Do you eat it because you enjoy it or because you think you should? By choosing only to eat what sings to me, I have discovered (again!) that I am not a big fan of meat and would rather eat a predominantly vegetarian diet. Occasionally I’ll eat chicken leg and I love bacon but beyond that I’m not fussed. FOOD DOES NOT HAVE A VALUE There are no good and bad foods. There are no trigger foods or forbidden foods. There is nosuch thing as junk. There is a place in your diet for your favourite indulgences in moderation. Believe me that when you let yourself eat cheesecake, chocolate and hot chips, the novelty soon wears off. I mostly eat unprocessed food, not because it’s “good” but because I love the taste and prefer how it makes me feel.

Bulk Warehouse: In the bulk warehouse, 48 cans cost 12.00. To find the cost per can, we'll divide the total cost by the number of cans: 12.00 ÷ 48 cans = 0.25 per can Local Grocery Store: At the local grocery store, 12 cans cost 6.00. To find the cost per can, we'll divide the total cost by the number of cans: 6.00 ÷ 12 cans = 0.50 per can Now, we can calculate the difference in cost per can between the two stores: 0.50 per can (grocery store) - 0.25 per can (bulk warehouse) = 0.25 per can So, buying the sparkling water at the local grocery store is 25 cents more expensive per can compared to buying it at the bulk warehouse.

For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation.

First introduced in the original God of War game, which was released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2, Kratos has evolved as a character throughout the series. Kratos is a demigod, born from the coupling of the Greek god Zeus and the mortal woman Callisto. From an early age, Kratos displayed remarkable skill in combat. He later became a Spartan soldier, rising to the rank of general and leading his army to numerous victories. However, in his quest for power, Kratos unknowingly made a pact with Ares, the God of War, to aid him in his battles. In exchange, Kratos was bonded to the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained, double-edged blades imbued with the power of fire. This ultimately led to the accidental slaughter of Kratos' wife, Lysandra, and daughter, Calliope, at his own hands, as Ares manipulated him to do so. This tragic event is the impetus for Kratos' unrelenting quest for vengeance against the gods. Throughout the original God of War trilogy (God of War, God of War II, and God of War III), players control Kratos in his quest for vengeance against the gods of Olympus, particularly Ares, Zeus, and other prominent figures from Greek mythology. Kratos' character arc revolves around his unflinching determination to confront and kill those responsible for the suffering in his life, as well as his attempts to find redemption and peace. In the prequels, God of War: Chains of Olympus, God of War: Ghost of Sparta, and God of War: Ascension, players also control Kratos. These games further explore Kratos' backstory, giving insight into his earlier years, his relationship with his brother Deimos, and his struggle against the Furies, who seek to punish him for breaking his oath to Ares. In 2018, the franchise took a different turn with the release of the game simply titled God of War for PlayStation 4. The story shifts from Greek to Norse mythology and it is set many years after the events of the original trilogy. Kratos now lives in the land of the Norse gods with his new wife, Faye, and son, Atreus. At Faye's behest, Kratos and Atreus embark on a journey to the highest peak in the Nine Realms to scatter her ashes. In this latest game, players still predominantly control Kratos, however, Atreus often accompanies him, providing assistance during combat and puzzle-solving with his archery skills. The interactions between Kratos and Atreus are an integral part of the game's story, as Kratos must come to terms with his past and learn how to be a father to his son. In conclusion, throughout the God of War series, players primarily take on the role of Kratos, guiding him on his journey of vengeance, redemption, and personal growth. From his origins in Greek mythology to the introduction of Norse mythology, players have been able to experience and shape Kratos' story as they navigate through breathtaking worlds and engage in epic battles against powerful foes."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Natalie feels bad about Erin's baldness because","output":"Natalie feels bad about Erin's baldness because she empathizes deeply with her friend's emotional distress. Erin's baldness isn't merely a physical condition, but a source of profound personal discomfort and lowered self-esteem. Natalie has known Erin for many years, they've shared joys, triumphs, defeats and disappointments. Witnessing her friend's struggle with sudden hair loss has opened her eyes to the significance of the situation and the deep impact it has on Erin's self-perception. Erin's baldness may have been caused by a variety of reasons such as illness, chemotherapy, alopecia, or even stress. Whichever the underlying cause is, it has been hard for Erin to accept this new reality of her own body image. In a society that often emphasizes the importance of physical appearance, Erin's baldness has made her feel out of place and incredibly self-conscious. Natalie is aware of the societal standards and expectations which are partly responsible for Erin’s discomfort. For most women, hair is associated with beauty, femininity, and identity. It’s a source of pride and self-expression. Having lush, full hair is often equated with health, vitality, and attractiveness. Losing it suddenly, whether due to medical reasons, stress, or hormonal changes, can be an intensely distressing experience. It is more than just a cosmetic issue; it is often a psychological and emotional battle. In addition, Natalie recognizes that Erin's baldness is not something that she can control or change on her own. Erin might have already sought medical opinion, considered wigs, or other treatments. These options, unfortunately, are not perfect solutions and may even boost Erin's sense of frustration and helplessness, which Natalie is deeply saddened about. Being a good friend, Natalie hates seeing Erin's spirit crushed by a factor which is largely out of Erin's hands. Natalie's sympathy goes beyond the surface issue of baldness; she feels bad for the mental and emotional toll it's taking on Erin. She believes Erin to be a beautiful person inside out and hates that this circumstance is causing Erin to question her own worth and attractiveness. Natalie feels bad about Erin's baldness because she wants to alleviate her friend's emotional pain but often feels powerless to do so. She wants Erin to feel beautiful, confident, and comfortable in her own skin, with or without hair. Every time she sees Erin's confidence faltering, her heart aches a little more. Therefore, Natalie tries to convey to Erin that physical appearance isn't everything and that she should not let hair loss undermine her self-worth and dignity. Nonetheless, Natalie understands that reassurances from friends, while valuable, may not fully compensate for the deep personal pain that Erin feels. All Natalie can do is be there for her friend, offer shoulders to lean on, and give a listening ear to Erin's deepest fears and anxieties. She feels bad because she wishes she could shield Erin from this heartbreaking experience, or at least make her journey a bit less painful. Natalie’s empathy for Erin, therefore, is rooted in a deep understanding of her friend's plight, a shared grief over a significant personal loss, and a sincere wish for her friend's happiness and peace."},{"instruction":"Given the rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about the dollar's strong rebound on a particular Thursday following the release of economic data that displayed a narrower U.S. current account deficit in the third quarter than what was initially anticipated. The news led to a relief rally for the U.S. currency, which had been under significant pressure before this positive development. To provide more context, the U.S. current account is a measurement of a country's trade balance, taking into account its exports and imports of goods and services, investment income, and net transfers. A current account deficit indicates that a country imports more goods and services than it exports, leading to a negative net balance. This can sometimes put downward pressure on the currency. In this case, the market had expected a much larger deficit, which would have been more negative for the dollar. However, the narrower deficit in the data released brought some relief to the beleaguered U.S. currency, sparking a rally that resulted in a strong rebound for the dollar. This indicates an improvement in market sentiment and a potential boost in the dollar's value against other major currencies."},{"instruction":"Question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Disillusioned by his parents and a dull job as a post room boy in an advertising firm, Jimmy finds an outlet for his teenage angst by taking amphetamines, partying, riding scooters and brawling with Rockers, accompanied by his Mod friends Dave (Mark Wingett), Chalky (Philip Davis) and Spider (Gary Shail). One of the Mods' rivals, the Rockers, is in fact Jimmy's childhood friend, Kevin (Ray Winstone). An attack by hostile Rockers on Spider leads to a retaliation attack on Kevin. Jimmy participates in the beating, but when he realises the victim is Kevin, he doesn't help him, instead riding away on his scooter. A bank holiday weekend provides the excuse for the rivalry between Mods and Rockers to come to a head, as they both descend upon the seaside town of Brighton. A series of running battles ensues. As the police close in on the rioters, Jimmy escapes down an alleyway with Steph (Leslie Ash)Â â a girl on whom he has a crushÂ â and they have sex. When the pair emerge, they find themselves in the middle of the melee just as police are detaining rioters. Jimmy is arrested, detained with a volatile, popular Mod he calls 'Ace Face' (Sting), and later fined the then-large sum of Â£50.

It was after midnight. So, she figured her new friend, Jason, was already dead. And so were her hopes of landing a secretarial job in time to keep her apartment. Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else. Maybe it was time to go home for a while. Surely she could put up with her mother for a few weeks while looking for work. She opened her Favorites list and clicked on the link for The Orange Leader. Sondra had not been back to her home town in a long time, but she liked to keep up with what was going on there. Occasionally, she'd see one of her old classmates in a wedding announcement. Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries. She checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist. Not enough pay. Then she saw a full-page ad announcing the upcoming Grand Opening of Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn. Open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, 6:00 PM to Midnight. For ages 12-20. Free soft drinks and popcorn. Live band. Five bucks to get in. Only twenty-five cents for arcade games.

It would play two hours a night, and earn 2,000 per week. Divided by four band members... Sondra could actually live on that! Not very well--but she could get by.

Identify the options that are related to the freeway: To answer this question, we should first identify which options are closely related to a freeway. From the given options, we can see that the exit ramp and stop light are associated with the functioning of a freeway. 2. Assess the functionality of each related option: Now that we have identified the options related to a freeway, it's time to assess their functionality. The exit ramp is designed specifically for vehicles to leave a freeway in a safe and controlled manner. On the other hand, a stop light is an essential traffic control device for intersections and not intended for getting off a freeway. 3. Remove unrelated options: Considering the options that are not related to the freeway – garage, driveway, and repair shop – these are not relevant to the question as they are not directly connected to a freeway and do not enable an automobile to get off a freeway. 4.

When, as the story goes, Milan-based artist and designer Piero Fornasetti (1913-1988) spotted the beestung lips and Mona Lisa-esque gaze of Belle Epoque opera singer Lina Cavalieri in an old magazine, he saw opportunity. Before long, he was recasting and tweaking her image, reimagining her as a vixen, a bandit and a deep-sea diver in an array of Surrealist motifs on dinner plates, paperweights, teacups and bathroom tiles. From the 1940s to the 1980s, Mr. Fornasetti spun out a prodigious collection of other illustrated pieces, applying crosshatched Piranesi engravings to lacquered secretaries, drawing fossils on tabletops and concocting trippy cityscapes from images of playing cards on paneled screens. Furniture design in itself wasn’t a fixation, said his son, Barnaba Fornasetti, who took over the business after his father’s death, after working alongside him for years. Some of the forms were the work of others—most notably the Italian architect and designer Giò Ponti. “My father saw himself as a decorator of surfaces,” said the younger Mr. Fornasetti, who once gave a Fender Stratocaster the family’s patented print treatment for an Italian collector. “His vision is not classifiable to a style or period, so it’s not fashion but an influencer of fashion. Decoration is something like music. You need it for your soul.” This week, “Piero Fornasetti: The Practical Madness” opens at the Louvre’s Les Arts Decoratifs, in Paris. The more than 1,000 pieces that the exhibition showcases, adorned with witty and sometimes transgressive prints, foreshadow today’s fad for wildly patterned surfaces. (See Isabel and Ruben Toledo’s new makeup compacts for MAC or Louis Vuitton’s spring dresses emblazoned with Fornasetti-style prints.) More evidence of the artist’s currency: In January, the Italian brand Valentino collaborated on a six-piece collection with Fornasetti that included a scarf, a tray and a stool. Valentino designers Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli see an accord between the two brands, or “Italian patrimonies,” as they put it: “We’ve found the same culture of luxury linked to the idea of beauty and manufacturing perfection.” We asked a few other Fornasetti connoisseurs to talk about their favorite discoveries. Here’s what they picked. Screen Gem “Piero was Pop before Pop,” said New York-based interior designer Frank de Biasi, describing Mr. Fornasetti’s appropriation of ready-made imagery. “I once found a four-panel screen depicting the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. The severe graphic design, contrasted with the slick resin surface, transformed this copy of a Piranesi print into something fresh and modern for the entry hall of the Colonial Revival house where I placed it.” Fornasetti Pompeiana Screen (a piece in the same spirit), 15,725, Barneys New York, 212-826-8900 Side Show “His love of decoration and his surreal motifs are all things I relate to,” said London-based jewelry designer Solange Azagury-Partridge. “I have a round side table at home that’s a bit knocked around. But I don’t think he would mind, considering his irreverent take on things.” Fornasetti ‘Re Sole’ Table, 1,540, Barneys New York, 212-826-8900 Snakes on a Rug Fornasetti designs are “intelligent in the same way a New Yorker cartoon is,” said New York-based interior designer Richard Mishaan. “Elegant and provocative.

In unusually direct criticism, the Prime Minister described the Church of England’s views on the North as ‘outdated’ and ‘condescending’. His comments follow a recent article by the Archbishop in which he said ‘entire cities are being cast aside and left to their own devices’. David Cameron has called Archbishop Justin Welby's views on the North 'outdated' and 'condescending' after a Church of England report said the region is heading backwards while the South surges ahead. Archbishop Welby also claimed that most of the country outside London and the South East had been left ‘abandoned and hopeless’, watching the wealth of the capital grow while they are trapped in a ‘vicious circle of decline’. Mr Cameron has now hit back, telling BBC Radio Manchester the Church was guilty of ‘just painting a picture that everything in the North is somehow going in the wrong direction’. Cameron pointed to Manchester as a revived city where unemployment rates have been lower in recent years than in London. He said: ‘Where I don’t agree with some of the things the Church of England said is I think there was an element of talking down the performance of some of our cities, including cities like Manchester, which in recent years have seen something of a revival. ‘When you look at the transport investment in Manchester, when you look at some of the infrastructure that’s being put in, you look at some of the great buildings that are going up, the growth in jobs, the fact that you’ve got a city council that’s working incredibly closely with the Government over issues like the ‘‘Northern powerhouse’’... ‘I thought the Church of England report rather outdated. I found it a bit condescending when it came to our great Northern cities. I don’t think it was really up to date on what is happening. 'I accept there are still regional disparities that we need to deal with but I don’t think we deal with them by just painting a picture that everything in the North is somehow going in the wrong direction and everything in the South is going in the right direction.’ Mr Cameron pointed out that employment rates in Manchester had been higher in recent years than those in London. He added: ‘If you talk to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce or the chambers of commerce in cities like Leeds and Newcastle, I would rather hope they would say the same thing.’ The Prime Minister also defended the benefit cap which he has pledged to cut to £23,000 after the election if the Tories win. He said: ‘I think it is right to say you shouldn’t get more [if you are] out of work than a family that is in work. 'Otherwise we send a totally perverse signal that somehow it’s better off to spend a life on benefits when you can work.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"David Cameron, a leader of a country, disagreed with Archbishop Justin Welby, an important religious person, about the situation in the North of England.

Similarly, for the second inner list [18, 1, 17, -25], the product would be -7650 (18 * 1 * 17 * -25). Part #3: Add the products to the output list. Usage: The output list should contain the products obtained from step #2. For example, for the given input list, the output list should have 8 numbers, with the first two numbers being 598 and -7650 based on step #2: [598, -7650, ...] Part #4: Ensure the output list has the same length as the number of inner lists in the input list. Usage: The length of the output list and the input list should match. For example, the given input list has 8 inner lists, and after applying the above steps, the resulting output list should also have 8 numbers: [598, -7650, 1365, 2064, 292620, -32670, 544, -417600]"},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to French: List of documents before the Commission at its fortieth session","output":"Étape 1: Diviser la phrase en segments pour la traduction.

However, considering that the word \\"awesome\\" generally denotes an extremely positive impression, it would be reasonable to assume that the reviewer is highly satisfied with the product or service. Taking this into account, one could infer that the star rating would likely be close to the highest possible rating. A rating of ★★★★★ (5 stars) would be a strong possibility, as it represents an excellent experience where everything met or exceeded the reviewer's expectations. Alternatively, it could also fall in the range of ★★★★ (4 stars) to ★★★★½ (4.5 stars) if the reviewer has some minor caveats or unmentioned expectations that were not entirely met, even though their overall impression was very positive.

The primary objective of napalm is to create an incendiary effect, leading to extensive burning and fire damage in the targeted areas. Napalm has garnered infamy due to its deployment in various military conflicts, such as World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, where it caused significant harm to both the environment and human populations.

In English language text, it's customary to separate words with a space, so I discerned this as the first standalone word. 2. \\"1\\" - The context in which numbers appear can often help you figure out what they signify. In this case, given that it's followed by what looks like a month (\\"October\\"), it's safe to deduce that this is referring to a day and so it stands as a separate entity. 3. \\"October\\" - It is pretty straightforward.

She was conscious of the potential perception that her acting career might be seen as successful merely due to her relationship with Spielberg, which could have cast a shadow over her credibility and accomplishments as an individual artist. During their time together, both Irving and Spielberg were pursuing their respective professional careers in the film industry, which brought about various stresses and strains on their relationship. By consciously deciding not to act in Spielberg's films, Irving sought to maintain a clear separation between her personal and professional life, thereby preserving the integrity of her career choices and demonstrating her independence as an actress. This move also aimed to prevent any potential accusations of nepotism or favoritism, which could have arisen if she had been cast in his projects while they were romantically involved. Furthermore, Irving's decision to focus on forging her path independently also highlights her ambition and self-confidence as an actress. She wanted her work to speak for itself without being overshadowed by her connection to Spielberg.

Options: - starting fire - illumination - heat - make fire - frustration Explain why a human would choose \\"illumination\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"illumination\\" as the answer to the question because the primary purpose of lighting a match in a dark tunnel is to provide a source of light. The other given options may have some degree of validity, but the context of the situation is essential for determining the most suitable answer. Let's analyze each option to understand the reason why \\"illumination\\" is the most accurate choice: - Starting fire: Although a match can potentially start a fire, it would not make sense to focus on that in a dark tunnel, where the main concern is usually visibility. Moreover, trying to start a fire in a tunnel could be dangerous due to limited space and air circulation. - Illumination: As mentioned earlier, this is the most logical choice because a match can provide light in a dark tunnel, allowing a person to see their surroundings and navigate the area more comfortably. The light from the match will help them find their way and avoid any obstacles or potential dangers. - Heat: While it's true that a lit match generates heat, it cannot provide sufficient warmth, especially in a large, cold tunnel. People typically use other, more effective sources of heat, such as stoves or heaters. - Make fire: This option is similar to \\"starting fire,\\" but simply indicating \\"making fire\\" instead of \\"starting\\" does not change the fact that starting a fire in a dark tunnel is not the primary purpose of lighting a match. - Frustration: Lighting a match out of frustration is an implausible option, as people usually resort to other methods for relieving frustration and stress. In a dark tunnel, using a match for illumination would be the primary focus and of utmost importance. Given the options and context, it is clear that \\"illumination\\" serves as the most appropriate and common reason for lighting a match in a dark tunnel."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again.

Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911.

Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off. This dormancy period helps trees. It allows them to survive the cold and dry winter. Plants only want to grow when conditions are right.

Mr Gianforte has apologised for the incident in which he is accused of \\"body slamming\\" Ben Jacobs who works for the UK's Guardian newspaper. In a victory speech he said he had \\"learned a lesson\\" and was \\"sorry\\". A Fox News journalist who saw Wednesday's incident said Mr Gianforte had \\"grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground\\" after the reporter persisted in trying to question him. Mr Gianforte had previously said Mr Jacobs had grabbed his wrist, pulling them both to the ground. \\"When you make a mistake you have to own up to it, that's the Montana way,\\" he said, after initial laughter among his supporters as he began to speak about the incident. \\"Last night I made a mistake, I took an action that I can't take back. \\"I am not proud of what happened, I should not have responded in the way that I did, and I'm sorry,\\" he said. \\"I should not have treated that reporter that way, and for that I'm sorry Mr Ben Jacobs,\\" he added. He has been charged with misdemeanour assault, for which the maximum penalty is a 500 (Â£385) fine and a six-month jail term. Mr Gianforte, a multimillionaire technology executive and Christian conservative, beat Mr Quist, a banjo-playing folk singer, to fill an empty seat in the House of Representatives. Mr Quist said he was \\"sure that Montanans will hold Mr Gianforte accountable.\\" The vacancy in Montana arose after President Donald Trump appointed the previous holder of the seat, Ryan Zinke, as interior secretary. Three of the state's largest newspapers withdrew their endorsements of Mr Gianforte after the violent incident on the eve of the vote. The state's Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, described it as \\"a wake-up call to all Montanans and Americans\\". \\"It is unsettling on many levels that Greg Gianforte physically assaulted a journalist and then lied, refusing to take responsibility for his actions,\\" he said in a statement. More than a third of the votes were cast by mail before it took place, an electoral official told Reuters. Republicans have held the state's single seat in the House for two decades. The party has, in general, been downplaying the case and casting it as an errant mistake, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher says. But critics are drawing the line between the rhetoric of President Trump - in which he has dubbed certain media outlets as \\"enemies of the American people\\" - and the incident, our correspondent adds. Summary:","output":"Republican Greg Gianforte has won Montana's special congressional election with 51% of the vote over Democratic rival Rob Quist's 43%. Gianforte apologized for reportedly \\"body slamming\\" Guardian journalist Ben Jacobs the day before the election, saying he \\"learned a lesson\\" and was \\"sorry.\\" Gianforte has been charged with misdemeanor assault and could face a maximum penalty of a 500 fine and six months in jail. The seat in the House of Representatives was vacated after President Trump appointed the previous holder, Ryan Zinke, as interior secretary."},{"instruction":"1.

Sentence 1: From her former marriage, Katy Spencer had a daughter, Ann (a graduate of Texas Tech in 1962). Sentence 2: From her previous marriage, Ann had a daughter, Katy Spencer (a 1962 graduate of Texas Tech). Step 2: Identify the key components of each sentence. Sentence 1: - Main subject: Katy Spencer - Relationship: had a daughter - Daughter: Ann - Ann's achievement: graduate of Texas Tech in 1962 Sentence 2: - Main subject: Ann - Relationship: had a daughter - Daughter: Katy Spencer - Katy's achievement: graduate of Texas Tech in 1962 Step 3: Compare the key components and their interactions. Comparing the two sentences, we notice the following differences: 1. The main subjects are different. In sentence 1, the main subject is Katy Spencer, while in sentence 2, the main subject is Ann. 2. In sentence 1, Katy Spencer is the one who had a daughter named Ann, while in sentence 2, Ann had a daughter named Katy Spencer. Step 4: Determine if sentences are paraphrases. Based on the comparison, we conclude that the two sentences are not paraphrases of each other.

In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony.

Smile and address the entire room as you speak. Pass out a syllabus/class instructions and answer questions.\\"","output":"Title: Embracing the Warm Welcome: Effective Techniques for Introducing Educators to Students Introduction As the new academic year dawns, educators worldwide prepare to step into a variety of classrooms filled with fresh faces, youthful enthusiasm, and eager minds ready to learn. The opening moments of a class set the tone for the semester, and establishing a strong rapport with students from the get-go can significantly impact their overall experience in your class. A well-crafted introduction that exudes warmth and professionalism is crucial to fortifying this positive relationship between educator and student. In this article, we will explore the essential elements of engaging with students at the beginning of the semester, from greeting them with a smile and passing out the syllabus, to answering their questions and demonstrating genuine interest in their perspectives. We will also provide tips for educators to create a supportive and energizing classroom environment that fosters success throughout the year. 1. Greet Students Warmly The first impression you make with a student is crucial as it lays the foundation for a lasting connection. A warm smile, friendly demeanor, and openness can go a long way in establishing a welcoming atmosphere in the classroom. Stand at the doorway, greeting each student individually as they come in. This helps to create an instant bond with them and will make them feel acknowledged and valued. Being approachable and accessible from the start will encourage students to feel comfortable seeking assistance and engaging in the classroom. 2. Introduce Yourself and Encourage Student Participation Once all students are seated, take a moment to introduce yourself, sharing professional and personal anecdotes that showcase your expertise and passion for your subject. This will help to humanize you as an educator, fostering trust and respect with your students. Involve students in the process by requesting them to introduce themselves, stating their names and sharing a tidbit of personal information. This exercise not only facilitates camaraderie within the class but also allows you to learn more about your students. Additionally, engaging the entire room during introductions can boost the energy and captivate student attention. 3. Distributing the Syllabus and Class Instructions Setting clear expectations from the first day is crucial for students to understand course objectives, assessment criteria, and resources available for their support. Pass out a syllabus that outlines the course structure, goals, grading policies, and evaluation procedures, as well as relevant dates and deadlines. Take the time to review the syllabus, ensuring that students understand key facets such as attendance and participation policies, assignment requirements, academic integrity, and expectations for respectful dialogue. Remember that this is an opportunity to establish your teaching philosophy and set clear boundaries, so students know what to expect throughout the semester. 4. Answering Questions and Addressing Concerns Open the floor to questions and address them with patience and empathy. Encourage students to clarify any aspects they deem confusing or unclear. By doing so, you validate their concerns and empower them to take charge of their educational experience. Additionally, it creates a sense of shared ownership in the course and builds trust that their voices are respected and valued. 5. Wrap Up on a High Note End your brief introductory session on a positive note by expressing enthusiasm for the semester and communicating your commitment to their success. Offer your contact information, including office hours and preferred methods of communication. This confirms that you are available for support, guidance, and assistance throughout the semester. Conclusion The power of first impressions should never be underestimated, especially in an educational setting. By greeting students warmly, introducing yourself and creating a sense of camaraderie, setting clear expectations with a syllabus, answering questions, and expressing your enthusiasm for the course, you will foster an empowering classroom environment. These actions will not only set the stage for a successful semester, but they will also nurture the kind of lasting connections that educators and students alike can cherish for years to come."},{"instruction":"Given the following passage \\"A number of modern movements or tendencies in Buddhism emerged during the second half of the 20th Century, including the Dalit Buddhist movement (also sometimes called 'neo-Buddhism'), Engaged Buddhism, and the further development of various Western Buddhist traditions.\\", answer the following question.

This task involves several steps and understanding the properties and functions of different physical objects included in the kit. Below, I'll provide a detailed explanation of this task: 1. Unboxing and inventory: The first step is to open the flat-pack kit and carefully remove all the components, including the wooden panels, screws, brackets, nails, dowels, and any other included hardware. It's important to become familiar with each part, understand its purpose, and ensure that everything listed in the assembly instructions is present. This may require knowledge of different types of screws, nails, and other hardware to identify them correctly. 2. Understanding the assembly instructions: Proper assembly of the furniture requires following the instructions provided in the manual, which often includes diagrams and labels for each part. Interpreting these instructions accurately necessitates knowing the various physical properties of the included objects, such as dimensions, shapes, and possible assembly orientations. 3. Preparing the necessary tools: To successfully assemble the bookshelf, certain tools are needed, including a screwdriver or drill, a hammer, and possibly a leveling tool. Having knowledge of these physical objects and their correct usage is essential for the task. 4. Assembling the frame: Begin by assembling the bookshelf frame through connecting wooden panels, such as the sides, top, and bottom, with the dowels, screws, or brackets as detailed in the instructions. The understanding of how these physical objects fit together, the strength of their connections, and the stability of constructed joints is crucial to building a sturdy and functional piece of furniture. 5. Installing shelves and supports: Often, bookshelves consist of multiple, adjustable shelves. This part of the task requires knowledge of shelf brackets, which are physical objects used to hold and support the shelves. Properly installing these brackets and securing the shelves in place necessitates an understanding of the physical properties of the brackets, screws, and wooden panels, as well as the tools required to drill and screw them into place. 6. Checking stability and alignment: After the main components have been assembled, evaluate the overall construction to ensure the bookshelf's stability and correct alignment. This assessment may involve tapping the structure gently to test its sturdiness, leveling the shelves using a leveling tool to verify that they are horizontally aligned, and visually checking the structure for gaps or misaligned parts. 7. Securing the bookshelf to the wall: Finally, many bookshelves, particularly taller ones, require additional support by anchoring them to a wall using brackets and screws. Knowing the physical properties of wall materials, such as drywall or brick, and selecting the appropriate anchors and screws will be crucial to safely secure the bookshelf. In conclusion, the task of assembling a bookshelf from a flat-pack kit is a complex process that requires knowledge of various physical objects, including wooden panels, screws, brackets, dowels, and tools, as well as their properties and functions, to perform effectively and result in a stable, robust, and functional piece of furniture."},{"instruction":"Wow...I don't know what to say.

Holmes remarks, \\"You've a magnificent brain, Moriarty. I admire it. I admire it so much I'd like to present it, pickled in alcohol, to the London Medical Society\\". \\"It would make an impressive exhibit\\", replies Moriarty. Later Holmes and Watson are visited at 221B Baker Street by Ann Brandon (Ida Lupino). She tells him that her brother Lloyd has received a strange note - a drawing of a man with an albatross hanging around his neck - identical to one received by her father just before his brutal murder ten years before. Holmes deduces that the note is a warning and rushes to find Lloyd Brandon. However he is too late, as Lloyd has been murdered by being strangled and having his skull crushed. Holmes investigates and attends a garden party, disguised as a music-hall entertainer, where he correctly believes an attempt will be made on Ann's life. Hearing her cries from a nearby park he captures her assailant, who turns out to be Gabriel Mateo, out for revenge on the Brandons for the murder of his father by Ann's father in a dispute over ownership of their South American mine. His murder weapon was a bolas. Mateo also reveals that it was Moriarty who urged him to seek revenge. Holmes realises that Moriarty is using the case as a distraction from his real crime, a crime that will stir the British Empire - an attempt to steal the Crown Jewels. Holmes rushes to the Tower of London to prevent the crime, and during a struggle Moriarty falls, presumably to his death.

Let's define the number of toys the younger son received as Y: Y = 3 * number of toys bought for the elder son Since the elder son received 60 toys, we can plug that value into the equation: Y = 3 * 60 Y = 180 So, the younger son received 180 toys. Now, to find the total number of toys Mr. Desmond bought, we'll add the number of toys he bought for both sons: Total toys = toys bought for elder son + toys bought for younger son Total toys = 60 + 180 Total toys = 240 Thus, Mr. Desmond bought 240 toys in total."},{"instruction":"Possible answers: i. Attending the conference; ii. Co-founded CalArchNet; iii. Working at Cal Poly; iv. not enough information; Q: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Ambassador Susan Rice on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for her meeting with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). (Win McNamee/Getty Images) U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a fresh round of face-to-face meetings with her Republican critics, and once again failed to find the public support she would need to secure her confirmation to serve as the next secretary of state. As with meetings she held Tuesday, Rice discussed her role in the Obama administration’s response to the Sept. 11 U.S. consulate attack in Benghazi, Libya, specifically comments she made five days afterward regarding the origins of the assault. Rice’s involvement in the administration’s response is complicated by the fact that President Obama is reportedly considering her to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton at the State Department. Rice met Wednesday morning with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is the ranking member on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is investigating the Libya attack. She also met with Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. After a 75-minute meeting with Rice, Collins told reporters: “I still have many questions that remain unanswered.” Collins said she was “troubled” that Rice, in her role as U.N. envoy, “decided to play what was essentially a political role at the height of a contentious presidential election campaign” by appearing on five political talk shows to present the administration’s position. Collins also noted that Rice was working at the State Department in 1998 — and was the assistant secretary for African Affairs — when U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed. Requests for additional security at both outposts had been denied and Collins said she asked Rice on Wednesday whether she had been involved in those decisions. “She [Rice] said she would have to refresh her memory, but that she was not directly involved in turning down the request,” Collins said. But the senator said Rice must have been aware of the requests. Collins demurred when asked if she would be able to support Rice if she is nominated by Obama to serve as the next secretary of state: “I would need to have additional information before I could support her nomination. She’s not been posted yet, our homeland security committee investigation is ongoing, there are many different players in this and there’s much yet to be learned. So I think it would be premature for me to reach that judgment now.” For his part, Obama on Wednesday once again voiced support for Rice. Asked by reporters during a White House Cabinet meeting whether he still supported his U.N. ambassador, Obama said: “Susan Rice is extraordinary.” With that, the rest of his Cabinet applauded. “I couldn’t be prouder of the job that she’s done,” he added. Back on Capitol Hill, Corker said Obama should nominate whoever “he thinks is best suited” to serve as his next top diplomat. “I am asking the president to step back away from all that’s happened and take a deep breath and to nominate the person that he really believes is the very best person to be secy of state for our country, regardless of relationship,” Corker said. But Corker said he remains troubled by the administration’s response to the Libya affair: “Whenever I’m in contact with anyone who has anything to do with either the intelligence, the communication, anything involving the way Washington itself has handled Benghazi, whenever I’m around anybody who’s had any close relationship, I will say that emotion within me rises tremendously.” Corker said so much of the GOP’s attention has focused on Rice “because she ended up being the spokesperson five days later.” This item has been updated since it was first published.

Over the past two days, four key Republican senators have emerged from private meetings to blast the United Nations ambassador’s explanation about what happened during and after the deadly attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Text Size - + reset Collins: 'Troubled' by Rice Obama calls Rice extraordinary (PHOTOS: Susan Rice's career) It’s not clear what Rice said behind closed doors to anger all these senators, but it’s obvious the meetings went badly and this was hardly a nominee-in-waiting charm offensive. Even Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, just the type of moderate Republican who might help break a filibuster on a nomination, said there were still too many questions about why Rice incorrectly characterized the Sept. 11 assault in five Sunday talk show interviews as the result of spontaneous protests at the same time the Libyan president was calling it a terrorist attack. “I don’t understand why she would not at least qualify her response to that question,” Collins told reporters after emerging from a 75-minute, closed-door meeting with Rice. (PHOTOS: What they're saying about Susan Rice) The Wednesday meeting in a secure briefing room in the Capitol basement came a day after a similar sit-down Rice had with three key voices on foreign policy and defense issues went terribly wrong. GOP Sens. John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte, all members of the Armed Services Committee, said they were more “troubled” about the Benghazi affair than they had been before their meeting with Rice. And Graham and Ayotte went so far as to say they would place a hold on her possible nomination. “If she were nominated tomorrow, I would hold her because we still have questions that have not been answered,” Ayotte told POLITICO on Wednesday. McCain, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee and Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential rival, hasn’t been as explicit. But one GOP senator told POLITICO Wednesday that McCain, Graham and Ayotte were so incensed after their powwow with Rice because they felt she was not being straight or candid with them about Benghazi. Rice acknowledged this week that she had mistakenly described the attack as something spontaneous rather than premeditated. But she said neither she nor anyone else in the administration intended to mislead the public. President Barack Obama defended Rice on Wednesday, just as he did at a news conference two weeks ago. “Susan Rice is extraordinary,” Obama said at the start of his Cabinet meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at his side and Rice seated at the end of the table. “Couldn’t be prouder of the job she’s done.” Both Clinton and Rice gave updates on tensions in the Middle East during the meeting. ||||| Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.), the presumptive incoming ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declined to explicitly criticize Susan Rice after meeting Wednesday morning with the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. ADVERTISEMENT Corker, whose panel would have primary jurisdiction if President Obama tapped Rice to become the next secretary of State, pledged he would not prejudge her possible nomination. A day after Corker said Rice would make a better chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee than secretary of State, he explained that he did not intend to steer Obama away from picking Rice. Corker said he would fairly consider Rice's nomination, if Obama chooses her to lead the State Department. “I know that at some point I may play a semi-important role in who the next secretary of State may be,” he told reporters. “Whoever the president nominates, I certainly plan to sit down and give a full hearing to, as I’ve said from Day One, regardless of who that nominee is,” he said. Corker promised to “weigh in heavily” when the nomination is made. However, he suggested the president try to step back from the intensifying debate over Rice and contemplate who would be the best person to succeed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “I’m asking the president to step back away from all that’s happened and take a deep breath and to nominate the person that he really believes is the very best person to be secretary of State for our country, regardless of relationship,” he said. He said the Senate holds the secretary of State to a higher standard than other Cabinet members. Corker said he is unhappy with the FBI’s and CIA’s handling of the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and its aftermath. “I’m very disappointed in the entire apparatus here,” he said. Earlier, Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) became the latest GOP senator to raise questions about Rice. After an almost two-hour meeting with the ambassador, Collins said she's unconvinced by Rice's explanation of her role after the attack. “I continue to be troubled by the fact that the UN ambassador decided to play what was essentially a political role at the height of a contentious presidential election ... by agreeing to go on the Sunday shows to present the administration's position,” said Collins, the top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee. Collins, a centrist Republican who would be a key vote for Rice if she is nominated, also said she is concerned about Rice's role in denying security requests prior to the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa. Collins's statement comes after three key Senate Republicans — Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (N.C.) and Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) — said Tuesday they were “more troubled” than ever after meeting with Rice. — Julian Pecquet contributed ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice has faced criticism from Republican senators after a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, with many questioning her explanations regarding the Benghazi attack on September 11. Despite President Obama once again voicing his support for Rice, the string of meetings seem to have diminished her chances of securing support needed for confirmation as the next Secretary of State, as senators continue to express concern over the administration's response to the Libya incident."},{"instruction":"These names were chosen to correspond to their rough equivalents in international chess , not literal translations of the Japanese names .

Here are excerpts from the conversation between the cockpit and air traffic control. (Audio courtesy: LiveATC.net) A woman aboard a United Airlines plane texted her husband that she was experiencing the “scariest moment” of her life after a passenger raced screaming toward the cockpit before being subdued by others on the plane, the woman’s husband said Tuesday. Donna Tellam of Boulder, Colo., was returning from a business trip to London via Dulles International Airport on Monday night, according to her husband, Curt. In a text, Donna Tellam told her husband that “some crazy guy just tried to get into the cockpit.” She also wrote that three passengers took the person down, right at her feet near her first-class seat. None of the passengers aboard the flight were reported to be injured. The plane returned to Dulles and the person was taken off. Officials at Dulles Airport said the passenger who was taken off the plane was “transported to a local hospital for observation.” Kimberly Gibbs, a spokesman for the agency that oversees the airport’s operations, said in an e-mail Tuesday that the passenger “has not been charged at this time.” [Professor arrested following mid-flight foreign policy rant] The incident started around 10:40 p.m. Monday. Once the person was subdued, the aircraft was searched and the passengers were allowed off the plane around midnight. Later Monday night, Tellam texted her husband that the incident was the “scariest moment of my life.” She told her husband she grabbed the guy sitting next to her and held on to him. Tellam told her husband she was sitting on the plane playing a game on her phone and waiting to get her computer when the person ran straight past her, screaming. He made it to the area where flight attendants typically sit outside the cockpit area before three men tackled him, she recalled to her husband. Tellam also told her husband that the passenger was saying “jihadists” were on the plane, but authorities have given no details on the incident. Those who allegedly took him down, according to Tellam’s husband, were saying “take off his shoes, check for bombs.” On Tuesday morning, Tellam’s husband was getting ready to go pick her up at the airport in Denver. “I was scared,” he said of receiving her text and hearing of the incident. Few other details emerged from officials on the incident, which unfolded shortly after Flight 1074 took off from Dulles around 10:15 p.m. with 33 passengers and six crew members on board. The Boeing 737 was headed to Denver. Local law enforcement officials met the plane at the gate at Dulles and the person was detained, according to United Airlines officials. Luke Punzenberger, a United Airlines spokesman, said in a statement that the passenger “failed to comply with crew instructions.” Punzenberger did not provide additional information on the disruption. ABC News reported that the person had to be held by other passengers after rushing the cockpit. It cited LiveATC.net, which provides air traffic control communications online. According to ABC News, the passenger “ran forward towards the cockpit and he is being restrained by passengers,” one of the pilots said during the flight. “Cockpit is secure and we would like to return to the airport and have the authorities meet him,” one of the pilots then said, according to the report. The pilot was said to speak in a calm voice on the recording and told air traffic controllers that he was “declaring an emergency due to a passenger disturbance.” He went on to say that the person was “restrained. We need to return to the airport,” according to LiveATC’s recording. After the pilot was asked by controllers, he said the incident was a “Level 2” disturbance. That is said to be the second lowest level of severity on a four-level scale. A Level 2 disturbance in the industry means there has been physically abusive behavior but no life-threatening behavior. Donna Tellam said to ABC News, “One held his feet and the other one kind of laid on top of him and then the flight attendants went and got some plastic restraints for his arms.” A video online purported to show scenes from the flight. In the video, a person appears to be held down by people on a flight. Gibbs, the spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority — which oversees Dulles Airport — said in an e-mail that there was “no impact to airport operations.” The passengers aboard the plane were rebooked by the airline to Denver.

Their religion, \\"Yazidism\\" is linked to ancient Mesopotamian religions and combines aspects of Zoroastrianism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Yazidis who marry non-Yazidis are automatically considered to be converted to the religion of their spouse and therefore are not permitted to call themselves Yazidis. They live primarily in the Nineveh Province of Iraq. Additional communities in Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have been in decline since the 1990s as a result of significant migration to Europe, especially to Germany. The Yazidis' cultural practices are observably Kurdish, and almost all speak Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish).

The band primarily consisted of vocalist Chrissy Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. Amphlett garnered widespread attention for performing on stage in a school uniform and fishnet stockings, and often used an illuminated neon tube as a prop for displaying aggression towards both band members and the audience. Originally a five-piece, the band underwent numerous line-up changes, with Amphlett and McEntee remaining as core members, before its dissolution in 1996. In 1991 Divinyls released diVINYLS on Virgin Records and the single \\"I Touch Myself\\" which became their only Australian No.1 single. The song reached No. 4 in the US and No. 10 in the UK. The majority of Divinyls' hits were co-written by Amphlett and McEntee, but in this case they wrote with Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg. diVINYLS reached No. 5 on the Australian album charts and No. 15 on Billboard Top 200. The drummer for the diVINYLS sessions was Charley Drayton, who became romantically involved with Amphlett: they married in July 1999, and from 2000, lived together in New York. A disagreement with Virgin Records stifled future development outside Australia where they released popular albums and achieved two more top twenty singles with \\"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\\" No. 19 in 1992 and \\"I'm Jealous\\" No. 14 in 1995. During the 1980s and 1990s Amphlett collaborated as a songwriter with other artists including Chrissie Hynde and Cyndi Lauper, and both Amphlett and McEntee worked on solo projects. A live album, Divinyls Live, was released in 1991 but Divinyls did not provide another studio album for five years. In the early 1990s they recorded a series of cover songs for various movie soundtracks, including the Young Rascals' \\"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\\" for Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992), the Wild Ones' \\"Wild Thing\\" for Reckless Kelly (1993), and Roxy Music's \\"Love Is the Drug\\" for Super Mario Brothers (1993). The song \\"I Touch Myself\\" caused such a controversy it had trouble getting airplay in many US-area markets; so much to the point that while performing their song live in Texas at Austin Aqua Fest 1991 the plug was pulled on the band mid-set by organisers. This song is also mentioned in The Guide to Getting it On by Paul Joannides. It wasn't until 1996 that Underworld, their fifth studio album, was released in Australia by BMG. Despite the success of diVINYLS Virgin had not kept them under contract and BMG did not release Underworld in the US. As with What A Life! they worked with three producers, beginning with Peter Collins recording \\"I'm Jealous\\" in Nashville, followed by Keith Forsey for \\"Sex Will Keep Us Together\\" and \\"Heart of Steel\\". Although \\"Heart of Steel\\" was chosen as a single, Divinyls discontinued working with Forsey because according to Amphlett \\"he was a bit too 'pop' for us\\" and remaining tracks were produced by their drummer Drayton. By the end of 1996, Amphlett and McEntee had a falling out and separated without formally disbanding Divinyls.

Article: The World Health Organization warns that millions of people are dying every year from indoor air pollution. The WHO finds that poor cooking, heating and lighting technologies are killing millions of people each year. Indoor air pollution results from the use of dangerous fuels and cook-stoves in the home. To help fight the problem, the WHO announced, new guidelines aimed at reducing household pollutants. WHO officials say nearly three billion people are unable to use clean fuels and technologies for cooking? heating and lighting. And they say more than seven million people die from exposure to indoor or outdoor air pollution each year. Of that number, the WHO says about 4. 3 million people die from household air pollution given off by simple coal cook-stoves. Most of the deaths are in developing countries. Carlos Dora is Coordinator in the WHO's Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. He says people should not use unprocessed coal and kerosene fuel indoors. He says opening a window or door to let out the harmful air will not improve the situation. It will only pollute the outdoors. WHO officials say indoor pollution leads to early deaths from stroke, heart and lung disease, childhood pneumonia and lung cancer. Women and girls are the main victims. The United Nations found that more than 95 percent of households in sub-Saharan Africa depend on solid fuels for cooking. It says huge populations in India, China and Latin American countries, such as Guatemala and Peru, are also at risk. Nigel Bruce is a professor of Public Health at the University of Liverpool. He says researchers are developing good cook-stoves and other equipment to burn fuels in a more efficient way. WHO experts note some new, safe and low-cost technologies that could help are already available. In India, you can buy an induction stove for about 8.00. And in Africa a you can buy a solar lamp for less than 1. 00. Question: What has been done to reduce indoor air pollution? Options: A: The WHO provided selfless assistance for the poor.

The triode, however, was a fragile device that consumed a lot of power. Physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld filed a patent for a field-effect transistor (FET) in Canada in 1925, which was intended to be a solid-state replacement for the triode. Lilienfeld also filed identical patents in the United States in 1926 and 1928. However, Lilienfeld did not publish any research articles about his devices nor did his patents cite any specific examples of a working prototype. Because the production of high-quality semiconductor materials was still decades away, Lilienfeld's solid-state amplifier ideas would not have found practical use in the 1920s and 1930s, even if such a device had been built.

We will delve into the language utilized in the premise, analyze the intended meaning, and relate it to the hypothesis. 1. Premise Language: The provided premise uses a phrase \\"Scientific gentleman, he was.\\" At first glance, it seems that the sentence structure is slightly unusual, as it places the subject \\"he\\" and the verb \\"was\\" at the end of the statement. This construction is known as anastrophe, which is a literary technique where the typical syntax of a sentence is reversed. It is often used for emphasis or to create a rhetorical effect. 2. Intended Meaning: The term \\"scientific gentleman\\" likely refers to an individual who is both educated in the sciences and is of high social or intellectual standing. A gentleman, in this context, would be someone who is courteous, well-mannered, and respectable. To be considered a \\"scientific gentleman\\" means that the individual is knowledgeable and practiced in the science field while possessing the qualities of a gentleman. 3. Relating to the Hypothesis: Given the intended meaning of \\"scientific gentleman,\\" it is reasonable to assume that the individual in the premise has engaged in scientific endeavors or possesses a deep understanding of the scientific principles. The hypothesis, \\"He was very scientific,\\" aims to clarify the degree of the individual's involvement in the scientific field. It suggests that he was not only knowledgeable but also deeply engaged and passionate about his scientific pursuits. 4. Conclusion: It is important to note that the premise does not explicitly state how deeply invested the individual is in his scientific endeavors. The term \\"scientific gentleman\\" is indicative of someone knowledgeable in the scientific field, but it does not shed light on the intensity of their passion or their degree of expertise. However, considering the context, the use of the term \\"scientific gentleman\\" instead of simply using \\"gentleman\\" implies a significant emphasis on the individual's engagement with science. This, in turn, would suggest that the hypothesis \\"He was very scientific\\" is likely true. In conclusion, while the premise does not definitively confirm the hypothesis \\"He was very scientific,\\" it does provide substantial support for the claim. The choice of words in the premise communicates the significance of the individual's scientific pursuits, thus making it reasonable to conclude that he was indeed \\"very scientific.\\""},{"instruction":"What is the first name of the person that asks Father Goodard about a job?

Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"vertebrates never lack a brain. Vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, all possess a brain as the central organ of their nervous system. The brain is responsible for controlling and coordinating their bodily functions. Invertebrates, on the other hand, display more variation in their nervous system organization. While many invertebrates have brains, some, such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts, and starfish, lack a centralized brain. Instead, they possess diffuse or localized nerve nets that help coordinate their body functions without a centralized control center. In summary, vertebrates consistently possess brains, while invertebrates may or may not have a brain, depending on the specific species and its nervous system organization."},{"instruction":"Write an article with the title: \\"Syria blames rebels for Houla massacre\\" Article:","output":"Title: \\"Syria Says Rebels Caused Sad Event in Houla\\" Once upon a time in a country far, far away called Syria, there was a very sad and scary event called the \\"Houla massacre.\\" This event happened because the people in Syria were not getting along.

Viriconium is known as the Pastel City. Both universal and particular, the city has a shifting topography and history, and is sometimes known by names such as 'Uroconium'. The first book, The Pastel City (1971), presents a civilization in decline where medieval social patterns clash with the advanced technology and superscience energy weapons that the citizens of the city know how to use but have forgotten how to engineer. The more complex second novel is A Storm of Wings (1982). It is set eighty years later than The Pastel City. and stylistically it is far denser and more elaborate. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. Harrison brilliantly depicts the workings of civilization on the verge of collapse and the heroic efforts of individuals to help it sustain itself a little longer. The third novel, In Viriconium (1982) (US title: The Floating Gods), was nominated for the Guardian Fiction Prize during 1982. It is a moody portrait of artistic subcultures in a city beset by a mysterious plague. Where the previous books in the series held some sword and sorcery elements, In Viriconium goes beyond black humour into a coma of despair.

However, an occluded front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility. Columbia 409 and Freeman's Beechcraft are both diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport. Salt Lake air traffic control assigns Columbia 409 to land ahead of Freeman's Beechcraft. As Columbia 409 is about to start its descent, First Officer Urias unlocks himself from his seat to check out a vibration. Just then, Freeman suffers a massive heart attack and descends into the approach of Columbia 409. The Beechcraft impacts Columbia 409 just above the co-pilot seat, blowing Urias out of the plane to his death and killing Flight Engineer Julio. Captain Stacy is struck in the face by debris and is blinded. Nancy Pryor, the First Stewardess, rushes to the flight deck, where Captain Stacy is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch before losing consciousness. Pryor informs the Salt Lake control tower that the crew is dead or badly injured and that there is no one to fly the plane. She gives an assessment of the damage as a large hole on the right side of the flight deck that wiped out most of the instrument gauges over the engineer station. Joe Patroni, Columbia's Vice President of Operations, is apprised of Columbia 409's situation. He seeks the advice of Captain Al Murdock, Columbia's chief flight instructor, who also happens to be Nancy Pryor's boyfriend, even though their relationship was \\"on the rocks\\" at that time.

Movie title: Two Brothers Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Set in Cambodia during the 1930's during French colonial rule, two tigers; one male and one female, meet and mate. Months later, the tiger couple have given birth to two tiger cubs, who would one day get separated after the ancient temple where they live is disturbed by Aidan McRory (Guy Pearce), who intends to steal and sell the ancient statues at an auction in London. Two tiger cubs are playing when the second cub (later named Sangha) comes upon a young civet. Sangha chases the civet into its burrow and the mother civet appears and chases Sangha up a tree. The first tiger cub (later named Kumal) appears and chases the mother civet back into her burrow. Eventually, humans come across them in their temple home and the tigress arrives to protect the cubs. She picks Sangha up and runs for safety. Kumal follows, but can't keep up and falls behind. The cubs' father appears, but the men have caught up with them and he is shot dead by McRory when attacking a hunter, who might have harmed his cub, as protection. McRory is an unscrupulous but kind explorer, big-game hunter, and temple looter. He discovers Kumal and befriends him after having shot his father, but McRory is arrested later on for stealing sacred statues from the ancient temple and Kumal is kept by the chief in the Cambodian village where McRory had been staying. The chief then sells Kumal to a circus owned by cruel circus ringmaster Zerbino, his wife, and his faithful sabre swallowing and fire breathing friend Saladin where he is to be the star attraction. McRory is soon released from prison by the French administrator, Eugene Normandin due to being a big fan of McRory and all his exploits but is not permitted to leave the country until all the formalities are completed within the three years sentencing. Nevertheless, McRory is... The answer to this question is:","output":"In the movie \\"Two Brothers,\\" Aidan McRory, played by Guy Pearce, is a big-game hunter, explorer, and temple looter. Although the film does not specify an explicit vow made by McRory, his character undergoes a transformation in the story. After being arrested for stealing sacred statues from an ancient temple and witnessing the consequences of his actions on the two tiger cubs, McRory appears to develop a sense of responsibility and a change of heart. Throughout the film, McRory becomes more connected with Kumal, one of the tiger cubs, as well as the injustices happening to animals and the local people due to colonial rule. As his character evolves, it is implied that he regrets his past actions and is dedicated to making amends. By the end of the movie, McRory works towards reuniting the two tiger cubs and protecting them from further harm. From the character development and events in the movie, one can infer that McRory implicitly vows to never again engage in activities that would harm or exploit animals, sacred sites, or the local people, though it's not explicitly stated as a vow. Instead, his actions and change in attitude demonstrate his commitment to a new, more compassionate and responsible path."},{"instruction":"Acest lucru ar rezolva problema timpului limitat pentru un singur om, o problemă care nu poate fi rezolvată în alt mod.

I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow.

The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

Specifically, the Euratom Safeguards Office is a part of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). It operates under the legal framework provided by the Euratom Treaty and additional complementary arrangements. The Euratom Safeguards system is designed to ensure that nuclear materials within the European Union are used exclusively for peaceful purposes, such as energy production and research activities, and not diverted to any military or non-peaceful applications. In ensuring compliance with the agreement and Regulation No. 3227/76, the Euratom Safeguards Office has several responsibilities: 1. Inspections: The Euratom Safeguards Office conducts regular inspections in nuclear facilities across the European Union. These inspections aim to verify that nuclear materials are accounted for and utilized in accordance with the declared purpose as per the agreement. 2. Reporting: Nuclear facility operators are required to provide reports on the inventory, use, and transfer of nuclear materials. The Euratom Safeguards Office is responsible for evaluating these reports and comparing them with their inspection findings to confirm the consistency of information provided. 3. Monitoring: The Euratom Safeguards Office employs various technical methods to monitor nuclear facilities. These methods include the installation of cameras, seals, and other equipment, which enable the continuous tracking and verification of nuclear material movements within the facilities. 4. Collaboration with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA): The Euratom Safeguards Office coordinates and cooperates with the IAEA to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of safeguards implementation in the EU member states. This collaboration aims to avoid duplication of activities and share best practices for strengthening the overall non-proliferation regime. 5. Regulations updates: The Euratom Safeguards Office continuously revises and updates its regulatory framework according to the latest international standards and best practices. This ensures an effective and up-to-date system for ensuring the safe and peaceful use of nuclear materials within the European Union. In conclusion, the Euratom Safeguards Office performs a crucial function in the field of nuclear safety and security by verifying that nuclear operators adhere to the provisions in the agreement and Regulation No. 3227/76.

Have you ever sat in front of a campfire? What are two things you notice? The fire creates light. It is also warm by the fire, meaning it creates heat. The energy of the fire comes from the stored energy in the wood. The wood contains chemical energy. As it burns, the chemical energy is changed into light and heat. Not all chemical energy changes produce light and heat. Our cars use gasoline as a fuel. Gasoline contains chemical energy. When our cars burn gasoline in their engines, it is converted into motion and heat. When energy changes forms, energy is conserved. Question: \\"How does a drummer transfer motion energy to sound energy?\\" Answer: \\"He changes the chemical energy to sound\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer to the question is not correct. The drummer transfers motion energy to sound energy not chemical energy to sound energy. When the drummer strikes the drumhead with the drumstick, the motion energy from the moving drumstick is transferred to the drumhead causing it to vibrate. This vibration of the drumhead creates sound energy. So, the correct answer would be \\"The drummer transfers motion energy to sound energy by hitting the drumhead with a drumstick, causing it to vibrate and create sound.\\""},{"instruction":"Complete the following sentence. Sarah chose to knit a scarf instead of crocheting one because the","output":"knitting technique appealed more to her due to several reasons. Firstly, Sarah finds knitting to be more engaging and easier to pick up than crocheting. This is mainly due to the orthogonal movement of the needles in knitting compared to the rotational movement required in crocheting. The knitting process involves the use of two needles which are used in a cross and release manner. This results in a series of loops that create the fabric of the scarf. It's much like the action of tying shoelaces, just with a lot of loops being tied together at once. This made the learning process for Sarah much less strenuous. Secondly, Sarah appreciates the flexibility that knitting offers in terms of design and texture. While crochet can produce beautifully intricate designs, knitting offers a different type of versatility. The ability to switch easily between knit and purl stitches within a single row allows for a wide variety of textures and patterns. This makes it possible for Sarah to create a unique pattern for her scarf and add any kind of design she wants with relative ease. Thirdly, the feel of the finished product plays a huge part in Sarah's preference for knitting. Knitted items tend to be lighter and more flexible than crocheted ones, due to the differences in how the yarn is looped and pulled through. A knitted scarf will drape and fold more naturally, and Sarah prefers this softer, more fluid end result. Knitted fabric has that stretchiness, which reacts more like woven cloth. She likes that her scarves can be folded away neatly and compactly for storage. Also, Sarah enjoys the rhythmic, meditative nature of knitting. Once she gets going, the repetitive motion can be very soothing, almost hypnotic. This, combined with the satisfying click-clack sound that the knitting needles make, offers a therapeutic value that she doesn't find in crocheting. Lastly, Sarah prefers the results of knitting when considering aesthetics. Knitting has a right and wrong side to its fabric, which allows each side to present a different appearance offering diversity in design, as opposed to the uniform, somewhat one-dimensional appearance of crocheting. The combination of these reasons explains why Sarah chose to knit a scarf instead of crocheting one. Despite the charms of crocheting, knitting suits Sarah's personal preferences and needs better. It's a more gentle and therapeutic activity that she finds incredibly fulfilling and rewarding."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Six girls have been found murdered in the apartment of famed Russian occultist, Karl Raymarseivich Raymar, and police cannot explain it.

Not even his estranged daughter Olivia McKenna (Melissa Newman) or her husband Allan (Adam West) knows what happened until they meet Samuel Dockstader (Donald Hotton), a feature writer for \\"The World of the Occult\\". Dockstader, once a friend to Raymar, explains that Raymar was a psychic vampire who gained great powers of telekinesis by kidnapping young girls, terrorizing them, and feeding off the bioenergy they produced. Allan does not believe him, but Dockstader shows Olivia a set of photographs to demonstrate how bioenergy works and gives her an audiotape that outlines his findings, which convinces Olivia to believe him. High school student Julie Wells (Meg Tilly) wants nothing more than to be one of \\"The Sisters,\\" a club of three snobby high school girlsâCarol (Robin Evans), Leslie (E.G. Daily), and Kitty (Leslie Speights). Unfortunately, Carol is the ex-girlfriend of Julie's new boyfriend Steve (David Mason Daniels), and is jealous.

Julie explores the mausoleum and sets up her sleeping bag, unaware of the cracks that appear around Raymar's vault. Carol and Kitty, hoping to scare Julie, sneak back into the mausoleum in Halloween costumes. They succeed in frightening Julie, who locks herself in the chapel. Suddenly, the walls shake, windows explode, and doors slam shut. Thinking this is the result of Julie being scared, Carol and Kitty decide to leave.

Any person who wants to borrow a book is free to do so as long as they return the book after they've finished reading. She has already received 300 book donations. If ten people come and donate five books each in a week, and a total of 140 books are borrowed by other people to read, calculate the total number of books she has remaining in the store? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Step 1: Determine the total number of books donated by the ten people. Since ten people come and donate five books each, their total donation is: Total book donations = Number of people × Books donated per person Total book donations = 10 × 5 = 50 books Step 2: Determine the total number of books in the store after the new donations. To find the total number of books after the new donations, add the donated books to the initial book collection: Total books = Initial book collection + New book donations Total books = 300 + 50 = 350 books Step 3: Calculate the remaining books after 140 books are borrowed. To find the remaining number of books after the borrowing, subtract the borrowed books from the total books: Remaining books = Total books - Borrowed books Remaining books = 350 - 140 = 210 books So, Tracy has 210 books remaining in the store after ten people donate and 140 books are borrowed by other people."},{"instruction":"Which is this about?

After U2 guitarist the Edge worked individually with Rubin in Los Angeles, the group spent two weeks in September 2006 completing songs with the producer at Abbey Road Studios in London. Later that year, the band released two songs from these sessions on the compilation album U218 Singles: a cover of the Skids' \\"The Saints Are Coming\\" with Green Day, and \\"Window in the Skies\\".

I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under.

So I done bit the bait.Kooper: So far so good! Looks like it's gonna be really nice. I'm really lookin' forward to it. Like I said, I've never done anything like this before. So it's very flattering, and I'm very curious about it. The concept is that he got what he thinks are some of the best musicians in town. I think there's ten singers that're gonna each sing one of my songs. I sent 50 songs for them to pick from. There'll be a house band backing them up. The first half of the show is gonna be people singin' those ten songs. The second half of the show I'm gonna play mostly my solo show, but I'm probably gonna do three or four songs with the band as well, since it's there. Plus, I think the only time I played Minneapolis was-Is that where they have the Tyrone Guthrie theatre?-then I played there with Dylan. That was in the early '80s, say maybe '81. That's the only time I've ever played Minneapolis. I like gettin' them cities in my backpack. So I'm really happy to do that.Kooper: No, not at all. Ya know, I'm 66 now, and in the last few years I've been gettin' inducted into this and awards for that. I think it comes with the old-age territory. So it's all in a day's work.Kooper: Yeah, there ya go. This is actually my 52nd year of playin' professionally.Kooper: I was very luckily in this band that had the number one record in the country-the Royal Teens. [The song was] \\"Who Wears Short Shorts.\\"Kooper: I didn't play on it. So I joined them while they were havin' it.Kooper: Oh yeah. Many, many, many times.Kooper: I'll take it.

After the Late Night Wars toppled Conan O’Brien from The Tonight Show and reinstalled Jay Leno in his place, it seemed as though the battle lines had been drawn: on one side, there was Team Coco, on the other, Team Leno, and never the twain should meet. That’s what makes the news we’re about to reveal all the more surprising. Sources tell Movieline that Conan O’Brien’s longtime bandleader Max Weinberg recently made overtures to Leno about joining the new Tonight Show as Leno’s bandleader. He’d be replacing Kevin Eubanks, who announced in February that he had plans to leave the show. It’s a post that Weinberg has long coveted, though he only held it briefly during O’Brien’s truncated tenure. “I think one of the biggest thrills in my life was seeing my name in the same sentence as Doc Severinsen, who, in my view, is the gold standard for Tonight Show bandleaders,” Weinberg told Inside Jersey last August after assuming the gig. “There’s never been anyone who did it quite near the class and the brilliance of Doc Severinsen in the original Tonight Show Band. I used to think when I was a kid what a great job that must be — you know, same place, every time, everyday. Lo and behold, here I am 40 years later, doing it. That sounds deep, deep, deep, deep, deeply satisfying to me.” In some ways, the news comes as a shock: even entering into discussions with Leno would mark Weinberg as a high-profile defector from the Conan camp, and could spark another round of backlash against Leno just as he’s settling into the Tonight Show. Still, we hear that despite his long association with O’Brien, Weinberg was less than beloved by staffers. When O’Brien’s show was still located in New York, Weinberg would send interns to do gardening work at his house on the New Jersey shore, and would involve staffers in his pay disputes with the network — at one point, even enlisting an intern to tabulate every minute of screen time Weinberg had racked up over two years in an argument for a salary raise. Though several members of Weinberg’s band will be joining O’Brien during his live summer tour, Weinberg himself is conspicuously absent from the list. When asked to address the matter, an NBC spokeswoman said only, “We are not commenting.” Reps for Leno and Weinberg have yet to get back to us.

Sir Nicholas Macpherson has proposed a separate Scottish currency. He also suggested that a big shift in tax and spending would probably require low taxes and a smaller, more efficient state sector. Sir Nicholas was the top civil servant at the Treasury in Whitehall. In that role, he took the unprecedented step two years ago of publicising his advice to ministers about the risks of the UK breaking up. He is now an academic at King's College London, and writing in the Financial Times, he set out ways in which the case for independence within the European Union could now be significantly stronger. Sir Nicholas argued that supporters of independence should plan for a separate Scottish currency with a central bank to back it up. Over time, that could lead to convergence with the euro currency, though the experience of Sweden shows that could be avoided. He repeated his view from 2014 that the Treasury would not have done a deal on sharing control over sterling with an independent administration at Holyrood. But he said an independent Scotland in Europe would \\"have no interest in seeking to tie its currency to a country that wishes to put more distance between itself and the EU\\". Other economists have warned of the problem facing an independent Scotland if it broke away from use of sterling currency, given that it sells far more into the English, Welsh and Northern Irish markets than it does to the rest of the world. The former Treasury mandarin suggested an independent Scotland could poach financial services work from London, though it might lose the headquarters of the Royal Bank of Scotland. That would mean a reduced state exposure to the risks carried by RBS. Sir Nicholas repeated his warnings of the 2014 independence plans being over-optimistic about tax revenue, particularly from oil production. But he said the work is being done to build credibility for the Scottish government's financial management, with its own independent fiscal council. He wrote: \\"There is now a much better opportunity for informed debate about public finances, taking into account changing North Sea oil production levels and wider demographic trends. \\"The Scottish government can strengthen its credibility by setting out long-term plans for public services, public investment and social security, in particular pensions. It also has a chance for major tax reform, aimed at attracting inward investment and highly skilled migrants, but as that would mean low business and income tax rates, \\"it may also point to a smaller, more efficient state\\". Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said they were \\"quite remarkable comments\\" from someone who had previously been a \\"fierce critic\\" of independence. \\"I think that confirms much of what the SNP government had been saying about the economic strength that Scotland had and also the economic opportunity we now have in trying to continue Scotland's place within Europe,\\" he told the BBC. \\"I think there's a number of people that have reconsidered their position in light of the Brexit vote and how Scotland has voted with such a huge margin to remain within the EU.\\" But Mr Mackay added that he disagreed with Sir Nicholas's suggestion to make Scotland a low tax, small state economy. Labour MP and former Scottish shadow secretary Ian Murray said the Financial Times article just piled \\"uncertainty on top of the uncertainty\\". \\"What Sir Nicholas Macpherson has actually done is just reopened all the arguments from 2014 about currency, about central banks and the economic arguments for independence - which is much, much weaker today than it was indeed in 2014, and much weaker today than the day before the referendum on the European Union.\\" He said the proposals would mean an independent Scotland operating with a different currency to its biggest trading partner - the UK - and \\"slashing public services to pay for it\\".","output":"Former Treasury permanent secretary, Sir Nicholas Macpherson, has argued that an independent Scotland with a separate currency backed by its own central bank, could build a stronger case for EU independence."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: the renaissance madrigal was a sacred music form?","output":"The Renaissance madrigal was not a sacred music form; rather, it was a secular form of vocal music popular during the Renaissance era, which dates approximately from the 14th to the 17th century. This period was characterized by a resurgence in art, science, philosophy, and literature, with a particular focus on humanism and a rediscovery of ancient Greco-Roman knowledge. Madrigals, as a secular form, were primarily composed for entertainment and enjoyment, often set to lyric poetry with themes such as love, desire, and nature. By contrast, sacred music is music composed for religious settings and purposes, such as worship services, liturgies, and devotionals. Examples of sacred music from the Renaissance era include the motet, the mass, and the hymn. Madrigals originated in Italy around the 1520s, and the earliest madrigals were typically composed for four or five voices, with a polyphonic texture where the voices would independently move together to create harmonies. The music was carefully crafted to express and mirror the emotions and meanings found within the poetry. These early madrigals were called \\"prima pratica\\" or \\"stile antico.\\" As the style evolved in the mid-to-late 16th century, madrigals became increasingly complex and versatile, incorporating a range of emotional expressions in the music and often embracing chromaticism and dissonance. This period, known as \\"seconda pratica\\" or \\"stile moderno,\\" saw a notable increase in emotional expression, often guided by the philosophies of humanism. In addition to Italy, madrigals became quite popular in England, leading to the development of the English madrigal. This style maintained the polyphonic texture and expressive settings of the Italian madrigal while incorporating elements unique to English music, such as word-painting and complex thematic variety. Composers such as Thomas Morley, John Wilbye, and Thomas Weelkes were prominent figures in the English madrigal tradition. While the Renaissance madrigal was undoubtedly a secular genre, it is important to stress that the history of music is often fluid, which means that certain genres and styles occasionally overlapped. The madrigal shared a lot of commonality with sacred forms when it came to technical aspects, such as polyphony, counterpoint, and the treatment of harmony, but the principal distinction remains its secular focus on poetry, human emotion, and themes unrelated to religious devotion. In conclusion, the Renaissance madrigal was not a sacred music form; it was a secular genre that celebrated human emotions, experiences, and poetic expression. While madrigals shared certain techniques and musical traits with sacred music forms, they were distinguished from them through their focus on non-religious themes and the purpose of providing entertainment and enjoyment beyond the religious context."},{"instruction":"Are these paraphrases?

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Buddhist schools vary on the exact nature of the path to liberation, the importance and canonicity of various teachings and scriptures, and especially their respective practices. Buddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community). Taking \\"refuge in the triple gem\\" has traditionally been a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. Other practices are Ten Meritorious Deeds including, giving charity to reduce the greediness; following ethical precepts; renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana tradition, invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas.\\"? Answer:","output":"One potential question to assess students' comprehension of this passage could be: Question: Based on the passage, what are the key components and practices in the Buddhist tradition that differentiate a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist, and how do these practices contribute to the path of liberation? This question allows students to demonstrate their understanding of the passage by identifying and explaining the significance of the Three Jewels, taking refuge in the triple gem, and the various practices mentioned in the passage such as the Ten Meritorious Deeds and Mahayana tradition. By asking them to explain the purpose of these practices in relation to the path of liberation, it encourages them to think critically and analytically about the information presented in the passage. Specific points students may address in their responses include: 1. The Three Jewels – the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community) – as the foundation of Buddhist tradition and practice. 2. Taking \\"refuge in the triple gem\\" as a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path, which distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. 3. The Ten Meritorious Deeds – examples may include giving charity to reduce greed, following ethical precepts, renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic, the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation, cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment, study of scriptures, devotional practices, ceremonies, and invoking buddhas and bodhisattvas in the Mahayana tradition. 4. How these practices contribute to the path of liberation – for instance, reducing greed through charity, cultivating mindfulness and wisdom through meditation and study, and fostering a sense of community through the Sangha.

The president had his share of victories and setbacks amid a backdrop of Twitter storms and, at times, raging rhetoric. Trump's political base seems pleased with his first year in office, touting his efforts to cut Obama-era regulations, install Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and roll back Islamic State forces in the Middle East. \\"We were kind of thinking we were going to relax and put Trump behind us and just watch all the great promises that he gave us, and watch him make America great again,\\" said Michigan Trump supporter Meshawn Maddock. \\"But what happened immediately is that we felt he was under attack from day one.\\" The president's biggest legislative victory came just last month, a sweeping tax cut bill that had been a Republican priority for years. \\"We are very proud of it,\\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed it. \\"It is going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It is going to be fantastic for the economy.\\" In fact, there are plenty of signs of a surging economy, and public opinion polls show growing support for Trump's handling of it and even a bump up in support for the tax bill, which many voters saw initially as too favorable to the wealthy.

By acting out, the child may hope to get what they want in the end. If you give the child what they want (e.g. ice cream, or a delayed bathtime/bedtime), then the child will learn that tantrums are a good way to get things. It is much easier to start addressing tantrums when the autistic person is a child. For example, a 6-year-old boy who throws himself on the floor is much easier to manage compared to a 16-year-old. Also, the child will be less likely to cause injury to themself or others. Planned ignoring can work best for yelling, swearing, and sulking. This will teach the child that the behavior is not an effective way to get attention. It helps to clearly communicate this idea, such as \\"I can't understand what's wrong if you're pouting back there. But if you would like to calm down a little and explain what is wrong, I would be happy to listen to you.\\" Always step in if the child begins throwing things, taking things that belong to others, or hitting. Ask the child to stop and then explain why the behavior is not okay. Tell your child that they can choose to act in a way that will get the desired response. Explaining this to your child will help your child understand the best way to get what they want (or at least a listening ear or a compromise). For example, you can tell your child, \\"If you'd like me to help you, you can take a few deep breaths and tell me what's wrong. I'm here for you if you need me.\\" Summary:","output":"This article explains that when children have tantrums to get what they want, it's important to teach them better ways to communicate their needs instead of giving in to their tantrums."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: I ejaculated. Sentence 2: There was no ejaculation. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The two sentences provided present a contradictory situation. We can analyze their truth-values by breaking down the scenarios. Sentence 1: \\"I ejaculated.\\" This sentence claims that an ejaculation occurred. If we assume this statement to be true, we proceed with that information in mind. Sentence 2: \\"There was no ejaculation.\\" This sentence directly contradicts the first sentence, as it implies that no ejaculation took place. When evaluating whether the second sentence is true, we must take the first sentence's truth-value into account. Since we first assumed the first sentence (\\"I ejaculated.\\") to be true, the second sentence (\\"There was no ejaculation.\\") must necessarily be false. These sentences are mutually exclusive, meaning either one or the other can be true, but not both. In summary, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence is false. It is impossible for both sentences to be simultaneously true, given the contradiction between their claims."},{"instruction":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter. John is studying the different states of matter. Today, he has a matter in three states in front of him, state A, state B, and state C. State A is in solid state. State B is in liquid state.

When we are born and we first get on the train, we meet people who we think will be with us for the whole journey. Those people are our parents. Sadly, this is far from the truth. Our parents are with us when we completely need them. They, too, have journeys they must complete. We live on with the memories of their love, support and so on. There are others who get on the train and who finally become very important to us. These people are our brothers, sisters and friends, whom we will learn to love and take care of. Some people regard their journey as a pleasant tour. They will just go happily along. Others will _ many upsets, tears and losses on their journey. Some others will stay on to offer a helping hand to anyone in need. Some people on the train will leave a deep impression when they get off. Some will get on and get off the train so quickly that they will hardly leave a sign. We will sometimes be upset that some passengers, whom we love, will choose to sit in another compartment and leave us to travel on our own.

Stricter inspections and licensing: The government, councils, and local health departments should create and enforce more stringent health inspection regulations to ensure that all food establishments meet the same high standards. Only when the businesses pass comprehensive evaluations should they be granted licenses to operate. Restaurants found to have violated quality regulations should be mandated to rectify the issue within a specific time frame or risk closure. 2. Real-time information sharing: Develop an integrated database that shares real-time information on all food establishments in the area, such as inspection results, complaints, and legal actions taken. This would enable both councils and the public to have greater access to information about the businesses they patronize, fostering increased transparency and accountability. 3. Public education and engagement: Local communities should be educated on how to report suspected health and safety violations at food establishments. This would not only help the relevant authorities identify offenders quickly but also encourage continuous improvement in the food industry. 4. Regular training for food establishment staff: All staff working in food establishments should receive periodic training in food safety and hygienic practices. Proper training would ensure that all employees are knowledgeable about best practices, and it reduces the likelihood of poor hygiene standards being overlooked in the workplace. 5. Stronger penalties and fines: Increase penalties, fines, and sanctions for food establishments found to be operating under unsafe and unhygienic conditions. The fear of severe consequences could act as a deterrent to business owners who may otherwise ignore health and safety regulations. 6. Collaboration with other stakeholders: Partnerships between local government, health departments, industry associations, and community organizations could lead to a more holistic approach for addressing the problem. Collaboration can facilitate the exchange of knowledge, resources, and information, resulting in a more efficient and effective food safety system. The closure of the Golden Dragon serves as an example of the urgent need for vigilance, oversight, and action to protect the health and well-being of the community. Taking the necessary steps to address these issues would ultimately promote safer, cleaner, and more responsible food establishments that customers can trust and enjoy."},{"instruction":"Asher and Mary Isabelle Richardson House, location, U.S. Route 83; Asher and Mary Isabelle Richardson House, addedToTheNationalRegisterOfHistoricPlaces, \\"1988-11-22\\"; Asher and Mary Isabelle Richardson House, NationalRegisterOfHistoricPlacesReferenceNumber, \\"88002539\\"; Asher and Mary Isabelle Richardson House, yearOfConstruction, 1911 What is sentence that verbalizes this data?","output":"The Asher and Mary Isabelle Richardson House, located along U.S. Route 83, is a historic residence constructed in 1911.

Step 1: Extract keywords from the given text Keywords: \\"does\\", \\"all\\", \\"of this\\", \\"and more\\" Step 2: Assess the connotations of these keywords \\"Does\\" serves as an action verb, and doesn't convey any specific positive or negative sentiment on its own. However, \\"all\\" implies that the movie accomplishes multiple aspects, possibly demonstrating thoroughness. \\"Of this\\" indicates that the context is missing, so I will take it into account. \\"And more\\" implies that the movie goes beyond what was previously mentioned. This suggests that it exceeds expectations in some regard. Step 3: Analyze the overall sentiment Without knowing more about the context, we cannot definitively determine if the review is positive or negative. However, based on the presence of phrases like \\"all\\" and \\"and more,\\" I would lean towards interpreting this review as having a positive opinion about the movie.

The reviewer initially establishes their previous positive association with Construction Junction by mentioning they have had \\"the best experiences there\\" and were \\"construction junction junkies.\\" However, the tone quickly shifts to a negative one as they share their recent experience with a lady from the store who they found uncooperative and arrogant. The review highlights the reviewer's frustration with the lady's adamant refusal to provide assistance, even when the reviewer offered to send a picture via email and emphasized their eagerness to purchase the chandelier. The reviewer also quotes what they perceive to be excuses from the sales agent, ultimately expressing disappointment with her unsympathetic attitude and seeming indifference towards their requests.

The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer. As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows. The answer to this question is:","output":"In the film, Professor Kristan's fiancée is attacked by Kristan himself when he is in a trance-like state of murderousness, caused by the traits of vampirism passed down to him through Lamarckism after his mother was bitten by a vampire bat. However, the mob of villagers assumes that Zan, the loyal hunchback, is the one responsible for the attack on the professor's fiancée."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question. Paragraph : The farther you stretch the band, the greater the resistance is. Question: Jim is playing with a rubber band by stretching and releasing it. Would he feel more resistance stretching the band to 40 cm or or 30 cm? Answer:","output":"Jim would feel more resistance when he stretches the rubber band to 40 cm as opposed to 30 cm. The paragraph states that \\"the farther you stretch the band, the greater the resistance is.\\" This means that as the rubber band is stretched farther, the force or resistance it exerts against the stretching action increases. In this situation, 40 cm is a greater distance than 30 cm. When Jim stretches the rubber band to 40 cm, the band has to cover a larger distance, which requires more force to achieve. As a result, the resistance generated by the rubber band will be higher at 40 cm compared to when it is stretched only to 30 cm. This is due to the inherent properties of the rubber band. The material used in making rubber bands is elastic, which allows it to stretch and return to its original shape and size when the stretching force is removed. As the band is stretched, the molecules in the rubber become more aligned and experience a greater internal resistance against the stretching force. Consequently, the farther the rubber band is stretched, the more it resists being stretched further. In conclusion, Jim would feel more resistance stretching the rubber band to 40 cm as compared to 30 cm, as the resistance increases with the distance it is stretched."},{"instruction":"Next question: what were the years of prohibition in the united states?","output":"Prohibition in the United States was a nationwide constitutional ban on the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages. It was a significant period in American history that lasted for a little over 13 years. Prohibition formally began on January 17, 1920, when the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution came into effect and ended on December 5, 1933, with the ratification of the 21st Amendment, which repealed the 18th Amendment. The push for Prohibition in the United States developed over a long period of time. Temperance movements had gained traction in the 19th century, primarily motivated by religious and moral beliefs. Advocates of temperance argued that alcohol consumption led to social problems such as crime, poverty, and broken families. The emergence of the Anti-Saloon League in the late 1800s added significant momentum to the cause. In 1919, the United States Congress passed the Volstead Act, which was officially named the National Prohibition Act. The Act enforced the 18th Amendment and defined the terms under which the production, sale, and transportation of intoxicating liquors were prohibited. The Volstead Act faced a challenge from President Woodrow Wilson, who vetoed the bill. However, his veto was overridden by Congress, and the Act went into effect alongside the 18th Amendment on January 17, 1920. Despite its noble intentions, Prohibition turned out to be a contentious policy that led to a variety of unintended consequences. The ban on alcohol created a massive black market, giving rise to criminal organizations and leading to an increase in organized crime. Gangsters, such as the infamous Al Capone, profited immensely by smuggling and distributing alcohol through speakeasies, underground bars and clubs that flouted Prohibition laws. Violent clashes between rival gangs and law enforcement officials became a more frequent occurrence during this period. The federal government struggled to enforce Prohibition effectively, as limited resources and widespread corruption among authorities hindered their efforts. Furthermore, many American citizens did not support the ban on alcohol, leading to widespread disrespect for and disregard of the law. Prohibition also had economic implications on the United States. Job losses were suffered as breweries, distilleries, and other alcohol-related industries struggled. Additionally, the government experienced a significant reduction in tax revenues due to the absence of alcohol sales. As the detrimental effects of Prohibition became increasingly apparent, calls for its repeal grew louder. The onset of the Great Depression in 1929 further intensified these demands, as the struggling economy prompted policymakers to search for new sources of revenue, such as alcohol taxes. Eventually, the 21st Amendment was proposed and ratified on December 5, 1933, officially repealing the 18th Amendment and bringing an end to the era of Prohibition in the United States. In summary, Prohibition in the United States lasted from January 17, 1920 to December 5, 1933. Although intended to address social issues related to alcohol consumption, it led to numerous unintended consequences, such as the rise of organized crime, that ultimately contributed to its repeal."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment was a joint venture owned/operated by Warner Communications and American Express that developed interactive television shows in the 1970s and 80's and initiated several successful cable networks that remain well-known. - Viacom Media Networks (formerly MTV Networks) is an American mass media division of Viacom that oversees the operations of many of its television channels and Internet brands, including Nickelodeon, BET, CMT, Comedy Central, VH1 and the original MTV channel in the United States.

In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America.

It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Cable television is a system of delivering television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or, in the 2010s, light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with broadcast television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television.

First of all, though they did their share, there is a unwarranted dope scene where John sniffs weed like an idiot. The wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse then the old Beatle cartoons. John is the nasty, envious, closet homosexual, slave to Yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited Albert Goldman book. They even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation \\"it was always just the Two Of Us\\"! John would not have been mean to his fans like this either. Like his death showed us he was too nice if anything. The one funny scene is where a dumb Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's Yesterday. An insulted John says something along the lines of \\"Sure and while I croon why don't you get down on your knees, put on your wife's wig, and lick my liggin\\". That made me laugh for days.

He was an infant when his father died. His mother remarried with a French-American, but after her death when Caray was eight, he went to live with his aunt Doxie at 1909 LaSalle Street in a tough, working-class section of St. Louis. As a young man, Caray played baseball at the semi-pro level for a short time before auditioning for a radio job at the age of 19. Context: Caray increased his renown after joining the North Side Cubs following the 1981 season. In contrast to the \\"SportsVision\\" concept, the Cubs' own television outlet, WGN-TV, had become among the first of the cable television superstations, offering their programming to providers across the United States for free, and Caray became as famous nationwide as he had long been on the South Side and, previously, in St. Louis. In fact, Caray had already been affiliated with WGN for some years by then, as WGN actually produced the White Sox games for broadcast on competitor WSNS-TV, and Caray was a frequent sportscaster on the station's newscasts. Caray succeeded longtime Cubs broadcaster Jack Brickhouse, a beloved announcer and Chicago media fixture. The timing worked in Caray's favor, as the Cubs ended up winning the National League East division title in 1984 with WGN-TV's nationwide audience following along. Millions came to love the microphone-swinging Caray, continuing his White Sox practice of leading the home crowd in singing \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" during the seventh inning stretch, mimicking his mannerisms, his gravelly voice, his habit of mispronouncing or slurring some players' names -- which some of the players mimicked in turn -- and even his trademark barrel-shaped wide-rimmed glasses, prescribed for him by Dr. Cyril Nierman, O.D. In February 1987 Caray suffered a stroke while at his winter home near Palm Springs, California, just prior to spring training for the Cubs' 1987 season. This led to his absence from the broadcast booth through most of the first two months of the regular season, with WGN featuring a series of celebrity guest announcers on game telecasts while Caray recuperated. Caray's national popularity never flagged after that, although time eventually took a toll on him. Nicknamed \\"The Mayor of Rush Street\\", a reference to Chicago's famous tavern-dominated neighborhood and Caray's well-known taste for Budweiser, illness and age began to drain some of Caray's skills, even in spite of his remarkable recovery from the 1987 stroke. There were occasional calls for him to retire, but he was kept aboard past WGN's normal mandatory retirement age, an indication of how popular he was. Toward the end of his career, Caray's schedule was limited to home games and road trips to St. Louis and Milwaukee. In December 1997, Caray's grandson Chip Caray was hired to share play-by-play duties for WGN's Cubs broadcasts with Caray for the following season. However, Harry Caray died in February 1998, before the baseball season began, leaving the expected grandfather-grandson partnership in the broadcast booth unrealized. Question: How did he die? Answer:","output":"Harry Caray died on February 18, 1998, at the age of 83. His death was caused by complications resulting from cardiac arrest that he experienced while having dinner with his wife Dutchie at a restaurant in Rancho Mirage, California on February 14, 1998. He was initially hospitalized and placed on life support, but his condition did not improve, leading to his passing a few days later. His death came before the start of the 1998 baseball season, and as a result, the anticipated partnership between him and his grandson Chip Caray in the broadcast booth did not materialize. Harry Caray's passing marked the end of a legendary, illustrious career as a baseball broadcaster that spanned over five decades."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Which of the following films presents a survey of the history of the comic book in America: Beyond Hatred or Comic Book Confidential?

Chiefs' running back Priest Holmes would meet with a neurosurgeon about his October 30 neck injury, suffered against the Chargers' Shawne Merriman. Holmes must practice by November 7 to be eligible to remain in the season. Trent Green suited up for the game against the Rams, but was listed as the third quarterback behind starter Damon Huard and rookie Brodie Croyle. Herm Edwards said there was no chance Green would play against the Rams, but could be back by week 10. Damon Huard threw a 43-yard pass to Samie Parker which put the Chiefs in the red zone at the 3-yard line. Huard continued the drive with a 3-yard pass to Tony Gonzalez, his 58th career touchdown and the Chiefs' all-time record breaker for Tight ends. The Chiefs were leading with two and a half minutes into the game. Kansas City again used Larry Johnson's speed to their advantage as Johnson broke a 16-yard dash, setting up a field goal by Lawrence Tynes on fourth and one. An offensive battle ensued between the two teams before the half, as Tony Gonzalez scored his 59th career touchdown and second of the game from 25-yards out. The Rams failed to find the endzone, but Jeff Wilkins connected on a field goal to make the score 24-10 at the half. Damon Huard fumbled on Kansas City's next offensive drive but was recovered by Kyle Turley&#8212;in his first game back from an injury. The Rams' defensive unit stopped the Chiefs from securing the lead. The Chiefs' defense gave up some major yardage on the Rams' next turn on offense.

The colony of New Amsterdam was centered at the site which would eventually become Lower Manhattan.

John McCain also blasted fellow Republicans. In a Senate floor speech laced with sarcasm and stings, the Arizona Republican aimed especially harsh fire at the tea party Wednesday. McCain said the movement is \\"foolish\\" to think a balanced budget amendment could pass before the August 2 deadline. At one point, McCain read from an op-ed in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. That article referred to activists as \\"tea party hobbits\\" – the little people who inhabit Middle-earth in the Lord of the Rings series. McCain – 2008's Republican presidential nominee – also blasted as \\"bizarre\\" an idea supported by current GOP presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, though McCain did not mention her by name. McCain's fiery language comes amid competing Democratic and Republican plans to reduce the deficit. McCain also blasted Democrats in his speech. He called the plan from Majority Leader Harry Reid \\"full of smoke and mirrors,\\" and said President Barack Obama is leading \\"from behind\\" by not offering \\"a specific plan that perhaps could be considered by both bodies.\\" \\"It's unfair of the president of the United States ... only to go out and give lectures and act in as partisan a fashion as I have seen in his addresses to the American people,\\" McCain said. When it came to the tea party, McCain was equally biting. He said he fully supports a balanced budget amendment. But he thundered that current political realities make passing one in the near future near impossible. \\"What is really amazing is that some (Senate) members are believing that we can pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution in this body with its present representation – and that is foolish,\\" McCain said. \\"That is worse than foolish,\\" he continued. \\"That is deceiving many of our constituents.\\" \\"To hold out and say we won't agree to raising the debt limit until we pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, it's unfair, it's bizarre,\\" McCain added. \\"And maybe some people who have only been in this body for six or seven months or so really believe that. Others know better.\\" McCain did not mention which senators he was referring to. But also on Wednesday, Sens. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky, tea party boosters, joined many tea party activists who rallied on Capitol Hill demanding passage of the \\"Cut, Cap and Balance\\" plan. Among other things, that proposal would cut total spending by 111 billion for fiscal year 2012 and require a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that would cap total annual spending at 18 percent. McCain talked about Boehner's plan and quoted the Wall St. Journal piece, which said: \\"The question now is whether House Republicans are going to help Mr. Boehner achieve significant progress, or in the name of the unachievable, hand Mr. Obama a victory.\\" McCain continued reading the article: \\"The idea seems to be that if the House GOP refuses to raise the debt ceiling, a default crisis or gradual government shutdown will ensue and the public will turn en masse against Barack Obama....Then Democrats would have no choice but to pass a balanced budget amendment and reform entitlements, and the tea party hobbits could return to Middle-earth...This is the kind of crack political thinking that turned Sharron Angle and Christine O'Donnell into GOP nominees. The reality is the debt limit will be raised one way or another.\\" Earlier in his remarks, McCain blasted a position that Rep. Bachmann supports. Saying, \\"Today we are six days away from a possible default which could plunge this country into a serious crisis,\\" McCain added: \\"There are those that argue somehow in a bizarre fashion that somehow we could prioritize our payments to the most urgent requirements, such as our veterans, such as Social Security.\\" Bachmann recently co-sponsored a bill that aims to ensure military service members receive their paychecks on time should the nation default. McCain won re-election in last year's midterm elections after a bitter primary with former congressman J.D. Hayworth, who had some tea party support. The nation's largest tea party group is responding to McCain. Mark Meckler is co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots. He told CNN that many Americans support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution – and \\"What Republicans should be doing is pushing all the way to the line.\\" As for McCain's quoting the Wall Street Journal's line about \\"tea party hobbits,\\" Meckler used his own Lord of the Rings metaphor to strike back at the senator. \\"Clearly he's been corrupted by the ring of power,\\" Meckler said. Republican Sharron Angle, who lost her Nevada Senate bid against Democratic Sen. Harry Reid in 2010 with support from the tea part movement, praised the \\"hobbits\\" while taking a jab at McCain. \\"As in the fable, it is the hobbits who are the heroes and save the land,\\" Angle said in a statement. \\"It is regrettable that a man seeking dialogue, action and cooperation for votes on the floor of the United States Senate has only one strategy to achieve that effort: name-calling.

Jay Z, Drake, Kendrick Lamar and the Foo Fighters were ­headlining nearby concerts, and Times Square had been renamed \\"Super Bowl Boulevard.\\" Amid the fanfare, Alicia Glen -- a former Goldman Sachs executive who had just become a deputy mayor with the then-new administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio -- attended NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's annual pregame Super Bowl party at the Museum of Natural History. There, she was approached by Jonathan Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants and co-chairman of the board of Loews Corp. \\"You see how great these events are for the city?\\" Tisch asked. \\"Why don't we team up to bring the Grammys back to New York?\\" Three years later, according to multiple sources close to the ­negotiations, the Grammys are indeed set to return to New York's Madison Square Garden -- for just the second time in 17 years -- for the show's 60th anniversary in 2018. The deal is all but done, city sources say, and a formal announcement will be made after this year's ceremony. But sources close to the situation tell Billboard that after that New York sojourn, the Grammys will return to the Staples Center in 2019, as part of a multi-year extension of its most recent agreement. After all, the Grammys have developed a cozy relationship with their Los Angeles base, particularly the awards-show-friendly Staples Center. While the ceremony ­essentially traded off between L.A. and New York for its first three decades, that ended in the late 1990s after a very public spat between then-New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and then-Recording Academy chief Michael Greene, which spiraled into threats and insults after Greene refused to allow Hizzoner to read the list of nominees at a news ­conference promoting the awards show. \\"If they want to go back to L.A., they can,\\" said Giuliani in 1998. \\"We could replace the Grammys in about a day.\\" But by 2014, New York wanted them back. The Grammys bring an estimated 82 million bump to its host city's economy, according to a report from the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board; the mayor's office says the total could be as much as 200 million in ancillary ­spending. That summer, Tisch ­introduced Glen to Recording Academy CEO Neil Portnow. The Grammys' agreement with Staples was up for renewal in 2017, and native New Yorker Portnow was interested. But discussions lay dormant as de Blasio became ensnared in a series of investigations into his fund-raising, which left City Hall reluctant to ask would-be donors for contributions. The calculus changed at the start of 2016, when Julie Menin, a longtime civic activist who worked to revitalize Lower Manhattan in the years after 9/11, was named to head the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment; just as she was appointed, her ­department's purview grew from film and TV to include a number of other creative industries, especially music. In February, Menin flew to L.A. to meet with The Recording Academy. According to sources familiar with the negotiation, the academy balked, mostly because a show in New York would require an additional 6.5 million in costs due to increased production, labor and venue expenses. City Hall declined to offer up funds, so Menin set about raising the money from private ­interests, enlisting Related Companies, a major real estate developer in the city, to invest, along with Spotify, ­consulting company Accenture and the Partnership for New York City; she also negotiated with labor unions for concessions on costs. Not every union was ­willing, however, so final costs ended up rising to 8 million, ­according to a source -- a figure Menin promptly matched by a new round of solicitation. \\"She came to us looking for some help, and we did our best to ­accommodate,\\" says James Claffey, president of Local 1, the stagehands union for MSG. Claffey offered flexibility on call times and meal times that the Grammys sought. \\"Honestly, I did not think Julie would pull it off,\\" he adds. \\"She was remarkable.\\" The toughest knot of all, however, was the venue and its executive chairman James Dolan. The Grammys require the arena to remain dark for nearly two weeks as the set is built and taken down. \\"It's a pain in the ass for them,\\" one person involved in the ­negotiation tells Billboard. \\"It's a money loser.\\" Another source says Dolan declined to meet with de Blasio or New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, since the ­latter two have a long-running feud and Dolan did not want to get involved. But Irving Azoff, Dolan's business partner in Azoff-MSG Entertainment, had been in touch with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman -- a neutral party in the feud -- who reassured Dolan and Portnow that the city and state would adhere to whatever was agreed to, says a source. MSG also requested that the Grammys be presented \\"in the round,\\" which would allow it to sell more luxury suites and help make up the ­financial shortfall for the remaining 11 dark days. Why was the venue so ­cooperative? Not ­coincidentally, Azoff-MSGE also runs the Staples Center's fiercest ­competitor: The Forum. (Representatives for The Recording Academy, Azoff, MSG, Staples Center owner AEG and City Hall declined requests for comment.) All seemed positive until the eve of a get-to-know-each-other dinner with the stakeholders -- representatives from MSG, Tisch, Claffey, Menin, Portnow, the CEO of the corporate sponsors on the host committee and reps for the academy -- when The New York Times reported the Grammys would be returning to New York. \\"It put a bit of a strain on the dinner,\\" says one attendee. While reps for the academy and the city declined to comment beyond statements like Menin's to Billboard -- \\"We're having ­productive ­conversations\\" -- and sources close to the academy insist the deal is not final, the Grammys are ­conspicuously doubling down on their presence in New York. In December, the academy purchased a 13.5 million Manhattan townhouse to serve as a new local headquarters; on Feb. 7, it announced the ­opening of the first East Coast Grammy Museum at the Prudential Center in nearby Newark, N.J.; and on Jan. 30, Menin was a featured speaker at a Grammy reception for New York nominees at the Standard Hotel. Even if, as multiple sources confirm, the Grammys are held in New York next year, a longer-term ­arrangement may take more fund-raising and finagling in light of the Academy's deal to return to Staples in 2019. Still, says one source, \\"More than just a one-off is everyone's hope.\\" Additional reporting by Jem Aswad A version of this article originally appeared in the Feb. 18 issue of Billboard. ||||| Archive-It Partner 1067: The Political TV Ad Archive, a project of the Internet Archive, collects political TV ads and social media sites in key 2016 primary election states, unlocking the metadata underneath and highlighting quality journalism to provide journalists, civic organizations, academics, and the general public with reliable information on who is trying to influence them & how. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The 59th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony took place in Los Angeles and featured a comprehensive list of winners and nominees, along with performances by Adele, Beyoncé, and Justin Bieber in the Album of the Year category.

Article: South Africa hosted the fifth BRICS Summit in March 2013,which completed the first cycle of BRICS summits,BRICS is an acronym for the powerful grouping of the world's leading up-and-coming economies,namely Brazil,Russia,India,China and South Africa.The BRICS aims to achieve peace,security,development and cooperation.It also seeks to contribute to the development of humanity and build a more stable and fairer world. The industry leaders from the business communities of the five countries agreed that the BRICS countries will actively support industrialization on the African continent in order to contribute significantly to its development and to expand trade links between Africa and BRICS.The global economic situation,though improving,continues to remain uncertain with the Euro-crisis a major concern.The task ahead is to build on these developments and BRICS countries remain committed to the cause of promoting sustainable growth.Greater economic cooperation among BRICS countries can be significantly important,which will prove beneficial for global economic growth. According to Dr.Rob Davies,South African Minister of Trade and Industry,the African continent is recognized as the second fastest growing continent after Asia.There are four drivers of the economic growth in African continent.These are the boom in mineral products in the African continent,the development of the service industries,the benefit of not having the financial crisis,and infrastructure development.Davies also adds that other BRICS countries have advantage of large populations providing big home markets for their products.The South African population is small compared to other BRICS countries,but if you add up numbers on continent then you have a critical mass that can support the new industrial wave in Africa:That is why the South African needs to create large trading blocks across large parts of African continent.

He is best known for working alongside Declan Donnelly as part of the presenting duo Ant & Dec. McPartlin came to prominence, alongside Donnelly, in the children's drama series Byker Grove, with both men establishing successful careers as television presenters, in which they are most known for presenting SMTV Live (between 1998-2001), I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! McPartlin's first appearance on television was on the children's workshop programme Why Don't You?, but his big break came when he rose to prominence playing the character of PJ in the CBBC series Byker Grove. It was during his time on the programme that he first met Declan Donnelly, who was cast in the part of Duncan. The pair formed a close friendship on the programme, both socially and professionally, with the men performing as their characters until their departure from the programme in 1993. During their tenure, the pair created a number of hit records under the label of \\"PJ & Duncan AKA\\", including the song \\"Tonight I'm Free\\" that had been performed on Byker Grove.

He hugged his lawyers and their assistants and then said , \\" Thank you so much . \\" Moments later , he hugged his defense lawyers , softly saying , \\" Thank you , so much . \\" Options are: - no; - yes;...I think the answer is","output":"Yes, the two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, but there are some subtle differences in the context and tone. Both sentences describe an individual expressing gratitude towards their lawyers and assistants through physical affection (a hug) and verbal thanks (\\"Thank you,\\" \\"Thank you so much,\\" and \\"Thank you, so much\\"). However, there are slight variations in the phrasing and structure of the two sentences that set them apart. In the first sentence, \\"He hugged his lawyers and their assistants and then said, 'Thank you so much.'\\" The action is presented as an uninterrupted sequence of events, implying that the individual's gratitude was intended for both the lawyers and their assistants simultaneously. Their appreciation seems assertive and direct. The second sentence, \\"Moments later, he hugged his defense lawyers, softly saying, 'Thank you, so much.'\\" suggests that there might have been some time-lapse between the individual's expression of gratitude and the preceding event. Using \\"moments later\\" establishes the possibility that right before this event, something else occurred or the individual had previously spoken to different people prior to focusing on their defense lawyers. Additionally, when expressing thanks in this sentence, the individual does so \\"softly.\\" This could imply that their gratitude, although sincere, might have been more emotional or tender in nature compared to the first sentence. In summary, while both sentences communicate the same overall message – an individual hugging and thanking their legal representatives – there are subtle differences in context and tone. Despite these variations, the core meaning remains the same, and the answer is, therefore, yes – the two sentences essentially mean the same thing."},{"instruction":"Q:- These substances rise into the high atmosphere - They react with water and oxygen - This creates a more acidic rain - The rain with the high acid content falls. What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step in the process you described involves the release of specific substances into the atmosphere that have acidic properties. These substances, known as pollutants, are primarily sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), and they are emitted from various human activities and natural processes. The release of these substances into the atmosphere sets the stage for the subsequent reactions that lead to the formation of acid rain. Human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) in power plants, industrial processes, and automobile engines are major sources of SO2 and NOx emissions. Fossil fuels contain sulfur impurities, which, when burned, are converted into sulfur dioxide. Nitrogen oxides, on the other hand, are formed when the nitrogen in the fuel or air is oxidized at high temperatures in combustion processes. These pollutants can travel long distances in the atmosphere, mixing with water vapor, oxygen, and other chemicals, impacting areas far from their original sources. Natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions, can also release significant amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. In addition, some natural sources of nitrogen oxides include lightning and microbial activity in soils. Once these substances, specifically SO2 and NOx, are released into the atmosphere, they undergo numerous chemical reactions with water vapor, oxygen, and other atmospheric constituents to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). These reactions can occur not only in gaseous phase but also in the aqueous phase, specifically within tiny liquid droplets and cloud particles. The formation of these acids subsequently increases the acidity of rainwater, resulting in acid rain. When this highly acidic rainfall reaches the Earth's surface, it can have various detrimental impacts on ecosystems, human health, and man-made structures. Acid rain can acidify soil and water bodies, which, in turn, harms aquatic life and vegetation, accelerate the weathering of buildings and monuments, and directly affect human health by aggravating respiratory diseases and contributing to the formation of secondary pollutants, such as ozone. In summary, the first step of this process is the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels and natural processes, into the high atmosphere. This initiates the chain of reactions that eventually lead to the formation of acid rain and its associated environmental consequences."},{"instruction":"Question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Pending Downloading on pending..\\" Answer:","output":"It is challenging to provide a precise rating for this review without additional context, as it appears to be incomplete and unclear.

One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—\\"Radio Free Europe\\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame.

But in the USA, each year, students take part in a kind of competition called the Science Olympiad. It has a lot of different events. Students go there to show how much they know about the science of music, biology, chemistry and others. My best event is forestry . This time, I went to the Olympiad with my school's team. We had worked hard, but this was the state competition. It would be hard to win. The Olympiad was out of town, so we got to ride on a bus and stay in a hotel for a night. The Olympiad was in three big rooms. When we got there, we set up our team's \\"camp\\" off to one side. The big day had come at last! First, I went to watch the tower building competition. That's when students build small towers and put heavy things on top of it. They hope they can hold them up. One of my schoolmates was putting things on her tower. She was nervous, and in the end it was too heavy for her tower to hold it--it broke! I felt bad for her. After lunch, I helped some teammates with their events. One was geography, and the other was history. I don't know much about those things, so I just watched my teammates do most of the work. At last, it was time for my favorite event--forestry. Another student was also in the forestry event. The rules were easy. We had to look at more than 40 different kinds of leaves and find out which plants they were from. We also had to answer some questions about the uses of each leaf. I knew almost all of the leaves and could answer most of the questions. I had spent more than a month studying on the Internet to get ready. At the end, it was time for the awards , I was nervous, because the forestry awards were last. We won second place in the whole state! A nice man gave me a medal and smiled at me. I had a great time at the Science Olympiad. I can't wait for next year!

Squats are a fundamental leg exercise that can be done at home, and is an important exercise to learn before using leg machines at the gym. Once you've mastered the movements, you can add weights to make it more difficult.","output":"To ensure proper form while doing squats, start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes slightly turned outward. Keep your chest up, your shoulders relaxed, and engage your core as you prepare to lower your body. As you lower yourself, treat your movement as if you are going to sit in a chair by bending at your hips and knees simultaneously. Aim to lower your hips and glutes just below your knees to achieve a deep squat, all while keeping your knees in line with your toes and avoiding any inward collapsing. Throughout the entire movement, it's important to maintain proper posture and keep your upper body upright. While descending into the squat, keep your weight evenly distributed on your heels and your midfoot, without allowing your toes to come off the ground. As you ascend back to a standing position, focus on driving through your heels and not your toes, maintaining a strong posture and keeping your knees in line with your toes. Along with squats, incorporate other leg exercises into your routine to fully tone your legs, such as lunges, step-ups, leg curls, and calf raises. In addition to compound and isolation exercises, stretching and mobility work can significantly improve the muscle definition in your legs. Regularly practicing yoga or pilates can be an excellent way to work on flexibility, balance, and strengthen the smaller muscle groups in your legs. By adding a variety of these exercises to your fitness regimen, you can avoid potential muscle imbalances and improve the overall look and feel of your legs. Another crucial aspect of toning your legs is having a well-rounded cardiovascular routine. Incorporating a mix of cardio exercises like running, cycling, swimming, or hill sprints can aid in burning excess body fat and defining your leg muscles. Varying the intensity, duration, and type of cardio can minimize the risk of hitting a plateau while making your workouts more enjoyable and engaging. Lastly, consider your nutrition when working on toning your legs. Consuming a healthy and balanced diet with plenty of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates can support your body's muscle-building and fat-burning processes. Be mindful of your daily caloric intake, ensuring that you're eating the right number of calories for your goals, whether it be weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain. By combining a nutritious diet with a structured exercise routine, you'll be well on your way to beautifully toned legs!"},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

For instance, they separate the words in a sentence, allowing us to better understand the syntactic structure and determine the meaning of individual words and phrases. Without the spaces, it becomes much more challenging for readers to identify individual words and piece together the intended meaning of the text. The concept of spacing between words can be traced back to ancient forms of writing, with early examples of scripts such as hieroglyphics and cuneiform demonstrating techniques to differentiate between words. Over time, these techniques evolved to include spaces in written language, such as in Latin and Greek script, leading to the present-day system where spaces are used as delimiters between words. With the advent of digital technology, it has become even more critical to preserve spaces between words when transferring information electronically. Text processing software, websites, and online communications rely heavily on accurately identifying word boundaries to convey the intended meaning to readers appropriately. In summary, removing spaces between words in written language can make it difficult to understand the text's meaning, and it is essential to maintain such spaces for clarity and comprehension.

The government says it is in touch with the militants behind the video. A journalist who had contact with Boko Haram has been declared a wanted man by the Nigerian army. The group is said to be holding more than 200 of the 276 final-year girls it seized from a school in April 2014. Non-Muslims were forcibly converted to Islam, and it is feared that many of the schoolgirls have been sexually abused and forced into \\"marriage\\" by their captors. Parents of the missing girls have described their anguish at seeing their daughters in captivity. The video begins with a shot of a masked man, carrying a gun, speaking to the camera. He says that some of the girls have been wounded and have life-threatening injuries, and that 40 have been \\"married\\". Speaking in the Hausa language, the gunman says the girls on display will \\"never\\" be returned if the government does not release Boko Haram fighters who have been \\"in detention for ages\\". I have watched the video several times. I saw her sitting down. The fact is we are overwhelmed with a feeling of depression. It's like being beaten and being stopped from crying. You helplessly watch your daughter but there is nothing you can do. It's a real heartache. Those who are still alive - we want them back. We want them back irrespective of their condition. As ordinary men, there is nothing we [the other fathers and I] can do on our own. We are just here unable to do anything with our lives. You see your child but someone denies you from having it. They are being forcefully married and they now live in terrible conditions. The video concludes with footage of bodies, said to be the victims of air strikes, lying on the ground at another location. The militant also carries out a staged interview with one of the captives, who calls herself Maida Yakubu, in which she asks parents to appeal to the government. Maida's mother, Esther, is one of several parents of Chibok girls who recently published open letters to their daughters detailing the pain they feel at their children's absence and their hopes for the future. Another girl among those standing in the background can be seen with a baby. Some of the girls can be seen weeping as Maida speaks. Boko Haram has waged a violent campaign for years in northern Nigeria in its quest for Islamic rule, and a faction of the group recently pledged loyalty to so-called Islamic State. Thousands of people have been killed or captured by the group, whose name translates as \\"Western education is forbidden\\". Many of the girls abducted in Chibok were Christian. Boko Haram has always maintained that the Chibok girls were safe and would only be released if the Nigerian government gave in to its demands. Through this video, the group is again trying to make the government look like the villain for carrying out air strikes on the militants, which it claims have backfired and hit the abductees instead. Reigniting public sympathy for the girls might be an attempt to force the government to listen. Boko Haram is attempting to paint the military campaign against the jihadists as a failure. It is also significant that this video comes shortly after a split in the group, with one faction maintaining that it is the true regional branch of the so-called Islamic State. The video indicates that the other faction, led by Abubakar Shekau, is the one holding the Chibok girls and so it will use this to show why it cannot be ignored, even if its rivals have foreign backing. Nigerian Information Minister Alhaji Mohammed insisted the government was doing everything possible to secure the girls' release. \\"We are being extremely careful because the situation has been compounded by the split in the leadership of Boko Haram,\\" he said. \\"We are also being guided by the need to ensure the safety of the girls.\\" The video is the first to be seen since CNN obtained footage in April purportedly showing 15 of the girls. The Nigerian army declared journalist Ahmad Salkida a wanted man after he published details of the new video before it was released. Salkida, who moved to Dubai a few years ago, has written extensively about the inside operations of the group. The Chibok girls had been thought to be in a heavily forested area of northern Nigeria.

Does it follow that \\"There are many workers that do not know the retirement age for full Social Security has changed. \\"?","output":"Yes, it does follow that \\"There are many workers that do not know the retirement age for full Social Security benefits has changed.\\" The statement provided explains that many workers are unaware of the change, which implies that these workers lack the knowledge that the retirement age for full Social Security benefits is gradually increasing from 65 to 67 years old. This lack of knowledge among some workers about the change in retirement age can have consequences as they plan for their retirement. Workers might be under the impression that they can retire and receive full Social Security benefits at the age of 65, but depending on their year of birth, they may need to work for a few more years to receive the full benefits. The Social Security program underwent amendments in 1983, leading to the increase in the retirement age to accommodate the growing life expectancy and fiscal challenges the program faced. The amendments were implemented to ensure the program's sustainability and its capability to provide benefits to future retirees while reducing the financial burden on the working population. As the retirement age for full benefits increases, it will impact those born between 1938 and 1960 or later. For people born between 1938 and 1959, the retirement age will increase incrementally over time. For those born in 1960 or later, the full retirement age is set at 67. The new retirement age eligibility will be based on the specific birth year, with the details outlined on the Social Security Administration's website. It is essential for workers to educate themselves on these changes and the new retirement age to make informed decisions regarding their retirement plans. This includes understanding when an individual is eligible for full benefits, the effects of early or delayed retirement on benefits, and other factors that may impact their retirement income. In conclusion, it is reasonable to infer from the statement that many workers are not aware of the change in the retirement age for full Social Security benefits. This lack of knowledge could consequently impact their retirement planning and overall financial preparations for their post-work life. It is crucial for workers to increase their awareness of these changes to make informed decisions about when to retire, the benefits they will receive, and how to maximize their retirement income."},{"instruction":"See question below: One of the following sentences is nonsensical.

The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property.

Now we need to isolate \\"k\\" in the equation to find its value. The equation is 13 * k = -156, where '*' denotes multiplication. We have to \\"undo\\" this multiplication to find the value of k. Since the opposite of multiplication is division, we divide both sides of the equation by 13. This will give us: k = -156 / 13. 3. Simplify the right side of the equation to find the value of \\"k\\". -156 divided by 13 gives -12. So, the solution to the equation 13*k = -32 - 121 - 3 is k = -12."},{"instruction":"Question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Moving the computer out of the bedroom can be a practical step in this process as it could help to limit access and therefore reduce the behavior. (i). The sentence is too vague and doesn't provide a clear next step in dealing with the addiction. We don't need to think about ideas but to take concrete steps. (ii). This sentence would be more appropriate in the context of advice for someone recovering from alcohol addiction, not internet forum addiction. The terminology ('sober', 'drinking') isn't relevant in this context. (iii). This sentence also could be a logical follow-up, as expressing feelings can be part of recovery process.

April was a brilliant and talented college student, but she faced difficulty in setting her future in the world. Her dreams were to pursue a degree in social sciences and leave a mark on the academic world, yet the pressure of fitting into societal norms and expectations weighed heavily on her shoulders. Around the same time, in the same town, a young man named Cyrus was navigating the tumult of college life. Cyrus excelled in swimming and had a natural talent for it. His father, a former swimming champion himself, wished for Cyrus to take his swimming skills to the national level. He envisioned a future where his son would surpass his achievements and bring honor to their family name in the world of competitive swimming. In college, Cyrus quickly became popular due to his charming personality and swimming prowess. However, in spite of his popularity, Cyrus felt out of place and struggled to find genuine connections. He often felt like his peers only embraced him for his potential to be a swimming legend, rather than truly understanding who he was as an individual. Meanwhile, April's life took a dramatic turn when her stepmother and stepsisters moved in. As the days progressed, her new family members began to treat her like a servant, forcing her to manage the house and burdening her with endless domestic duties. Despite the weight of these new responsibilities, April managed to put on a brave face. She continued attending college, intent on pursuing her degree and turning her dreams into reality. One day, April and Cyrus crossed paths at a college seminar on academic development. They struck a conversation about their shared passion for education and acknowledging their mutual feelings of being trapped in a life not of their choosing. As their friendship grew, they found solace in one another, seeing in each other the support they sorely needed. April confided in Cyrus about the difficulties with her step-family and the struggles of balancing her studies and domestic duties. Cyrus, in turn, shared his father's expectations for a swimming career, revealing the trepidation that gnawed at his spirit as he pursued an ambition he no longer cherished. April's understanding and encouragement inspired Cyrus to make an important decision about his life: he chose to stand up to his father and forge his own path, much to his father's dismay. Cyrus began attending college classes and found his passion for environmental studies, blending his love for water sports with his newfound enthusiasm for environmental conservation. Forging a bond outside the rigid confines of their social circles, Cyrus and April both attended college events together, gradually making their mark on campus. April's determination to continue her education while managing her household duties was an inspiration to her peers. Her drive helped her secure internships and research opportunities that gradually brought attention to her academic talents. Cyrus, in turn, became an advocate for sustainable practices in sports, using his influence as a swimming prodigy to raise awareness on environmental challenges faced by aquatic ecosystems. He didn't completely abandon swimming, though, as his dreams of competitive success morphed into a desire to leave a lasting, meaningful legacy in the sport. Eventually, the two college students graduated with honors and embarked on a journey to reshape their lives. April's work led her to become a renowned social scientist, with a focus on empowering women in academia. Cyrus followed his passion for environmental studies, forging a new path that led to a successful career as a conservationist and reformist in aquatic sports. Through their journey, April and Cyrus had proved that the courage to follow their hearts and the strength of their friendship had the power to transform their destinies – carving out the future they so truly deserved."},{"instruction":"Question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process in maintaining blood sugar levels involves the detection and monitoring of blood sugar levels by specialized cells. This is an essential aspect to ensure the body can sustain its vital functions as it requires an adequate supply of energy. Let's break down the detailed process below: 1. Detection of blood sugar levels: The body constantly monitors the blood sugar (glucose) levels as a key aspect of maintaining its overall homeostasis. In the pancreas, there are specific cells, called alpha cells, that are primarily responsible for detecting changes in blood glucose concentrations. 2. Release of glucagon: When the blood sugar levels drop below a specific threshold, the alpha cells in the pancreas initiate the process by releasing a hormone called glucagon. Glucagon acts as a signal to the liver and other body cells to elevate blood glucose levels. 3. Conversion of glycogen to glucose: The liver plays a crucial role in maintaining blood glucose levels by storing glucose in the form of glycogen. In response to the glucagon signal, the liver starts converting the stored glycogen back into glucose through a process called glycogenolysis. 4. Release of glucose into the blood: Once the glycogen has been converted back into glucose, it is released into the bloodstream. This glucose is then distributed to various organs and tissues, where it can be utilized as a source of energy. 5. Restoring blood sugar levels: As the blood glucose levels rise due to the newly released glucose, the body can maintain its normal functions, avoiding the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Once the blood sugar concentrations return to the normal range, the secretion of glucagon by the pancreas decreases, preventing an excessive rise in glucose levels. 6. Feedback and regulation: The entire process of blood glucose maintenance is tightly regulated by a feedback mechanism that involves the cells in the pancreas, liver, and other tissues. This ongoing communication ensures that blood glucose levels remain stable and within a healthy range for the body to function optimally. In conclusion, the first step of the process in maintaining blood sugar levels is the detection of blood glucose concentrations by the alpha cells in the pancreas. This step is vital as it initiates the subsequent mechanisms such as the release of glucagon and the conversion of glycogen into glucose to restore sufficient blood sugar levels and ensure the body's proper functioning."},{"instruction":"Read this article and answer this question Coming off their season-sweep over the Dolphins, the Jets went home for a Week 14 intraconference duel with the Cleveland Browns.

But Palahniuk is a short order cook serving up thin, insufficient burgers whose only flavoring is a slathering of ketchup. You can salt bad food to save it, but that doesn't make it worth swallowing.This is less an act of literature than a smart-alecky rant. A rant that is neither new nor funny nor intriguing. It is insufferably trite - to the point of being numbing - and coarsely, cheaply repetitive. We're a culture hung up on looks, on money, on fame, on competition, on faith - repulsively so, farcically so. Yeah, so what? That is the ear-splitting sermon of this tiresome book. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of the given product review is decidedly negative. The reviewer uses various criticisms and harsh descriptions to convey their dissatisfaction with the book \\"Survivor\\" by Chuck Palahniuk. From the very beginning, the title, \\"Bad Review,\\" sets a negative tone that is followed throughout the entire piece. The reviewer then employs multiple metaphors and comparisons to highlight their dissatisfaction with the quality of the writing. In particular, the analogy of the meal suggests that there was promise in the premise of the book, likening its bold opening to the smell of good meat cooking. However, the reviewer ultimately concludes that the author failed to deliver on this potential, comparing the book's content to a greasy, thin burger slathered in ketchup. The reviewer goes on to describe the book as \\"insufferably trite\\" and \\"numbing,\\" harsh adjectives which drive home the negative tone. The reviewer is especially critical of the book's reiteration of common cultural critiques, referring to it as a \\"smart-alecky rant\\" that berates the readers without offering any new or compelling insights. It is clear that the reviewer finds the book painfully repetitive, further emphasizing the negativity of their opinion. Lastly, the mention of the \\"ear-splitting sermon\\" in the book showcases the annoyance and disappointment the reviewer feels about the content and delivery. The use of strong language, such as \\"repulsive\\" and \\"farcical,\\" only adds to the overall negative tone of the review. In summary, the product review's tone is unmistakably negative, with the reviewer harshly critiquing both the style and content of \\"Survivor\\" by Chuck Palahniuk. The use of various metaphors, comparisons, and strong language to describe their dissatisfaction further emphasizes the negative opinion of the book."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer, due to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.Endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales.An Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles). Riding the southern Indian Ocean Gyre, this vortex of plastic garbage constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the Mozambique Channel, and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.The garbage patch in the Indian Ocean will, according to a 2012 study, decrease in size after several decades to vanish completely over centuries. Over several millennia, however, the global system of garbage patches will accumulate in the North Pacific.In 2016 six new animal... Two of Earth's oceans provide vast quantities of fish for human consumption. The Indian ocean hosts a large concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer. The Pacific ocean has less phytoplankton and nutrients for marine life. Which ocean accounts for a more economically valuable tuna catch? A:","output":"The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. This is primarily due to the presence of a large concentration of phytoplankton blooms during summer, as a result of strong monsoon winds and upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis. Phytoplankton production supports the marine ecosystem and forms the base of the marine food web, and eventually helps in sustaining larger fish species such as tuna. While the Pacific Ocean has less phytoplankton and available nutrients for marine life, it still provides a significant amount of fish for human consumption. However, in terms of economic value for tuna catch, the Indian Ocean has a higher value due to the factors mentioned above. It is essential to note that the Indian Ocean borders many countries that highly depend on the fishing industry for domestic consumption and export, as well as foreign fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan that exploit the region mainly for shrimp and tuna."},{"instruction":"Please check if these have the same meaning.

In American football, there are a vast array of positions, formations, strategies, plays and types of play calling systems that are utilized. If a strategy is for a particular game, it is known as a \\"game plan\\". Hypothesis: Offensive, defensive, and special teams players are deployed for varying amounts of time.","output":"In order to determine the validity of the hypothesis that offensive, defensive, and special teams players are deployed for varying amounts of time, it is necessary to analyze the structure and rules of American football. In this context, football teams can be disaggregated into three primary units: offensive, defensive, and special teams. Offensive Unit: This unit is responsible for scoring points by driving down the field and either reaching the end zone for a touchdown or getting within field goal range. The offensive unit consists of positions such as the quarterback, running backs, wide receivers, tight ends, and offensive linemen. This unit will spend time on the field each time they possess the ball during a game and typically has the most prolonged periods of continuous play. Defensive Unit: This unit's objective is to stop the opposing team's offensive unit from advancing the ball and ultimately scoring points. The defensive unit includes the defensive linemen, linebackers, and defensive backs. Similar to the offensive unit, the defensive unit will spend time on the field based on the opposing team's possession of the football. However, their time on the field also depends on the effectiveness of their plays and tactics which can lead to turnovers and quick offensive possessions for their team. Special Teams: The special teams unit consists of players who are utilized during kicking plays, such as punts, field goal attempts, and kickoffs. Due to the specialized nature of these plays, the special teams unit is generally on the field for lesser continuous time compared to the offensive and defensive units. Players in key positions on special teams include the punter, kicker, long snapper, and return specialists. Given the specific roles and functions of each unit in American football, it is evident that the time spent on the field can vary depending on the circumstances related to a game's progression. Factors such as the overall game plan, score differential, and the effectiveness of each unit in executing plays will influence the amount of time each unit is deployed throughout the game. Considering the differentiation in the roles, responsibilities, and circumstances faced by offensive, defensive, and special teams players during an American football game, the hypothesis that they are deployed for varying amounts of time is indeed true. The dynamics of American football and the diverse strategies employed by coaches and players ensure that each unit's deployment time is likely to differ, as they contribute uniquely to the outcome of the game."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What was a possible consequence of belief in evolution?\\" Context: \\"Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"A possible consequence of belief in evolution, particularly in the context of Father Joseph Carrier, Father John Augustine Zahm, and their involvement in the Catholic Church, was the potential conflict between religious teachings and scientific discoveries. This conflict could have led to controversy and debate within both religious and scientific communities, as well as among the general public, concerning the compatibility of evolution with religious beliefs. In the case of Father John Augustine Zahm, his book \\"Evolution and Dogma\\" (1896) attempted to reconcile certain aspects of the evolutionary theory with religious teachings. He argued that the great Church teachers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Augustine, may have taught something similar to evolution. This could have implied that the belief in evolution was not necessarily contradictory to the traditional teachings of the Catholic Church. The potential consequence of such a belief could have been Zahm's censure by the Vatican, as some within the Church might have considered his views on evolution as undermining the Church's authority on moral and philosophical matters. However, the intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented this censure. Furthermore, embracing the belief in evolution could have encouraged more Catholics to engage in scientific research and exploration, as demonstrated by Zahm's collaboration with Theodore Roosevelt on an expedition through the Amazon. This could have contributed to bridging the gap between scientific and religious communities, fostering dialogue and mutual understanding. In summary, the possible consequence of belief in evolution during the time of Father Joseph Carrier and Father John Augustine Zahm was a potential conflict with religious teachings and potential censure from the Church. However, their efforts to reconcile scientific discoveries with religious beliefs also helped promote the idea that science and religion could coexist, leading to a broader intellectual dialogue within the Catholic community."},{"instruction":"Answer based on context: In the county, the population was spread out with 24.90% under the age of 18, 7.20% from 18 to 24, 28.10% from 25 to 44, 23.60% from 45 to 64, and 16.30% who were 65 years of age or older.

The school’s name was something of a misnomer: Rather than grant JDs, Witherspoon staged seminars and lectures offering lessons in what it summarized as “the comprehensive biblical foundation for our common law and constitutional government.” Its target audience was homeschooled young men. The school itself was a project of Vision Forum, a Texas-based ministry whose founder was also a leader in the Christian Patriarchy movement, which preaches, among other things, that husbands should vote for their wives. Most sitting judges would go to great pains to avoid such a gathering. But Tom Parker, then a few months into his first term on the Alabama Supreme Court, gladly accepted an invitation to speak at that year’s Witherspoon retreat. Before his election to Alabama’s highest court, Parker had been an aide-de-camp to Chief Justice Roy Moore, whose installation of a granite Ten Commandments monument in the state judiciary building had touched off what became for Alabama both a considerable embarrassment and a genuine constitutional crisis. At Parker’s swearing-in, he made it clear that he had sought the bench to continue his old boss’s spiritual fight. “The very God of Holy Scriptures, the Creator, is the source of law, life, and liberty,” he declared to an audience that included his eight unsmiling fellow justices. The atmosphere at Parker’s Witherspoon appearance was far warmer, and his remarks there were even more candid. A DVD of the session shows him gripping the lectern, dressed in a gray suit and blue tie, as he railed against the perceived sins of jurists at every level. “It’s the judges who have legalized abortion and homosexuality … They are shaking the very foundation of our society.” Parker made it clear that he had no intention of letting legal precedent get in his way. “We cannot fall under that trap,” he insisted. “We have to stand for what’s right.” The one thing he most wished for the young men before him was that they find a way to gain positions of influence and turn them to God’s purpose. No opportunity to do so should be shrunk from or wasted. In the nine years Parker has now served on the court, he has made the most of his opportunities. Child custody disputes, for instance, have made good occasions to expound on the role of religion in parental rights. (“Because God, not the state, has granted parents the authority and responsibility to govern their children, parents should be able to do so unfettered by state interference,” he wrote in one case.) But Parker has been the most creative in his relentless campaign to undermine legal abortion. Again and again, he has taken cases that do not directly concern reproductive rights, or even reproductive issues, and found ways to use them to argue for full legal status for the unborn. Those efforts have made Parker a pivotal figure in the so-called personhood movement, which has its roots in a loophole in Roe v. Wade. While that 1973 ruling was creating a broad new right to abortion grounded in a constitutionally protected right to privacy, an often-overlooked passage left an opening for those who would seek its undoing. During oral arguments, the justices had asked Roe’s lawyer what would happen if a fetus were held to be a person under the Constitution. “I would have a very difficult case,” she had replied. In his majority opinion, Justice Harry Blackmun noted that the Supreme Court could find no basis for such status, before adding, “If this suggestion of personhood is established, [Roe’s] case, of course, collapses, for the fetus’ right to life would then be guaranteed.” Inside the courtroom of the Alabama Supreme Court in downtown Montgomery. (William Widmer, special to ProPublica) Roe’s fiercest critics immediately took up the challenge, launching a push for a constitutional amendment affirming that life begins at conception. But that first effort fizzled, and it’s only in recent years that a new wave of pro-life activists—many of them born after Roe and educated in fundamentalist Christian settings—have once again seized on personhood as a way not just of weakening Roe, but of overturning it. In state after state, they have been pushing to have their beliefs enshrined in policy. This November 4, in Colorado, voters will cast ballots on Amendment 67, an initiative that would include unborn human beings under the definition of “person” and “child” throughout the state’s criminal code. North Dakotans, meanwhile, will decide on Measure 1, which would alter the state constitution to recognize the “inalienable right to life” at every stage of human development. Even if both initiatives fall short, others will follow. The first one to pass doubtlessly will then be challenged in court, igniting the potentially decisive battle that personhood advocates really want. Their goal is to get to the U.S. Supreme Court — as quickly as possible, while conservatives still dominate. Christian-educated lawyers have been preparing for that day, churning out articles published by Christian law journals, which are then cited in briefs submitted to courts by Christian-right legal organizations. But given their provenance, the impact of those arguments has been limited. Parker, a graduate of Dartmouth and Vanderbilt who counts Clarence Thomas as a role model, has the imprimatur of his office behind him, and he has used it to build a body of reasoning that can be cited and re-cited, helping to frame and refine the thinking of other lawyers and judges in the battles ahead. “Now, it’s not just an obscure law-review article making these arguments,” said Glen Halva-Neubauer, a Furman University political scientist who studies anti-abortion activism. “It’s not just some treatise that twenty-five of your right-to-life friends know about and nobody else. The mainstream effect is not inconsequential.” And that, of course, was the idea all along. “What Justice Parker has done,” said Lynn Paltrow, executive director of the nonprofit National Advocates for Pregnant Women, “is explicitly lay out the roadmap for overturning Roe v. Wade.” The Human Life Amendment, as personhood advocates’ first big push was commonly known, was ahead of its time. In the wake of Roe , pro-choice groups — which then included many centrist Republicans — had the momentum. Personhood proponents hoped in vain that Ronald Reagan’s election and the GOP’s capture of the Senate in 1980 would turn the tide, but the comparatively moderate pro-life mainstream wasn't fully on board. By the time the Supreme Court reaffirmed a core right to abortion in the landmark 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the movement had shifted to its own incremental approach. Targeting legislatures in conservative states, it sought tougher penalties for fetal homicides, and, later, birth certificates for stillborn babies. The revised approach alarmed abortion-rights advocates because it was so emotionally resonant — and effective. The basic holding of Roe obviously remains in place, and more than one million legal abortions are performed in the United States every year. Yet the personhood movement has made significant inroads. Today, 38 states have fetal-homicide statutes that make it a crime to cause the death of an unborn child during an act of domestic violence, for example, or while driving drunk. At least 15 have laws that make the pregnancy of a homicide victim an aggravating factor that can lead to the death penalty. And more and more jurisdictions have begun policing pregnant women themselves. In almost every state, women have been arrested or detained for exposing their fetuses to illegal drugs; in more than half of them, mothers can lose some or even all of their custody rights if they or their newborn tests positive for controlled substances. In some places, legislators have written laws expressly authorizing such steps. (Tennessee’s new statute goes the furthest, allowing pregnant drug-users to be charged with criminal assault.) More commonly, it’s constables and prosecutors who’ve taken the initiative, reinterpreting existing laws to detain and arrest mothers. “One clever thing about using drug cases this way,” said Sara Zeigler, a feminist scholar and dean at Eastern Kentucky University, “is that the average person is not going to be at all sympathetic” to a pregnant woman who gets high. Thanks to moves such as these, the idea that a fetus has rights separate from its mother’s has taken root in the law and flourished, even when the more controversial subject of fetal personhood is not directly invoked. In sum, although, as the petitioners correctly state, a majority of jurisdictions have held that unborn children are not afforded protection from the use of a controlled substance by their mothers, they nonetheless fail to convince this Court that the decisions of those courts are persuasive and should be followed by this Court. — Tom Parker, writing in Ex Parte Ankron and Kimbrough A big reason that these piecemeal personhood triumphs haven’t translated into something more sweeping is because courts haven’t been willing to explicitly take up the issue. “If you are a careful, strict constructionist kind of judge, you don’t necessarily connect the dots,” Halva-Neubauer said. Parker not only connects the dots, “he uses a rocket launcher to go after these cases and say, ‘Hey, this is a case that could be used to overrule Roe , and I’m going to show you how.’” In 2011, for example, Parker and his fellow justices heard a case involving a wrongful death lawsuit brought by a woman who blamed her miscarriage on the negligence of her doctors. Under Alabama precedent, such suits weren’t allowed unless the fetus had developed to the point where it could survive outside the womb. But in Hamilton v. Scott, the court voted to strike down that limit. Parker wrote the majority opinion. Then he wrote some more. As a judge, Parker has developed the decidedly unusual habit of authoring concurring opinions to his own majority rulings in cases that hold particular interest for him. In his concurrence to Hamilton, he cited advances in medical and scientific technology as part of a larger, painstaking argument asserting that a centerpiece of Roe — that states cannot ban abortion before the point of viability — was “arbitrary,” “incoherent,” and “mostly unsupported by legal precedent.” Zeigler marvels at how Parker has used the concurrence to strategic effect. “It’s like he’s writing a law-review article without having to go through that process, plus he gets a much wider audience,” she said. And unlike a dissent, a concurrence conveys a certain legitimacy — the idea that the author is on the winning side. “It is much likelier to be noticed and captured and repeated in future cases.” Montgomery, the city where Parker was raised and where the Alabama Supreme Court sits, wears its faith on its sleeve — and its t-shirts, and its restaurant menus, and its license plates. Crosses are more ubiquitous than the American flag. Every other block seems to have a church, sometimes two or three of them. The Frazer United Methodist Church, where Parker worships, is particularly modern and prosperous looking, with a TV station and a playground inside the main lobby. When you park in the immense lot — the church claims a congregation of 8,000 — you remember where you left your car not by the usual Section A, B or C but by one of the virtues: Love, Self-Control, Patience. Over the decades, as Parker has learned to seize his opportunities, he has also learned the value of self-control and patience. “We have to rely on the Holy Spirit so that we don’t rush out into a battle that God did not call us to,” he told a roomful of admirers at the Witherspoon conference in 2005. “With youthful zeal I wanted to get involved in so many fights. But it was so important for me to remember this truth: that the existence of the need is not evidence of the call.” A Christian Family Stores branch in Montgomery, Ala. (William Widmer, special to ProPublica) Parker’s own calling wasn’t clear for many years. He was born to a middle-class Montgomery family in 1952, at the dawn of the modern civil rights era, a few miles from the bus stops and churches where it all began. At a time when many white families were fleeing to segregated Christian academies, he attended the city’s public schools. (His senior year, he was student body president and, according to his classmates, “Most Sincere.”) At Dartmouth, he thought he might become a historian, but ultimately chose law school instead. What he found at Vanderbilt Law School in the mid-1970s shocked him. The religious roots of American law were a forbidden topic. There were no classes specifically devoted to the founding document of American jurisprudence, he said. “They teach you about what judges say about the Constitution rather than having you go back and study the Constitution,” he told a gathering last year. As a young lawyer, Parker led fights to restore God to everyday life in the state — particularly in its schools and textbooks. But he often wound up frustrated, never more so than when a landmark school prayer case he worked on went down to defeat before the U.S. Supreme Court. He complained that the court’s 1985 decision in Wallace v. Jaffree was “the greatest setback to religious liberty that has ever occurred in this country.” After a stint as a lobbyist, during which he helped establish two think tanks affiliated with James Dobson’s hugely influential Focus on the Family, Parker became a confidant of Roy Moore, then a county judge. When Moore became chief justice of the state Supreme Court in 2000, Parker served as his legal lieutenant, strategist and spokesman. And when Moore’s final Ten Commandments crusade ended in debacle, Parker was ousted, too. If unemployed, Parker was hardly finished. He went to work at Moore’s Foundation for Moral Law, a think tank devoted “to protect[ing] the Constitution and protect[ing] the heritage of our Country.” It promoted the far-right strain of Christianity known as Reconstructionism — supporters believe that the Bible should be the governing text for all areas of civil and political life; that America’s Christian founders intended it to be a Christian land; that there is no law without God; that the law and the Constitution don’t evolve any more than humans do, but are fixed and immutable. The Foundation was also a champion of the newly revived personhood movement — indeed, it claimed the group Personhood Alabama as one of its projects. Parker won a spot on the state’s top court in 2004. Once elected, he freely recruited the kinds of committed, somewhat eclectic culture combatants who made up Moore’s circle. For the powerful behind-the-scenes job of chief of staff, he chose John Eidsmoe, an ex-law professor and author of several seminal Reconstructionist works — “the top Biblical law commander of the era,” according to Frederick Clarkson, a journalist and historian of far-right religious movements and senior fellow at Political Research Associates. Two of Parker’s quirkiest hires were Alex and Brett Harris, 16-year-old homeschooled twins from outside Portland, Ore., whose blog, Rebelution (tagline: “a teenage rebellion against low expectations”) had made them the Jonas Brothers of the Christian homeschool world. After they blogged about one of his opinions, Parker took them on for a two-month legal internship; despite their lack of training, they quickly progressed from filing memos to researching and drafting legal opinions. A few months after that, in 2006, Parker made them the grassroots directors in his (failed) campaign to become chief justice. “They demonstrated a maturity comparable to the law students we’ve had, and sometimes exceeding that maturity,” Parker raved. Frazer United Methodist Church, which Tom Parker attends. (Will Widmer, special to ProPublica) Parker soon gained a kind of celebrity in the world of Christian talk radio. He appeared at conferences and conventions and had little compunction about voicing his opinions in public forums. “The liberals on the U.S. Supreme Court already look down on the pro-family policies, Southern heritage, evangelical Christianity and other blessings of our great state,” Parker declared in one particularly blistering op-ed, in which he excoriated his fellow justices for following that court’s precedent and overturning the death penalty for a man convicted of murder as a juvenile. “We Alabamians will never be able to sufficiently appease such establishment liberals, so we should stop trying and instead stand up for what we believe without apology… It does no good to possess conservative credentials if you surrender them before joining the battle.” Parker didn’t expect those battles to be easy. But knew that judges had strategic weapons at their disposal that could alter the course of the fight in the long term. Dissents and concurrences, for example, might not have the force of precedent, but they could signal new tactics, raise new arguments — and eventually change minds. Parker liked to invoke scripture when referring to judges as “gods with little g’s.” “When judges don’t rule in the fear of the Lord, everything’s falling apart,” he would argue, citing the Book of Psalms. “The whole world is coming unglued.” In 2013, a case landed on the Alabama Supreme Court docket that presented Parker with yet another opportunity to attack Roe v. Wade . One of the plaintiffs, Hope Ankrom, from Coffee County south of Montgomery, had pleaded guilty after her son tested positive for cocaine and marijuana at birth. The other, Amanda Kimbrough, from rural northwestern Alabama, had used methamphetamine while pregnant, giving birth 15 weeks prematurely to a boy who soon died. Facing the possibility of life in prison, she opted for a plea deal and a 10 year sentence in the notorious Tutwiler state penitentiary for women. But no Alabama laws specifically authorized the women’s arrests and convictions. Instead, prosecutors had charged them under a felony “chemical endangerment” statute enacted in 2006 to protect children from the noxious fumes and explosive chemicals that make home-based meth labs so dangerous. Lawyers for Ankrom and Kimbrough argued that the state had grossly overreached, pointing out that legislators had debated — and rejected — expanding the meth-lab law to cover pregnant women. Parker, along with five other justices, didn’t buy it. He declared that the chemical-endangerment law did indeed apply to fetuses exposed to drugs in the womb. But again, Parker didn’t leave it at that. His main opinion in Ex Parte Ankron and Kimbrough ran 55 pages. His concurrence ran another 20. This time, Parker’s goal was to establish the many ways that existing statutes recognize fetuses as persons with legally enforceable rights. The document is a kind of masterpiece of pro-life reasoning. “He’s someone who really takes time to read history and the development of jurisprudence,” said Mat Staver, the head of Liberty Counsel and a leading Christian legal theorist. “He’s not a surface thinker.” Step by step, Parker lays out his evidence: laws that give inheritance rights to unborn children, laws that ban pregnant inmates from being executed, laws that give fetuses legal guardians for the purposes of protecting their interests, laws that allow parents to sue for damages if fetuses are injured or killed as the result of negligence or some other wrongful act. Several pages of the concurrence consist almost entirely of lists of statutes from around the country conferring fetal rights. “Today, the only major area in which unborn children are denied legal protection is abortion,” he concluded, “and that denial is only because of the dictates of Roe.” This past spring, as if to punctuate its reasoning, the Alabama Supreme Court confronted a virtually identical case, and, with Parker again writing the majority opinion, reached a virtually identical conclusion. In this concurrence, Parker called on the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve the matter of full fetal rights once and for all. (Will Widmer, special to ProPublica) The Court will soon have its chances, if it wants to take them. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit just upheld a set of abortion regulations in Texas that have shut down most of that state’s abortion clinics, the appeal of which the justices could well agree to hear. Meanwhile, the National Advocates for Pregnant Women is putting together a lawsuit that would challenge Alabama’s chemical-endangerment prosecutions, which now number at least 130. Going to the Supreme Court on any issue that touches on abortion feels increasingly risky for pro-choice supporters. Anthony Kennedy remains the swing vote, and, on the one hand, he has argued that people must be allowed “to define one’s own concept of existence.” On the other, he has upheld almost every abortion restriction to come before him. Staver is hopeful that Kennedy’s concern for “the dignity of the individual,” a recent theme of his ever-unpredictable reasoning, may make him newly amenable to overturning Roe on personhood grounds. Pro-choice advocates, not surprisingly, are deeply worried about any ideas that Parker’s writings could give the justices in Washington. “Parker is pointing out all the ways the law treats the fetus as a person already,” Zeigler, the feminist scholar, said. “The pro-choice argument, meanwhile, is that the personhood of the fetus hinges entirely on the women’s perception of it.” To the question of what constitutes life, she continued, “Parker has answers. The pro-choice side is more, ‘It depends.’ … People will really struggle with that.” This story was co-published with The New Republic. Illustration by Simon Prades. ||||| A Helena woman can proceed with a wrongful death claim against a doctor for her miscarriage when she was about six weeks pregnant, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled Friday in reversing a Jefferson County judge's order that dismissed her claim. One justice, outspoken in the past in his views against Roe v. Wade, said the decision reaffirms the Alabama Supreme Court's previous ruling that children are protected by Alabama's wrongful-death law from the point of conception. Justices ruled a circuit judge had erred when he said the doctor was immune from civil lawsuits for wrongful death involving the death of a fetus that had not yet reached the stage of viability. The state's Wrongful Death Act extends immunity from criminal prosecution to doctors for \\"a mistake or unintentional error causing the death of a pre-viable fetus.\\" But the judge, based on previous rulings, had extended that to also include immunity from civil lawsuits. The decision by the Alabama Supreme Court allowing the wrongful death claim to proceed to trial was unanimous, with all eight justices of the current court concurring in the result. Justice Tom Parker wrote a special concurring opinion. \\"Today, this Court again reaffirms the principle that unborn children are protected by Alabama's wrongful-death statute from the moment life begins at conception,\\" Parker wrote. \\"This has not always been the case in Alabama. Alabama used to deny unborn children who had not yet grown strong enough to survive outside of their mother's womb the protections of Alabama's wrongful-death statute.\\" Parker stated that Alabama previously applied the viability standard established in Roe v. Wade - the U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1973 that gave women the right to abortions before fetuses are viable - \\"to determine which unborn children received protection under the law and which did not.\\" However, in a 2011 decision in Mack v. Carmack the Alabama Supreme Court determined that the viability standard established in Roe does not apply to wrongful-death law, Parker stated. \\"The Court reaffirms that principle today,\\" he wrote. \\"The use of the viability standard established in Roe is incoherent as it relates to wrongful-death law because, among other reasons, life begins at the moment of conception,\\" Parker wrote. \\"The fact that life begins at conception is beyond refutation.\\" Parker's stance on the issue is widely known. In a 2014 article, the non-profit news organization ProPublica wrote that Parker was key to the \\"personhood movement\\" in an ultimate attempt to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade The publication argued that Parker was establishing the legal rights for the unborn in his opinions that ultimately could be used to overturn Roe v. Wade. Parker, in an interview with AL.com last year, called the ProPublica article a hit-piece and said he never used the word \\"personhood\\" in any of the decisions. \\"I have written opinions joined by the rest of the court that have recognized the right of parents to file a wrongful death lawsuit involving an unborn child from the point of conception,\\" Parker said. \\"Personally I have written against Roe v Wade and the lack of historical legal or medical basis for that decision and I have done that from one of my opinions.\\" Last week's decision by the Alabama Supreme Court overturned a ruling by Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Jim Hughey in the case of Kimberly Stinnett v. Dr. Karla G. Kennedy. \\"I think it was a huge decision to clarify the law,\\" Steve Heninger, the Birmingham lawyer who represented Stinnett, said of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling. Efforts to reach attorneys representing Kennedy were unsuccessful prior to publication of this story. Stinnett sued after she had a miscarriage in June 2012. According to the Supreme Court's opinion, Stinnett's obstetrician had informed Stinnett that she was pregnant on May 9, 2012. Two days later Stinnett experienced abdominal cramping and fever. Because it was after hours on the weekend, Stinnett called her obstetrician's answering service and received a call back from Dr. Kennedy, who was sharing calls with her regular obstetrician that weekend. Dr. Kennedy told Stinnett to go to the emergency room at Brookwood Medical Center. Stinnett reported prior miscarriages in 2005 and 2007 and a prior ectopic pregnancy in 2010. An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus. Kennedy was concerned that Stinnett was experiencing another ectopic pregnancy and performed a dilation and curettage, a surgical procedure in which the cervix is dilated and tissue is removed from the lining of the uterus, and a laparoscopy to determine whether the pregnancy was inside or outside the uterus, according to the opion. Kennedy informed her that there was no ectopic pregnancy but that she still felt as though there had been a miscarriage. Dr. Kennedy, however, testified that she still held \\"a high suspicion\\" of ectopic pregnancy on May 13 and, therefore, ordered methotrexate, a cytotoxic drug used to treat ectopic pregnancies, be administered to Stinnett. The drug is intended to cause the end of the pregnancy. On Monday, May 14, Stinnett's regular obstetrician returned and took over treatment of Stinnett at the hospital. A follow-up ultrasound showed that what had previously been suspected to be an intrauterine gestational sac had, in fact, progressed to a \\"definite yolk sac.\\" In his discharge summary for Stinnett, her obstetrician stated that Stinnett was having a failing intrauterine pregnancy possibly as a result of her methotrexate injection. Several weeks later, on June 8, 2012, Stinnett suffered a miscarriage, according to the opinion. The evidence was disputed as to whether the fetus could have reached viability, according to the opinion. In her lawsuit Stinnett alleged Dr. Kennedy committed medical negligence when she performed the D & C and administered methotrexate and that caused the loss of her child. Judge Hughey, on April 15, 2016, entered an order granting the motion to dismiss Stinnett's wrongful-death claim. He stated that \\"after considering all of the ... arguments and authorities, this Court finds that the existence of the 'physician's exception' to the Brody Act ...prohibits the extension of civil liability under the Wrongful Death Act to licensed physicians who through mistake or unintentional error cause the death of a previable fetus.\\" Hughey, however, allowed Stinnett's other claims, including her personal injuries and claim of mental anguish, in her lawsuit to continue to trial. At that trial in May a jury found in favor of Dr. Kennedy on those other claims. Heninger said they expected to lose the trial in May on Stinnett's mental anguish claims because that was only a small part of the case, which really focused on the wrongful death claim. The jury, however, was told it couldn't consider the wrongful death aspect, he said. One group, Liberty Counsel, applauded the Alabama Supreme Court's decision in a press release Tuesday. \\"Liberty Counsel applauds the Alabama Supreme Court and Justice Tom Parker for defending the legal rights of the unborn as clearly stated in Alabama law,\\" said Mat Staver, Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel. \\"We strongly urge other judges to do likewise as the value of human life is not a negotiable matter. The womb should be the safest place for a child and it must be legally protected. It's time to turn the tables on Roe v. Wade,\\" he stated. Liberty Counsel represented Parker in defenses of a judicial ethics complaint last year. The complaint was dismissed. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The Alabama Supreme Court has ruled that a physician can be sued for the wrongful death of a woman's unborn child that was six weeks into development when a miscarriage occurred.

The mother-of-four suffers from Trypophobia, a fear of holes which means even the thought of holding a sponge sends shivers down her spine - and she is forced to flee the shower if she spots any bubbles floating in the plug hole. Her terror is so real she quit her job in a school kitchen because as soon as she saw a cluster of holes - in crumpets, the bottom of mushrooms or the inside of peppers - she would have a panic attack. Jackie Wright, 45, from Wallsend, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne suffers from Trypophobia - a fear of holes. Even sponging off in the shower brings her out in a cold sweat.

She said: ‘I hated it when the camera would pan out from the naked people on the screen and merge into the pores of someone’s skin. ‘As soon as I saw it, my skin would crawl and after that, as soon as I heard the voice over for the advert I had to turn over to another channel.’ Her world was turned upside down. She said: ‘There were loads of things I was fine with, and then suddenly I just couldn’t bear them. ‘When I suffered an episode at work, I felt like I was going to pass out and I’d be on the verge of tears. ‘It. would start with a tingle in my head, which made me want to rip my hair. out then I would break out in goosebumps all over my body and I’d want. to rip my skin off.’ Jackie suffered in silence, until one day at work in the school kitchens, she had a breakdown. The final straw came when her colleague was making a pizza and unaware of her phobia, she showed her the holey base. Jackie. said: ‘She had no idea about my phobia, but was telling me how she. didn’t like the patterns herself. I started crying and had an anxiety. attack, it was horrible. My heart was racing and I had to sit in the. office to calm down. ‘I realised that I couldn’t carry on like this so I quit my job a month later.’ Jackie researched her symptoms on the internet and discovered that her bizarre fear was in fact a phobia of holes. But doctors do not recognise the phobia, and Jackie wants sufferers to be taken seriously. She. said: ‘Not many people understand, so I am very careful who I tell. about my phobia. I have told some friends and family and they were. supportive but it was still embarrassing. I just don’t want people to. think I’m mad.’ But her phobia does have one plus point – she doesn’t have to do the washing up. But Jackie's phobia does have one 'silver lining' - she doesn't have to do the washing-up because her husband David, 46, (pictured) does it. Trypophobia is fear, revulsion or disgust of objects with irregular patterns of holes. British academics Arnold Wilkins and Geoff Cole, who claim to be the first to scientifically investigate trypophobia, believe the reaction to be based on a biological revulsion, rather than a learned cultural fear. They found that holes in skin, meat, wood, plants, coral, sponges, mould, dried seed pods, honeycomb, soap, cheese, soil, plants, wounds, bubbles, waffles, speakers caused sufferers distress. Their study in journal Psychological Science also found some people think that something might be living inside holes and are afraid that they might fall in the holes. Cole and Wilkins concluded that Trypophobia triggers a fear of danger. The holes, or images of holes, stimulate 'a primitive portion of his or her brain that associates the image with something dangerous.' Jackie, who lives with husband David, 46, and children Rachael, 22, Connor, 20, Sofie, 14, and Caitlin, 12, said: ‘It’s the only silver lining of the phobia.’ And now she has started to face her fears and is receiving Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to help her cope with anxiety. During the therapy she has to pop bubbles and is forced to use the objects she fears most - sponges and crumpets. Trypophobia has been investigated by Dr Geoff Cole, a lecturer in vision science at the University of Essex. Dr Cole believes everyone has the phobia to a certain degree. He said: ‘Trypophobia is the most common phobia you’ve never heard of. We estimate that around 16 percent of the population is Trypophobic but we think that everybody has it to a certain degree.’ And Dr Cole has his own theory as to why people are so embarrassed to disclose their fear to their loved ones. ‘As the phobia isn’t officially recognised, people think they are the only ones to suffer from it. Thankfully the internet is raising awareness and we hope that with more publicity we can get the condition recognised.’ What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article is about a woman named Jackie Wright who has a fear of holes called Trypophobia.

Somehow, Tasha and I began to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can imagine. She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert. I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha. So, I think, did she. The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made. She had no choice but to follow. (I do not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to. Those who are truly curious may look at the last act of \\"Captured Moments.\\") I remember suggesting, with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major accomplishments.

New York (CNN) -- The mayor of Newark has called for an investigation into a far-reaching New York Police Department surveillance program that was allegedly conducted in the New Jersey city's Muslim's neighborhoods. \\"The Newark Police Department was not involved in joint operations with the New York Police Department as was described in the disclosed NYPD report,\\" Mayor Cory Booker said Wednesday, referring to a leaked internal New York police document that allegedly detailed police surveillance of Muslim-owned business and mosques across the city. \\"I strongly believe that we must be vigilant in protecting our citizens from crime and terrorism but to put large segments of a religious community under surveillance with no legitimate cause or provocation clearly crosses a line,\\" he said. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also called the development \\"disturbing\\" and has asked the state's attorney general to investigate. The 60-page report, first obtained by The Associated Press, showed maps of Newark and photographs of Muslim residences and mosques. There was no statement in the document regarding terrorism or criminal activity. The New Jersey mayor's statement comes a day after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg defended the extent of police surveillance against critics who have suggested authorities went too far. \\"We have to keep this country safe,\\" the mayor told reporters, addressing questions about a separate report, also leaked to AP, that indicated the New York police were closely monitoring Muslim student associations in schools across the Northeast. \\"If people put things on websites and make them available to everybody, of course the NYPD is going to look at anything that's publicly available in the public domain,\\" Bloomberg said. \\"And given we've had a dozen people arrested or convicted of terrorist acts who've come from similar organizations, we have an obligation to do so.\\" That report said police have tracked websites, and on one occasion sent an undercover officer with students from the City College of New York on a whitewater rafting trip. \\"The police department goes where there are allegations,\\" Bloomberg said. But Yale University President Richard Levin described New York's surveillance program as \\"antithetical to the values\\" of the New Haven, Connecticut, university and those of the nation. When a reporter asked if police had gone too far by sending the agent on the rafting trip, Bloomberg responded, \\"No.\\" Police spokesman Paul Browne told CNN that his agency does not monitor students directly but confirmed it monitors websites they use. \\"In any case where you see an NYPD officer present, it's an indication that we were looking at an individual,\\" he said. The Columbia University Muslim Students Association condemned the police practice in a statement this week. \\"We are concerned that news reports about NYPD's presence on our campus have a chilling effect on the intellectual freedom necessary for a vibrant academic community,\\" it read. In December, a prominent group of Muslim leaders boycotted Bloomberg's annual interfaith breakfast in protest of the controversial program. The move stemmed from a series of earlier news reports that raised questions about the nature of a CIA partnership with the New York police that allegedly helped to build city intelligence programs to spy on Muslims. The boycott stood in a stark contrast to the goodwill the mayor earned among Muslim leaders when he defended plans for a controversial Islamic community center near the former site of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. The CIA later announced its internal watchdog found no issue or evidence of wrongdoing in the spy agency's partnership with New York police.","output":"Part #1: The maximum length of the highlight.

Two of the nation's largest and most prominent cities, Sydney and Melbourne, are often compared in terms of their influence and contributions to the Australian economy. Analyzing the manufacturing output of these two cities in 2013 offers an insightful perspective on the landscape of Australia's industrial growth during that period. In this article, we will be examining the differences in manufacturing outputs of Sydney and Melbourne in 2013, and answering the question: How many more billions of dollars was Sydney's manufacturing output compared to Melbourne? Manufacturing Output in Sydney Sydney, the capital of New South Wales (NSW), held the highest share of Australian manufacturing output in 2013. As the country's most populous city, it boasted an extensive industrial base, diverse range of manufacturing activities, and a well-established infrastructure. In 2013, Sydney's manufacturing output reached an impressive 21.7 billion, an amount that contributed significantly to the state's and the nation's economy. Sydney's robust manufacturing sector was centered around various industries, including food and beverage processing, chemicals and chemical product manufacturing, as well as machinery and equipment manufacturing. Other notable sectors in the region included metal product manufacturing and textiles, clothing, and footwear production. Manufacturing Output in Melbourne Melbourne, the capital city of Victoria, and often dubbed Australia's cultural and sporting capital, has also been historically vital to the country's manufacturing industry. In 2013, Melbourne contributed 19.7 billion in manufacturing output. This placed it in second place regarding Australia's cities, with a prominent presence in industries such as auto manufacturing, aerospace, and biotechnology. Similar to Sydney, Melbourne also had a strong focus on food and beverage processing, machinery and equipment manufacturing, and chemicals and chemical product manufacturing. Other sectors of significance in the region involved the production of metal products, as well as textiles, clothing, and footwear. The Comparative Difference Comparing the manufacturing outputs of Sydney and Melbourne in 2013, we can discern a difference of 2 billion between the two cities. Sydney's manufacturing output surpassed Melbourne's by this amount, totaling 21.7 billion compared to Melbourne's 19.7 billion. This 2 billion difference serves as an indicator of the stronger industrial activities and growth that Sydney experienced in 2013. Conclusion Analyzing the data from 2013, the manufacturing output of Sydney exceeded Melbourne's by 2 billion, reaching a remarkable total of 21.7 billion. As Australia's two major cities, both Sydney and Melbourne held significant sway over the manufacturing landscape and the national economy. While Sydney's edge over Melbourne in terms of manufacturing output highlights its greater industrial capacity in 2013, it is essential to note that both cities contributed immensely to Australia's economic growth and prosperity during that year. Future comparisons of manufacturing outputs between these two cities will provide valuable insight into the evolving industrial landscape and the potential impact it will have on Australia's overall economic performance. The continued development of strategic policies, investments in infrastructure, and support for innovation will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping the future growth of the manufacturing sectors in both Sydney and Melbourne."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

His literary style was Atticistic imitating Classical Attic Greek in its prime. - Paolo Caliari, known as Paolo Veronese (15281588), was an Italian Renaissance painter, based in Venice, known for large-format history paintings of religion and mythology, such as \\"The Wedding at Cana\\"(1563) and \\"The Feast in the House of Levi\\" (1573). Included with Titian, a generation older, and Tintoretto, a decade senior, Veronese is one of the great trio that dominated Venetian painting of the \\"cinquecento\\" and the Late Renaissance in the 16th century. Known as a supreme colorist, and after an early period with Mannerism, Paolo Veronese developed a naturalist style of painting, influenced by Titian. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Lucretia is a painting by Paolo Veronese from c. 1585 . - Tiziano Vecelli or Tiziano Vecellio (1488/1490 27 August 1576), known in English as Titian , was an Italian painter, the most important member of the 16th-century Venetian school. He was born in Pieve di Cadore, near Belluno (in Veneto, Republic of Venice). During his lifetime he was often called \\"da Cadore\\", taken from the place of his birth. - Tintoretto (born Jacopo Comin, late September or early October, 1518 May 31, 1594) was an Italian painter and a notable exponent of the Renaissance school. For his phenomenal energy in painting he was termed Il Furioso. His work is characterized by its muscular figures, dramatic gestures, and bold use of perspective in the Mannerist style, while maintaining color and light typical of the Venetian School. - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

The work is a large-format (6.77 m × 9.94 m) oil painting executed in the Mannerist style of the High Renaissance (14901527); as such, \\"The Wedding Feast at Cana\\" is the most expansive canvas (67.29 m) in the paintings collection of the Musée du Louvre. - Mannerism is a style in European art that emerged in the later years of the Italian High Renaissance around 1520, lasting until about 1580 in Italy, when the Baroque style began to replace it. Northern Mannerism continued into the early 17th century. - Titus Livius (64 or 59 BCAD 17)known as Livy in Englishwas a Roman historian who wrote a monumental history of Rome and the Roman people \\"Ab Urbe Condita Libri\\" (\\"Books from the Foundation of the City\\") covering the period from the earliest legends of Rome before the traditional foundation in 753 BC through the reign of Augustus in Livy's own time. He was on familiar terms with the Julio-Claudian dynasty, advising Augustus's grandnephew, the future emperor Claudius, as a young man not long before 14 AD in a letter to take up the writing of history. Livy and Augustus's wife, Livia, were from the same clan in different locations, although not related by blood. - The Feast in the House of Levi or Christ in the House of Levi is a 1573 painting by Italian painter Paolo Veronese and one of the largest canvases of the 16th century, measuring . It is now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice. It was painted by Veronese for the rear wall of the refectory of the Basilica di Santi Giovanni e Paolo, a Dominican friary, as a \\"Last Supper\\", to replace an earlier work by Titian destroyed in the fire of 1571. - Cinquecento ('five hundred'; short for \\"millecinquecento\\" '1500') was the Italian Renaissance of the 16th century, including the current styles of art, music, literature, and architecture. - History painting is a genre in painting defined by its subject matter rather than artistic style. History paintings usually depict a moment in a narrative story, rather than a specific and static subject, as in a portrait. The term is derived from the wider senses of the word \\"historia\\" in Latin and Italian, meaning \\"story\\" or \\"narrative\\", and essentially means \\"story painting\\". Most history paintings are not of scenes from history, especially paintings from before about 1850. In modern English, historical painting is sometimes used to describe the painting of scenes from history in its narrower sense, especially for 19th-century art, excluding religious, mythological and allegorical subjects, which are included in the broader term history painting, and before the 19th century were the most common subjects for history paintings. - Lucretia or Lucrece (died ) was an ancient Roman woman whose fate played a vital role in the transition of Roman government from the Roman Kingdom to the Roman Republic. While there were no contemporary sources, accounts from Roman historian Livy (Livius) and Greek-Roman historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus from the time of Emperor Caesar Augustus (23 September 63 BC 19 August 14 AD) agreed that there was such a woman and that her suicide after being raped by an Etruscan king's son was the immediate cause of the anti-monarchist rebellion that overthrew the monarchy. What is the relationship between 'lucretia ' and '1580'?","output":"The relationship between 'Lucretia' and '1580' is that 'Lucretia' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter, Paolo Veronese, created around 1585. The painting is an interpretation of the story of the ancient Roman woman, Lucretia, whose tragic fate played a significant role in the transition of Roman government from the Roman Kingdom to the Roman Republic. The year 1580 is close to the time when the painting was created."},{"instruction":"Given the question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Eukaryote. Yes or no? Answer: The two other domains, Bacteria and Archaea , are prokaryotes and have none of the above features. Question: how many eukaryotic cells are in a animal? The answer is:","output":"The task is to clarify the number of eukaryotic cells in an animal, and to consider this, we must first establish what eukaryotic cells are. Eukaryotic cells are one of the primary types of cells that make up life on Earth, other types are prokaryotic cells. Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells have a nucleus enclosed within a nuclear envelope or membranes. Prominent examples of eukaryotes are animals, plants, and fungi, which are mostly multicellular, and protists, which are unicellular. Now, regarding the number of eukaryotic cells in an animal, it varies significantly depending on the animal's size, type, and complexity. Let's take the human body as an example. According to scientific research, the human body has approximately 37.2 trillion cells, and most of them are eukaryotic. This number comprises many different cell types, including skin cells, nerve cells, blood cells, and many others, each playing a specific role in the body. In smaller animals, the number of eukaryotic cells would be less. For instance, the microscopic roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, often used in biological studies, has exactly 959 cells if it's a hermaphrodite and 1031 if it's a male. However, it's still a eukaryote and offers an excellent counter/example to the human body's complexity. For larger animals, the number of cells would be even higher. The blue whale, the largest animal ever to have existed, would have considerably more cells than humans. However, quantifying the exact number is extremely challenging due to the animal's size. In conclusion, the number of eukaryotic cells in an animal is dependent on the type, size, and complexity of the animal in question. The number could range from less than a thousand in microscopic organisms to trillions in larger mammals like humans and whales. Therefore, the statement- \\"The two other domains, Bacteria and Archaea, are prokaryotes and have none of the above features\\"- is correct as it points out that only eukaryotes have the advanced features and complex cellular organization typical of animals, plants, and other higher forms of life. The other two domains, Bacteria and Archaea, indeed consist of prokaryotes, organisms that lack a nucleus and other organelles due to the absence of internal membranes, which distinguishes them from eukaryotes."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Everyone needs friends.

It was formed by a merger of French Aérospatiale-Matra Missiles (of EADS, now Airbus Group), Italian Alenia Marconi Systems (now Leonardo) and British Matra BAe Dynamics (of BAE Systems) in December 2001. In 2015 the company had 10,000 employees. In 2015, MBDA recorded orders for €5.2bn and an order book of €15.1 bn. MBDA works with over 90 armed forces worldwide. - Radar is an object-detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed. Radar was developed secretly for military use by several nations in the period before and during World War II. The term \\"RADAR\\" was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging or RAdio Direction And Ranging. The term \\"radar\\" has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization. - British Aerospace Dynamics Limited (BADL or BAe Dynamics) was a division of British Aerospace. - Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS) was a major European integrated defence electronics company and an equal shares joint venture between BAE Systems and Finmeccanica until its dissolution on May 3, 2005. - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - Active radar homing (ARH) is a missile guidance method in which a missile contains a radar transceiver (in contrast to semi-active radar homing, which uses only a receiver) and the electronics necessary for it to find and track its target autonomously. NATO brevity code for an air-to-air active radar homing missile launch is Fox Three. - Brimstone is an air - launched ground attack missile developed by MBDA for Britain 's Royal Air Force . It was originally intended for \`\` fire - and - forget '' use against mass formations of enemy armour , using a millimetric wave ( mmW ) active radar homing seeker to ensure accuracy even against moving targets . Experience in Afghanistan led to the addition of laser guidance in the dual - mode Brimstone missile , allowing a \`\` spotter '' to pick out specific targets when friendly forces or civilians were in the area . The tandem shaped charge warhead is much more effective against modern tanks than older similar weapons such as the AGM - 65G Maverick , while the small blast area minimises collateral damage . Three Brimstones are carried on a launcher that occupies a single weapon station , allowing a single aircraft to carry many missiles . After a protracted development programme , single - mode or \`\` millimetric '' Brimstone entered service with RAF Tornado aircraft in 2005 , and the dual - mode variant in 2008 . The latter has been extensively used in Afghanistan and Libya . An improved Brimstone 2 was expected to enter service in October 2012 , but problems with the new warhead from TDW and the ROXEL rocket motor put back the planned date to November 2015 . MBDA is working on the targeting of swarms of small boats under the name Sea Spear . The RAF intend to fit Brimstone to their Eurofighter Typhoons , and planned to integrate it with their Harriers until they were withdrawn from service in 2010 . MBDA is studying the use of Brimstone on ships , attack helicopters , UAVs , and from surface launchers ; it will be integrated on the Lockheed Martin F - 35 Lightning II when the F - 35B enters British service . The United States , France and India have expressed interest in buying Brimstone for their aircraft , but Saudi Arabia is the only export customer as of 2015.The cost per missile has been quoted as £ 175,000 ( 263,000 ) each in 2015 , or ' over £ 100,000 ' . - BAE Systems plc is a British multinational defence, security and aerospace company.

Select the topic that this about: The last probable common ancestor to humans and great apes had a body like an ape, fingers like a chimp and the upright posture of humans, according to researchers who unearthed a fossil of the animal in Spain. Options: -World -Sports -Business -Science/Tech","output":"This topic belongs to Science/Tech. The discovery of the last probable common ancestor's fossil between humans and great apes is a significant breakthrough in the field of human evolutionary studies. By analyzing these fossils, researchers can unlock crucial information about the biological and morphological traits that have shaped our lineage and led to the emergence of modern humans. The fossil, unearthed in Spain, demonstrates a unique blend of characteristics from both humans and apes, which may have allowed the species to adapt better during critical periods of evolutionary change. A body like an ape suggests that this species was adapted to moving through trees or across uneven surfaces. This physical feature would have benefited them in the arboreal environment, enabling them to effectively search for food, avoid predators, and establish a territory. In addition, fingers like a chimp indicate a greater degree of manual dexterity and gripping capabilities that could have been used in multiple ways - from handling objects and manipulating tools to signal communication and social functioning. This trait may have been vital in developing the cognitive and cultural processes that have enabled human intellectual development. One of the most striking features of human evolution is our upright posture, also known as bipedalism. This trait is shared with the last probable common ancestor, potentially providing evidence on how early hominids began to rely more on walking upright, ultimately leading to improved energy efficiency and the ability to traverse longer distances. Bipedalism also freed the hands for various tasks such as carrying objects, tool manufacturing, and social grooming - all essential factors to the social and cultural evolution of our species. This significant discovery highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in the field of paleoanthropology. By combining various investigative methods from disciplines such as geology, biology, and archeology, researchers can reveal fascinating stories about our past and understand the complex factors that lead to the evolutionary success of our species. In conclusion, the topic of the last probable common ancestor to humans and great apes found in Spain is most accurately classified under the Science/Tech category. This discovery contributes to our understanding of human evolution, illustrating the morphological features and biological traits that have set the stage for the emergence of modern humans. It sheds light on the evolutionary adaptations that propelled our ancestors towards the sophisticated cognitive and social abilities that define humanity today."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was one of Henry V's victories? When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

The film is based on actual events, beginning in August 1941. Nazi Einsatzgruppen (task forces) are sweeping through Eastern Europe, systematically killing Jews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettoes are the Belarusian Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the local Auxiliary Police chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader.

How many tomatoes of the number he harvested on Friday are remaining if he gives away 700kg of them to his friends? Let's be accurate as possible.","output":"To solve this problem, we will first find the total weight of the tomatoes harvested on Wednesday and Thursday. Then we will find the weight of the tomatoes harvested on Friday. Finally, we will subtract the weight of tomatoes given away and find the remaining number. 1) On Wednesday, Tedra harvests 400 kg of tomatoes. 2) On Thursday, he harvests half as much as on Wednesday, which means he harvests 400 kg / 2 = 200 kg. 3) The total weight of tomatoes harvested on Wednesday and Thursday is 400 kg + 200 kg = 600 kg. Now, we know that the total weight of tomatoes harvested on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2000 kg. So, we can find the weight of the tomatoes harvested on Friday using this information: 4) The weight of tomatoes harvested on Friday = 2000 kg (total) - 600 kg (Wednesday and Thursday) = 1400 kg. Next, we need to find the remaining number of tomatoes after Tedra gives away 700 kg to his friends: 5) Remaining tomatoes on Friday = 1400 kg (harvested on Friday) - 700 kg (given away) = 700 kg.

In order to design and construct a reservoir, several critical factors need to be taken into account. These factors help dictate the best materials, methods, and overall engineering design needed to assure that the reservoir is structurally sound, environmentally friendly, and sustainable for long-term use. Below is a detailed analysis of these factors: 1. Size of the reservoir: The size of the reservoir is determined by the volume of water it needs to store, the available land area, and the topography of the location. Calculating the size is essential for identifying the amount of materials needed for construction and the overall cost of the project. It is also necessary for estimating the amount of time required to fill or empty the reservoir and to forecast the potential impacts on surrounding ecosystems. 2. Weight load on the coastal zone: The weight load on the coastal zone should be calculated carefully, considering the soil type, slope stability, seismic conditions, and other geological hazards. This information helps in developing the structural design and engineering works needed to avoid any potential failures, such as landslides or land subsidence, which could significantly impact the safety and functionality of the reservoir. 3. Picked up materials for the registration of the coast: The type of materials used to construct the reservoir's coastline – which can range from sand, pebbles, boulders, concrete or other artificial elements - should be chosen based on factors like the local availability of materials, environmental considerations, and the specific requirements of the project. These materials should be engineered to resist erosion, withstand wave action and other forces of nature, and provide adequate support for the entire structure. 4. Choice of construction methods: Once these factors have been assessed, the best construction method should be chosen for the reservoir. This methodology could include traditional earth, rock, or concrete fill dams, roller-compacted concrete dams, or more innovative designs like inflatable rubber dams. The construction method should be chosen based on cost efficiency, ease of construction, maintenance requirements, and the long-term resilience of the structure. It's also important to consider the environmental impacts and any potential disruptions to local communities. 5. Safety measures: Ensuring the safety of the reservoir, both during and after construction, is essential. This includes implementing proper safety measures during the construction phase, routine inspections, regular maintenance, and emergency response planning in case of accidents or unforeseen events. Engineering designs should incorporate features like spillways, retention ponds, and barrier systems to prevent flooding and mitigate the risk of environmental damage. In conclusion, designing and constructing a reservoir is a complex process that involves careful consideration of various factors, including the size of the reservoir, weight load on the coastal zone, and the materials chosen for the shoreline. Engineers must weigh these factors when choosing the appropriate construction method and must also carefully consider the long-term durability, safety, and environmental impacts of the reservoir to ensure a successful and sustainable project."},{"instruction":"Q:Given the below context: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

Uranium enrichment is a process that's critical for both civil nuclear power generation and military nuclear weapons. This dual-use technology is thus rigorously monitored and regulated on an international level. In this context, the enrichment of uranium by Iran, a country that has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), becomes a significant point of concern for many nations worldwide because it potentially signals Tehran’s capability and intention to develop nuclear weapons. The passage also highlights the diplomatic efforts of three European powers to curb Iran's nuclear program. Although these countries are not explicitly named in the excerpt, historical knowledge reveals the group typically referenced in such cases is the E3, or EU3, consisting of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. These key European nations have repeatedly aimed to negotiate with Iran in order to persuade the country to halt its nuclear developments and particularly its uranium enrichment activities as part of a broader strategy to maintain stability in the Middle East and global nuclear security. Lastly, the threat to \\"intensify pressure\\" on Iran if it does not comply with requests to curb its nuclear program suggests a range of diplomatic and economic measures, including potential sanctions or reporting the issue to international institutions such as the United Nations.

There could be multiple reasons for their lackluster performance, such as inadequate execution of plays, difficulty adapting to the offensive strategies, or potential injuries that impacted the overall performance of the players. As for The Clemson Insider's Ashley Pendergist, they seem to be providing a brief summary or analysis of the scrimmage, focusing on the perspective of the coaching staff. The emphasis on the coordinators' edition of the two-minute drill could be an indication that this analysis specifically looks at the offensive and defensive strategies employed by the coaches and how the players performed during the scrimmage. It's important to note that the conclusion drawn from this report should be taken with a grain of salt, as it is based solely on the opinions of the coaching staff and the summarized information provided by The Clemson Insider. In conclusion, based on the information given, it is more accurate to infer that Head Coach Dabo Swinney, Offensive Coordinator Jeff Scott, and Defensive Coordinator Brent Venables were happier with the performance of the offense rather than the defense during Clemson's first scrimmage of fall camp on Saturday. It is essential to remember that this conclusion is based on the available information and may not necessarily reflect the entirety of the scrimmage or the subsequent practices that followed. As Clemson's fall camp continues, the coaching staff will likely be working on identifying the areas that need improvement and developing strategies to bolster both the offensive and defensive units."},{"instruction":"Q: Justin Nelson, Jr., pounded the last of the stakes of his new cattle pen into the dry dirt. Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece. With a sigh escaping from the bellows of his withering chest, Justin shuffled back to the porch he had added onto his small two-room home. In the distance, a plume of dust was billowing off the road. Mail truck. Must be time for breakfast. About time I ate something. Question: Why was Justin's face like leather? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"Justin's face was described as being like leather, most likely due to the prolonged exposure to the harsh elements, such as the sun, wind, and dry air that he faced as a result of working outdoors for extended periods. Over time, constant exposure to these elements can cause the skin to become dry, tough, and wrinkled, taking on the appearance of leather. Justin's occupation as a rancher or farmer would have required him to spend long hours outside in all types of weather, tending to the land and his cattle. This lifestyle, combined with his aging, would contribute to the leathery and weathered appearance of his face. Additionally, the passage indicates that Justin has had a long life, with references to his \\"aging back,\\" making it likely that the passage of time has played a role in the leather-like appearance of his face. The line about \\"hating it more than usual\\" implies that he is becoming more aware of the physical effects of his age and perhaps even experiencing a degree of self-consciousness about them. Furthermore, Justin's stubbornness and refusal to admit that his constant thinking has slowed his progress on the cattle pen suggest that he may not take proper breaks or care for himself while working, which could also contribute to the weathered appearance of his skin. This is supported by the fact that he reminds himself to buy some cattle, indicating that he is preoccupied with his work and overlooks self-care, such as seeking shade and drinking water. In summary, the leather-like appearance of Justin's face is the result of years of hard work outdoors, his aging, and perhaps a tendency to neglect self-care due to a strong work ethic and stubbornness, which have caused his skin to become weathered and tough, resembling leather."},{"instruction":"by project leader michael kristensen category: fossil free island in august five employees from the islands branch of energy service denmark met to talk about challenges and collaboration possibilities for the future. søren hermansen was invited to contribute with inspiration and valuable insights.

The group stands accused of committing heinous war crimes during the Sierra Leone Civil War, a brutal conflict that took place between 1991 and 2002. Step 1: Introduction to the context The trial pertains to the Civil War in Sierra Leone, a conflict that left tens of thousands of people dead and millions displaced. Various factions fought for control over the territory and its valuable resources, leading to a multitude of atrocities and human rights abuses. Step 2: Present the accused group The pro-government militia in the trial is accused of perpetrating numerous war crimes during the conflict. They played a significant role in the unrest and the escalation of violence, contributing to the devastation faced by civilians caught in the crossfire. Step 3: Describe the court's decision Following a series of delays and setbacks during the pretrial phase, the Sierra Leone War Crimes Court has made the decision to adjourn the trial. This move grants both the prosecution and defense teams additional time to gather evidence and build their respective cases. Step 4: Discuss potential outcomes As the trial remains adjourned, it is yet unclear when it will resume. Nevertheless, this case holds significant potential for setting a precedent in addressing war crimes committed during times of conflict. If found guilty, the accused militia members could face severe consequences, serving as a deterrent to future acts of violence and human rights abuses. Step 5: Highlight the importance of the trial The trial of the pro-government militia in Sierra Leone serves as a crucial step toward achieving justice for the victims of the Civil War and the country's efforts to establish a lasting peace. It serves as a reminder of the importance of holding perpetrators accountable for their actions and upholding human rights protections. In conclusion, the adjournment of the Sierra Leone War Crimes trial signifies the ongoing complexities surrounding the process of seeking justice for war crimes committed during the Civil War. While this development does not signal the end of the case, it highlights the continued need for thorough and transparent investigations to ensure that those responsible for atrocities are held accountable."},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a bird finds more twigs on the ground happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER nests. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Step 1: Analyze perturbation hypothesis The given perturbation hypothesis is that if a bird finds more twigs on the ground, there will be less or smaller nests. Step 2: Assess the relationship between elements and the process The process describes the steps a bird takes to build a nest. The process involves collecting twigs, making a base and sides, and adding softer material to the inside. The size of a nest could be influenced by the number of twigs a bird has access to. Step 3: Consider the direct effect of perturbation on the process If a bird finds more twigs on the ground, this means it has more material to use for its nest, which can directly affect the size of the nest. The bird might create a larger nest, assuming the bird has the energy and time to construct a bigger nest. It could also have the option to create multiple nests, which might provide backup nesting options. Step 4: Analyze the indirect effect of perturbation on the process Indirectly, the increased availability of twigs on the ground could attract more birds to the area where the twigs are plentiful. This could lead to increased competition for prime nesting locations in nearby trees. The competition might push some birds to gather fewer twigs to secure a nesting location faster, leading to smaller nests being constructed as a trade-off. Step 5: Evaluate the overall impact of the perturbation Based on the direct and indirect effects, the perturbation hypothesis might not hold true for every case. Some birds might build larger nests with more twigs, while others might build smaller nests due to a faster construction to compete for limited nesting locations. Step 6: Conclusion The supposed perturbation does have both direct and indirect effects on the process. However, the hypothesis assumes that more twigs will result in fewer or smaller nests, but this relationship is not guaranteed, given the various direct and indirect factors at play."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation: This Merino carries a very heavy wrinkly hide In form the type A is angular and has little carcass value It is not advocated for commercial lamb and wool production","output":"This Merino carries a very heavy, wrinkly hide.

They have evidence that an unknown flying craft crashed in their vicinity, so Reporter Ned Scott (Douglas Spencer) tags along for the story. Dr. Carrington later briefs Captain Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) and his airmen, and Dr. Redding (George Fenneman) shows photos of a flying object moving erratically before crashing; not the movements of a meteorite. Following erratic magnetic pole anomalies, the crew and scientists fly to the crash site aboard the team's C-47. The mysterious craft lies buried beneath refrozen ice, with just the tip of a rounded airfoil protruding from the surface. As they outline the craft's general shape, they realize they are standing in a circle: they have discovered a crashed flying saucer. They try deicing the buried craft with thermite heat bombs, but only ignite its metal alloy, causing an explosion that destroys the saucer. Their Geiger counter then points to a slightly radioactive frozen shape buried nearby in the refrozen ice. They excavate a large block of ice around what appears to be a tall body and fly it to the research outpost, just as a major storm moves in, cutting off their communications with Anchorage. Some of the scientists want to thaw out the body, but Captain Hendry issues orders for everyone to wait until he receives further instructions from the Air Force. Later, Corporal Barnes (William Self) takes the second watch over the ice block and to avoid looking at the body within, covers it with an electric blanket that the previous guard left turned on.

St Botolph's Church is an Anglican place of worship in the village of Quarrington, part of the civil parish of Sleaford in Lincolnshire, England. The area has been settled since at least the Anglo-Saxon period, and a church existed at Quarrington by the time Domesday was compiled in 1086, when it formed part of Ramsey Abbey's fee. It was granted to Haverholme Priory about 1165, and the Abbey claimed the right to present the rector in the 13th century. This right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation in the early 16th century, and then passed to Robert Carre and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. With capacity for 124 people, the church serves the ecclesiastic parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and, as of 2009, had an average congregation of 50. Recognised for its age and tracery, the church has been designated a grade II* listed building. It has a tower and spire with a nave and north aisle ending at a chancel at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out restoration work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of arcading correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and trefoils in the reticulated designs.

A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Why might it be easier for us to repeat tasks using a computer?\\" in the given passage can be summarized as the concept of the \\"flow of control\\" within a program. Flow of control allows a computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention, which makes it easier for us to repeat tasks using a computer. The passage compares program execution to reading a book, in which a person reads each word and line, sometimes jumping back to an earlier place or skipping sections. In a similar fashion, a computer can go back and repeat instructions in a program multiple times based on internal conditions being met. This ability to execute tasks repeatedly and efficiently, coupled with the speed and precision of computers compared to humans, contributes to the ease of repetition in tasks by using a computer."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Congress never passed a budget for the current fiscal year, and the government has been running on a \\"continuing resolution,\\" which expires March 4. House Republicans have thrown down the gauntlet over cuts to current programs and threaten to shut down the government if they don't get their way. After Obama sends his 2012 plan to Capitol Hill, House and Senate budget committees each pass their own budget resolutions, which set caps on spending and establish revenue targets and generally serve as five- to 10-year blueprints for congressional priorities. The budget resolutions also allocate how much may be spent on broad budget functions like defense and education but not individual programs. House and Senate numbers often differ, and the chambers must resolve their differences and pass a single Budget Act. Obama: Budget 'down payment' on debt. Next, the appropriations committees and subcommittees in each chamber debate how to allocate discretionary funds among government agencies and programs. If all doesn't go according to plan, Congress must pass a continuing resolution like last year's by 11:59 p.m. September 30 to continue funding the government as lawmakers continue to try to slice up the budget pie. Justice budget includes increase for prisons. Here are some highlights from Obama's plan:. Department of Education. There's a good reason Obama went to a school to make his first public pitch after his spending plan was released. Education is one of the few areas to get a significant increase in funding: 4.5 billion more than in his 2011 budget. Obama requests increase for education in 2012. The 77.4 billion request would be spent on reforms, teacher training for STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) and reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, also known as No Child Left Behind. Obama wants to spend 80 million to recruit 10,000 teachers in STEM subjects in the next two years, 100,000 over the next 10 years. He also wants 900 million for a new round of Race to the Top, the competition that rewards states that meet the administrations standards for innovation and outcomes. The budget request maintains the current funding level for Pell Grants, but it recommends dropping the year-round option that began in 2009. It also drops subsidies that allowed grad students to avoid interest accruing on loans while they are in school. Department of Defense. The plan increases the Pentagon's base budget to 553 billion, 22 billion more than last year. Defense, State fight for more funding. It reinvests 100 billion expected to be saved through cuts to areas like development or purchase of unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets; proposals for more ships; a new ground combat vehicle; the Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite; and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The budget includes a 1.6% increase for military pay as well as an increase in housing allowances and health care, especially for wounded service members. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are covered separately, with 118 billion set aside: more than 41 billion less than last year, mostly because of the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. Slight increase sought for Homeland Security. Department of Transportation. The plan provides 13.4 billion in discretionary resources in 2012, a 1.3 billion decrease from 2010. It proposes a six-year, 556 billion surface reauthorization plan to modernize the country's transportation infrastructure. It provides 8 billion in 2012 and 53 billion over six years to reach a goal of providing 80 percent of Americans with convenient access to a passenger rail system, featuring high-speed service, within 25 years. The plan reduces funding for airport grants, focusing support on smaller airports, while giving larger airports more flexibility to raise their own resources. Department of Veterans Affairs. Obama's plan provides 61.85 billion, a 10.6% increase over 2010. It proposes a multiyear budgeting approach to manage medical care resources across multiple fiscal years, including advance appropriations for the 2013 fiscal year. It reduces construction spending and redirects those funds for care and benefits to veterans. Department of the Interior. Obama's plan budgets 12 billion, which is roughly the same as in previous years, and increases land and water conservation programs. The savings are planned through decreases in the U.S. Geological Survey, cuts in construction programs and tribal program reductions. The plan provides more than 500 million to restructure the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement and to strengthen oversight of offshore oil and gas operations in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year. Department of State and international programs. The plan provides 47 billion for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, a decrease of less than 1% from 2010. Increases are made in the areas of food security and global health. Foreign assistance to several countries is cut. The plan reduces funding for the African Development and Inter-American Foundations by nearly 20% and directs them to seek partnerships to leverage remaining funding.","output":"In his spending plan, President Obama placed a strong emphasis on education, with a 4.5 billion increase from his 2011 budget. The Department of Defense saw its base budget increased to 553 billion, 22 billion more than the previous year. Another key feature was a slight increase for the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Transportation experienced a reduction of 1.3 billion from 2010, while the Department of Veterans Affairs received a 10.6% increase from 2010. The Department of the Interior saw a budget of 12 billion, with increases in land and water conservation programs. Lastly, the Department of State and international programs experienced a decrease of less than 1% from 2010, with increased funding for food security and global health. Overall, the budget included significant funding boosts for education, defense, and Veterans Affairs, while other departments faced funding reductions or minimal adjustments. Importantly, the spending plan represented the first step in a complex process that would involve numerous congressional committees, subcommittees, hearings, and votes, with the aim of getting funding in place for the federal government by the beginning of the 2012 fiscal year."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],N={key:0},j={key:1};function E(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
