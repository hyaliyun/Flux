Question: According to the latest research in the United States,men and women talk such different languages that it is like people from two different cultures trying to communicate.Professor Deborah Tannen of Georgetown University has noticed the difference in the style of boys' and girls' conversations from an early age.She says that little girls' conversation is less definite than boys' and expresses more doubts.Little boys use conversations to establish status with their listeners. These differences continue into adult life,she says.In public conversations,men talk most and interrupt other speakers more.In private conversations,men and women speak in equal amounts--although they say things in a different style.Professor Tannen believes that,for women,private talking is a way to establish and test intimacy(,).For men,private talking is a way to explore the power structure of a relationship. Teaching is one job where the differences between men's and women's ways of talking show.When a man teaches a woman,says Professor Tannen,he wants to show that he has more knowledge,and hence(,)more power in conversation.When a woman teaches another woman,however,she is more likely to take a sharing approach and to encourage her student to join in. But Professor Tannen does not believe that women are naturally more helpful.She says women feel they achieve power by being able to help others.Although the research suggests men talk and interrupt people more than women,Professor Tannen says,women actually encourage this to happen because they believe it will lead to more intimacy and help to establish a relationship. Some scientists who are studying speech think that the brain is pre-programmed for language.As we are usually taught to speak by women,it seems that the brain must have a sexual bias in its programming,otherwise male speech patterns would not arise at all.

Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which battle day group A would have more openings in their nest thatch, battle day three or battle day four?  Hint: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. Answer:","output":"To answer the question, we need to determine in which battle day group A would have more openings in their nest thatch considering the conditions provided for each day and the hint about Acromyrmex heyeri ants. Step 1: Analyze the temperature factor for each battle day. - Battle day one: Group A territory had a temperature of 5 °C, which is below the temperature range mentioned in the hint (20 – 30 °C temperature) where ants create more openings. - Battle day two: Group A territory had a temperature of 22 °C, falling within the specified temperature range. Step 2: Analyze the humidity factor for each battle day. - Battle day three: Group A territory had low air humidity. The hint indicates the ants will close the openings to reduce water loss in such conditions. - Battle day four: Group A territory had high air humidity. There is no mention of how this humidity level would impact openings in the nest thatch, but it does not involve the need to close openings. After analyzing both factors, we can conclude that: - In battle day one, the ants would not create more openings due to low temperature. - In battle day two, the ants would create more openings because the temperature falls within the specified range. - In battle day three, the ants would close openings due to low air humidity. - In battle day four, there is no information regarding the nest thatch openings, but it does not involve the factor that leads to closure. Therefore, group A would have more openings in their nest thatch during battle day four."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year.

He is now the president of North Korea Strategy Center (NKSC).  - Pierre Rigoulot (born 1944) is a French historian and author. The author of \\"L'antiaméricanisme\\", he contributed to Stéphane Courtois' \\"The Black Book of Communism\\" and helped Kang Chol-Hwan write \\"The Aquariums of Pyongyang\\". In 2006, he prefaced \\"France Intox\\", published by Editions Underbahn.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - The Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a highly militarized strip of land running across the Korean Peninsula. It was established at the end of the Korean War to serve as a buffer zone between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). The DMZ is a \\"de facto\\" border barrier that divides the Korean Peninsula roughly in half. It was created by agreement between North Korea, China and the United Nations in 1953. The DMZ is long, and about wide.  - The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression is a 1997 book edited by Stéphane Courtois, who includes contributions by several European academics documenting a history of repressions, both political and civilian, by Communist states, including genocides, extrajudicial executions, deportations, and artificial famines. The book was originally published in France as \\"Le Livre noir du communisme: Crimes, terreur, répression\\" by Éditions Robert Laffont. In the United States it is published by Harvard University Press.  - North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK ), is a country in East Asia, in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang is both the nation's capital as well as its largest city. To the north and northwest the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok (known as the Yalu in China) and Tumen rivers. The country is bordered to the south by South Korea, with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two.  - The Korean Peninsula is a peninsula in East Asia.

It begins with an introduction by co-author Pierre Rigoulot describing Kang 's new life in the Republic of Korea , then continues with a brief history of both North and South Korea since the Korean War in 1953 . It shows how a powerful family with money and material goods has everything taken from them by the Workers ' Party of Korea . Kang 's family , while of Korean ethnicity , originally lived in Japan before emigrating to the DPRK at the behest of his communist grandmother . When Kang was nine years old , his grandfather was imprisoned for suspected activity against the State . As the policy at the time was to incarcerate the immediate family of political prisoners , Kang Chol - Hwan , his grandmother , father , uncle and younger sister Miho were all imprisoned at the Yodok concentration camp # 2915 . There they suffered and viewed many atrocities over a period of ten years including disease , starvation , torturous punishments and public execution . In the book , Kang states that , while in the camp , he met Pak Seung - zin , a member of the North Korean football squad in the 1966 FIFA World Cup . He says that Pak and other players had been imprisoned after returning from the tour . However , in the documentary film The Game of Their Lives , Pak and the other players were interviewed and denied there had been any retribution . Following his family 's release ( presumably upon the death of his grandfather , the original offender against the State ) , Kang worked in assigned occupations before becoming at risk of again being sent to a concentration camp .

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.  Question: \\"What happened to many Indian people when they participated in the Salt March to protest the British salt tax?\\" Answer: \\"They ate too much salt and got sick\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is incorrect. When many Indian people participated in the Salt March to protest the British salt tax, more than 60,000 of them were put in jail as a consequence of their civil disobedience.

He putters around the archipelago with tourists in a small decommissioned military sub originally designed as a target for naval battle exercises. And now some of his countrymen are gunning for him.

The government won't say what that something is, but Sweden's press is reporting the military is looking for a submarine, maybe a Russian one. Speculations are running rampant, fueled by the tense political climate and the uncertain nature of the potential threat. With the media providing a steady flow of information, the public's imagination is captured by the possibility of a foreign submarine entering Swedish waters. Though officials haven't confirmed any specific details, the Swedish military is already deploying troops, ships, and helicopters to patrol and search the Baltic region. It seems that the government is taking the threat of a foreign submarine intrusion very seriously. Locals share their concerns as national security is at stake, prompting an upswing in discussions about military spending and attitudes toward international relations. Despite the Swedish government's reluctance to disclose details about the possible underwater intruder, further reports indicate that evidence points to a possible Russian submarine. Tensions between the neighboring countries have been escalating in recent years, due in part to Russia's military actions in Crimea and Ukraine. The incident in the Stockholm archipelago is a stark reminder of the ever-present risk of naval encounters between Russia and Sweden. For Lasse Schmidt, the situation continues to be a surreal and nerve-wracking experience. The public eye is on him and his small decommissioned military sub, a curious and unexpected turn of events. He continues to maintain that his vessel has nothing to do with the sought-after intruder and that it is purely a tourist attraction, harmless in its intentions. Nevertheless, the situation in the Stockholm archipelago serves as an important reminder of the global political climate and its potential impact on even the most seemingly safe and idyllic corners of the world. The search for the mysterious submarine—be it a Russian spy or a case of mistaken identity—raises questions about the role of national defense, military spending, and diplomacy in an increasingly complex and unpredictable world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Preserving sugar differs from gelling sugar, also called jam sugar, because the latter contains pectin while preserving sugar is 100% sugar. Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supported by the text: is jam sugar the same as preserving sugar? Choose your answer from: a). no b). yes","output":"a). No Jam sugar and preserving sugar are not the same, as there are differences in their composition, purpose, and usage. The key distinction between these two types of sugars lies in the presence of pectin, a crucial ingredient in determining their functions and outcomes in various food preparations. Preserving sugar is essentially 100% sugar, without any additives or other ingredients. It is primarily used in the preservation of fruits and other food items, where it acts as a sweetening agent and helps in maintaining the texture and quality of the preserved food. Preserving sugar typically consists of larger sugar crystals that dissolve slowly, preventing the formation of foam or scum during the cooking process. This ensures a clearer appearance and even distribution of sugar throughout the finished preserve. It is commonly used in the preparation of simple preserves, pickles, and chutneys, where no additional thickening or gelling agents are required. On the other hand, jam sugar, also known as gelling sugar, contains pectin as one of its primary components. Pectin is a natural carbohydrate found in the cell walls of fruits, and it functions as a gelling agent to help set jams, jellies, and marmalades. When combined with sugar and heated, pectin forms a gel-like structure that is responsible for the thick, spreadable consistency of fruit preserves. Jam sugar usually contains a mixture of sugar and pectin, and may also include additional components like citric acid to help increase acidity and promote the gelling process. This type of sugar is best suited for making jams, jellies, and marmalades from fruits that are low in pectin, as it provides the necessary setting agent for the final product. In conclusion, jam sugar and preserving sugar are not the same. While both types of sugars are used for the preparation of fruit preserves and other food items, the presence of pectin in jam sugar sets it apart from preserving sugar. This key ingredient provides jam sugar with the unique property of promoting the gelling and setting process in the preparation of jams, jellies, and marmalades, while preserving sugar serves as a sweetening agent without any thickening capabilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The user wants to find the value of x which satisfies the equation. Here are the steps to solve it: Step 1: Set up the equation. We have the equation 11x + 1074 = 1085. Step 2: Isolate x. In order to find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 1074 from both sides of the equation, which gives us: 11x = 1085 - 1074. Step 3: Execute the operation on the right side of the equation. Subtracting 1074 from 1085 gives 11. So the equation is now: 11x = 11. Step 4: Divide by the coefficient of x. In order to completely isolate x, we now divide both sides of the equation by 11, the coefficient of x: x = 11 / 11. Step 5: Solve for x. Dividing 11 by 11 gives us 1. Therefore, the solution to the equation 11x + 1074 = 1085 is x = 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Allergens may be inhaled or ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin. Two common causes of allergies are shown in Figure below . Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes.  Now, I have a new situation: A pharmaceutical company is trying to find the cure for allergy. To that end, they conducted an experiment with two groups of subjects, group A and group B.

I joined a club recently where I met a true Indian. I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared?

Inclusion of religious beliefs whether they are conventional or new age are incompatible with the standards of objectivity one would expect in publications involving personal medical matters. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","output":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer appears to express dissatisfaction with the content of the book and questions the author's credibility due to their reliance on occult practices such as astrology and tarot card readings. The fusion of alternative beliefs and personal medical matters seems to be the root cause of the disapproval. The reviewer's main concern is the incompatibility of religious beliefs, whether conventional or new age, with the standards of objectivity expected in publications involving personal medical matters. This concern stems from the belief that incorporating religious or spiritual ideologies into medical discussions could potentially lead to misinformation, bias, or a diluted understanding of the subject matter. The unflattering portrayal of the product is further reinforced by the reviewer's decision to return the book. This action suggests that the content was so bothersome that the reviewer could not continue reading or engaging with the material. Such a strong reaction implies that the book might not meet the expectations of readers who seek objective information on personal medical matters. In summary, the review portrays the product in an unflattering light as it questions the author's credibility and the compatibility of the book's content with an objective approach to personal medical matters. The dissatisfaction expressed by the reviewer and their decision to return the book adds to the negative evaluation of the product.

To do this, let's add 3630 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 3630 = 110*x - 3630 + 3630 3630 = 110*x Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 110 to find the value of x: 3630 / 110 = 110*x / 110 33 = x There you go! The value of x that makes the equation true is 33."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Is electron shielding higher or lower in Sampline?  Hint: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. The answer to this question is:","output":"Electron shielding is higher in Sampline. Step-by-step justification: 1. Timmy is comparing Mardine and Sampline, which are in the same column of the periodic table. 2. Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. 3. The general trend in electronegativity is that it decreases down a column. 4. This decrease in electronegativity is due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. 5. Since Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine, it is a larger atom. 6.

Article:Trailing 1-0 from last week's first leg in Bucharest, Chelsea took the lead on the night through Juan Mata's close-range finish. But a scrambled effort from Vlad Chiriches before the break left Rafael Benitez's side needing two goals. John Terry pulled one back with a header then Torres produced a fine finish before missing a late penalty. After battling back from two goals down against Manchester United last weekend to secure an FA Cup replay, Chelsea were once again made to do it the hard way. But last season's Champions League winners showed plenty of patience to grind Steaua down. John Terry's last nine goals have all been scored at Stamford Bridge. Captain Terry has been used sparingly by Benitez because of an ongoing knee problem and he has not started a Premier League game since 2 February. But his goal set up the comeback before Torres, who only had an FA Cup goal against Brentford to show for his previous 19 games, drove in a third, although there was frustration when he failed to take another chance from the spot. For all the negativity that has surrounded the Stamford Bridge club this season, they still have two chances for silverware. But they had to dig deep to make it past Laurentiu Reghecampf's team. Steaua began with all the confidence of a team 12 points clear at the top of the Romanian table and were unfortunate not to move ahead when Raul Rusescu was played in behind the Chelsea defence only to see his shot turned wide by Petr Cech. The home side finally imposed themselves when a deep cross from Eden Hazard found John Obi Mikel at the far post and his shot was pushed away by Ciprian Tatarusanu. England: Chelsea, Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur Italy: Lazio Portugal: Benfica Russia: Rubin Kazan Switzerland: FC Basel Turkey: Fenerbahce Quarter-final draw to be made on Friday. Just after the half-hour mark they made the breakthrough when Mata drove forward and swapped passes with Ramires before stabbing a shot with enough power to get through Tatarusanu's legs. But in first-half added time, the visitors responded when a Iasmin Latovlevici corner was met by Cristian Tanase, whose shot was pushed on to the woodwork by Cech only for Chiriches to squeeze in at the near post to leave Chelsea needing two goals. Chelsea struggled for fluency at the start of the second period but just before the hour, an unmarked Terry headed in off the post from a Mata free-kick to give the home side hope. Cech was worked again when he palmed away from Alexandru Chipciu's looping effort. But Chelsea came up with a decisive third goal when Mata drifted in from the right and his pass was helped on by Hazard before Torres guided a shot into the corner. With five minutes remaining, Hazard was brought down in the area by Alexandru Bourceanu but Torres hit the bar with the resulting penalty. Full Time   The referee brings the game to a close.

There are two cities, Chien and Marisol, in France that are leaders in the amount of wine they export to the rest of the world. Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation.  Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.

I remember a certain Tuesday, the morning of 18/6/02 to be exact. I was dozed off, trying to convince myself to get out of bed when a horrific explosion was heard. I went to the kitchen where I have a view of several neighborhoods in the southern Jerusalem and saw a pillar of smoke rising from a distant point, the sight of the smoke was followed a minute later by the waling of sirens. I remember rushing to my bedroom, taking out my binoculars, racing back to the kitchen and spotting the image of a glass shattered bus. The bus was still near the pick up station where a terrorist boarded on it and with a single click on a TNT device, murdered 25 passengers, many of whom were on their way to school. The wife of a good friend of mine, sat on the bus at the back row, a seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life. I'm sure that every Israeli has at least one terror-related memory he wishes he never would have had and it was only a matter of time before someone made a film about it. As it turned out, the movie was about to become a repressed memory of its own. The film is about a play-write on a dry run, Haim Buzaglo (portrayed by, hmmm, Haim Buzaglo who also wrote and directed the film) that spends the better part of his day conducting staring contests with his blank word processor page. In the meantime, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli commercial channel, decides to make a piece about a debt ridden ex-army officer. Buzaglo, bored and a bit paranoid due what is medically known as the \\"what on earth this hot babe is dating me\\" syndrome, asks a private eye to conduct a stakeout on his girlfriend. As the detective progresses in his investigation, his observations are permeating into the play and later on, to the lives of its actors. In the meantime, the play metamorphoses from a comic play into an indictment against the aloofness of the Israeli society. As for the movie, well, the movie becomes an exercise in frenzy editing, ensconced in its petty cardboard characters and unreliable dialogs while drifting miles away from the subject it was supposed to deal with in the first place. When I say \\"cardboard characters\\" I refer to the characters that under the writer/director's obsession for a \\"meaningful\\" film, were devoid of any genuine dialogs and any shred of reliability. I won't elaborate too much about it. Suffice to say that I'm sure that homeless barefoot male prostitutes rarely go the theater. With the intention to see a play, that is. This movie, according to Haim Buzaglo himself is the first part of a current agenda trilogy. I sincerely hope that the other two films will be derived from the experiences like the one I wrote about in the beginning of my review as opposed to the secluded world of characters that are anything but existent and a plot that is anything but compelling. 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter. P.S. This movie was a landmark in austerity. It was shot in ten days, all the cast worked for free and the entire cost of the film was about 12,000 (no, I didn't omit a zero or two, twelve thousand dollars).

The only score of the third quarter was a 1-yard quarterback sneak TD by Matt Stafford of the Lions; however the extra point attempt by defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh (an emergency fill-in for injured kicker Jason Hanson, who got run into on the previous field goal attempt which gave them a fresh set of downs) was no good. Early in the fourth quarter, the Lions added to their lead with a Nate Burleson 2-yard TD catch. The Jets responded late in the quarter with a 1-yard TD quarterback sneak by Mark Sanchez. The Jets kicked a field goal to tie it up just before time expired, forcing overtime. The Jets won the toss and kicked a 30-yard field goal for the win as the Lions fell to 2-6.

This is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voice-over that pokes fun at everything French and then produces a rather naif but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Portrayed by the splendid Gerard Philippe, the dashing young man believes utterly in the fate curvaceous Lollobrigida foretells - notably that he will marry King Louis XV's daughter! Problem is, La Lollo soon find outs she too is in love with Fanfan... Propelled by good sword fights, cavalcades, and other spirited action sequences the film moves at a brisk pace and with many comic moments. The direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and takes itself so un-seriously that I could not give those shortcomings a second thought. Look out for Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavy in French films, trying to steal La Lollo, making himself a nuisance, and feeding the script to the fortune teller that reads La Lollo's hand! And what a gem Marcel Herrand is as the megalomanous and lust-driven King Louis XV! That is not all: So many beautiful women in one film makes me wish I were in France and on the set back in 1952! The film may have come out that year but its verve, cheek, superb narration, immaculate photography and the memorable Gerard Philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren let alone to anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular! Do see it! Would you say this review is positive or negative?

How do you say the word in French? In Chinese? In your language? Although people usually know what the word means,it sometimes has no exact translation.It's not surprising,because the idea of home is different from country to country,and from person to person.A home is more than a roof and four walls.It's the cooking,eating,talking,playing and sleeping that go on inside.And at home you usually feel safe and relaxed. Homes look different in different countries.They also have different things inside.For example,in cold northern Europe,there's a fire in the living room or kitchen and all the chairs face it.In the south,where the sun shines a lot and it's more important to keep the heat out,there are small windows and cool stone floors.

Governments of Republic of Turkey since that time have consistently rejected charges of genocide, typically arguing either that those Armenians who died were simply in the way of a war or that killings of Armenians were justified by their individual or collective support for the enemies of the Ottoman Empire. Passage of legislation in various foreign countries condemning the persecution of the Armenians as genocide has often provoked diplomatic conflict. (See Recognition of the Armenian Genocide) Who ruled Turkey when the Armenian genocide happened?","output":"When the Armenian Genocide happened, Turkey was ruled by the Ottoman Empire, specifically under the leadership of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), also known as the Young Turks. The Armenian Genocide took place during World War I, between 1915 and 1923. Three prominent figures known as the \\"Three Pashas\\" were the main architects and ruling triumvirate of the Ottoman Empire during this period. They were: 1. Mehmed Talaat Pasha (1874-1921): Talaat served as the Grand Vizier (equivalent to a Prime Minister) and Minister of Interior during the Armenian Genocide. He played a crucial role in implementing the orders for the deportation and subsequent massacre of the Armenian population. 2. Ismail Enver Pasha (1881-1922): Enver was the Minister of War (equivalent to a Defense Minister) and a military strategist for the Ottoman Empire. He often collaborated with Talaat Pasha in designing policies and proposing actions against the Armenian population. Enver was also instrumental in allying the Ottoman Empire with Germany during World War I. 3. Ahmed Djemal Pasha (1872-1922): Djemal served as the Minister of the Navy and the Governor of Greater Syria, which also included Palestine, Jordan, and Lebanon. He was the third member of the ruling triumvirate and was responsible for implementing the orders of Talaat and Enver Pasha regarding the Armenian Genocide in the regions within his jurisdiction. The Young Turks came into power after the 1908 revolution, which sought to modernize and democratize the Ottoman Empire. However, their initial promise of political and social reforms, including ethnic and religious equality, gradually transformed into an oppressive and nationalist regime that targeted the non-Turkish and non-Muslim populations of the empire. This led to various atrocities, culminating in the Armenian Genocide. During the Armenian Genocide, an estimated 1.5 million Armenians were systematically deported, tortured, and killed as the Ottoman Empire pursued its policy of ethnic cleansing. The genocide began on April 24, 1915, with the arrest and execution of Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in Istanbul, followed by the forced expulsion and mass killings of Armenian men, women, and children throughout the empire. Despite the overwhelming evidence and historical consensus on the Armenian Genocide, subsequent Turkish governments have continued to deny its occurrence and its genocidal intent. The recognition and condemnation of the Armenian Genocide by foreign governments and international institutions remain an ongoing issue today, often straining diplomatic relations between Turkey and other countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","output":"5) Church members - only saved people (Ephesians 2:21; 1 Peter) The phrase refers to the Christian belief that members of the Church consist of those individuals who have been \\"saved,\\" or who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. This belief is supported by verses from the New Testament of the Bible, specifically Ephesians 2:21 and 1 Peter. Ephesians 2:21 (New International Version) states: \\"In whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord.\\" This passage emphasizes that believers in Christ, when unified, form the Church or 'holy temple' that worships God. It suggests that the members of this holy temple are those who have been \\"fitted together\\" by accepting Christ's salvation and coming together in faith. In 1 Peter (the exact verse from which the text is taken is not provided), the author affirms that Christians are being built together into a spiritual house. Given the context of the initial phrase, it is likely referring to 1 Peter 2:5, which reads: \\"You also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.\\" This verse not only reaffirms the concept of believers forming the Church but also introduces the idea of believers becoming a \\"holy priesthood,\\" further embellishing the notion that members of the Church are those who have received salvation through Christ. In summary, the translated phrase \\"Church members - only saved people (Ephesians 2:21; 1 Peter),\\" highlights a fundamental teaching within Christianity emphasizing that the Church comprises those who have been saved through their faith in Jesus Christ. This salvation leads them to become part of a unified 'holy temple' or a 'spiritual house' that worships and serves God according to the teachings of the New Testament."},{"instruction":"Question: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point.

Only certain handguns are true \\"sporting weapons\\", seen as such by the sport's lovers. On the other hand, shooting at tin cans and other small objects in one's backyard is not and should not be considered a serious sport. When uncontrolled, it can be a very dangerous practice. Some opponents   of handgun control have stated that we are out to stop all hunting and that controlling the handgun would severely affect hunting. That is simply untrue. Handgun control would in no way limit the freedom of the true hunter. Few if any hunters consider the handgun an effective hunting weapon. There are a few hunters who do hunt with handguns, but most states place restrictions   on the type of guns that can be used in hunting, the reason is that killing of game should be done in as humane   a way as possible. Some small handguns are more likely to wound the animal rather than kill it at once. Only long guns, rifles and shotguns are effective arms of hunting. People must understand that handguns and hunters are separate matters. Because most of the hunters use a rifle or shotgun, there is no reason why their search for game and sport should be affected by handgun control. Mixing the anti-hunting matter with the handgun matter confuses the killing of animals with killing of people. Question: In the writer's opinion, people should use handguns only when    _    .

Please answer this question: when did the oregon trail game come out?","output":"The Oregon Trail game was first released in 1971, developed by three student teachers, Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger. The game was initially created as an educational tool for an American history course, focused on the 19th century pioneer experience. The Oregon Trail game was designed to teach school children about the realities of 19th-century pioneer life on the Oregon Trail, which was the main route taken by settlers traveling from the Eastern United States to Oregon Territory. The game presented players with various challenges, such as managing resources, facing diseases, and handling unpredictable weather, which were meant to simulate the hardships faced by pioneers during their journey. The initial version of the game was created using the programming language BASIC and was played on a teletype machine. It was shared on the Minneapolis Public School system's timeshare computer system, which allowed the game to spread across other schools in Minnesota. In 1974, Rawitsch joined the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC) and, with the help of its employees, made improvements to the game.  The first major release of the game came in 1978 in the form of a revised, text-based version for the Apple II computer. The Apple II version was distributed by MECC throughout schools in America, gaining wide popularity among educators and students alike. The game underwent several iterations throughout the years, with graphical updates, improved user interfaces, and additional gameplay elements being added. A popular and widely recognized version, The Oregon Trail Deluxe (featuring graphics, sound, and mouse support), was released in 1992 for DOS and Macintosh. The Oregon Trail game brand continued to evolve with time, even getting adaptations for mobile platforms and featuring 3D graphics in more recent installments. Overall, The Oregon Trail game has remained a significant part of American pop culture and education for more than five decades, inspiring a whole generation of learners about the challenges faced by early American pioneers during westward expansion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Legends of the Fall Movie plot: This is a wonderful yet heartrending period piece, as told by an elderly Native American through a collection of family letters he accumulated and saved over time.The right and proper Colonel William Ludlow, (Anthony Hopkins), a veteran of the Native American wars that took place in the late 19th century, has grown tired of the carnage and futility of war. Moreover, he detests the governments and their greed that propagated the battles he has fought. In the opening sequence, the teepees have been struck, the fires, billowing white smoke as they symbolically die out, along with the hope and freedom of \\"the People.\\"At first glance, the viewer might believe he is observing the remnants of the Colonel's last battle. Then a child is seen by his side, and the mood changes as the realization that the look in his eyes is not one of the victor, but that of sadness as he has come to know and respect the People, and forcing them from their home has brought him to his breaking point. He tosses his saber and sheath into the ground in disgust, viewing his humbled former enemy, and turns his back to the camera, and on his former life. The scene is similar to \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" in that the Native Americans, those who survived, are seen defeated and disheartened, abandoning what was once their home. The look on the \\"victorious\\" Colonel's face as he views his one time enemies says it all.Hopkins takes his wife, (Cristina Pickles) three sons, (Brad Pitt, Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas), and trusted Cree guide, One Stab, (excellent perfomance by Gordon Tootoosis, who also narrates), and his family on a quest to \\"lose the madness over the mountains and begin again.\\" Although filmed almost entirely in British Columbia, the setting for the film is the mountains near Helena, Montana. The scenery alone is reason enough to let yourself become lost in this film; temporarily lost from the madness.The story unfolds as the boys are still in their teens, and the youngest of the three, Samuel, (Thomas), is constantly watched over...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: I envy Chris Borland.      My first encounter with Chris was in the fall of 2011, when Penn State faced Wisconsin in what was both of our sophomore seasons. I recall thinking that he was the best linebacker I had ever faced, and throughout my entire collegiate career this held true. Chris was a tough, instinctive, downhill linebacker with great leverage who was never afraid of contact.      These past few days, I’ve heard many opinions on Chris and his decision to retire from the NFL at the age of 24 due to concerns about long-term brain injury. These opinions range from songs of praise calling Chris one of few football players with any sense, to words of derision describing him as soft.      The latter couldn’t be farther from the truth. Chris was one of the toughest football players I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing against.      Naturally, I believe that I have a certain insight into this dilemma, due to my non-athletic pursuits. In particular, I have a Bachelor’s and Master’s in mathematics, all with a 4.0, and numerous published papers in major mathematical journals. I am a mathematical researcher in my spare time, continuing to do research in the areas of numerical linear algebra, multigrid methods, spectral graph theory and machine learning. I’m also an avid chess player, and I have aspirations of eventually being a titled player one day.      It is a simple truth. Playing a hitting position in the NFL can’t possibly help your long-term mental health.      With all of these interests outside of the sport, I am often asked why I play football, how I feel about brain injury, and if that’s something I think about. This question has come up in NFL combine interviews, media interviews, and even in casual conversation with fans or fellow mathematicians. It can range from the very tame “You have such a bright future; aren’t you afraid of hurting your brain?” to the much more direct “You’re a fool for playing football, where are your parents?” I can assure you, I have received both ends of the spectrum and everything in between.      It’s not rude to ask. It’s not some taboo topic that offends. It is a simple truth. Playing a hitting position in the NFL can’t possibly help your long-term mental health. However, it’s also true that how bad such a pursuit is for you is something that, I believe, no one really knows for sure right now.      With that said, why take the risk?      Objectively, I shouldn’t. I have a bright career ahead of me in mathematics. Beyond that, I have the means to make a good living and provide for my family, without playing football. I have no desire to try to accumulate 10 million in the bank; I already have more money in my bank account than I know what to do with. I drive a used hatchback Nissan Versa and live on less than 25k a year. It’s not because I’m frugal or trying to save for some big purchase, it’s because the things I love the most in this world (reading math, doing research, playing chess) are very, very inexpensive.      I’m not playing for the money… I play because I love the game. I love hitting people.      My mother was always supportive of whatever endeavors I wanted to pursue. But this is not the life she wanted for me. I can remember all the way back to when I started playing football in high school. At the end of every season my mother would tell me that I’ve played enough football, that it was okay for me to call it quits. She would tell me that I have such bright things on the horizon, that I don’t need to play. This past fall I finished my 10th season of football, and, as usual, this offseason I had this conversation with my mother for the 10th time.      What my mother and a great majority of my friends, family, and fellow mathematicians don’t understand is that I’m not playing for the money. I’m not playing for some social status associated with being an elite athlete. No, the media has not brainwashed me into thinking this is what real men do.      I play because I love the game. I love hitting people. There’s a rush you get when you go out on the field, lay everything on the line and physically dominate the player across from you. This is a feeling I’m (for lack of a better word) addicted to, and I’m hard-pressed to find anywhere else. My teammates, friends and family can attest to this: When I go too long without physical contact I’m not a pleasant person to be around. This is why, every offseason, I train in kickboxing and wrestling in addition to my lifting, running and position-specific drill work. I’ve fallen in love with the sport of football and the physical contact associated with it.      Simply put, right now, not playing football isn’t an option for me. And for that reason, I truly envy Chris Borland. ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email      John Urschel, an offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens, recently co-authored a paper in the Journal of Computational Mathematics. It is titled \\"A Cascadic Multigrid Algorithm for Computing the Fiedler Vector of Graph Laplacians\\" and apparently includes \\"a cascadic multigrid algorithm for fast computation of the Fiedler vector of a graph Laplacian, namely, the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue.\\" I understand close to none of the words in that sentence, which comes from the paper's abstract. I probably never will. The rest of the study is similarly accessible. See some highlights below:      Urschel, who was drafted in 2014 to block for Joe Flacco, had a 4.0 grade point average at Penn State and has been published in several mathematical journals. He is also an accomplished chess player. For a living, he uses his body as a bulldozer. His family, he says, wonders why he would spend his time in such a way. The answer is, apparently, that he just enjoys leveling people.      Happy Pi Day!!!! Take some time to check out all of its properties and the amazing things it's involved in.

Summarize this article: The series, which became a national talking point when it began in 2000, has been resurrected by Channel 5. In April it was announced that the broadcaster had signed a two-year deal with the show's creators Endemol. Gaining notoriety for Nasty Nick's deceit in the first series, sexual encounters among housemates and romances which were later played out in glossy magazines, the programme was initially a huge hit for Channel 4. But a drop in ratings in recent years led Channel 4's director of television Kevin Lygo to announce in 2009 that the show \\"had reached a natural end point\\". 'Positive and interesting' So why is Channel 5 investing so much time and effort in reviving the format? Bosses are hopeful the programme's reincarnation will attract new audiences to the network. Channel 5 owner Richard Desmond has reportedly had a hands-on role in Big Brother's relaunch In pictures: Big Brother house Big Brother through the years \\"This will allow us to connect to a younger audience, and very importantly, we will continue to serve the viewers who love us,\\" says Jeff Ford, Channel 5's director of programmes. \\"But we're not going to tailor it for a Channel 5 audience because we want all audiences who used to love the show.\\" Speaking at the series launch party in Elstree, where the Big Brother house has been refurbished, he promises fans that the celebrity spin-off of the new series will include only the \\"the biggest, most colourful and interesting names around\\". He says they are focusing on making the programme \\"fun, positive and interesting\\", which reflects the brand values of the channel. 'Ratings gods' Tim Hincks, chief executive of Endemol, says the regular version of the series, which begins immediately after the three-week celebrity series, is going to be \\"entertaining, funny, glamorous and occasionally sexy\\". According to reports, Channel 5 owner Richard Desmond has been closely involved in the preparation for the new show, even selecting contestants himself. The media mogul, who also owns the Daily Star, the Daily Express and OK! magazine, has high hopes for Big Brother, telling the Media Guardian he wants to generate huge ratings of at least 20 million viewers. But how can a show that ran for 10 years and was given a thorough send-off be successfully resurrected? Former Big Brother winner Brian Dowling, who is replacing presenter Davina McCall in the new version, predicts it will be a success because it is \\"missing from people's TV screens\\". The 33-year-old, who won the second series in 2001 and Ultimate Big Brother last year, adds: \\"Let's be honest, Endemol and Channel Five are not spending Â£220m for no good reason. \\"Think about it, Channel 5 is right next to Channel 4 and if people are real fans, they'll watch it regardless of what channel it's on.\\" But some fans are uncertain. Dominic Norwell, 31, from Whitstable in Kent, has watched every series since its inception. By Torin DouglasMedia correspondent, BBC News Can Channel 5 make Big Brother a national talking point again? That depends on whether it has persuaded enough high-profile names to appear on Celebrity Big Brother, the launch pad for the series on its new channel. But more importantly, it depends on coverage in magazines and tabloid newspapers not owned by Richard Desmond. He bought Channel 5 as a way of extending the \\"celebrity\\" focus of his print media empire into TV. Desmond's titles - OK! magazine, the Daily Express, the Daily Star and their Sunday versions - can be relied on to promote Big Brother. So can Channel 5's OK TV! programme, which is relocating to the Big Brother house. The Daily Star proclaims it's the Official Big Brother paper with cover stories and double-page spreads on which celebrities  are tipped to be in or out. But the Sun and the Daily Mirror - which have many more readers - are more interested in ITV's X Factor, \\"counting down\\" to its first show on Saturday. \\"The closure they gave the last series on Channel 4 was too final,\\" he says. \\"To bring it back on a smaller channel is just not going to work. If there's nothing else on, people might migrate over to and flick it on, but it won't be like Channel 4's show where people would plan their Friday nights round the eviction.\\" Media analyst Toby Syfret from Enders Analysis says the success of the programme is \\"immensely important\\" to Channel 5. \\"It's the big buy they have made since last year, there's a lot of money riding on it. \\"There are figures all over the place about what it is worth and with that sort of money they are intending on making a big splash.\\" He says the format - which was broadcast in 87 countries last year - is \\"very important property\\" and could \\"hurt\\" Channel 4 in terms of sales and viewing figures. \\"If you look at the audience trends of Big Brother over the years it's gone down and it is less fashionable for the young than it was some years ago, but it still delivered a very good audience profile. \\"If it's successful it will do the [Channel 5] brand nothing but good.\\" Popular formula Mr Ford is equally confident the show will be a big hit, quoting Kevin Costner's character from the 1989 film Field Of Dreams. \\"If you build it they will come. So we've built it, so obviously because we've built it they're going to come, aren't they? \\"It's in the hands of the ratings gods and I pray to them every night and that's all I can do,\\" he laughs. The ratings formula was not proven when Australian soap Neighbours moved from BBC One to Channel 5 in 2008. The show ended on a Friday and by the following Monday had lost 300,000 viewers. Channel 5's attempt at producing reality TV in the past has not been as successful as its terrestrial counterparts. In 2004 the network launched Back to Reality, which featured stars from other reality shows. The Farm made its debut in the same year, its most memorable moment being Rebecca Loos stimulating a pig for breeding purposes. Neither show was hugely popular, which might explain why producers have decided not to tamper with the successful Big Brother formula. \\"If you were to change the format too much, it wouldn't be Big Brother anymore,\\" says Gavin Henderson, the programme's creative director. He previously worked on the third series of the show, which introduced the late Jade Goody to our screens. A few physical changes will be introduced, he says, which will include a slightly bigger garden and one bedroom instead of two in the Big Brother compound. He adds that there will also be a new approach to editing, which means viewers \\"won't necessarily have to sit and watch it every single day for three months\\". Live streaming of content all day every day has also been replaced with the emphasis now being on following updates on social network sites Twitter and Facebook. No doubt there will be blanket coverage of the show across all of Desmond's publications. But whether that will be enough remains to be seen as channel bosses nervously await the first set of viewing figures on Friday. Celebrity Big Brother begins on Channel 5 on Thursday 18 August at 2100 BST.","output":"Big Brother, a reality TV series that began in 2000, has been resurrected by Channel 5 after a drop in ratings led to its cancellation in 2009.

Information:  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.  - Rodrigues is a autonomous outer island of the Republic of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, about east of Mauritius. It is part of the Mascarene Islands which include Mauritius and Réunion. It is of volcanic origin and is surrounded by coral reef, and just off its coast lie some tiny uninhabited islands. The island used to be the tenth District of Mauritius; it gained autonomous status on 10 December 2002, and it is governed by the Rodrigues Regional Assembly. The capital of the island is Port Mathurin.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - A protectorate, in its inception adopted by modern international law, is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the suzerainty of a greater sovereign state. In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. Therefore, a protectorate remains an autonomous part of a sovereign state. They are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of. However, a state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates.  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - The Mascarene Islands (or Mascarenhas Archipelago) is a group of islands in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar consisting of Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues. The collective title is derived from the Portuguese navigator Pedro Mascarenhas, who first visited them in the early sixteenth century. The islands share a common geologic origin in the volcanism of the Réunion hotspot beneath the Mascarene Plateau and form a distinct ecoregion with a unique flora and fauna.  - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City.  - Modern Standard Hindi (Devanagari:  , \\"Mnak Hind\\") or simply Hindi (Devanagari: , \\"Hind\\"), is an Indian language and a standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language.

Outside India, Hindi is an official language in Fiji, and is a recognised regional language in Mauritius, Suriname, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Politics (from Greek: Politiká: P\\"olitika\\", definition \\"affairs of the cities\\") is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance  organized control over a human community, particularly a state.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants.

It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.  - Colonies in antiquity were city-states founded from a mother-city (its \\"metropolis\\"), not from a territory-at-large. Bonds between a colony and its metropolis remained often close, and took specific forms. However, unlike in the period of European colonialism during the early and late modern era, ancient colonies were usually sovereign and self-governing from their inception.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - The Immigration Depot ( Hindi :   Aapravasi Ghat ) is a building complex located in Port Louis on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius , the first British colony to receive indentured , or contracted , labor workforce from India . From 1849 to 1923 , half a million Indian indentured labourers passed through the Immigration Depot , to be transported to plantations throughout the British Empire . The large - scale migration of the laborers left an indelible mark on the societies of many former British colonies , with Indians constituting a substantial proportion of their national populations . In Mauritius alone , 68 percent of the current total population is of Indian ancestry . The Immigration Depot has thus become an important reference point in the history and cultural identity of Mauritius . Unchecked infrastructural development in the mid- 20th century means that only the partial remains of three stone buildings from the entire complex have survived . These are now protected as a national monument , under the Mauritian national heritage legislation . The Immigration Depot 's role in social history was recognized by UNESCO when it was declared a World Heritage Site in 2006 . The site is under the management of the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund . Conservation efforts are underway to restore the fragile buildings back to their 1860s state .  - In politics and history, a colony is a territory under the immediate political control of a state, distinct from the home territory of the sovereign. For colonies in antiquity, city-states would often found their own colonies. Some colonies were historically countries, while others were territories without definite statehood from their inception.  - The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters.  - The phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" has been used with variations to describe certain global empires that were so extensive that there was always at least one part of their territory that was in daylight.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - A trading post or trading station was a place or establishment where the trading of goods took place; the term is generally used, in modern parlance, in reference to such establishments in historic Northern America, although the practice long predates that continent's colonization by Europeans. The preferred travel route to a trading post or between trading posts, was known as a trade route.  - Mauritius, officially the Republic of Mauritius, is an island nation in the Indian Ocean about off the southeast coast of the African continent. The country includes the island of Mauritius, Rodrigues [ east], and the outer islands (Agaléga, St. Brandon and two disputed territories). The islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues (southwest) form part of the Mascarene Islands, along with nearby Réunion, a French overseas department. The area of the country is 2,040 km. The capital and largest city is Port Louis. Mauritius was a British colonial possession from 1810 to 1968, the year of its independence. The government uses English as the main language.  - Port Louis (Mauritian Creole: \\"Porlwi\\") is the capital city of Mauritius, located in the Port Louis District, the western part also lies in the Black River District. Port Louis is the country's economic, cultural, political centre and most populous city. It is administered by the Municipal City Council of Port Louis. According to the 2012 census conducted by Statistics Mauritius, the population was 149,194.  - History (from Greek , \\"historia\\", meaning \\"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\\") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians.  - Saint Brandon, also known as the Cargados Carajos shoals, is an archipelago comprising a number of sand banks, shoals and islets. It is a group of outer islands belonging to Mauritius and is administered by the Outer Island Development Corporation (OIDC). Saint Brandon is located in the Indian Ocean about 430 km to the northeast of Mauritius. The islands have a total land area of 1.3 km². The reef measures more than 50 km from north to south, and is 5 km wide, cut by three passes. The reef area is 190 km². The islands have a small transient population, mostly fishermen, 63 in number on census night (Census of 2001). The majority of the population (~40) lives on Île Raphael, with smaller settlements existing on Avocaré, Coco, and Île du Sud. A former settlement existed on Albatross Island, but was abandoned in 1988. The islands are rich in flora and fauna. They are classified as a dependency of Mauritius, which is more than 300 km to the south, and are administered from Port Louis. Cargados Carajos is part of the Mascarene Islands.  - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence.  - Réunion (; previously \\"Île Bourbon\\") is an island and region of France in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar and southwest of Mauritius. , it had a population of 844,994. It is the most prosperous island in the Indian Ocean, having the highest GDP per capita in the region.  - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.

Patrick and Angie are then hired by the child's aunt Beatrice (Amy Madigan) to find Amanda and discover that Helene and her boyfriend \\"Skinny Ray\\" (Sean Malone) had recently stolen money from Cheese (Edi Gathegi), a local Haitian drug lord. After Ray is murdered, Patrick and Angie join the police detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) with investigating the case and assist in arranging the trade of money for the return of Amanda. Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) reads Patrick a telephone transcript of the drug lord setting up an exchange for Amanda. The exchange at a nearby quarry in Quincy is botched and it is believed Amanda drowned; her doll is found in the quarry and returned to Helene. Doyle, whose own daughter was killed years before, takes responsibility for the death and goes into early retirement.

What is the answer to this question? apparatus used to determine the volumetric composition of water?","output":"To answer this question, I will first identify the apparatus used and then explain how it works to determine the volumetric composition of water. Step 1: Identify the apparatus The apparatus commonly used to determine the volumetric composition of water is a pycnometer. Step 2: Explain the process of using a pycnometer A pycnometer is a small, calibrated, and airtight glass container with a stopper that has a small hole in it. Here's how it works: 1. First, the empty weight of the pycnometer (with the stopper) is measured and recorded. 2. The pycnometer is then filled with water up to the mark, taking care to remove any trapped air bubbles. 3. The stopper is inserted, and any excess water is wiped off the exterior. 4. The pycnometer (filled with water) is weighed again, and the weight is recorded. 5. To determine the volumetric composition of water, the difference in weight between the filled pycnometer and the empty pycnometer is calculated. This gives the mass of the water. 6. The mass of the water is then divided by the pycnometer's known volume to obtain the density of water. 7. Finally, the density of water can be compared to the standard density at the same temperature to determine if there are any impurities or variations in composition. In summary, the apparatus used to determine the volumetric composition of water is a pycnometer, and it works by measuring the mass of water in a known volume to calculate its density."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Bees find a place for the hive, such as a rock crevice or tree branch - Bees gather nectar from flowers - The bees evaporate the nectar by passing it back and forth to each other - The evaporation turns the nectar into sugary honey - The bees chew the honey until it turns into moldable wax - The bees mold the wax into hexagonal (six sided) cylinders - Thousands of these hexagonal cylinders put together form the hive -   Question: suppose more stormy weather occurs happens, how will it affect Bees will extract less nectar from the flowers.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"B: less Stormy weather can have a significant impact on the ability of bees to extract nectar from flowers. Here's a detailed explanation of how stormy weather affects the bees and their honey production process: 1. Flight difficulties: Bees rely on their ability to fly from one flower to another to gather nectar. Stormy weather conditions, such as strong winds, heavy rain, and lightning, make it difficult for bees to fly and navigate their surroundings. As a result, they may spend less time foraging for nectar or may have to wait for the weather to clear before resuming their nectar-collecting activities. 2. Reduced floral availability: Stormy weather can also reduce the availability of flowers from which bees collect nectar. Heavy rains may wash away or damage flowers, while strong winds can dislodge petals or break off entire blooms. Additionally, lightning may cause fires, destroying plants and their flowers. With fewer flowers available, the bees will have a harder time finding and collecting nectar. 3. Altered nectar quality: Stormy weather can also affect the quality of nectar produced by flowers. Either excessive rainfall may dilute the nectar or lack of sunlight may hinder the production of nectar in flowers. This leads to bees collecting lower-quality or less concentrated nectar, ultimately affecting honey production. 4. Increased energy expenditure: During stormy weather, bees require more energy to maintain their body temperature, fly in difficult conditions, and locate the flowers. This increased energy expenditure could mean that bees have to consume more honey or nectar than usual, leaving less for storage in the hive. 5. Negative impact on bee health: Prolonged exposure to wet, cold, and harsh conditions can have a detrimental effect on the health of bees. Wet and cold bees may suffer from decreased immune system function, increased susceptibility to diseases, and a shortened lifespan. A sick or weak bee population will have a harder time collecting nectar and producing honey. In summary, the occurrence of more stormy weather can lead to bees extracting less nectar from flowers, ultimately affecting honey production. This is due to the challenges stormy conditions pose to both the bees' ability to fly and gather nectar effectively and the availability and quality of nectar sources in their environment. Additionally, bees may experience increased energy demands and health issues during inclement weather, making it harder for them to collect nectar and produce honey."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Using census data for more than one million people in Austria, Denmark and Australia, scientists at the Max Planck Institute in the northern German town of Rostock found the month of birth was related to life expectancy over the age of 50. Seasonal differences in what mothers ate during pregnancy, and infections occurring at different times of the year could both have an impact on the health of a new-born baby and could influence its life expectancy in older age. \\"A mother giving birth in spring spends the last phase of her pregnancy in winter, when she will eat less vitamins than in summer,\\" said Gabriele Doblhammer, one of a team of scientists who carried out the research. \\"When she stops breast-feeding and starts giving her baby normal food, it's in the hot weeks of summer when babies are prone  to infections of the digestive system.\\" In Austria, adults born in autumn (October-December) lived about seven months longer than those born in spring (April-June), and in Denmark adults with birthdays in autumn outlived those born in spring by about four months. In the southern hemisphere, the picture was similar. Adults born in the Australian autumn--the European spring--lived about four months longer than those born in the Australian spring. The study focused on people born at the beginning of the 20th century, using death certificates and census data. Although nutrition at all times of the year has improved since then, the seasonal pattern persists, Doblhammer said. But on the other hand, according to a study of more 40,000 people, those born in spring and summer report themselves luckier than those born in autumn or winter. Professor Richard Wise-man who led the research explained that the temperature at the time of birth might influence the development of the brain and seasonal factors make a difference as well.

Q: What term describes a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid?   Choices:  - mix  - suspension  - compound  - emulsion  A: Answer:","output":"The term that describes a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid is an \\"emulsion\\". In this context, an emulsion refers to the process of combining two immiscible substances (i.e., substances that don't mix with each other) by dispersing one substance within the other in the form of very small droplets or particles. This process requires the presence of an emulsifying agent, which allows the formation of a stable and homogeneous mixture. To further understand the given choices: - Mix: A mix refers to a simple combination of two or more substances without any specific interaction between them. These substances can be easily separated, and they don't necessarily create a homogeneous mixture. In other words, a mix can be a general term, but it doesn't provide the specific characteristics of an emulsion. - Suspension: A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which solid particles are dispersed in a liquid medium. These particles tend to settle over time due to gravity, and the mixture can be easily separated by mechanical means like filtration. Unlike an emulsion, a suspension doesn't involve liquids in both phases, and the mixture is not stable. - Compound: A compound is a substance that consists of two or more different elements chemically bonded together. Compounds have distinct chemical and physical properties compared to their constituent elements and cannot be separated by physical means. This term doesn't apply to the scenario of a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid. In conclusion, the term that best describes a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid is an \\"emulsion.\\" An emulsion represents a unique mixture type that combines two immiscible substances in a stable and homogeneous state due to the presence of an emulsifying agent."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given the following context:  After her sister Olga marries and leaves home, Katrin Koerber, the daughter of an Austrian medical professor, fights loneliness and dreams of a more exciting life outside Austria.

PUBLISHED:. 07:27 EST, 1 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 20:47 EST, 1 November 2013. Millions of families could benefit from a crackdown on water bills, as David Cameron tries to seize back the cost of living agenda. Ministers will announce a package of measures to shake up the market next week, to ensure customers get a ‘good deal’. While households have no choice over their water supplier, it is expected to include more discounts or ‘social tariffs’ for pensioners and the low paid. This would also help reduce the soaring burden of bad debts – worth around £1.6billion a year – which firms currently add to the water bills of other households. Bills: David Cameron, pictured on a visit to the M4 outside Cardiff today, has ordered ministers to draw up action on water charges. Unlike energy firms, whose prices are. hiked every year by the Big Six firms, annual water bills, currently an. average of £388 per family, are set in advance by industry regulator. Ofwat. But water firms have been criticised. for using legal loopholes to avoid £1billion of corporation tax, and. paying millions of pounds in bonuses to their executives during last. year’s hosepipe ban. The move comes as Labour leader Ed. Miliband called for the water industry to be ‘scrutinised’ to ensure it. is not ripping off customers. The coalition has been stung by claims it has failed to act on easing the squeeze on family finances, with Mr Miliband taking the lead with his promise to freeze gas and electricity bills for two years if he wins the next election. But today Number 10 insisted Mr Cameron ‘wants to see household costs coming down’ and targeting the water industry will be the next stage. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has already offered water customers in the South West a £50 rebate to tackle historically high bills. However, the new action to be set out by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is likely to offer help to customers across England with the details expected to be agreed this weekend. Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘Clearly the Prime Minister wants to see household costs coming down. ‘There will be some progress next week which Defra will be doing on the water industry and water bills.’ The government had already taken. action to freeze council tax bills, limit rail fare rises and cancel. increases in the cost of MoTs, he added. Water. watchdog Ofwat is preparing to block an eight per cent rise in charges. demanded by Thames Water for next year, which would add an extra £28 to. the average bill. The No.10. spokesman added: ‘The Prime Minister wants regulators there to look at. the industries they regulate and make sure that they are as robust and. delivering what they need to deliver for customers. ‘The Prime Minister realises that families are hard-pressed. He wants to see prices brought down across the board.’ Options being considered include making social tariffs for the poorest customers compulsory, capping fare rises to an amount linked to inflation and cutting the bad debt caused by customers who refuse to pay which adds £15-a-year to every bill. Costs: The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is to rush out action to limit water bill rises in an attempt to take back control of political debate over the cost of living. Details of the action on water bills are expected to be announced in the middle of next week, with Downing Street denying it had been caught on the hop by Mr Miliband. Chancellor George Osborne signalled the government's plans in a speech last month when he said: 'There are important improvements we can make to the scale of energy and water bills, the cost of housing, the fees paid for everyday financial services, the expense of rail and road travel. 'These are a burden on families – and we are doing everything we can do to reduce their cost – with more to come this autumn.' But Mr Miliband appeared to steal a march on the government yesterday with his warning that the industry could not escape scrutiny at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet. Warning: The government actions comes after Labour leader Ed Miliband said the water industry should be next to face more scrutiny. ‘I think we should be looking at all markets to make sure they are working  properly and that includes the water industry,’ he told the Western Morning News yesterday. ‘Some people will say this is an anti-business agenda. I think it is a pro-business agenda that you have got to reform markets that are not working properly. ‘I think the water industry is something that should be scrutinised to make sure it is working properly and make sure it is working properly for the benefit of consumers, because I know concerns have been raised. ‘I'm proud Labour is championing this agenda and I think it is consistent with believing what a market economy can do, and water is part of that.’ A Defra Spokesperson said: 'The Government is working across the board to reduce the cost of living and help hardworking households who are feeling the pinch. 'We want to ensure customers get a good deal from the water sector and will be setting out our approach next week.' Maria Eagle, Labour's shadow environment secretary said: 'David Cameron has never shown any interest in rising water bills and has wasted three years doing absolutely nothing to address the impact on already over-burdened family budgets. 'More than two million households, over one in ten, now spend more than five per cent of their income on water according to the regulator and customers in Britain face some of the highest bills in Europe. 'Yet David Cameron still refuses to require water companies to introduce a social tariff to help those who are struggling, even though only three companies have introduced such a scheme under the current voluntary arrangement. 'That’s why Labour will use the forthcoming Water Bill legislation to require all water companies to participate in a national affordability scheme and review whether there is a need for a tougher regulatory regime.' It comes after figures this week showed the squeeze on family budgets has lasted for four years and shows no sign of coming to an end, grim new figures revealed today. Disposable incomes have remained almost unchanged since the end of the recession, with the return to economic growth having little impact on ordinary people’s spending power. Instead bills for life’s essentials like housing, energy and petrol have dramatically eaten into incomes, and now account for more than 27 per cent of all spending. The Office for National Statistics warned the economic position of households ‘remains under pressure’. Disposable incomes grew even when Britain was plunged into recession in mid-2008, but have remained ‘broadly flat’ since the summer of 2009, despite the economy growing by 4.2 per cent since then. In particular big rises in energy bills have had a devastating impact on families. Highlights:","output":"1. Millions of families could benefit from a crackdown on water bills, as UK Government aims to shake up the market, ensuring customers get a 'good deal.' 2. The plan is expected to include more discounts or 'social tariffs' for pensioners and the low paid, reducing the £1.6 billion burden of bad debts added to other households' water bills. 3. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is set to help customers across England with details expected to be agreed upon soon. 4. Options being considered include making social tariffs for the poorest customers compulsory, capping fare rises linked to inflation, and cutting bad debt caused by customers who refuse to pay. 5. Labour leader Ed Miliband has called for the water industry to be 'scrutinised' to ensure customers are not being ripped off."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This phrase suggests that although there might be some achievement or success attained, it may not necessarily be without its darker aspects or cause for concern. The overall impact of this sentiment brings a sense of complexity and depth, making it more intriguing for readers or audience members to interpret. Breaking down the sentiment further: 1. \\"A quiet\\": The use of the word \\"quiet\\" might imply a discreet or low-profile victory or accomplishment. It suggests that the success in question was not ostentatious or vociferous, but rather achieved with a level of humility or finesse. This could be construed as a positive aspect, as it might reflect resilience, determination or hard work that is not conditioned or motivated by public adulation. 2. \\"Disquieting\\": The term \\"disquieting,\\" on the other hand, implies an element of unease, anxiety, or discomfort associated with this triumph. It suggests that the accomplishment or its consequences might evoke feelings of apprehension or suspicion in some individuals. This word infuses the sentiment with a shade of negativity, as it alludes to potential undesirable outcomes or risks related to the success. When both words are combined to form the phrase \\"a quiet, disquieting triumph,\\" the sentiment takes on a somewhat paradoxical nature. It represents a subtle, yet uneasy sense of achievement where the potential drawbacks or concerns cannot be ignored or discounted.  In a broader context, this sentiment could apply to various scenarios, such as a person conquering a personal challenge while simultaneously struggling with lingering self-doubt or moral dilemmas. Alternatively, it might refer to the outcome of a political situation, where a leader's victory could be seen as positive but the means to achieving it have created unease among the public. Overall, the sentiment of \\"a quiet, disquieting triumph\\" can be perceived as an intriguing blend of understated positivity and unsettling disturbance that reflects the complexities and dualities inherent in human experiences, achievements, and emotions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - tsunamis  - earthquakes  - droughts  - hurricanes  A: The answer is:","output":"- hurricanes Hurricanes are weather events that move with the prevailing winds and originate in the trade winds in the northern hemisphere. They form in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Earth, where the warm ocean waters provide the moisture and heat needed for their development. These storms are also known as tropical cyclones or typhoons, depending on the region where they occur. The term \\"hurricane\\" is used for these storms in the Atlantic Ocean and the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The trade winds are steady easterly winds that blow mainly in the tropics, specifically between 30 degrees north and 30 degrees south latitude. In the northern hemisphere, the trade winds blow from the northeast to the southwest, while in the southern hemisphere, they blow from the southeast to the northwest. The Coriolis effect, caused by the rotation of the Earth, helps to steer the trade winds in their respective directions. Hurricanes form when warm, moist air over the ocean rises and creates an area of low pressure at the surface. This causes the surrounding air to rush into the center, creating a spiraling motion as the air is forced upward. The warm air cools as it rises, causing the moisture in the air to condense into clouds and release heat energy. This heat energy warms the surrounding air, causing it to rise further and creating a cycle of rising warm air and cooling, condensing air. As this cycle continues, the storm system strengthens and starts to organize into a more defined structure. The trade winds play a significant role in the formation and movement of hurricanes in the northern hemisphere. These easterly winds steer the developing storms from the east to the west, generally towards the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm system moves along the path of the trade winds, it encounters areas of warmer ocean waters, which help to fuel its growth and intensify its strength. When conditions are favorable, such as low vertical wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, these disturbances can rapidly develop into massive and powerful storms. As hurricanes grow in strength, they move with the prevailing winds, which is largely influenced by the trade winds and other global wind patterns, such as the jet stream. These steering winds help to determine the path a hurricane will take, as well as its movement speed. As the hurricane moves across the ocean, it can cause widespread destruction through its heavy rainfall, strong winds, and storm surges. The other choices - tsunamis, earthquakes, and droughts - do not fit the criteria of weather events that move with prevailing winds and are associated with the trade winds in the northern hemisphere. Tsunamis are caused by the displacement of water due to underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, while earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates and have no direct connection to weather processes. Droughts, on the other hand, refer to prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, which can indirectly be influenced by global wind patterns. However, they are not considered discrete weather events that originate and move with the trade winds specifically."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I don't journey over to Willy St. as much as I would like, but when I do find myself on that side of Madison the Weary is always my first choice for dinner and drinks with friends.  Back in college I first heard of this place from a coworker who lived in the area.  He told me in no uncertain terms that I needed to come out after work for a few drinks and a late dinner, and I'm happy that I took him up on the offer.  Since then I've made my way back on a semi-regular basis.  The best times at the Weary are when you come in and find a nice larger table right away, especially if you can get one of the corner tables.  The place is almost always crowded, a victim of its own success in a way, and there are no reservations or waiting lists, just first-come first-serve.  As mentioned, there really isn't a good place to wait, and if you end up here crammed in the corner of the bar hoping for a table to open it can be a frustrating experience.  I don't think I've gone on a Friday or Saturday night in some time because of this, instead opting for weekday nights or later in the afternoons.  It's a testament to how good this place is that I find myself working my schedule around their busy times.  The Weary hits all of the right notes: the food is exceptional, the tap selection is top-notch, and the vibe hits the right tone of hip and mellow.  I've made my way through at least half of the relatively short menu, though I've been here more than enough times to try everything at least once over.  I've been prevented from doing so by the extreme excellence of the West of the Andes sandwich - possibly my favorite in all of Madison.  I usually get the tenderloin option (also comes with tuna or veggies), served with avocado, pico de gallo and chipotle mayo.  It's simply the best.  Also great: the Weary's Reuben - probably the best I've ever had, and the Bad Breath burger, which is as great as everyone says.  The goulash is what I tend to go with when I'm looking for a smaller meal, and even then it's filling.  There's a vegan chili as well, which I usually go Not-So and get with beef tips and bacon.  And if you're there with a good sized group of friends you can't go wrong with either the WI cheese & sausage platter or the Mediterranean plate.  I love the Weary Traveler and I've spent many a great night over the last five plus years with friends and family - in fact the Weary is my father's favorite Madison restaurant on account of the goulash.  The place is near perfect, and a consistent option for just about any occasion.","output":"This review is very positive and happy.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -11*z - 6*z - 85 = 0 for z.","output":"Okay, kiddo. Let's make this really simple!  So, we have -11*z and -6*z. These are like two baskets of apples having -11 and -6 apples respectively. If we put all apples together, we end up having -17 apples in total or in math language, -17*z. The equation now looks like: \\"-17*z - 85 = 0\\" To make it easy, let's say we owe our friend 17 candies for every 'z' and we just borrowed 85 more candies. In total, we owe them 17*z and 85 candies. Now, we want to find how many candies 'z' stands for, if all the candies we owe in total brings us to zero. To figure this out, we need to move the 85 candies to the other side of the \\"=\\". This makes the 85 change from negative to positive, because if we're giving back candies, we're bringing the amount we owe closer to zero. So, now our equation would look like \\"-17*z = 85\\" Here, z will be equal to 85 divided by -17, since dividing is like separating all the candies equally among our 'z' friends. Finally, when we divide 85 by -17, we get -5.  So, in our case 'z' is equal to -5. That means, we owe each friend 5 candies to get to zero.  I hope that makes sense!

The boy tried lots of different medicines to cure his pimples but the","output":"pimples never seemed to go away. He was always in search for a miracle treatment that would give him clear, smooth skin. The journey to find a cure for his acne-prone skin began when he was just a teenager, and his frustration grew with each passing year. Daily, he would wake up and scrutinize his face in the mirror, looking for any signs of improvement. Despite his efforts, the pimples persisted, sometimes even worsening. He felt embarrassed and self-conscious about his appearance, and it took a toll on his self-esteem. He started avoiding social gatherings and withdrew from activities that he once enjoyed. His friendships began to suffer as he began to isolate himself, unable to bear the burden of constantly feeling judged because of his skin. During his quest, the boy tried several over-the-counter creams, gels, and lotions that claimed to target pimples and clear up acne. He spent hundreds of dollars on different products, hoping to find the one that finally worked. Many times, he believed he had found the ideal solution, only to be disappointed a few weeks later when the pimples returned – sometimes worse than before. In pursuit of his goal, the boy ventured deeper into the realm of skincare. He researched natural remedies and homemade concoctions, hunting for a more permanent and less expensive answer. He experimented with ingredients like honey, lemon, and tea tree oil, and even changed his diet in an attempt to pinpoint any food triggers. He learned about the importance of maintaining a clean face, avoiding excessive sun exposure, and staying hydrated.  As he continued his journey, the boy turned to healthcare professionals for advice and guidance. He consulted dermatologists and estheticians, discussing with them his extensive history of failed treatments. They prescribed an array of treatments, from topical medications, like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, to oral prescriptions, such as antibiotics and even isotretinoin. Some of these medications seemed to help initially, but they often came with unpleasant side effects, including dry skin and irritation. His search for a solution continued. By the time the boy had reached young adulthood, he felt as though he had tried everything. He was beginning to lose hope that he would ever find a cure for his pimples. Some nights, he would sit alone in his bedroom, filled with despair and wondering if he was destined to live his life hidden away from the world. One day, while browsing the internet, he stumbled upon a blog that detailed a young woman’s similar struggle with acne. She described how, after years of trial and error, she had discovered a holistic approach to skincare that had transformed her skin completely. Intrigued, the boy delved deeper, consumed by this newfound knowledge he had been missing out on. He learned about the importance of looking at his skin as a reflection of his overall health. The blog emphasized the connection between stress, hormones, gut health, and inflammation in relation to acne. Realizing he had never considered these factors in his quest for clear skin, the boy began to develop a better understanding of his own body. Armed with this new insight, the boy embarked on a journey of self-discovery. He started to make changes to his lifestyle, focusing on reducing stress, improving his diet, and exercising regularly. He began to meditate and practice mindfulness, connecting with his emotions and learning how to manage his anxiety and tension. Slowly but surely, the boy noticed a change. His pimples began to heal and his skin's texture improved. He gained a newfound confidence and started to reconnect with the world that he'd shut out for so long. The journey to finding a cure for his pimples had been long and challenging, but through it all, the boy gained valuable knowledge about his body, his health, and what true confidence meant – and in the end, his journey proved to be worthwhile, both on the outside and within."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Our family members have to bunch up to get into the picture captured by the camera on my laptop computer. Sound and picture quality is a constant hassle. And it would be nice to display video on our big TV without having to fuss with video cables. When I tried Warpia's ConnectHD, I got a videoconferencing experience that was much improved on all counts. For one thing, it's wireless.

The picture and sound travel from a tiny USB dongle that plugs into your computer to a combination receiver-and-camera that can park above your TV screen. An HDMI cable connects the receiver to the TV, and it stays put. You don't have to string cables every time you want to have a video call on the TV. And the wireless connection supports the high-definition 1080p format, so the picture is always clean and clear. The lens in the ConnectHD camera has a wide-angle view. That means everyone on your end of the conversation can get in the picture without bumping heads. I set up the ConnectHD system in our kitchen using our 26-inch LCD TV and a Windows netbook computer. I installed Warpia's software and had everything working in about 15 minutes. The camera's view took in the kitchen's center island and most of the rest of the room, and its built-in microphone picked up everyone's voices. Nobody had to crowd around the TV or shout to be heard. Incoming audio also sounded much better coming from the TV than when we did Skype calls on the computer with its tiny (and tinny) speakers.

Martha and the Vandellas (known from 1967 to 1972 as Martha Reeves and the Vandellas) were an American all-female vocal group formed in 1957. The group achieved fame in the 1960s with Motown. Selected Members of the group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Formed in 1957 by friends Annette Beard, Rosalind Ashford and Gloria Williams, the group eventually included Martha Reeves, who moved up in ranks as lead vocalist of the group after Williams' departure in 1962. Teenagers Rosalind Ashford and Annette Beard first became acquainted after a local music manager hired them to be members of a girl group he named The Del-Phis. Ashford & Beard, along with then-lead vocalist Gloria Williams, performed at local clubs, private events, church benefits, YMCA events and school functions. They were also being coached by Maxine Powell at Detroit's Ferris Center. One of the group's first professional engagements was singing background for singer Mike Hanks.  The group originally had up to six members, shortened to four. After another member left the group, she was replaced by Alabama-born vocalist Martha Reeves, who had been a member of a rival group, the Fascinations and had also been a member of another group, the Sabre-Ettes. In 1960, the group signed their first recording contract with Checker Records, releasing the Reeves-led \\"I'll Let You Know\\". The record flopped. The group then recorded for Checkmate Records, a subsidiary of Chess Records, recording their first take of \\"There He Is (At My Door)\\". That record, featuring Williams on lead vocals, also flopped.  Briefly separated, Reeves returned to a solo career performing under the name Martha LaVaille, in hopes of getting a contract with emerging Detroit label Motown. After Motown staffer Mickey Stevenson noticed Reeves singing at a prominent Detroit club, he offered her his business card for an audition. Reeves showed up at Motown on a wrong date (Motown auditions were held at Thursdays, while Reeves showed up to Motown's Hitsville USA studios on a Tuesday). Stevenson, initially upset, told Reeves to look out for clients and other matters. Soon Reeves became Stevenson's secretary and later was responsible for helping acts audition for the label. By 1961, the group, now known as The Vels, were recording background vocals for Motown acts. Prior to her success as lead singer of The Elgins, Sandra Edwards (then going by her surname Maulett) recorded the song \\"Camel Walk\\", in 1962, which featured the Vels in background vocals. That year, the quartet began applying background vocals for emerging Motown star Marvin Gaye, singing on Gaye's first hit single, \\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\\" After Mary Wells failed to make a scheduled recording session feigning a short illness, the Vels recorded what was initially a demo recording of \\"I'll Have to Let Him Go\\". Motown was so impressed by the group's vocals - and Martha's lead vocals in the song - that the label CEO Berry Gordy offered to give the group a contract. Figuring that being in show business was too rigorous, Williams opted out of the group. With Williams out, the remaining trio of Ashford, Beard and Reeves renamed themselves The Vandellas, after Detroit's Van Dyke Street and Reeves' favorite singer, Della Reese.","output":"This text is about Martha and the Vandellas, an American all-female vocal group formed in 1957.

Write an article with the title: \\"No scrubs, please.\\"","output":"Title: No Scrubs, Please Introduction: Many of us have heard the term \\"scrub\\" before, referring to an individual who may seem lazy, unambitious, or downright disrespectful. In this article, we will explore what it means to be a scrub, why it is important to avoid such behaviors, and how to cultivate better habits for personal and professional success. Let's dive into the world of no scrubs, please! Step 1: Define a scrub A scrub is a term that is often used to describe a person who lacks motivation, confidence, or respect for others. They may have poor social skills and demonstrate behaviors that are detrimental to their well-being or the well-being of those around them. It is important to recognize these traits in ourselves and others to ensure that we are promoting a positive and progressive environment. Step 2: Identify the reasons behind scrub behavior In order to combat scrub behaviors, it is important to first understand the reasons behind them. Scrubs may develop their habits due to various factors, including upbringing, social influences, or personal insecurities. Once we identify the root causes of these behaviors, it becomes easier to cultivate better habits and foster personal growth. Step 3: Highlight the consequences of scrub behavior Scrubs can inflict harm not only on themselves but also on the people around them. By displaying laziness, negativity, and disrespect, they may prevent themselves from reaching their full potential and hinder the growth of their peers. Additionally, scrub behaviors can lead to negative consequences in work and social settings, such as being passed up for job opportunities or facing social isolation. Step 4: Encourage self-reflection One of the most effective ways to address scrub behavior is through self-reflection. This means honestly evaluating one's own actions, attitudes, and beliefs to identify and rectify any areas where poor habits may be present. It's important to take personal responsibility for our behaviors and strive for continuous self-improvement. Step 5: Promote positive and respectful habits In order to move away from scrub behavior, it is essential to develop positive habits that foster personal and professional success. This includes practicing active listening, showing respect for others' opinions and beliefs, and fostering a growth mindset. These habits will not only benefit the individual but also contribute to a more positive and supportive environment. Step 6: Always maintain accountability Finally, it is important to always maintain accountability for one's actions and acknowledge when scrub-like behaviors may have resurfaced. This process of self-awareness and responsibility will ensure that individuals continue to grow and progress in their personal journeys toward better habits and attitudes. Conclusion: In conclusion, by understanding the nature of scrubs and the reasons behind their behaviors, we can actively work to avoid them and promote a more positive environment. Through self-reflection, accountability, and cultivating positive habits, we can all move away from the scrub mentality and contribute to a world in which respect and growth are prioritized.

Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What village's first Boy Scout troop was Troop 1 Briarcliff, founded before 1919? ?  The village symbol is the Briarcliff Rose, a more brightly colored offshoot of the American Beauty rose. Since 2006, the Briarcliff Rose has been used on village street signs. The Briarcliff Manor Garden Club, which also uses the Briarcliff rose as their symbol, was established in 1956. One of its primary functions is in planting, maintaining, and improving public gardens and grounds.Briarcliff Manor has groups in several Scouting organizations, including Cub Scout Pack 6 and Boy Scout Troop 18. Pack 6 became the first Cub Scout pack in the village at its establishment in 1968; by 2002 it had over 70 cubs in 12 dens. The village's first Boy Scout troop was Troop 1 Briarcliff, founded before 1919. Sources cite Bill Buffman as the first Scoutmaster and John Hersey as the troop's first Eagle Scout. The first Girl Scout troop in the village was founded in 1917 by Louise Miller and Mrs. Alfred Jones, and the first Brownie troop was founded in 1929.The Briarcliff Manor Community Bonfire is a winter holiday event at Law Park, hosted by the village and the Briarcliff Friends of the Arts, involving live music (primarily seasonal and holiday songs), refreshments, and craft projects for children. Another annual community event is the Memorial Day parade, a tradition in Briarcliff Manor for more than fifty years. Before the parade begins, the Municipal Building's bell is rung to commemorate firefighters who have died in the previous year; the parade ends at the village's war memorial in Law Park, where wreaths are laid on the monument. The holiday has been celebrated in the village since the early 1900s, though initially involving large family picnics, with parades reserved for the Fourth of July. The answer is:","output":"The village whose first Boy Scout troop was Troop 1 Briarcliff, founded before 1919, is Briarcliff Manor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: You’ll be able to find the proper size for your underwear across brands if you know your waist and hip measurements. Use a tape measure to measure your natural waist and the fullest part of your hips so you can choose the most comfortable size for your body.  You can find your natural waist by bending sideways. A crease will form at your waist to help you identify it. Keep the tape measure parallel to the ground when you measure your hips. It’s a good idea to measure both your waist and hips twice to make sure that you get the same measurement both times. Once you have your waist and hip measurements, you can consult the sizing information for any underwear you’re considering to ensure a proper fit.  Checking your measurement is important, because sometimes you don't get it right the first time. If your measurements are different on the second try, measure them a third time. One of these sets should match up, so use that set of measurements when shopping. No one wants to be pulling at their underwear all day to keep it from slipping or falling down. Choose underwear that has firm elastic in the waistband so you know it will stay in place. While firm elastic at the waist is helpful in underwear, avoid styles with elasticized leg holes. They have a tendency to bunch up, which can be uncomfortable. Underwear that’s too tight doesn’t just lead to unflattering bulges and lumps beneath your clothing; it can also cause skin chafing and irritation from the friction. In general, any underwear that’s tight enough to leave marks on your skin is too tight. Underwear that’s too tight also doesn’t breathe as well, so it can lead to health issues and leave you a little sweaty. Before leaving the house for the day, it’s important to make sure that your undies are lying smoothly against your body. Any pair that bunches, rolls, or sags under your clothing is going to be uncomfortable because you’ll be tugging at them to keep them from pinching your skin or falling down.  Not only can bunching underwear be uncomfortable in the long run, but it can also look messy and ruin even the best outfit. This is especially important with dresses and skirts! If your underwear is bunching, readjust it so that it sits properly on you. If it still bunches, switch to a different pair. Bunching, rolling, and sagging is often a sign of old, worn underwear; it means that the fabric has lost its stretch and is now too big for you. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: To find the proper size for your underwear across different brands, measure your natural waist and hips using a tape measure.

Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm.  He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre.  Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained.  Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece.  In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.

Answer:","output":"I would say the right answer to the question \\"what keeps mammals warm?\\" is a combination of both \\"animal fur\\" and a \\"layer of fat under the skin.\\" While it is true that many mammals have a layer of fat under their skin to help insulate and retain body heat, fur also plays a crucial role in maintaining their body temperature. Animal fur consists of two main layers: the undercoat and the guard hairs. The undercoat is the dense, insulating layer that traps air close to the body, creating a warm barrier to help prevent heat loss. The guard hairs are the longer, waterproof, and often oil-covered hairs that protect the undercoat and help repel moisture. Together, these two layers create an effective insulation system that helps maintain the mammal's body temperature in cold environments. Furthermore, the layer of fat under the skin acts as an additional layer of insulation, not only conserving body heat but also providing an energy source during periods of food scarcity. This layer is particularly beneficial for marine mammals, such as whales and seals, living in cold aquatic environments where losing heat quickly can be a significant threat to survival. In conclusion, both animal fur and a layer of fat under the skin contribute to keeping mammals warm, with each playing a crucial role in maintaining the mammal's body temperature and overall survival in cold environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Let's say you're working with the following problem: Y =√(x-7) You cannot take the square root of a negative number, though you can take the square root of 0. So, set the terms inside the radicand to be greater than or equal to 0. Note that this applies not just to square roots, but to all even-numbered roots. It does not, however, apply to odd-numbered roots, because it is perfectly fine to have negatives under odd roots. Here's how: x-7 ≧ 0 Now, to isolate x on the left side of the equation, just add 7 to both sides, so you're left with the following: x ≧ 7 Here is how you would write it: D = [7,∞) Let's say you're working with the following function: Y = 1/√( ̅x2 -4). When you factor the denominator and set it equal to zero, you'll get x ≠ (2, - 2). Here's where you go from there:  Now, check the area below -2 (by plugging in -3, for example), to see if the numbers below -2 can be plugged into the denominator to yield a number higher than 0. They do. (-3)2 - 4 = 5  Now, check the area between -2 and 2. Pick 0, for example. 02 - 4 = -4, so you know the numbers between -2 and 2 don't work.  Now try a number above 2, such as +3. 32 - 4 = 5, so the numbers over 2 do work.  Write the domain when you're done. Here is how you would write the domain: D = (-∞, -2) U (2, ∞) Summary:","output":"The article discusses finding the domain of functions with roots or radicals. For even-numbered roots, the terms inside the radicand must be greater than or equal to 0, while odd-numbered roots can have negatives. Two examples are given.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What views does Scout contend with?\\" is in \\"Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The views that Scout contends with in Harper Lee's novel, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" revolve around societal expectations and prejudices, particularly in regards to gender roles, racism, and classism. As Scout grows up and tries to understand the world around her, she encounters various female characters who help shape her development and attitudes towards these issues. Scout primarily identifies with her father, Atticus Finch, and older brother, Jem. This allows her to observe female characters from both an outsider's perspective and as a female herself. She is influenced by strong, independent, and protective women like Calpurnia and Miss Maudie. These characters serve as positive role models for Scout, demonstrating strength and resilience in the face of societal expectations and prejudices. On the other hand, Scout also encounters female characters who represent and uphold more traditional beliefs, such as racist and classist attitudes. For instance, Mayella Ewell's false testimony against Tom Robinson, an innocent black man, exemplifies the destructive power of racial prejudice. Scout also faces criticism about not adhering to traditional gender roles from Mrs. Dubose, who chastises her for not wearing a dress and camisole, and accuses her of ruining the family name by not doing so. Mrs. Dubose also questions and insults Atticus' decision to defend Tom Robinson. By experiencing these various perspectives and influences, Scout begins to develop a sense of independence and ultimately embodies feminist ideals. She learns to question and challenge the societal norms related to gender, race, and class, adopting a more progressive and open-minded worldview. Through the character of Scout, Harper Lee gradually showcases her journey towards becoming a feminist in the South, as she maintains her ambivalence about being a Southern lady and navigates the complexities of societal expectations and prejudices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A scientist studied the effects of alcoholic beverages on the human body during severe weather exposure. He decided to experiment on himself. He stood in -30 degrees weather for 2 hours and called it experiment A. He then repeated the experiment, the only difference being that he consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during those two hours, and that was called experiment B.  When did the person have a lower core temperature, during experiment A, or during B? Answer:","output":"To determine when the person had a lower core temperature, during experiment A or B, we need to consider the effects of alcohol on the human body and the specific conditions of each experiment.  Step 1: Understand the conditions of the experiments - Experiment A: the scientist is exposed to -30 degrees weather for 2 hours without consuming alcohol. - Experiment B: the scientist is exposed to the same conditions (-30 degrees for 2 hours) but consumes a pint of hard liquor before and during the experiment. Step 2: Analyze the effects of alcohol on the human body - Alcohol causes blood vessels to dilate, which increases blood flow to the skin's surface. This can create a feeling of warmth. - The increased blood flow to the skin's surface combined with the cold weather could lead to a faster loss of body heat in experiment B. Step 3: Compare the two experiments  - In experiment A, the scientist is exposed to cold temperatures but does not consume alcohol. Therefore, there is no alcohol-induced dilation of the blood vessels, and the body loses heat at a more controlled rate. - In experiment B, the scientist consumes alcohol, which may cause the body to lose heat faster due to increased blood flow to the skin's surface and the cold weather conditions. Conclusion: The person likely had a lower core temperature during experiment B, as the consumption of alcohol could have caused a faster loss of body heat due to the dilation of blood vessels and increased blood flow to the skin's surface."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There was one very well-off bunny in the village who had a large burrow and lots of food saved up. He wasn't worried about the drought at all. The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter. The very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them. \\"I don't mind telling you,\\" Lenny said, \\"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk. \\"No need to be afraid,\\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \\"The Easter Bunny will provide.\\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is most likely true about Reverend Billy Bunny? Options:  A.

Jake has become one of the most famous schoolchildren in South Africa since people began sharing a picture of him, joking he was everything from a grumpy driving instructor to an unimpressed security guard.      But Jake lives thousands of miles north, in a small village in eastern Ghana, unaware of his new-found fame.      In fact, up until Wednesday, not even the man who took the photograph knew it had proved such a hit.      Pensive      Cameraman Carlos Cortes travelled to Ghana in 2015 to make a documentary about Solomon Adufah, an artist returning to his home country from the US.      The picture of Jake, then four, was one of hundreds taken by Cortes while Adufah taught art and creative studies to the children.      \\"I just caught Jake in the moment of his teaching,\\" Cortes, of Chicago, told the BBC. \\"He definitely has a pensive look on his face.\\"      The two men then returned to the States, unaware they had captured a future star.

When he first realised it had gone viral, he was unsure of how to react to the posts, worried they were making fun of Jake.      \\"I thought, I'm not going to respond,\\" the 27-year-old told the BBC. \\"But then I remember a moment when I thought, what if all these 'likes' turned into actual funds to help?\\"      Jake and his friends live in a rural village, and for some families sending their children to school is more than they can afford.      What is more, the primary school is also in need of supplies.      \\"I remember one day we spent 20 minutes just trying to make sure we had enough pencils for all the kids,\\" Mr Cortes said. \\"That's what the campaign is really about.\\"      Image copyright Carlos Cortes Image caption Solomon Adufah poses with the children, with Jake sitting in the front row      So Adufah, who has lived in the US since he was 16, set up a fundraising campaign, hoping Jake will really inspire people to turn their likes into cash to help pay for his education, and that of the other children in the village.      Within 24 hours, it had raised 2,000 (£1,642) - 10% of its target.

In the post, he speaks fondly of Jake and says: \\"The Internet has a way of visually misrepresenting positive images and people often troll, shedding negative light on priceless unique moments... Everyone say hi to my buddy Jake. This was moments in Ghana during my art workshop with the kids. Each kid received brand new set of crayons, pencil colors, pencils, toys and other wonderful goodies.

Question: Given the background: Plants can grow as much as 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO2 when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients. Elevated CO2 levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops, with wheat, rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 12–14% under elevated CO2 in FACE experiments.Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage and increased water-use efficiency. Studies using FACE have shown that CO2 enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants. This may have knock-on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein.The concentration of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids  and the situation: Jerry and Gary each live in separate cities, but both run equally sized farms that grow the same produce. The cities they live in have very similar environments with the only difference being that the CO2 levels in Jerry's town are elevated, and in Gary's they are not.

The given background information states that studies using Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) have shown that elevated CO2 levels, as found in Jerry's town, lead to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants.

Unusual susceptibility to PUD in RA, independent of therapy, has been suggested. To compare RA patients with others who had similar drug exposure but no known predisposition to PUD, 120 patients hospitalized for treatment of severe arthritis (65 with RA, 55 with osteoarthritis) were assessed by questionnaire for PUD history, drug history and other relevant variables. The relationship of PUD to sex distribution, smoking, alcohol consumption and anti-inflammatory therapy followed expected patterns. We found high but similar PUD rates in RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients (RA 15%, OA 18%). This suggests that a common factor (probably drugs) is responsible.

The original version can be found here. By Nolan Feeney @NolanFeeney and Andrew Katz @katz Days of angry but peaceful protests in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray devolved after his funeral Monday into scenes of rioting, arson and looting that carried into Tuesday, leaving more than a dozen police officers injured and prompting the declarationof a state of emergency as reinforcements arrived to restore order. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said late Monday he activated the National Guard as a “last resort” to tamp down the violence as night fell. “People have the right to protest and express their frustration,” he told reporters, “but Baltimore City families deserve peace and safety in their communities and these acts of violence and destruction of property cannot and will not be tolerated.” State police said an additional 5,000 officers from around the Mid-Atlantic region were requested to assist with the chaos that had erupted in West Baltimore. Hogan’s statement followed a news conference by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who said a city-wide curfew would go into effect Tuesday, from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m, and last for one week. A separate curfew for juveniles is already in place. “We are deploying every resource possible to gain control of the situation and to ensure peace moving forward,” she said. “It is idiotic to think that by destroying your city that you’re going to make life better for anybody.” Read more: The Wire Creator Calls for End to Violence in Baltimore At least 27 people were arrested by Monday evening and 15 officers were injured, with two still hospitalized, police said. One officer was unresponsive and others had broken bones. Monday’s riots came hours after funeral services were held for Gray. His death on April 19, following a fatal injury sustained in police custody during his arrest one week earlier, has become the latest to ignite the national debate on race and police brutality. Baltimore police denied using force against the 25-year-old; one of the family’s attorneys said Gray’s spine was 80% “severed at the neck.” A video recorded by a bystander shows Gray, who appears to have trouble walking, being placed inside a police van. Officials are investigating exactly how Gray received those injuries. The Justice Department and the FBI are conducting civil rights investigations into Gray’s death. Gray’s family had requested protesters not march on the day they paid their respects to him. According to the Baltimore Sun, city law enforcement officials became concerned about references on social media of a “purge”—apparently named after the plot of the movie The Purge, about a night when all crime is legal—that would begin at Mondawmin Mall at 3 p.m. and continue toward the downtown area. The University of Maryland Baltimore announced it would close early due to a police warning about the planned events, and several other businesses reportedly did the same. A group of 75 to 100 youths making their way toward the mall were met by officers in riot gear, the Sun reports, and the confrontations escalated from there. Projectiles like bottles, bricks, rocks and stickers were aimed at lines of officers, who had protective gear, shields and tear gas at their disposal. Live footage from a news helicopter showed the scene intensify, with people standing atop a police cruiser and smashing in its roof and windows. Elsewhere in the area, others were seen flooding into local businesses, like a check-cashing store and a liquor store, then returning outside with their hauls. One CVS drug store that was looted was later set on fire, and television cameras captured people slashing the fire hoses to prevent firefighters from putting out the flames. In a live televised interview as footage showed smoke billowing from the store, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings said “We never expected anything like this.” The escalation prompted the Baltimore Orioles to announce on Twitter that Monday evening’s home game against the Chicago White Sox had been postponed after consultations with city authorities; it will be rescheduled for a later date. Former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley, who is a former Baltimore mayor and a presumed Democratic presidential candidate, said he would forego several paid speeches in Europe and return to Baltimore. “I’m saddened that the City I love is in such pain this night. All of us share a profound feeling of grief for Freddie Gray & his family,” he wrote on Twitter. “We must come together as one City to transform this moment of loss & pain into a safer & more just future for all of Baltimore’s people.” The White House said Attorney General Loretta Lynch updated President Barack Obama after her swearing-in ceremony. Lynch issued a statement later in the evening, condemning what she called “senseless acts of violence by some individuals,” and said the Justice Department was ready to provide assistance to the city as needed. “Those who commit violent actions, ostensibly in protest of the death of Freddie Gray, do a disservice to his family, to his loved ones, and to legitimate peaceful protestors who are working to improve their community for all its residents.” Read more: Baltimore Mourns Freddie Gray as Officials Call for Reforms Late Monday, a fire began to engulf a senior center that was being built by a nearby church. The pastor, Rev. Donte L. Hickman, told the New York Times that he considered the fire to be set deliberately and was “probably a result of what is taking place because of all the injustice that people feel in the community.” An attorney for Gray’s family, Mary Koch, said during an interview on CNN that the violence had “completely detracted” from his death and the family’s quest for answers. In a brief statement to reporters at around 11 p.m., local time, Gray’s twin sister, Fredericka, called the violence “wrong” and said “I don’t think that’s for Freddie.” Around that time, at the scene of one of the blazes around the city, Rawlings-Blake spoke again to reporters. The mayor, who was born and raised in Baltimore, called the scenes of destruction “extremely heartbreaking.” “This is one of our darkest days as a city,” she said, “and I know that we are much better than this.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"In Baltimore, some people got really upset by the death of Freddie Gray, who was hurt while he was being arrested by the police. After some peaceful protests, there were some angry people who started to break things, start fires, and even hurt police officers. The leaders of the city and the state decided that they needed to call in extra help to stop the violence and make sure people were safe. They also told everyone they had to be inside their homes by 10 p.m. for a week. Freddie Gray's family and many others said that breaking things and hurting people wasn't a good way to express how upset they were."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who possibly acquired his later connections with the French royal chapel through early experiences at Saint-Quentin? is inside the article: Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was..., can you guess it ?

It's part of a growing worldwide trend toward outdoor education. The schools are called forest kindergartens. The numbers are small so far in the U.S., but the idea is well established in Europe, with schools in Scotland, England, and Switzerland. By far the most such schools are in Germany, which has more than 400 forest kindergartens. Some schools feature several hours of outdoor schooling. This is certainly the case with the Waldorf School of Saratoga Springs. Children there will be venturing out on the nearby Hemlock Trail to learn more about the natural world. Some lessons are focused on nature; others are academic topics delivered in a natural setting. In all cases, students are active-not sitting at desks or on mats on the floor but walking, running, jumping, solving problems like how to get the mud off the bottoms of their shoes before their parents find out. Seriously, the focus is on activity at these schools. Studies have shown that children's immune systems actually get stronger after all of the outdoor activity, and that graduates of forest kindergartens show a higher ability to learn when they progress through their academic careers. Other schools are all outdoors, all the time. This is the case with the Cedar Song Nature School, on Vashon Island, Washington. Students at this school spend their whole three-hour day outdoors, in a private five-acre forest, doing all kinds of physical activities. At these forest kindergartens, students learn science by observing and doing it, learn math by applying it to the natural world around them, learn letters and words by putting them together using sights and sounds. These students learn how to get along with one another, individually and in a group. They also develop healthy levels of self-confidence. Nowadays many children become obese  because of sedentary  activities like watching television and playing video games. These outdoor schools give children chances to learn just as much, if not more, from opening their eyes...

He popularized the classification of birds on the basis of the quinarian system.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin \\"philosophia naturalis\\") was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science. It is considered to be the precursor of natural science.  - The Quinarian system was a method of zoological classification which had a brief period of popularity in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup. Swainson's work on ornithology gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of Charles Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" (1859 ) which paved the way for evolutionary trees.  - Johann Jakob Kaup ( April 10 , 1803 - July 4 , 1873 ) was a German naturalist .

He was born at Darmstadt. After studying at Göttingen and Heidelberg he spent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to the amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant in the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his \\"Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere\\" (18551862). He also wrote \\"Classification der Säugethiere und Vögel\\" (1844), and, with Heinrich Georg Bronn, \\"Die Gavial-artigen Reste aus dem Lias\\" (18421844).  - William Sharp Macleay or McLeay (21 July 1792  26 January 1865) was a British civil servant and entomologist.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  Two teams were competing in a 5 km race. White team warmed up before the race, but Blue team arrived with a bus late and didn't have time to warm up properly before the race.  Which team had fewer athletes with increased blood flow to the muscles before the race?","output":"The team with fewer athletes with increased blood flow to the muscles before the race was the Blue team. The reason behind this is that the White team did a proper warm-up before participating in the 5 km race, while the Blue team, unfortunately, arrived late on a bus and did not have time to adequately warm up before starting the race. A proper warm-up plays a crucial role in preparing the body, especially muscles and tendons, for physical activity. Warming up consists of a gradual increase in the intensity of an exercise, which ultimately causes a rise in both blood flow to the muscles and heart rate. When the muscles and tendons are effectively warmed up, they become more flexible, resulting in a reduced risk of injury. This is particularly important for high-intensity sports, like running and soccer. Warming up can also improve overall performance during the actual activity. In this scenario, the White team's athletes would have had an increased blood flow to their muscles and an elevated heart rate, resulting from their warm-up session. The increased blood flow helps oxygenate the muscle tissues and makes them more resistant to strain. On the other hand, the Blue team's athletes, who had not adequately warmed up, would have lower blood flow to their muscles, thus rendering them more susceptible to injury and reduced performance levels. Even elite athletes need to warm up before engaging in any form of physical or sports activity. Warming up prepares the body for the upcoming exertion and can prevent injuries, enhance performance, and increase overall stamina. In conclusion, the Blue team had fewer athletes with increased blood flow to the muscles before the race, due to their lack of a proper warm-up session."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\".

I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: This activity probably took: Options:  A. A day  B. A week  C. not enough information  D. A month Answer:","output":"D. A month"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Palestinian Authority declared three days of mourning and closed Palestinian schools. Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh suggested, \\"This is the moment Sheikh Yassin dreamed about\\". The Hamas leadership said Ariel Sharon had \\"opened the gates of hell.\\" Hamas called for retaliation against Israel. About 200,000 people took to the streets of the Gaza Strip for Yassin's funeral as Israeli forces declared a national alert.  The assassination of Yassin also led to the fact that Hamas, for the first time, named as the most popular movement in Palestine by the residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip two weeks after the assassination.  Abdel Aziz Rantisi was announced as the new head of Hamas. At a memorial service for Sheik Yassin, he declared that \\"The Israelis will not know security... We will fight them until the liberation of Palestine, the whole of Palestine.\\" Publicly addressing the \\"military wing\\" of Hamas, Rantisi suggested, \\"The door is open for you to strike all places, all the time and using all means.\\" Rantisi was himself killed by Israel on 17 April 2004 in an assassination almost identical to that of Yassin. He was killed by three rockets fired from a Gunship by the Israeli Military.  On 31 August 2004, at least 15 Israeli people were killed and 80 injured in a suicide attack against two Israeli buses in Beersheba. Hamas stated the attack was a revenge for the assassination of Rantisi and Yassin. Following the bombing, an estimated 20,000 Hamas supporters in Gaza took to Gaza's streets, celebrating the successful attack.

Marsha loves playing with her noodle friend. She had it for a long time so it is now a dark brown color. When her mom first made it, it was white. The night she met her noodle friend was spaghetti night. Marsha's favorite dinner was spaghetti, which happened to be every Tuesday night. On one Tuesday, a piece of spaghetti fell on the kitchen floor. To Marsha, it looked like a stick man so she kept him. She named her new noodle friend Joey and took him everywhere she went. Sometimes Joey gets a little dried out so Marsha's mom told her to soak him in water every few days. There were a couple times that the family dog, Mika, has tried to take Joey from Marsha and eat him! So from now on, Marsha takes extra special care to make sure Joey is safe and sound at all times.

Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change. So yes, temperature affects the rate that physical change occurs.

Answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House.  The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.  The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea.  Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\"  Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs.  Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security.  \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\"  Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports.

He was a two-term Senator, which means he was an important person who helped make decisions for the country. Kerrey lived during the '80s and '90s, which was a long time ago. One day, Kerrey found out that the president (the boss of the country) was doing something he didn't like. The president was making changes to the way people get help from doctors and hospitals. This was called \\"Obamacare.\\" Kerrey thought these changes might not be good for the U.S. economy. The economy is like the big piggy bank that helps the country buy things and pay people for their work. Kerrey also heard that the president told people, \\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\\" But this was not true. It was a little like when someone tells a fib about what they did with their toys. Kerrey thought the president should have known better and not told that fib. Kerrey thought there was another fib going around too. Some people, called Democrats, were saying that \\"everybody\\" could get \\"high-quality, affordable health care.\\" High-quality means really good, and affordable means it doesn't cost too much. Kerrey didn't think it was true that everyone could get this kind of help from doctors and hospitals. Then, Kerrey looked at the president again. He realized that the president might not be brave enough to work with both Democrats and Republicans. These are groups of people who have different ideas about how to run the country. Kerrey thought that if the president was really brave, he would bring these groups together to talk about how to save things like Social Security and Medicare. Those are programs that help older and sick people. But it looked like those programs might run out of money if they didn't find a solution. So, Kerrey talked to some people, called MailOnline, and shared his thoughts. He said, \\"If the president was up to it, he would have done it already.\\" That means that Kerrey thought the president might not have what it takes to fix these big problems.

Fighting Grips Syrian Capital After Attack on Assadâs Inner Circle Jalaa Marey/Agence France-Presse â Getty Images Smoke billowed from the Syrian village of Jbatha Al-khashab in the Golan Heights region, as seen from Israel on Thursday. More Photos » BEIRUT, Lebanon — Fighting seized neighborhoods encircling Damascus for a fifth straight day on Thursday, a day after President Bashar al-Assad’s key security aides were killed in a brazen bombing attack in the sharply escalating conflict. The bombing, close to Mr. Assad’s own residence, called into question the ability of a government that depends on an insular group of loyalists to function effectively as it battles a strengthening opposition. In a move to dispel any rumors that he had been injured or had left the capital, Mr. Assad appeared on state television on Thursday swearing in a new defense minister in what appeared to be a reception room at the presidential palace. The images were broadcast in a continuous loop on SANA. The outlook for a peaceful outcome to the conflict darkened further on Thursday, when Russia and China vetoed a Britain-sponsored resolution at the United Nations Security Council that would have penalized Mr. Assad’s government with sanctions for the first time for failing to implement the six-point peace plan negotiated by Kofi Annan, the special Syria envoy. The double veto also called into question the viability of a 300-member United Nations mission sent to Syria to monitor the peace plan. Its mandate expires Friday. Opposition activists reported battles between the Army and opposition forces in the southern district of Damascus and in the northern suburb of Qaboun, with residents who were not trapped by fighting fleeing many areas. In a second statement in two days, the Syrian military said on Thursday that the bombing had left it more determined to “clear the homeland of the armed terrorist groups” — the term it uses for the insurgents seeking Mr. Assad’s ouster. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, said that the government assault had intensified, with more helicopters firing rockets that were igniting and destroying houses in Qaboun. It said that snipers were deployed around the exits of the neighborhood and that water and electricity had been cut off with numerous families trapped and no one able to excavate dead bodies from the rubble. One activist reached in Damascus, using only the name Omar, said that the government had been asking residents of Tadamon and parts of Yarmouk, the capital’s southern neighborhoods, to leave their homes. That is usually a sign that government forces are on the verge of a violent attack. Residents of Mezze and Kafr Sousseh, western neighborhoods even closer to the center of the city, fled unprompted because of the intensity of the shelling there, activists said. Another activist, Ali Salem, said residents of some five districts of the southern districts of the capital had been warned to leave and those neighborhoods were largely empty. “They threatened them and gave them 24 hours to leave their homes or they will be shelled,” he said. At least some of the Assad family has left Damascus. One opposition figure said a person associated with air force intelligence told him that a plane left Mezze military airfield in Damascus on Wednesday afternoon for Latakia carrying Mr. Assad’s mother, Anisa al-Assad, the widow of the former president Hafez al-Assad; his wife, Asma, and their three children, and other women and children from the family. It is possible the family is gathering for a ceremony at the family mausoleum in Qardaha, above Latakia, to bury Asef Shawkat, the most significant of those who died in the attack on Wednesday. Mr. Shawkat, the former deputy chief of staff of the military and the husband of the president’s older sister, Bushra, was killed along with Defense Minister Dawoud A. Rajha, the most prominent Christian in the government, and Maj. Gen. Hassan Turkmani, a previous defense minister serving as the top military aide to Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa. The strike dealt a potent blow to the government, as much for where it took place as for the individuals who were targeted: the very cabinet ministers and intelligence chiefs who have coordinated the government’s iron-fisted approach to the uprising. The battle for the capital, the center of Assad family power, appears to have begun. Reporting was contributed by Dalal Mawad and Hwaida Saad from Beirut; Alan Cowell from London; Matthew Rosenberg from Kabul, Afghanistan; Rick Gladstone from New York; Ellen Barry from Moscow; Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem; Elisabeth Bumiller and Eric Schmitt from Washington; and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The text discusses a series of significant events in Syria resulting from ongoing conflict which escalated due to an attack close to President Bashar al-Assad's residence. This event brought mounting doubts about the government's ability to function amidst the increasing strength of the opposition. First, continuous fighting for five consecutive days took hold of neighborhoods surrounding Damascus. A bombing attack was carried out near President Assad’s residence, leading to the death of his key security aides. This signified an escalating conflict and raised concerns over the ability of Assad’s administration, which relies heavily on a loyalist group, to function effectively amidst the strengthening opposition. In an attempt to dispel rumors about any injury he could have sustained, or that he had escaped the capital, Mr. Assad appeared on state television swearing in a new defense minister, with the images being continuously televised on SANA. Second, the possibility of a peaceful resolution to the situation in Syria suffered a setback as Russia and China vetoed a resolution sponsored by Britain at the United Nations Security Council. This resolution aimed to sanction Mr. Assad’s government for the first time for their failure to implement the peace plan negotiated by Kofi Annan, the special Syria envoy. Third, opposition activists witnessed increasing battles between the army and opposition forces in southern Damascus and its northern suburb, Qaboun. The Syrian military stated that the bombing had only strengthened its resolution to take down opposition groups, termed ‘armed terrorist groups’.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based organization, asserts that the government attacks have increased, causing massive damage to homes and infrastructure. Snipers have reportedly surrounded areas of conflict while services like water and electricity have been shut off, resulting in trapped civilians and no means of recovering bodies from destroyed structures. Lastly, it was reported that some members of the Assad family have fled Damascus after being warned by the government about a possible surge in violent attacks. Others left due to the intensity of shelling in their areas. This state of affairs appears to signal that a significant confrontation for control of the capital city, which is the heart of Assad family's rule, has begun.   Taken together, these points demonstrate the escalating violence and tension in Syria, causing considerable doubt over the future stability of President Assad’s government."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise \\"Killing's not my first skill\\" entails the hypothesis \\"My first skill wouldn't be killing.\\" To break it down, let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis: 1. Premise: \\"Killing's not my first skill.\\" This statement implies that the speaker does not consider killing to be their primary or most proficient skill. It is an outright declaration that they possess other skills that they prioritize or excel at over killing. 2. Hypothesis: \\"My first skill wouldn't be killing.\\" This statement refers to the assumption that if the speaker's primary skill or most proficient expertise were assessed, it wouldn't be killing. The hypothesis is drawn based on the information provided in the premise. Given the analysis, we can see that the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise with a minor change in phrasing. The hypothesis mirrors the sentiment expressed in the premise and is, therefore, entailed by it. In essence, both the premise and the hypothesis communicate the same idea - that killing is not the speaker's primary or most proficient skill.

If you like it perked, you can't do better than this model. Timeless styling, and stainless steel (not that aluminum junk). Works flawlessly, goes right into the dishwasher. My only gripe is that it does not come with operating instructions. My technique is, once you load it up with water and coffee, bring to a boil, reduce the heat a little, and let it perk for 4 and half minutes. Watch out, perked coffee is (literally) boiling hot!

Article: 08/19/2010                  AP Advisory                  AP Standards Center issues staff advisory on covering New York City mosque                  Associated Press Deputy Managing Editor for Standards and Production Tom Kent sent the following note to the staff about covering the New York City mosque story and then discussed the guidance and reaction in a Facebook entry headlined \\"Behind the News: Describing the proposed NYC mosque.\\" Aug. 19, 2010            Colleagues, Here is some guidance on covering the NYC mosque story, with assists from Chad Roedemeier in the NYC bureau and Terry Hunt in Washington: 1. We should continue to avoid the phrase \\"ground zero mosque\\" or \\"mosque at ground zero\\" on all platforms. (We’ve very rarely used this wording, except in slugs, though we sometimes see other news sources using the term.) The site of the proposed Islamic center and mosque is not at ground zero, but two blocks away in a busy commercial area. We should continue to say it’s “near” ground zero, or two blocks away. WE WILL CHANGE OUR SLUG ON THIS STORY LATER TODAY from “BC-Ground Zero Mosque” to “BC-NYC Mosque.”            In short headlines, some ways to refer to the project include: _ mosque 2 blocks from WTC site      _ Muslim (or Islamic) center near WTC site      _ mosque near ground zero      _ mosque near WTC site            We can refer to the project as a mosque, or as a proposed Islamic center that includes a mosque.            It may be useful in some stories to note that Muslim prayer services have been held since 2009 in the building that the new project will replace. The proposal is to create a new, larger Islamic community center that would include a mosque, a swimming pool, gym, auditorium and other facilities. 2. Here is a succinct summary of President Obama’s position: Obama has said he believes Muslims have the right to build an Islamic center in New York as a matter of religious freedom, though he's also said he won't take a position on whether they should actually build it. For additional background, you’ll find below a Fact Check on the project that moved yesterday. Tom            ---      Slug: BC-US--Mosque-Fact Check      Byline: CALVIN WOODWARD      Bytitle: Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — A New York imam and his proposed mosque near ground zero are being demonized by political candidates — mostly Republicans — despite the fact that Islam is already very much a part of the World Trade Center neighborhood. And that Muslims pray inside the Pentagon, too, less than 80 feet from where terrorists attacked.            And that the imam who's being branded an extremist has been valued by both Republican and Democratic administrations as a moderate face of the faith.            Even so, the project stirs complicated emotions, and Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf is a complex figure who defies easy categorization in the American Muslim world.            He's devoted much of his career to working closely with Christians, Jews and secular leaders to advance interfaith understanding. He's scolded his own religion for being in some ways in the \\"Dark Ages.\\" Yet he's also accused the U.S. of spilling more innocent blood than al-Qaida, the terrorist network that turned the World Trade Center, part of the Pentagon and four hijacked airplanes to apocalyptic rubble.            Many Republicans and some Democrats say the proposed 100 million Islamic cultural center and mosque should be built elsewhere, where there is no possible association with New York's ground zero. Far more than a local zoning issue, the matter has seized congressional campaigns, put President Barack Obama and his party on the spot — he says Muslims have the right to build the mosque — divided families of the Sept. 11, 2001, victims, caught the attention of Muslims abroad and threatened to blur distinctions between mainstream Islam in the U.S. and its radical elements.            A look at some of the claims and how they compare with the known facts:      ___            —\\"The folks who want to build this mosque — who are really radical Islamists who want to triumphally prove that they can build a mosque right next to a place where 3,000 Americans were killed by radical Islamists — those folks don't have any interest in reaching out to the community. They're trying to make a case about supremacy.\\" — Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a potential 2012 presidential candidate.            —Some of the Muslim leaders associated with the mosque \\"are clearly terrorist sympathizers.\\" — Kevin Calvey, a Republican running for Congress in Oklahoma.      —\\"This radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas.\\" — Statement by GOP Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida and Peter King of New York.            THE FACTS:      No one has established a link between the cleric and radicals. New York Police Department spokesman Paul Browne said, \\"We've identified no law enforcement issues related to the proposed mosque.\\"            Ros-Lehtinen and King were referring to the State Department's plan, predating the mosque debate, to send Rauf on another religious outreach trip to the Middle East as part of his \\"long-term relationship\\" with U.S. officials in the Bush and Obama administrations. The State Department said Wednesday it will pay him 3,000 for a trip costing the government 16,000.            Rauf counts former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright from the Clinton administration as a friend and appeared at events overseas or meetings in Washington with former President George W. Bush's secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, and Bush adviser Karen Hughes.      He has denounced the terrorist attacks and suicide bombing as anti-Islamic and has criticized Muslim nationalism. But he's made provocative statements about America, too, calling it an \\"accessory\\" to the 9/11 attacks and attributing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children to the U.S.-led sanctions in the years before the invasion.            In a July 2005 speech at the Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial Center in Adelaide, Australia, Rauf said, according to the center's transcript:            \\"We tend to forget, in the West, that the United States has more Muslim blood on its hands than al-Qaida has on its hands of innocent non-Muslims.\\"            While calling terrorism unjustified, he said the U.S. has supported authoritarian regimes with heinous human rights records and, faced with that, \\"how else do people get attention?\\"      In the same address, he spoke of prospects for peace between Palestinians and the Israelis — who he said \\"have moved beyond Zionism\\" — and of a love-your-neighbor ethic uniting all religions.      ___            —\\"Mr. President, ground zero is the wrong place for a mosque.\\" — Rick Scott, Republican candidate for Florida governor.            —\\"Nazis don't have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust Museum in Washington. We would never accept the Japanese putting up a site next to Pearl Harbor. There's no reason for us to accept a mosque next to the World Trade Center.\\" — Gingrich.      —\\"Just a block or two away from 9/11.\\" — Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, another 2012 GOP presidential prospect. THE FACTS:      No mosque is going up at ground zero. The center would be established at 45-51 Park Place, just over two blocks from the northern edge of the sprawling, 16-acre World Trade Center site. Its location is roughly half a dozen normal lower Manhattan blocks from the site of the North Tower, the nearer of the two destroyed in the attacks.            The center's location, in a former Burlington Coat Factory store, is already used by the cleric for worship, drawing a spillover from the imam's former main place for prayers, the al-Farah mosque. That mosque, at 245 West Broadway, is about a dozen blocks north of the World Trade Center grounds.            Another, the Manhattan Mosque, stands five blocks from the northeast corner of the World Trade Center site.            To be sure, the center's association with 9/11 is intentional and its location is no geographic coincidence. The building was damaged in the Sept. 11 attacks and the center's planners say they want the center to stand as a statement against terrorism.      ___            —\\"There should be no mosque near ground zero in New York so long as there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia. ... America is experiencing an Islamist cultural-political offensive designed to undermine and destroy our civilization.\\" — Gingrich.            —\\"This religion's plan is to destroy our way of life. ... If we have to let them build it, make them build it nine stories underground, so we can walk above it as citizens and Christians.\\"            — Ron McNeil, a House GOP candidate in the Florida Panhandle, in an exchange reported by The News Herald in Panama City.            THE FACTS:      Such opinions are shared by some Americans, while others are more reluctant to paint the religion with a broad brush and more welcoming of the faith in this country. Bush, himself, while criticized at the time for stirring suspicions about American Muslims, traveled to a Washington mosque less than a week after the attacks to declare that terrorism is \\"not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace.\\"            In any event, the U.S. armed forces field Muslim troops and make accommodations for them. The Pentagon opened an interfaith chapel in November 2002 close to the area where hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 slammed into the building, killing 184 people.            Muslims gather there for a daily prayer service Monday through Thursday and hold a weekly worship service on Fridays, drawing no complaints. Similar but separate services are provided for other faiths.      ___      Associated Press writers Tom Hays in New York and Anne Flaherty in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| By Doug Powers • August 19, 2010 04:34 PM      **Written by Doug Powers      The Associated Press is now prohibiting its staff from using the words “Ground Zero mosque” in stories:      The Associated Press, one of world’s most powerful news organizations, issued a memo today advising staff to avoid the phrase “Ground Zero mosque.” The Upshot reported Tuesday that the AP started using the phrase “Ground Zero mosque” in some headlines in late May. The New York Times, for one, has consciously avoided that phrasing. The AP began using the phrase as the controversy over the proposed Islamic cultural center and mosque in Lower Manhattan started bubbling up to the national level. Many news organizations, across platforms, routinely dub the project the “Ground Zero Mosque.” The AP has always been clear in the text of stories that the project would be built two blocks from Ground Zero and not on the actual site. But AP headlines, at times, ran with the phrase adopted by opponents of the project and amplified by the media. Now the news organization is taking steps to make sure that no longer occurs.      The AP memo is here. Give it a read and see if you think it’s simply a re-tread of a pro-mosque talking points memo (including a quote reminding AP staff that “the United States has more Muslim blood on its hands than al-Qaida has on its hands of innocent non-Muslims”). Fortunately for AP fact checkers, this mosque debate is taking place in between Sarah Palin book releases.      There’s no official line around the WTC site where “ground zero” ends, however I’m fairly certain that if the Associated Press office was two blocks away and hit by debris on 9/11, we’d be reading AP stories about “the horror we experienced at Ground Zero” to this day.      In any case, since “Ground Zero Mosque” is officially a no-no for the AP, here are a couple of suggestions for Associated Press writers to choose from to get us started. They could even use these on a rotating basis to avoid repetition. Feel free to add to this short list and I’ll try and put some of them up when I get home later:      -“The Hope & Change Experience”      -“House of worship in relative proximity to where Russell Simmons believes Christians bombed the WTC”      -“Project Bloomberg”      -“Site very far from WTC crater where faulty landing gear struck a now defunct Burlington Coat Factory turned peaceful multi-faith cultural center”      -“TAI Fridays”      Update: Naturally, nutmuffin Florida Rep. Alan Grayson has opined. After blaming 9/11 on Bush (of course), Grayson referred to the Ground Zero mosque as an “athletic center” and a “health club” — which is about as wildly exaggerated as calling Grayson a “lucid Congressman”:      Update II:      Doug Ross collected some of the best of your suggestions:      Here’s just a sampling of some great ideas:      15. Landing Gear Mosque      14. Project Bloomberg      13. 9/11 Victory Mosque      12. Daily Kosque      11. Caliphate-on-Hudson      10. The Gorelick & Clarke Building      9.

Kim studied a 15000 year-old settlement, before humans invented agriculture, while Harry studied a 5000 year-old village.  Which student studied about a village that had a lower birth rate?  Hint: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. A:","output":"Kim studied about a village that had a lower birth rate.

As the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in the constitutionality of the health care reform law, CNN spoke with two experts on opposing sides of the issue. Karen Harned is executive director of Small Business Legal Center for the National Federation of Independent Business. The group, along with 26 states, will appear at the court's oral arguments. NFIB represents 350,000 small-business owners. (Ron Pollack, founding executive director of Families USA, is for the health care reform law. Read his viewpoint here). The following interview with Harned is edited for clarity and brevity:. CNN: Has the U.S. reached a health care crisis that justified the law supported by President Barack Obama and most Democrats in Congress? Karen Harned: \\"We strongly think that our system is broken, and NFIB for two decades has been aggressively fighting for health insurance reforms. The reforms we wanted unfortunately were not included in the final law. They were reforms that would not drive down the cost of health insurance. That has been the number one issue for small-business owners. \\"We are very much not of the 'just say no' crowd, we think the status quo is not acceptable. Our members are very vocal on that. The problem is that the reforms that we advocated were the ones that ended up landing on the cutting room floor and that Congress made a bad situation worse.\\" Preview: 'The implications ... are impossible to overstate' CNN: But proponents argue there are tax incentives and other benefits designed to help small businesses provide health coverage for their small staffs. Harned: \\"Of course, there are provisions in this law that small-business owners like. On the big picture, our small-business owners don't get to pick and choose which provisions of the law apply to them, in addition to the two better provisions. There are numerous new tax increases, but there's also an unconstitutional infringement of individual liberty in the form of individual mandates that require everyone to buy health insurance or pay a fine. So at the end of the day, the small-business owners that we represent saw more bad than good. \\"The tax credit has been highlighted by the administration as something that's great for small business, but what we have found is that most of our members are not going to get that full credit. And the extent to which they get that credit, it's just not that significant. Because the amount of the tax incentive goes down as you either add employees or pay them more. It's actually disincentivizing small-business owners to grow their businesses.\\" CNN: Why in your view is the individual mandate requiring most Americans to purchase some form of health issuance an unconstitutional provision? Harned: \\"If it's upheld, then the Constitution is essentially giving Congress the authority to create a command-and-control economy. This is about them telling us all sorts of things that we have to buy or contracts that we need to enter into. This is exactly the opposite of what we want to see -- Congress telling you where you need to be shopping, what you need to buy. Two families, two viewpoints on health reform. \\"It also is just amending decades -- maybe centuries -- of contract law because you always have two willing participants. Those are things that fundamentally strike at the core of the small-business owners that I represent; it offends them to no end. As a practical matter, there are dollars and cents attached to this. I've talked to members who say, 'Look, this is a no-brainer.' \\" CNN: So you worry the federal government would only expand its authority over commerce? Harned: \\"The government has only made this worse in how they've argued this case, because they've been unable in every court they've been in before, to say where it would end. \\"As recently as the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals case, where Judge [Laurence] Silberman asked them [the Justice Department lawyers] point blank, 'Is it unconstitutional to regulate broccoli?' and [the government lawyer] said, 'Well, it depends.' Now it's like we're not citizens of this country anymore, we're merely subjects, if this individual mandate goes through.\\" CNN: Should Congress start all over and craft a new health care bill? Harned: \\"NFIB went into this with the intention of striking down the entire law. We have demanded for decades that we get health insurance reform that drives down the cost of health insurance for small-business owners because that market is severely broken. \\"We also believe, as the government has continued to argue, that the individual mandate is key, integral, to its operation. Without the individual mandate, it cannot stand. Even some of the provisions that people think are relatively extraneous come back, at least from a cost perspective, to the individual mandate. And if you don't have that, how does the rest of it work? \\"... And the answer here is clearly no, because the two things that the law was said to be accomplishing were to increase coverage. The individual mandate is very key to increasing coverage. And reducing costs -- again by getting everybody into the pool, they're basically having the young, healthy people subsidizing the older population. That is supposed to be helping to lower costs for all. \\"When you take that out, we don't see how the entire law works as Congress intended. And we definitely don't think Congress would have passed it without the individual mandate.\\" CNN: What is your message to the Supreme Court as they take on this legal challenge? Harned: \\"We think the law is on our side. We think it's very clear that the Founding Fathers never intended to see Congress telling people what products they should buy. If you look at the justifications the government gives, the text doesn't support this mandate, the Constitution doesn't support it, and if the justices rule that the individual mandate is constitutional, they are going to basically open the door for Congress to legislate whatever mandates it finds appropriate that it will impose on individuals. \\"We think the law, the Constitution, is very much on our side. That's what they're charged with upholding.\\" What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. Both experts acknowledge that the U.S. healthcare system is broken and in need of reform. 2. Karen Harned argues that the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has been fighting for health insurance reforms, but the proposals they supported were not included in the final law.  3. Harned believes that the current health care reform law has more negative aspects than positive ones for small-business owners. She claims that the tax credits offered to small businesses are not as beneficial as the government claims, and in some cases, they may disincentivize business growth. 4. Harned is against the individual mandate requiring most Americans to purchase health insurance, calling it an unconstitutional provision. She argues that if upheld, this would give Congress too much power to regulate and control the economy.  5. The NFIB argues that if the individual mandate is removed, the rest of the health care reform law cannot stand, as it is integral to its operation.

A Somali refugee walks past the United Nations-donated tents at a refugee camp west of Aden. Seventy-four survivors made it to the beach Tuesday and were taken to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees center in Ahwar, Yemen, according to UNHCR. Some told the United Nations that they were waiting on their boat for a smaller vessel to take them ashore when the smugglers operating the boat forced them overboard.

After being forced overboard by smugglers, the survivors found themselves in a precarious situation, desperately needing help and hope for a brighter future. The lives of these refugees take a turn for the better when both local and international communities come together to create opportunities and uplift them from their despair. The tragic incident garners significant global attention and prompts a substantial increase in funding for refugee assistance programs. The United Nations, the UNHCR, and multiple NGOs become highly involved in efforts to improve the lives of these displaced individuals in Yemen and other countries hosting refugees.  Local communities in Yemen are cautious but welcoming to the survivors, offering support and sanctuary. Some of the refugees find solace in Aden and Ahwar, where they are given temporary shelter and aid by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Multiple nations also come forward to provide aid and technical support to Yemen, helping uplift the local residents in the process. With increased focus on education and vocational training, many of the refugees manage to rebuild their lives, learning new trades and integrating into their host communities. The unity and collaboration between the various nations, NGOs, and volunteers facilitate the creation of safe havens in multiple locations around the Horn of Africa, providing asylum to individuals fleeing economic hardship and war in their home countries. As the years progress, the situation in Somalia begins to stabilize, with peace talks yielding productive results. International efforts are directed towards rebuilding war-torn regions, creating sustainable employment opportunities, and fostering a sense of unity among the various factions. Many refugees, now skilled and educated, choose to return to their homeland and actively participate in the efforts to reconstruct their nation. This story ends on a hopeful and largely optimistic note. It speaks of healing, homecoming, and an undying commitment to building a better future.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,...

The list contains a mix of characters, numbers, and strings of numbers. We can start by iterating through the list, checking each element to determine if it is an alphabetical character. We can use the isalpha() method in Python to check if an element is an alphabetical character. If so, we append the index + 1 (since the position of the 1st element is 1) to a result list. After iterating through the entire input list, we need to check if any alphabetical characters were found. If the result list is empty, that means no alphabetical characters were found, so we should return -1. Otherwise, we return the result list as it contains the positions of all alphabetical characters. Here's a code solution: \`\`\`python def find_alpha_positions(input_list):     alpha_positions = []     for index, element in enumerate(input_list):         if str(element).isalpha():             alpha_positions.append(index + 1)     return alpha_positions if alpha_positions else -1 \`\`\` Now we can use this function to find the positions of the alphabetical elements in the given input list: \`\`\`python input_list = ['l', 'I', '7539', 'U', '3745', '9783', 'D', '5531', '4325', 'J', '9005', 'h', '6447', 't', '583', '1231'] result = find_alpha_positions(input_list) print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 12, 14] \`\`\` As per the given input list, we have alphabetical elements at positions 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 14.

Four-star officers are often the most senior commanders in the armed services, having ranks such as (full) admiral, (full) general, or air chief marshal. This designation is also used by some armed forces that are not North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) members.  - Air vice-marshal (abbreviated as AVM) is a two-star air officer rank which originated in and continues to be used by the Royal Air Force. The rank is also used by the air forces of many countries which have historical British influence and it is sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure. Air vice-marshals may be addressed generically as \\"air marshal\\". Air vice-marshal is a two-star rank and has a NATO ranking code of OF-7. It is equivalent to a rear-admiral in the Royal Navy or a major-general in the British Army or the Royal Marines. In other NATO forces, such as the United States Armed Forces and the Canadian Armed Forces, the equivalent two-star rank is major general.  - A flag officer is a commissioned officer in a nation's armed forces senior enough to be entitled to fly a flag to mark the position from which the officer exercises command.  - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO  '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP.  - An officer of three-star rank is a very senior commander in many of the armed services holding a rank described by the NATO code of OF-8. The term is also used by some armed forces which are not NATO members. Typically, three-star officers hold the rank of vice admiral, lieutenant general, or in the case of those air forces with a separate rank structure, air marshal.  - Vice admiral is a senior naval flag officer rank, equivalent to lieutenant general and air marshal. A vice admiral is typically senior to a rear admiral and junior to an admiral. In many navies, vice admiral is a three-star rank with a NATO code of OF-8, although in some navies like the French Navy it is an OF-7 rank, the OF-8 code corresponding to the four-star rank of squadron vice-admiral.  - Counter admiral is a rank found in many navies of the world, but no longer used in English-speaking countries, where the equivalent rank is rear admiral. The term derives from the French \\"contre-amiral\\".  - The French Navy (\\"national navy\\"), informally , is the maritime arm of the French Armed Forces. Tracing its roots back to 1624 it is one of the world's oldest naval forces and historically played a key part in establishing the French colonial empire. Since the early foundings, its roles have been defined as maintaining intelligence, protecting populations, preventing crises, intervening wherever necessary to reestablish peace, and dissuading any threats against vital French interests. The Marine nationale consists of four branches: the \\"Force d'Action Navale\\", the \\"Forces Sous-marines\\", the \\"Aéronavale\\" and the \\"Fusiliers Marins\\" (including Commandos Marine). As a blue-water navy the Marine nationale operates a wide range of fighting vessels, including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, nuclear-powered submarines, frigates, patrol boats and support ships. The French Navy does not use prefixes of the names of its ships (such as the Royal Navy uses HMS, for instance). Foreign commentators sometimes use the prefixes \\"FS\\" (for \\"French Ship\\") or FNS (for \\"French Navy Ship\\"); these are not official, however.  - An officer of two-star rank is a senior commander in many of the armed services holding a rank described by the NATO code of OF-7. The term is also used by some armed forces which are not NATO members. Typically, two-star officers hold the rank of rear admiral, counter admiral, major general, or in the case of those air forces with a separate rank structure, air vice-marshal.  - Lieutenant general, lieutenant-general and similar (abbrev Lt Gen, LTG and similar) is a three-star military rank (NATO code OF-8) used in many countries. The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages, where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield, who was normally subordinate to a captain general.  - Rear admiral is a naval commissioned officer rank above that of a commodore and captain , and below that of a vice admiral . It is generally regarded as the lowest of the \`\` admiral '' ranks , which are also sometimes referred to as \`\` flag officers '' or \`\` flag ranks '' . In many navies it is referred to as a two - star rank ( OF - 7 ) . It originated from the days of naval sailing squadrons and can trace its origins to the Royal Navy . Each naval squadron would be assigned an admiral as its head , who would command from the centre vessel and direct the activities of the squadron . The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral , who commanded the lead ships which would bear the brunt of a naval battle . In the rear of the naval squadron , a third admiral would command the remaining ships and , as this section of the squadron was considered to be in the least danger , the admiral in command of the rear would typically be the most junior of the squadron admirals . This has survived into the modern age , with the rank of rear admiral the most - junior of the admiralty ranks of many navies . In some European navies ( e.g. , that of France ) , and in the Canadian Forces ' French rank translations , the rank of rear admiral is known as contre - amiral . In the German Navy the rank is known as Konteradmiral , superior to the flotilla admiral ( Commodore in other navies ) . In the Royal Netherlands Navy , this rank is known as schout - bij - nacht ( lit. : supervisor during night ) , denoting the role junior to the squadron admiral , and fleet admiral .  - Air marshal (Air Mshl or AM) is a three-star air-officer rank which originated in and continues to be used by the Royal Air Force. The rank is also used by the air forces of many countries which have historical British influence and it is sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure. Air marshal is a three-star rank and has a NATO ranking code of OF-8, equivalent to a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy or a lieutenant-general in the British Army or the Royal Marines. In other NATO forces, such as the United States Armed Forces and the Canadian Armed Forces, the equivalent three-star rank is lieutenant general.    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'said to be the same as' with the subject 'rear admiral'.

Plus, what 48 million will buy you in Aspen.      BENGHAZI, Libya—Rebels menaced Col. Moammar Gadhafi's stronghold from all sides Thursday, as insurgent commanders said they have sent troops for an offensive against Tripoli and residents of the capital prepared their first mass demonstration in days on Friday.      Just 30 miles west of Col. Gadhafi's shrinking base of power, antiregime forces battled for the oil-industry town of Al-Zawiya. On Thursday evening, opposition forces gained control of Misrata, a coastal city 130 miles east of Tripoli.      In Benghazi, the country's second-largest city and the hub of eastern Libya, a group of army colonels who recently defected said they are plotting the end their former commander's 42-year reign, which began to crumble last week as Libyans joined the antiauthoritarian protests roiling the Arab world.      \\"We have a plan to bring down Tripoli,\\" Col. Tareq Saad Hussein, one of seven former colonels who have taken charge of rebel forces in Benghazi, said in an interview. \\"We will not stop until we liberate the whole country.\\"      {if djIsFlashPossible} The version of Adobe Flash Player required to view this interactive has not been found.

Hussein said his team had already begun sending rebels west toward Tripoli in small groups to slip past forces loyal to Col. Gadhafi.      Tripoli residents, meanwhile, said antiregime groups sent a wave of text messages Thursday urging residents to meet en masse Friday for prayers at the city's Green Square as a sign of defiance against Col. Gadhafi.      Several residents who participated in Sunday's large demonstration in Tripoli say heavy patrols by government forces have made the streets dangerous for protesters. Some say they hope Friday's event will be a turning point. \\"We will go and gather, even if we are slaughtered,\\" said one resident.

Governments across the world continued their attempts Thursday to evacuate their citizens from Libya. Germany and the U.K. sent warships to retrieve nationals. A ferry loaded with U.S. passengers continued to await departure in Tripoli's port Thursday amid high winds and rough seas, complicating U.S. efforts to take diplomatic action against Col. Gadhafi.      On Thursday, President Barack Obama consulted with European leaders while Washington explored a full range of options. Asked whether the U.S. was considering military steps, White House spokesman Jay Carney said: \\"I'm not ruling anything out.\\"      State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Col. Gadhafi had told the U.S. through Libyan officials that his opponents are inspired by Islamists and under the influence of drugs, a message that has mirrored his statements on Libyan state television.      In an interview with David Wessel, Daniel Yergin, author of \\"The Prize,\\" states that the turmoil in the Middle East is a \\"sea change\\" for the global oil market and that the U.S. and emerging markets are most economically vulnerable to rising oil prices.      Col. Gadhafi lashed out at his domestic opponents again Thursday in a 23-minute telephone interview with state television, accusing rebels in Al-Zawiya and elsewhere of being under the sway of al Qaeda. \\"What is this farce? You in al-Zawiya turn to [Osama] bin Laden?\\" he said. \\"He brainwashed your sons.\\"      While Libya does have a history of homegrown terrorism, Col. Gadhafi's more immediate concern appears to be the new military units commanded by Col. Hussein and other former officers around the country. Libya has long required its men to serve in the military, making the regulars, reservists and former soldiers who make up these militias familiar with arms.      Residents of Tajura, a suburb of Tripoli, say pro-government militias have fought running battles against local youths amid ongoing street protests by residents in defiance of Col. Gadhafi's speech Tuesday that promised death to demonstrators. The residents were taking inspiration from rousing sermons issued by a notable religious leader, Sheikh al-Geryani.      \\"He spoke up,\\" says one resident about the religious leader. \\"He was telling the people that we can't let them kill us. Now they have raided his house and are looking for him.\\"      Tajura youth groups have fought running gun battles with pro-regime forces for the three nights leading up to Thursday night, according to residents. But the government has moved in tanks and set up road blocks on most main streets of the town, and so far remain in control over the area, residents say.      In Benghazi, Col. Hussein said he and other colonels had dispatched armed rebels west toward Tripoli in small units, to make it difficult to detect them passing through territories including the city of Sirte, the heavily fortifieed hometown of Col. Gadhafi and his still-loyal tribesmen. Col. Hussein wouldn't say how many fighters had been sent to Tripoli and wouldn't comment on when a larger scale westward offensive might be launched.      Idriss Sherif, an economics professor who is serving on one of Benghazi's newly formed leadership committees, said he believed that over 1,000 rebel troops had already been dispatched to Tripoli.      At the Benghazi compound's front gate, two antiaircraft guns pointed skyward. Inside, in the shade of eucalyptus and palm trees, soldiers piled dozens of wooden crates filled with tank shells into a pickup truck. The soldiers said the compound now served as depot where weapons seized by young protesters from army bases and police stations were gathered and redistributed to trained rebel fighters.      Col. Hussein, speaking as he picked over a lunch of grilled chicken and macaroni, said his forces were also working to hunt down Col. Gadhafi.      Col. Hussein said intelligence from friendly senior army officers with whom he is in contact throughout Libya suggested Col. Gadhafi was moving from house to house to avoid detection.      He said there were strong indications that Col. Gadhafi's hold on power was fast slipping.      Some of Benghazi's new officials said their contacts in Sirte told them that Mr. Gadhafi's intelligence chief, Abdullah Senussi, had bolted the city Thursday, along with the unit of soldiers protecting him.      Col. Hussein said his forces had recently been contacted by some members of Col. Gadhafi's tribe in and around Sirte who said they no longer supported Col. Gadhafi.      \\"Gadhafi's days are numbered,\\" said Col. Hussein. \\"If we capture him, he will be publicly prosecuted for his crimes. But if the youth find him first, I don't think I'll see Gadhafi in less than 40 or 50 pieces.\\"      Meanwhile, Col. Hussein and other rebel commanders say their forces are motivated and gaining in strength, numbers and organization with each day.      There was no way to confirm these rebel reports.      At the headquarters of Benghazi's interim governing committees, dozens of youth lined up Thursday to sign up.      \\"We've opened the doors for volunteers in the new army, to unite and fight against the mercenaries and liberate all of Libya,\\" said Akram Akaza, a 36-year-old corporal who was directing the volunteers to the sign-up lists. \\"We must get Gadhafi out. I'm going to Tripoli.\\"      Senior rebel commanders in other eastern cities said similar efforts were underway there.      \\"We are getting many volunteers every day,\\" said Maj. Gen. Suleiman Mahmoud, who is headquartered in Tobruq. Gen. Mahmoud was the commander of the armed forces in eastern Libya—making him one of Col. Hussein's seniors—under Col. Gadhafi before he defected to the rebels on Sunday.      Gen. Mahmoud said his rebel forces were also preparing a march on Tripoli.      But it was unclear how much coordination there was between efforts in different cities.      Col. Hussein and Gen. Mahmoud both said coordination was good. But neither, when asked Thursday, seemed aware of what the other was doing.      Gen. Mahmoud is among a small group of top ranking Libyan defense officials who appear to be playing a key role in the rebellion. Another senior military figure in the uprising is Abdel Fattah Younis, who was Libya's defense minister until he defected to the rebels on Sunday. Mr. Younis was helping rebels days before that, according to some rebel officials in Benghazi.      Mr. Younis's leadership was key to drawing up and executing the operation that brought down Benghazi's principal pro-Gadhafi military base, which collapsed late Sunday night, according to Mr. Sherif.      \\"He was the one giving orders that day,\\" said Mr. Sherif. \\"He commands the loyalty of officers throughout all of Libya.\\"      But some rebel soldiers and loyalists voiced distrust of both Gen. Mahmoud and Mr. Younis, because they served for so long and in such a senior capacity.      Asked about his views on Gen. Mahmoud and Mr. Younis, Col. Hussein would only say: \\"There are officers with high ranks who had very nebulous positions toward the revolution until the last minute. These officers should have declared their support earlier.\\"      —Angus Mcdowall, Nour Malas and Summer Said contributed to this article.      Write to Charles Levinson at charles.levinson@wsj.com and Margaret Coker at margaret.coker@wsj.com ||||| BENGHAZI, LIBYA - Fighting between Libyan opposition groups and government paramilitary forces moved closer to the capital, Tripoli, on Thursday, as residents braced for a potential push to oust Moammar Gaddafi's regime from the city.      With opposition leaders calling for major protests in Tripoli on Friday, residents said jeeps full of armed fighters were moving into the city from a nearby military barracks.      \\"Fear, fear, fear,\\" one businessman described the mood in the city. But he predicted a big turnout for the Friday demonstrations. \\"It's now or never,\\" he said of the effort by opposition groups to extend their rebellion to Gaddafi's stronghold, where forces loyal to the Libyan leader have kept a firm grip on power.      Beyond Tripoli, there were new signs Thursday that what began as a disorganized revolt was gaining strength and coherence. Parallel governments are taking shape in major cities such as Benghazi, about 600 miles east of the capital, with citizen leaders working alongside former government officials and military officers.      As the clashes spread closer to the capital, rebel gains threatened to leave the Libyan leader's stronghold isolated. Forces loyal to Gaddafi appeared to have repelled their opponents in Zawiyah, 30 miles west of Tripoli, but residents of Misurata, a major town east of the capital, said that the streets were in rebel hands and that opposition members had rebuffed an attack by regime loyalists.      Gaddafi has vowed to fight to the death to keep his 41-year-old rule intact, and he made a direct appeal to Zawiyah's residents, telling them that protesters had been drugged and were under the influence of al-Qaeda. \\"Please do not disappoint me,\\" Gaddafi said in a telephone call to the state-run radio station. \\"Otherwise each will take justice into his own hands to rid us of this darkness.\\"      The turmoil in Libya continued to disrupt world oil markets and dominate international diplomacy as nations tried to evacuate their citizens and craft a response to the violence. U.S. officials said a ferry chartered to evacuate American citizens to nearby Malta was unable to depart Thursday because of high seas. Swiss officials said they were freezing any possible bank assets of Gaddafi and his close associates. The step was similar to one announced by Swiss authorities against the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt as they were ousted in rebellions.      In Washington, President Obama called British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy amid mounting criticism that the administration's quiet diplomacy is doing little to stop the Libyan government's violent reprisals.      A French government statement said Sarkozy and Obama \\"reiterated their demand for an immediate halt to the use of force against the civilian population.\\" Sarkozy also called for a second urgent session of the U.N. Security Council to demand \\"immediate access to humanitarian assistance and to sanction those responsible for the violence against Libya's civilian population.\\"      Obama's telephone diplomacy Thursday came on the eve of a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, called to address the revolt in Libya.      The council's European members are expected to lead the push for Libya's expulsion from the panel and support the first step in establishing a U.N.-sanctioned investigation of the violence that could end at the International Criminal Court. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled to travel to Geneva on Monday for the council's regular session.      The extent of the fighting in Zawiyah could not be independently verified, but wire services and others, quoting witnesses, reported fierce clashes that included government fighters firing on a mosque where protesters had staged a sit-in.

Title: A bit overly ambitious to claim THE Best of the Blues\\" Product review: I really appreciated Robert Santelli's \\"Big Blues Book\\", but his book \\"The Best of the Blues - 101 Essential Albums\\" leaves much to be desired. I do not profess to be a blues expert, but I have been an avid fan since the mid '50s, have about 200 blues albums and know a bit about the music. The selections in the book are curious if nothing else. For example, there are three albums by Skip James and two by Paul Butterfiled yet there are none by Sleepy John Estes, Robert Nighthawk, Lightnin' Slim, Houston Stackhouse or Lazy Lester. I bought this book expecting (after the great \\"Big Blues Book\\") to find some albums I am missing from my collection. Not so!

Passage 1:Initially called Camp Annapolis Junction, the post was opened as \\"Camp Admiral\\" in 1917 on acquired for a training camp. The post was called Camp Meade Cantonment by 1918, Camp Franklin Signal Corps school was located there and in 1919, the Camp Benning tank school—formed from the World War I Camp Colt and Tobyhanna schools—was transferred to the fort before the Tank Corps was disbanded. Renamed to Fort Leonard Wood (February 1928 – March 5, 1929), the fort's Experimental Motorized Forces in the summer and fall of 1928 tested vehicles and tactics in expedition convoys (Camp Meade observers had joined the in-progress 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy). In 1929, the fort's 1st Tank Regiment encamped on the Gettysburg Battlefield. During World War II, Fort Meade was used as a recruit training post and prisoner of war camp, in addition to a holding center for approximately 384 Japanese, German, and Italian immigrant residents of the U.S. arrested as potential fifth columnists. The Second U.S. Army Headquarters transferred to the post on June 15, 1947; and in 1957, the post became headquarters of the National Security Agency.  Passage 2:In 2015, together with his bandmate David Bryant, Lemieux co-directed the experimental documentary short Quiet Zone about people with electromagnetic hypersensitivity living in the United States National Radio Quiet Zone in West Virginia. The film premiered in January 2015 at the International Film Festival Rotterdam where it was a part of the Tiger Awards Competition for Short Films 2015. At the 4th Canadian Screen Awards the film was nominated for Best Short Documentary by the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television. A year later Lemieux directed Shambles (original French title: Maudite poutine), his feature film debut. The film premiered at the 2016 Venice Film Festival before going into theatrical release in Canada in 2017. The film garnered four Prix Iris nominations at the 19th Prix Iris in 2017.

Kelly's, a local eatery, is located in this area and the Elm Street Pier is also located here. Majority of the Port Charles waterfront is owned by the Pride-Philips Company, which was given to Courtney Matthews as a thank you from a woman whose life she saved. Courtney later sold Pride-Philips to Lorenzo Alcazar. In 2008, Alexis Davis and Sam McCall are attacked here by the Text Message Killer.

Given the following context:  During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.

Article:The idea came from an economist, Jim O'Neill formerly of Goldman Sachs, who thought of the group (without South Africa) as a useful way of thinking about the future of the global economy. On those rather flimsy foundations the countries built a summit and now they seem to be on the point of creating a new financial institution. If they can agree to sign up to it at a summit in Fortaleza in Brazil, the five Brics countries will create a new development bank, a new challenger to the World Bank and the ranks of other similar regionally focused agencies. They are all agreed in principle that it's something they want to do, and reports ahead of the summit suggest they are close to agreeing enough of the detail to be able to sign a founding treaty for the bank. So just what will this Brics bank look like? A lot of detail has still to be filled in, but previous summit declarations have set out some elements. Its main function would be to mobilise \\"resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in Brics and other emerging economies and developing countries\\". So it would be for the benefit of their own economies, but for others too. Infrastructure is one of the jobs that the existing development banks do. They lend money to a government to pay for projects such as power stations and electricity supply grids, ports, roads, telecommunications networks, water and sewerage. A Brics bank would bring more resources into this important area. The World Bank acknowledges that more is needed. There's a gap between what is spent on infrastructure and what is needed. The World Bank says on its website: \\"The gap is estimated at 1 trillion in low and middle-income countries, and the demand for infrastructure continues to grow as countries develop.\\" The existing development banks could not get anywhere near filling a gap of that size. Currently overseas aid, including the existing multilateral development banks, provide a small fraction of total infrastructure spending in the developing world - something like 40-60bn (Â£23-35bn) out of a total approaching a trillion. A group of three economists including the Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz have described the Brics bank as \\"an idea whose time has come\\". They saw another benefit in the idea. They wrote with the global financial crisis still in mind, a disaster where one element was money from the emerging world invested in rich country financial markets. \\"Such a bank could play a strong role in rebalancing the world economy by channelling hard-earned savings in emerging markets and developing countries to more productive uses than funding bubbles in rich-country housing markets,\\" they said. So how much will a Brics bank be able to bring to the infrastructure party? There are many moving parts in the calculation. The Brics countries are talking about total capital of as much as 100bn, though it wouldn't necessarily all be paid in. The bank's capacity to lend would depend on how much they do pay in, its credit rating, whether it gets contributions from other countries, which Brics countries have said they would allow, on what it does with any profits and many other factors. One estimate by Columbia University Prof Stephany Griffith-Jones suggested it could eventually lend as much as 34bn a year. With joint financing by private investors and other development banks, it would be supporting projects worth even more than that. But that would take 20 years and it is of course a hypothetical figure. It's a significant contribution to the developing world's needs, but it would still leave a lot of the infrastructure gap unfilled. There is more to this plan than just the financial aspects. A Brics bank would probably take a less assertive position when it comes to setting conditions attached to its loans than the World Bank, for example. Those conditions have often been controversial, with critics saying they are wrong for the countries concerned and an intrusion on their sovereignty. There is also a long standing complaint from the developing world about who is in charge at the World Bank - and the International Monetary Fund as well. The system of weighted voting gives the rich countries a very big say. It has enabled them to maintain an informal arrangement which has meant the Bank always has an American in the top job, while a European has always led the IMF. There will most likely be politically driven wrangling over the management posts at the Brics bank. But we can be pretty sure it will be one of their own nationals in charge. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are close to agreeing on the creation of a new development bank, intended to be a challenger to the World Bank and other similar financial institutions. Its main function would be to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other emerging economies, as well as developing countries. The initial capital discussed is around 100bn, and it could eventually lend as much as 34bn a year. A BRICS bank is expected to take a less assertive position on loan conditions and give more representation to the developing world. The proposal for the BRICS bank is seen as an idea whose time has come, and it could help rebalance the global economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Ali: Fear Eats the Soul Context: Ali (Salem), is a Moroccan Gastarbeiter (guest worker) in his late thirties, and Emmi (Mira), is a 60-year-old widowed cleaning woman. They meet when Emmi ducks inside a bar, driven by the rain and drawn by the exotic Arabic music (Al Asfouryeh by Sabah) she says she has heard so often on her walk home from work. A woman in the bar (Katharina Herberg) who is part of Ali's Arabic-speaking cohort tauntingly suggests Ali ask Emmi (\\"the old woman\\") to dance, and Emmi accepts. A strange and unlikely friendship develops, then a romance and soon they are living together in Emmi's flat. Out of a professed sense of responsibility but also hopefulness, Emmi first confides in her newfound love when she goes to visit her daughter Krista (Irm Hermann) and her tyrannical son-in-law Eugen (Fassbinder himself) and announces that she is in love with Ali; Eugen thinks she is screwy and Krista as well can only think that her mother - who has been a widow for years - is fantasizing. The first real threat to their relationship comes with a visit by the landlord's son, who has been sent on the assumption that Emmi has taken in a lodger to point out to her that sub-letting is against Emmi's tenancy agreement, and that Ali must leave within a day. Impulsively, and fearful of losing this new joy in her life, Emmi claims that she and Ali are planning to marry to alleviate this little difficulty. This changes everything for the landlord's son, the only character in the film who consistently accepts their relationship as unproblematic. After he has apologized for the misapprehension and departed, Emmi speaks to Ali with embarrassment of her having invented the idea of their marrying but, to her surprise and delight, Ali concurs that it is an excellent idea, and we next see them emerging from the civil court, married. What follows is a bitter and noxious reaction over their relationship, revealing every character in their lives, especially every German in Emmi's former life, as being mired in prejudice against foreign workers as dirty... Answer:","output":"The idea of marriage is a complex social construct predating recorded history, and therefore it is difficult to attribute its invention to a single person or society. Marriage has evolved over time and has been influenced by various religions, cultures, and legal systems throughout human history. As a result, there are numerous different types of marriages and ceremonies practiced worldwide. Regarding the movie you mentioned, \\"Ali: Fear Eats the Soul\\" is a 1974 West German film directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. The film tells the story of an unlikely romance between Ali, a Moroccan guest worker, and Emmi, a widowed German cleaning woman, which is met with racial prejudice and societal disapproval. As their relationship develops, they face many challenges caused by discrimination and the preconceived notions about their union. In the film, the idea of marriage is brought up when Emmi and Ali have to deal with housing issues due to the restrictions on Emmi's tenancy agreement. Emmi, driven by fear of losing her newfound happiness, claims that they are planning to get married to solve the housing problem. Initially, this marriage proposal stems from a practical need, but Ali eventually agrees to it, and they proceed to marry. While the film portrays marriage as an essential part of their relationship, it also highlights the societal context surrounding intercultural marriages and the prejudice faced by individuals in such unions. Of course, this should not be mistaken as an account of how or why the idea of marriage was initially invented. The origins of marriage remain a complex and multifaceted topic deeply intertwined with human history and cultural evolution."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Question: suppose the wood is covered happens, how will it affect the wood becomes soaked faster.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If the wood is covered and protected from rain, it will have a reduced chance or even no chance of becoming soaked. This will result in less water seeping into the wood surface, hence decreasing the overall detrimental impact on the wood. Consequently, the second effect mentioned, which is the loss of the wood's luster and appearance due to the evaporation of water taking the finish of the wood with it, will also be influenced in a positive manner. With less water present to damage the wood, its luster and appearance will be better preserved.

Answer the question...when did the first moon landing take place??","output":"The first moon landing took place on July 20, 1969, during the historic Apollo 11 mission led by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States. This momentous event marked a significant milestone in the history of human space exploration and epitomized the culmination of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Apollo 11 mission was commanded by astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, accompanied by pilot Edwin E. \\"Buzz\\" Aldrin Jr. as Lunar Module Pilot and pilot Michael Collins as Command Module Pilot. The three-part spacecraft was launched on July 16, 1969, from the Kennedy Space Center (then named the Cape Kennedy Air Force Station) in Florida. The mission consisted of three crucial stages: launch and ascent, lunar landing, and safe return. The spacecraft with the three astronauts aboard reached Earth's orbit approximately 12 minutes after liftoff, and it traveled through space for three days before entering lunar orbit. The spacecraft then started its descent to the lunar surface. On July 20, as the Lunar Module (named \\"Eagle\\") separated from the Command and Service Module (named \\"Columbia\\"), Armstrong and Aldrin prepared for the final descent, while Collins stayed in lunar orbit. At 20:17 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the Lunar Module successfully touched down on the moon's surface in an area called the Sea of Tranquility. About six and a half hours after landing, Neil Armstrong became the first human to step onto the lunar surface, creating a historic moment immortalized by the famous phrase, \\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\\" Roughly twenty minutes later, Buzz Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface, and the two of them spent approximately 2 hours conducting experiments, collecting lunar samples, and deploying scientific instruments. The astronauts then returned to the Lunar Module and, after a period of rest, initiated the ascent back to the Command and Service Module, rendezvousing with Collins in lunar orbit. The three astronauts traveled back to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969, where they were recovered by the USS Hornet. The success of the Apollo 11 mission effectively ended the space race, demonstrating the capacity of humans to explore celestial bodies beyond Earth and setting the stage for further lunar missions and the eventual development of long-term space exploration plans. The first moon landing remains a shining symbol of human achievement and an enduring testimony to human ingenuity, determination, and collaborative spirit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US.

(CNN) -- George Jones, the country music legend whose graceful, evocative voice gave depth to some of the greatest songs in country music -- including \\"She Thinks I Still Care,\\" \\"The Grand Tour\\" and \\"He Stopped Loving Her Today\\" -- has died, according to his public relations firm. Jones, 81, died Friday at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, the public relations firm said. He had been hospitalized since April 18 with fever and irregular blood pressure. Jones' career was marked by a tumultuous marriage to Tammy Wynette and bouts with alcoholism that led to occasional concert cancellations. (One of his nicknames was \\"No-Show Jones\\"; after he got clean, he puckishly used \\"No-Show\\" on his license plates.)","output":"As the news of George Jones's passing spread, the country music world and its fans mourned the loss of a true legend. For his family, friends, and colleagues, it was a time of reflection and remembrance of the highs and lows of his extraordinary life and career. His passing signaled the end of an era, as George Jones had been one of the last living legends of country music's golden age. In the wake of his death, the public rediscovered his iconic songs, with many radio stations and streaming platforms paying tribute to his music. As fans revisited his extensive library of hits, the beauty and emotion in his lyrics were given a new, profound resonance. The music world would remember \\"No-Show Jones\\" not just for the trouble he faced throughout his life and career, but for his unwavering passion for music, which shone through even in the darkest times. Several major events and tributes were organized to honor George Jones's legacy. The Country Music Hall of Fame, where Jones had been inducted in 1992, set up a special exhibit dedicated to his life and work. The Grand Ole Opry, a venue that was intimately connected with his career, held a memorial service where fellow musicians and admirers shared stories, sang songs, and paid their respects to the man who had given so much to the country music scene. Posthumously, TV Specials and documentaries were created, detailing the life of George Jones, placing particular emphasis on his hard-fought battles with alcoholism and his tumultuous relationship with Tammy Wynette. These documentaries offered a more in-depth perspective of the man behind the voice, and helped solidify his position as an important figure in American music history. His autobiography, which he had been working on with music writer Tom Carter during his final years, would be published posthumously under the title, \\"The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend.\\" The book would go on to become a bestseller, allowing fans to relive George Jones's incredible journey from a poor, small-town boy to country music royalty. Meanwhile, songs that Jones had recorded, but never released, were collected into an album titled \\"Unreleased.\\" This album would be a bittersweet reminder of how much talent and passion George Jones still possessed in his later years, with the songs quickly becoming popular with fans. As a testament to his wide-reaching influence, contemporary country stars would continue to perform his music, revering his contribution to the genre. His songs would inspire the next generation of musicians, ensuring that his legacy endured for years to come. In conclusion, the story of George Jones, the country music legend, ends on a poignant note. With his passing, the world mourned the loss of one of the most iconic voices in the history of country music. Although his personal struggles ultimately played a part in defining his story, it's his commitment to his craft, and the beauty of his music that would be remembered by generations of fans. Through tributes, memorials, and the enduring power of his songs, George Jones's legacy was immortalized for future generations to admire and appreciate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Carl is talking to his best friend Peter (Bradley Cooper) who is trying to persuade him to come to a gathering at the usual bar and Carl keeps trying to weasel out telling Peter that he's at home and he's got things to do but is really at the local Blockbuster renting movies like 300 and Transformers for a lonely night at home. During the conversation, we see Peter outside the store window, and Carl is caught.Carl ends up going to the bar with Peter, Rooney (Danny Masterson from That 70's Show) and Lucy (Sasha Alexander). Peter makes the big announcement that he and Lucy are engaged and tells Carl the date of their engagement party, which Carl is obligated to attend.

And it is a must see! Just don't expect to see something outbreaking. The Freudian psychoanalyzes are interesting in many parts of the film, but there's just too much perversion and it doesn't stick in the end. Some of the good things are the analyzes of Kieslowski's Blue, most of David Lynch's, some of Hitchcock's and perhaps a couple more I missed (I just remembered...Dogville), and I usually don't miss things unless they are too obvious or loose in the air. Other than being repetitive, which makes it too long, the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of noticing some perversions fed by our unconscious, hence the commercial success of most thrillers studied and used as basis for this theory. I really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of Mr. Zizek to revive Freud's theory, which has been numb for too long, specially in north America. Again, it's way over the top and I believe not to be a completely waste of time for I do believe most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood. What is the sentiment of this review? Choose your answer from: [A]. negative [B]. positive","output":"The sentiment of this review can be considered a mix of both positive and negative. However, with a few positive points like the interesting Freudian psychoanalysis, the energetic tone of the narration, and the effort to revive Freud's theory, it leans more towards a [B]. positive sentiment.

This could be perceived as a positive trait if referring to someone with deep knowledge of a specific subject or mastery over certain skills. On the other hand, it could also be seen negatively if it implies secretive or sneaky behavior. 2. \\"quietude\\": This term refers to a state of tranquility or peace. In general, this would be considered positive, as it suggests calmness and composure. 3. \\"and room noise\\": This typically refers to the ambient noise or background sounds present in a space. Given the context, this could be considered either positive or negative. If it suggests a person's ability to tune into these subtle sounds and use them to their advantage, it would be positive. However, if it implies that the subject is only capable of producing inconsequential noise or lacks substance, it may be perceived as negative.

I will add these together: -2966*g + 573*g = (-2966 + 573)*g = -2393*g So, the simplified equation is: -2393*g + 195552 = 3039*g Step 2: Move all terms with g to one side of the equation. To do this, I will add 2393*g to both sides of the equation: -2393*g + 2393*g + 195552 = 3039*g + 2393*g This simplifies to: 195552 = 5432*g Step 3: Solve for g.

According to the magazine's annual rich list, Mr Gates' fortune rose to 86bn, from 75bn, followed by investor Warren Buffett, up 14.8bn to 75.6bn. It was bad news for US President Donald Trump, who slipped 220 spots to 544 and must now rub along on just 3.5bn. Forbes said the 1bn fall in his wealth was due to the slow US property market. There were 183 tech billionaires on the Forbes list, with a combined 1tn in wealth. The list is dominated by US billionaires. Others in the top 10 included Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who moved up to number three with the biggest gain of any person on the planet, a 27.6bn rise in his fortune of 72.8bn. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was number five and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison was number seven. The global population of billionaires, now put at a record 2,043, marks the biggest annual increase in the 31 years since the magazine began compiling the list. The number of US billionaires on the list was 565, which Forbes attributed to the recent stock market surge since Mr Trump's November 2016 election. China was second with 319 billionaires, and Germany was third with 114. Forbes' top ten: The number of women on the list rose to 227 from 202, giving them a collective net worth of 852.8bn. For the second year running France's Liliane Bettencourt, the L'Oreal cosmetics heiress, was the world's wealthiest woman with a 39.5bn net worth. Most of the richest women inherited their fortune, Forbes said. But the list also contained 15 new \\"self-made\\" women, mostly from Asian countries, including Vietnam's Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao of budget airline VietJet air. Forbes attributed the US president's slide down the list to the sluggish Manhattan property market, which is responsible for a disproportionate amount of his wealth. \\"Forty percent of Donald Trump's fortune is tied up in Trump Tower and eight buildings within one mile of it,\\" Forbes said. \\"Lately, the neighbourhood has been struggling - relatively speaking.\\" The magazine also said that his wealth was hit by 66m in political spending on his successful presidential campaign, as well as 25m to settle litigation he allegedly ripped off students at Trump University. Mr Trump would also have missed the big Wall Street rally following his election, assuming he sold off all of his shares during last  year's campaign, the magazine said. But not all of the trends were negative for Mr Trump. The magazine estimated the worth of the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida rose 25m due to post-election exposure.

Answer the following question: There are stories about two U.S . presidents,Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren,which attempt to explain the American English term OK.We don't know if either story is true,but they are both interesting. The first explanation is based on the fact that President Jackson had very little education.In fact,he had difficulty reading and writing.When important papers came to Jackson,he tried to read them and then had his assistants explain what they said.If he approved of a paper, he would write \\"all correct\\"on it.The problem was that he didn't know how to spell.So what he really wrote was \\"ol korekt\\".After a while,he shortened that term to \\"OK\\".

What makes or breaks this spot for you, is whether you like their \\"twists\\" on sushi.  All my nigiri had sauces on them.  I am used to plain fish/rice, maybe a little lemon or wasabi hiding in there, but they used sauces.  I liked MOST of the combinations...others didn't do much for me and wished they were plain.  (I hear you can just request without the sauces though).  The most important thing though, the fish tasted fresh and the service was good, although I went dry a few times on the drinks.  The food comes fast, and empty plates disappear quickly.  You have to try the tuna carpaccio, the tostada, and they other apps.  Those were probably the highlight of the night for myself.  A nice change from the norm....although they do limit you to 1PP.  This place is very small though.  We came around 11pm on a Tuesday night, and we still had to wait 30min for a table.

As a former Ohio substitute teacher at Columbus' East High School has learned, not doing so could land you in jail. Yesterday, a judge sentenced long-term temp Sheila Kearns to three years of probation, plus 90 days in jail as a condition, after Kearns showed the unrated movie The ABCs of Death to five classes of students when she was asked to fill in for a Spanish teacher in April 2013, the Columbus Dispatch reports. She was fired two months later. Kearns, 58, who doesn't speak Spanish, said she didn't watch the movie beforehand and had her back to the TV all day. What she reportedly missed: grisly deaths, full-frontal nudity, and graphic sex in movie chapters titled \\"E is for Exterminate\\" and \\"O is for Orgasm,\\" reports the AP. Kearns, who apologized in court, was convicted of four counts of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles (the students were 14 to 18) in January. A jury cleared her of one count, believing Kearns didn't know the movie's content during the first showing. But a student testified that Kearns did watch the movie, and the jury appeared to side with Judge Charles A. Schneider, who said Kearns' claim that she didn't watch it was \\"unconscionable. There's no way you'll persuade me that's what happened.\\" He also slammed Columbus public schools. \\"This is what happens when you put a teacher in a class that she cannot teach,\\" he said. Schneider ordered Kearns to report to jail on April 10, but the sentence will be delayed as Kearns' lawyer appeals her conviction. (Another substitute teacher was fired for asking kids about her love life.) Article:","output":"Title: The Consequences of a Classroom Film Unwatched: Ohio Substitute Teacher Faces Jail Time In the rich tapestry of teaching, a key tip for teachers has come to the fore following a critical incident in Columbus' East High School in Ohio. The critical piece of advice - always screen a film before you show it to your students. A lesson most unfortunately learned by Sheila Kearns, a substitute teacher, who was sentenced to three years of probation and 90 days in jail for failing to abide by it.  Residing in a school culture that not only treasures education but also the well-being of students, the episode serves as a stark reminder of the significant responsibility placed upon educators. What a teacher decides to bring into the classroom environment affects the learning trajectory of students, as Kearns discovered to her dismay. She was asked to fill-in for a Spanish teacher in April 2013, an incident that ended up having dire consequences both for her and the five classes of students exposed to the unrated movie, 'The ABCs of Death.' Two months after the incident, Kearns' teaching journey took a turn for the worse. She was fired after the school discovered the nature of the movie shown to students aged 14 to 18 years old. The graphic movie encompassed a myriad of hard-hitting scenes involving grisly deaths, full-frontal nudity, and positions of sexual intimacy. It was a stark contrast from what would normally be expected in a classroom setting. The class viewing ended up more aligned with chapters titled \\"E is for Exterminate\\" and \\"O is for Orgasm,\\" rather than a day of learning Spanish. Kearns, who was also handed a conviction of four counts of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles, did express remorse over her actions. However, as a key argument in her defense, Kearns claimed that she was not aware of the movie content, explaining she hadn't watched the material beforehand and had her back to the screen throughout the day.  However, her claims were met with skepticism. A student contradicted Kearns' assertion, testifying that the substitute teacher had indeed watched the movie. This testimony seemingly tipped the scales in favor of Judge Charles A. Schneider's derogatory conclusion. Refuting Kearns' claim, Judge Schneider mentioned, \\"There's no way you'll persuade me that's what happened.\\" He also highlighted the imprudence of the Columbus public schools, criticizing the decision to assign a teacher to a class she wasn't equipped to teach. This incident has led to Kearns staring down the barrel of her sentence. However, the start of her sentence, scheduled for April 10, will be delayed due to an appeal launched by Kearns' attorney against her conviction. The incident not only raises a red-flag on Kearns' actions but also points rankled fingers at the flaws prevalent in the education system. While it underlines the critical requirement for educators to fully comprehend and vet the content they bring in their classrooms, it also amplifies the fact that the task of placing a teacher in a role should be done judiciously by the schools.  As the story of Kearns unravels, it stands as a grim reminder of the power wielded by educators, and the severe consequences that can unfold when not used judiciously. It underscores a fundamental lesson - watching and understanding a movie's content before showing it in class is not merely a precaution, but a necessity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.  Question: \\"Why was Melaka not an ideal place for most people to live in its early days?\\" Answer: \\"It was full of pirates\\" Is this answer correct?

Hypothesis: Both dogs are black and brown. Now let us analyze the hypothesis: 1. It states that there are two dogs involved in the situation. 2. The dogs have a combination of black and brown colors (i.e., each dog has both black and brown fur). For the hypothesis to hold true, there must be evidence in the premise supporting each aspect of the hypothesis. Let's compare the information from the premise with the hypothesis. 1. The presence of a black dog can be confirmed through the premise. 2. The premise also mentions another dog, but it doesn't provide details about the color of this second dog, only stating that it is being playfully bitten by the black dog. 3. The setting of the living room is not essential in determining the truth value of the hypothesis, as it is unrelated to the colors of the dogs involved. Given the information in the premise, we cannot confirm whether the second dog is black and brown or any other possible color combination. As such, it is not possible to conclusively state that the hypothesis is true based solely on the truth of the premise. There is insufficient information available. In conclusion, while the premise might be accurate, it does not provide enough evidence to establish the truth of the hypothesis.

First, he must divorce his vulgar and promiscuous wife Miriam (Laura Elliott). On a train, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) recognizes Guy and knows about his marital situation from the gossip pages. Bruno introduces himself, then proposes an idea for the perfect homicide: he and Guy should \\"swap murders\\". Bruno will murder Miriam, and in exchange Guy will kill Bruno's despised father. Each would be killing a stranger. Having no identifiable motive for the crimes, neither would be suspects. Guy humors Bruno's absurd murder plot by pretending to find it amusing.

Pregnant by someone else, she now refuses to give Guy a divorce and threatens to cause a scandal.

During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever.

Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"A dog jogs through the grass.\\", is the sentence \\"a dog runs through grass\\" a true sentence? Available choices: [I] yes. [II] it is not possible to tell. [III] no.","output":"[I] yes. The sentence \\"A dog jogs through the grass.\\" describes a scenario in which a dog is moving through grass at a jogging pace. The word \\"jog\\" generally means to run at a steady or gentle pace. Thus, it implies that the dog is running but not as fast as it would sprint. Meanwhile, the alternative sentence, \\"A dog runs through grass,\\" is a simplified version of the original, utilizing the broader term \\"runs\\" instead of the more specific \\"jogs.\\" However, it is essential to note that the word \\"runs\\" encompasses various speeds - from gentle jogging to more rapid sprinting. Therefore, the second sentence remains truthful to the original, as it refers to a dog moving, running, or proceeding in the grass, which indeed could include jogging. It is important also to consider that the alternative sentence has omitted the word \\"the\\" before \\"grass.\\" Despite this omission, the meaning still stands that a dog is running through some grass. In conclusion, given the contexts of both sentences that describe a dog in motion through grass, the sentence \\"a dog runs through grass\\" can be considered a true sentence based on the initial sentence, \\"A dog jogs through the grass.\\" As a result, the correct choice is [I] yes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Their music is so repetitive and lacks depth. Jake: I'm with Declan on this one. I tried listening to that new single you mentioned, and it just sounds like everything else they've put out. Annie: You guys just don't appreciate their music. They're so talented, and each song is a unique blend of different styles and influences! Plus, their lyrics are so meaningful. Shayla: Exactly! They talk about real issues that people face, like heartbreak, loneliness, and finding one's own identity. What's not to like? Declan: I don't deny that they might have some interesting things to say, but the way they present it is just... boring. Don't you two ever feel like branching out and listening to other genres?

Question: -  Coal is burned in a boiler - Steam is produced under pressure - Flows into a turbine - The turbine spins  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process after the turbine spins is typically utilizing the mechanical energy generated by the spinning turbine to produce electricity. This is achieved when the spinning turbine is connected to an electrical generator, which converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy. Once the electricity is generated, it is then transmitted through power lines to supply homes, businesses, and industries. Meanwhile, the condensed steam that loses its thermal energy in the turbine is returned to the boiler for reheating, and the cycle begins anew.

Nelson could remain calm under pressure.","output":"(a). Kevin could remain calm under pressure. Handling emergencies was never very difficult for Kevin but it was for Nelson because Kevin could remain calm under pressure. This ability had always come naturally to Kevin, and it earned him the admiration of his friends and colleagues. Nelson, on the other hand, was known to be prone to anxiety in high-pressure situations. Despite his competence and expertise in many fields, his tendency to get flustered in emergencies often held him back. Kevin and Nelson lived in a small rural town in the Midwest, where they worked together at the local fire department. The town had a history of mysterious fires, and it was up to them to keep their community safe from these blazes. Their contrasting abilities to handle emergencies had led them down different paths in their careers—Kevin served as the lead firefighter, while Nelson coordinated dispatch and communication efforts. One day, a fire raged through a local chemical plant, and there was a risk of hazardous substances getting released into the air, threatening the safety of the town. Kevin, as the leader of the firefighting team, was tasked with extinguishing the blaze before it could spread any further. It was a dangerous mission, with numerous lives at stake, and the penalty for failure could be devastating. Meanwhile, Nelson was in the command center, monitoring the situation and coordinating the response efforts. Despite his anxiety, he knew he had an essential role to play in this high-stakes situation. He was responsible for tracking the fire's progress, alerting nearby residents, and keeping his team informed of any potential dangers. As the firefighters arrived at the scene, Kevin's natural ability to remain calm under pressure proved crucial in the face of such a challenging emergency. He quickly assessed the situation, directed his team, and established a safe perimeter before beginning a resolute attack on the flames. His clear-headed decisiveness and leadership were key factors in navigating the dangers they faced. Back at the command center, Nelson tried his best to maintain control over his anxiety, knowing that his abilities could be instrumental in saving lives. It was hard for him to concentrate, but he focused all his energy on his tasks, ensuring that firefighters were well informed about the dangers they faced and directing them as necessary. As the flames roared through the chemical plant, the teams faced numerous challenges - toxic smoke filling the air; chemicals reacting with the intense heat; and exploding containers, which sent debris flying across the area. But, through it all, the dedicated team of Kevin and Nelson remained resolute in their goals of extinguishing the blaze and keeping their town safe. They recognized that they both played vital but different roles in the outcome of this emergency. Gradually, the fire was brought under control, and the danger to the town was averted. The residents breathed a collective sigh of relief and were grateful for the bravery and skill their local firefighting heroes had displayed. Nelson, despite his challenges, had been able to push through his anxiety and contribute to the team's hard-fought victory. In the end, this emergency had shown Kevin and Nelson the true value of teamwork – recognizing and utilizing each other's strengths while supporting one another through their weaknesses. Kevin's calm demeanor in the face of crisis complemented Nelson's expertise in coordination and communication. This emergency had not only deepened their mutual respect but also strengthened their bond as friends and colleagues."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: When you meet someone for the first time, do you put across a good impression? And what do we mean by \\"good\\" in the context? According to Presence, a new book by Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy, people assess you on two main criteria when they first meet you: 1. Can I trust this person? 2. Can I respect this person? Your level of trustworthiness, or warmth, is the most important factor in how people initially admire you, Cuddy says-yet many mistakenly believe that the second factor,characterised as competence, is more important.\\"From an evolutionary aspect,\\"Cuddy writes,\\"it is more important to our survival to know whether a person deserves our trust.\\" While displaying competence is certainly beneficial, particularly in a work setting, Cuddy warns that focusing on winning people's respect, while failing to win their trust, can backfire-a common problem for young professionals attempting to make a good impression early on in their careers. \\"If someone you're trying to influence doesn't trust you, you're not going to get very far\\", Cuddy says, \\"A warm, trustworthy person who is also strong elicits  admiration, but only after you've established trust does your strength become a gift rather than a threat.\\" In Cuddy's book she also explains some of the science that can help you spot a liar. When a person is lying there is likely to be differences between what they are saying and what they are doing, she suggests. \\"Lying is hard work,\\" she writes, \\"We're telling one story while suppressing another, and most of us are experiencing psychological guilt about doing this, which we're also trying suppress.

Information:  - The New Testament (Koine Greek:   , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.  - A traveling carnival (US English), usually simply called a carnival, is an amusement show that may be made up of amusement rides, food vendors, merchandise vendors, games of chance and skill, thrill acts, and animal acts. A traveling carnival is not set up at a permanent location, like an amusement park, but is moved from place to place. Its roots are similar to the 19th century circus with both being set up in open fields near or in town and moving to a new location after a period of time. Unlike traditional carnival celebrations, the North American traveling carnival is not tied to a religious observance.  - Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.  - A holiday is a day set aside by custom or by law on which normal activities, especially business or work, are suspended or reduced. Generally, holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or tradition of cultural or religious significance. Holidays may be designated by governments, religious institutions, or other groups or organizations. The degree to which normal activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job being held or even personal choices.  - The resurrection of Jesus is the Christian religious belief that, after being put to death, Jesus rose again from the dead. It is the central tenet of Christian theology and part of the Nicene Creed: \\"On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures\\".  - A travelling funfair, often simply called a fair, is a small to medium-sized travelling show primarily composed of stalls and other amusements.  - Calvary, also Gagulta, was, according to the Gospels, a site immediately outside Jerusalem's walls where Jesus was crucified. \\"Golgotha(s)\\" is the Greek transcription in the New Testament of the Aramaic term \\"Gagultâ\\". The Bible translates the term to mean \\"place of [the] skull\\", which in Greek is   (\\"Kraníou Tópos\\"), and in Latin is \\"Calvariæ Locus\\", from which the English word \\"Calvary\\" is derived.  - A fair (archaic: faire or fayre) is a gathering of people for a variety of entertainment or commercial activities. It is normally of the essence of a fair that it is temporary with scheduled times lasting from an afternoon to several weeks.  - Great Lent, or the Great Fast, (Greek:   or  , meaning \\"Great 40 Days,\\" and \\"Great Fast,\\" respectively) is the most important fasting season in the church year in the Byzantine Rite of the Eastern Orthodox Church including Western Rite Orthodoxy and the Eastern Catholic Churches, which prepares Christians for the greatest feast of the church year, Pascha (Easter).  - Lent (Latin: Quadragesima: \\"Fortieth\\") is a solemn religious observance in the liturgical calendar that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends approximately six weeks later, before Easter Sunday. The purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer through prayer, doing penance, repentance of sins, almsgiving, atonement, and self-denial. This event is observed by Christians in the Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic Churches. Some Anabaptist and evangelical churches also observe the Lenten season. Its institutional purpose is heightened in the annual commemoration of Holy Week, marking the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus, which recalls the tradition and events of the New Testament beginning on Friday of Sorrows, further climaxing on Jesus' crucifixion on Good Friday, which ultimately culminates in the joyful celebration on Easter Sunday of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Efteling is a fantasy-themed amusement park in Kaatsheuvel in the Netherlands. The attractions are based on elements from ancient myths and legends, fairy tales, fables, and folklore.  - The Flying Dutchman ( or \`\` De Vliegende Hollander '' in Dutch ) is a combination of a water coaster and a dark ride in amusement park Efteling in the Netherlands . It should have gone operational on April 16 , 2006 Easter , exactly 328 years after the disappearance of the legendary Dutch man of war The Flying Dutchman ; due to construction problems the opening was postponed to April 1 , 2007 .  - Easter, also called Pascha \\"(Greek/Latin)\\" or Resurrection Sunday, is a festival and holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, described in the New Testament as having occurred on the third day of his burial after his crucifixion by Romans at Calvary 30 AD. It is the culmination of the Passion of Jesus, preceded by Lent (or Great Lent), a forty-day period of fasting, prayer, and penance.  - Resurrection is the concept of a living being coming back to life after death. In a number of ancient religions, a dying-and-rising god is a deity which dies and resurrects. The death and resurrection of Jesus, an example of resurrection, is the central focus of Christianity.  - Kaatsheuvel is a village in the Dutch province of North Brabant, situated along highways N261 and N628. With a population of roughly 16,600, it is the largest village in and the capital of the municipality of Loon op Zand, which also consists of the villages of De Moer and Loon op Zand. As Kaatsheuvel is a municipality capital, it had a town hall located in the town centre. The town hall was torn down in 2010 as part of an ambitious plan to build a lively new town centre. Currently the new town centre is being built, working title \\"Bruisend Dorpshart\\" (Sparkling Village's Heart). Kaatsheuvel is (internationally) well known for the Efteling theme park and a gateway to National Park Loonse en Drunense Duinen.  - An amusement park (sometimes referred to as a funfair) or theme park is a group of entertainment attractions, rides, and other events in a location for the enjoyment of large numbers of people. Amusement parks have a fixed location, as opposed to travelling funfairs and traveling carnivals, and are more elaborate than simple city parks or playgrounds, usually providing attractions meant to cater specifically to certain age groups, as well as some that are aimed towards all ages. Theme parks, a specific type of amusement park, are usually much more intricately themed to a certain subject or group of subjects than normal amusement parks.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Penance is repentance of sins as well as the proper name of the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation/Confession. It also plays a part in non-sacramental confession among Lutherans and other Protestants. The word \\"penance\\" derives from Old French and Latin \\"paenitentia\\", both of which derive from the same root meaning repentance, the desire to be forgiven (in English see contrition). Penance and repentance, similar in their derivation and original sense, have come to symbolize conflicting views of the essence of repentance, arising from the controversy as to the respective merits of \\"faith\\" and \\"good works\\". Word derivations occur in many languages.  - In Christianity, the Passion (from Late Latin: \\"passionem\\" \\"suffering, enduring\\") is the short final period in the life of Jesus covering his entrance visit to Jerusalem and leading to his crucifixion on Mount Calvary, defining the climactic event central to Christian doctrine of Salvation History.   - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics.  - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.  - Fasting is a willing abstinence or reduction from some or all food, drink, or both, for a period of time. An absolute fast (dry fasting) is normally defined as abstinence from all food and liquid for a defined period, usually a period of 24 hours, or a number of days. Water fasting allows drinking water but nothing else. Other fasts may be partially restrictive, limiting only particular foods or substances. A fast may also be intermittent in nature. Fasting practices may preclude intercourse and other activities as well as food.

Their sound during their early inception as Warsaw was described as generic and \\"undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock\\". Critic Simon Reynolds observed how the band's originality only \\"really became apparent as the songs got slower\\", and their music took on a \\"sparse\\" quality. According to Reynolds, \\"Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris' drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.\\" According to music critic Jon Savage, \\"Joy Division were not punk but they were directly inspired by its energy\\". In 1994 Sumner said the band's characteristic sound \\"came out naturally: I'm more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I liked my guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn't hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers. To me, a drummer in the band is the clock, but Steve wouldn't be the clock, because he's passive: he would follow the rhythm of the band, which gave us our own edge.\\"  By Closer, Curtis had adapted a low baritone voice, drawing comparisons to Jim Morrison of the Doors (one of Curtis's favourite bands).  Sumner largely acted as the band's director, a role he continued in New Order. While Sumner was the group's primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument on a few recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, \\"He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, because no one else would play like Ian\\". During the recording sessions for Closer, Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody.  Hannett \\"dedicated himself to capturing and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality\\". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space. The producer instead aimed to create a more expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, \\"[Joy Division] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't have a clue. They didn't argue\\". Hannett demanded clean and clear \\"sound separation\\" not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit. Morris recalled, \\"Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he'd get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any bleed-through of sound\\". Music journalist Richard Cook noted that Hannett's role was \\"crucial\\". There are \\"devices of distance\\" in his production and \\"the sound is an illusion of physicality\\". Answer this question \\"What did others say about their music style?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Others said that Joy Division's music style quickly evolved from punk roots to a more original, slower, and sparse sound.

Obama calls on Europeans to help solve global woes By Kathy Kiely, USA TODAY BERLIN  Barack Obama is betting he can win votes at home by proving he can win hearts abroad. The Democratic presidential candidate, as he neared the end of his seven-country foreign trip, staged an unusual public rally here Thursday that drew more than 200,000 people to a historic park that is Berlin's equivalent of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It was the emotional high point of a trip that demonstrated that Obama has the staying power for the rigors of a fall campaign and the star power to draw a big, enthusiastic crowd into a foreign capital. Obama closes out his 16,000-mile odyssey, which began in Afghanistan and Iraq, with calls on French President Nicolas Sarkozy today and several top British leaders, including Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Saturday. For Obama, the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that \\"was necessary to pass,\\" said Edward Haley, a specialist in politics and international relations at Claremont McKenna College in California. \\"It looks as if he's done far better than just passing. He's aced this tour,\\" Haley added. \\"If there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage, I think he's more than answered that. He hasn't put a foot wrong in any of these places.\\" Getting a head start on the role he hopes to play as leader of the free world, Obama in Berlin made a direct appeal to citizens of other countries to help solve global problems such as terrorism, climate change, nuclear weapons proliferation, and free and fair trade. \\"Now is the time to join together, through constant cooperation, strong institutions, shared sacrifice, and a global commitment to progress, to meet the challenges of the 21st century,\\" Obama declared at a dramatic sunset appearance that had all the trappings of a campaign rally. He promised a new style of international leadership that would involve close consultations with U.S. allies. \\"America has no better partner than Europe,\\" he said. Republican candidate John McCain suggested that Obama is getting ahead of the U.S. electorate. Poking fun at his Democratic rival's globe-trotting, McCain dined Thursday at a German restaurant in Columbus, Ohio. \\"I'd love to give a speech in Germany,\\" McCain said at Schmidt's Sausage Haus und Restaurant, where he had bratwurst with local business leaders. \\"But I'd much prefer to do it as president of the United States rather than as a candidate for president.\\" The Obama's Berlin audience stretched almost a mile from the Siegessaule, an ornate victory column commemorating German victories in 19th century wars, to the Brandenburg Gate, which divided East Berlin from West Berlin during the Cold War. The crowd dwarfed Obama's largest U.S. crowd, 75,000 May 18 in Oregon. Obama used the once bifurcated city as a symbol of the divisions he wants to overcome if elected president. He urged Europeans to take up \\"the burdens of global leadership,\\" borrowing themes from his campaign speeches. \\"People of Berlin — people of the world — this is our moment. This is our time,\\" Obama said. A once obscure member of the Illinois Legislature until he rocketed to national prominence after a speech at the Democratic National Convention four years ago, the 46-year-old, first-term senator was received respectfully by leaders from Afghanistan to Jerusalem to here. After hosting Obama to an intimate dinner at his private residence, Jordan's King Abdullah II personally chauffeured him to the airport in the royal Mercedes. Perhaps most significantly, Obama's 16-month timetable for withdrawing U.S. combat troops won a qualified endorsement from Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki through the government's spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh. Obama's appearance in Berlin drew such large throngs of curiosity seekers that city officials had to set up police lines around his hotel. \\"He reminds me of the Kennedys,\\" said Beth Woodward, an American who teaches the children of military personnel stationed in Europe. She took the train from Frankfurt to see Obama speak. Obama took a moment of his speech to indulge in a little flag-waving overseas. Though he said there's room for improvement in some aspects of the USA — promising to be a better and more open partner with foreign allies — Obama described himself as \\"a proud citizen of the United States\\" and told his audience \\"how much I love America.\\" Not all of Obama's listeners were won over. \\"I wasn't impressed,\\" said Berliner Gabriele Seye. \\"He is like all the Americans. They see America as the savior of the world.\\" Contributing: Jill Lawrence and David M. Jackson in Washington, D.C.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he urged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to directly engage with Washington to salvage the June 12 nuclear summit with the U.S., when the two leaders held a surprise second inter-Korean summit Saturday. “I emphasized that the two sides must directly communicate in order to eradicate any misunderstandings, and preliminary talks through working-level negotiations on key agendas are necessary,” said President Moon at a press briefing in Seoul Sunday. North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security...

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? ludicrous attempt","output":"The phrase \\"ludicrous attempt\\" can be considered negative when assessing its connotation and potential inferences. To fully evaluate the phrase, it's crucial to break down the two primary words that make up the phrase: 1. Ludicrous - The word ludicrous has a negative connotation, as it is derived from the Latin word \\"ludicrus,\\" which means \\"sportive\\" or \\"intended for play.\\" In modern English, ludicrous is typically used to describe something that is so absurd, outrageous, or preposterous that it evokes a sense of amusement, disbelief, or sometimes a mixture of both. 2. Attempt - The second term, \\"attempt,\\" does not necessarily carry a positive or negative connotation when contextualized on its own. The word primarily describes an effort to achieve or accomplish something, whether it be a goal, task, or aspiration. As such, its connotation might change based on the results of the endeavor and whether or not it is perceived as being successful or unsuccessful. When combining these two words into the phrase \\"ludicrous attempt,\\" the negative characteristics of the term \\"ludicrous\\" tend to overshadow the neutrality of the word \\"attempt.\\" As a result, the phrase can generally be interpreted as a criticism or disapproval of someone's effort to achieve or accomplish something, often implying that their manner of pursuing or engaging in the task was either absurd, ridiculous, or lacking in logic. However, the precise meaning and degree of negativity attached to \\"ludicrous attempt\\" may depend on the context in which it is used. For instance, the phrase might be deployed in a lighthearted or joking manner when discussing a playful or harmless situation that resulted in failure. In such cases, the negativity present might be less harsh or severe and infused with a humorous or teasing tone. Conversely, \\"ludicrous attempt\\" may be employed to underscore the utter foolishness or irrationality of someone's actions, particularly when the stakes of the situation are high or the consequences dire. Ultimately, the degree of negativity attributed to the phrase \\"ludicrous attempt\\" will rely on the surrounding context, but in general, it leans towards a negative interpretation."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

When they arrive, he claims that he qualifies for entry under an exception for those who helped Allied soldiers during the war, but all he knows about the paratrooper he hid from the enemy is that his name is Tom and he plays clarinet in a jazz band in New York City's Times Square.The immigration authorities led by Inspector Bailey say that without better documentation he must be sent back to Europe. He jumps off the ship, breaking some ribs, and starts searching for Tom. He encounters an unemployed ex-factory worker named Maggie Summers. When she steals a coat in a restaurant, Peter helps her elude the police. They go to her apartment, where she tends his injury as best she can and learns his story. When her landlady, Mrs. Hinckley, threatens to evict her for being behind on her rent, Peter gives her all the money he has. Eddie Hinckley, the landlady's  son, barges in and tries to get amorous with Maggie. Peter bursts out of hiding and starts fighting him, but gets the worst of it. Maggie knocks Eddie out with a chair and flees with Peter.  The Hinckleys notify the police. Meanwhile, Tom sees Peter's picture on the front page of a newspaper. He wants to go to the immigration department, but his girlfriend Nancy persuades him to attend an important audition instead. Tom impresses band leader Jack Teagarden, but leaves abruptly to try to help Peter. Answer:","output":"The full name of the person who Mrs. Hinckley threatens to evict is Maggie Summers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

H. W. Johns, owner of a New York City Supply Shop for roofers , was responsible for(...) the opening of that first mine.     Mr. Johns was given a piece of asbestos which had been found in Italy. He experimented with the material and then showed its surprising powers to his customers. After putting on a pair of asbestos gloves, which looked much like ordinary work gloves, he took red-hot coals from the fireplace and played with them in his hands. How astonished the customers were to discover that he was not burned at all. You can well imagine that he had increasing business in asbestos roofing materials. However, because it was very expensive to transport (carry) them from Italy to the United States, Mr. Johns sent out a young scientist to seek a source nearer home. This young man found great vein , in the province of Quebec in Canada.     Ever since 1881 Quebec has led the world in the production of this unusual mineral, which is made up of magnesium, silicon, iron, and oxygen.

Here is an article: WASHINGTON — Republicans and Democrats sparred on Thursday over whether a new report by the Justice Department’s inspector general about the botched gun-tracking case known as Operation Fast and Furious meant that it was time for lawmakers to start wrapping up their own investigation. Members of both parties on the House oversight committee, which has been deeply divided during a long inquiry into the matter, praised the 471-page report by the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, as comprehensive and fair, even as each side sought vindication in different aspects of his findings. A major outstanding issue is a lawsuit by the House over a subpoena for internal Justice Department e-mails from 2011, after the operation had ended. President Obama asserted executive privilege over the documents. The chairman of the committee, Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, engineered a House vote this summer to cite Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. for contempt for refusing to turn over the materials. But the new report, released on Wednesday, quoted from the e-mails at length, and the Justice Department gave Congress more than 300 pages of material that it cited. “Although this report will not bring a complete end to the need for us to work with Justice to bring genuine reform to their process, it goes a long way toward that,” Mr. Issa said, adding, “Some materials contained in this report do help us because they are, in fact, many of the items that we wish we had received.” The ranking Democrat on the committee, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said the disclosures raised the possibility of resolving “any lingering issues without further conflict.” “With this action by the department,” he said, “I urge the committee to reconsider its position and settle the remnants of this dispute without resorting to unnecessary and costly litigation that nobody in this country wants.” But there were also signs of a continuing appetite by some Republicans to keep the investigation going. Several noted that the inspector general had not interviewed a handful of potential witnesses who did not work for the Justice Department. Operation Fast and Furious was an investigation from late 2009 to early 2011 into an Arizona-based gun-trafficking ring linked to a Mexican drug gang. During its course, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives used the tactic of gun-walking — not seizing illegal weapons in hopes of identifying more criminals and building a bigger case. In December 2010, two guns linked to the case were found after a shootout where a Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry, was killed. Over the past year, some Republicans and conservative media commentators have accused Mr. Holder and other senior Obama administration officials of orchestrating the gun-walking, saying they must be covering up their culpability. On Thursday, Democrats emphasized the inspector general’s conclusion that neither Mr. Holder nor other senior Justice Department officials had authorized the tactics in Operation Fast and Furious, which came to light after Agent Terry’s death. Instead, it found, the strategy was the handiwork of poorly supervised agents and prosecutors in Arizona who had used the same approach in a case during the George W. Bush administration. Republicans focused on the inspector general’s findings that wiretap applications for Operation Fast and Furious contained red flags that should have alerted the deputy assistant attorney general who approved them, Jason Weinstein, that agents might be refraining from seizing guns. The wiretap applications are not public records. Earlier this year, Mr. Issa claimed that the materials made clear that gun-walking was occurring, but Democrats who had also read them — including Mr. Holder — rejected that characterization. Mr. Weinstein resigned on Wednesday, portraying himself as having been unfairly made a scapegoat by the report.

Sentence 1: Oddly, this part of the 20/20 segment isn't quite as damaging to Ellis as the raw interview transcript was. This sentence states that there is a 20/20 segment that is less damaging to Ellis than the raw interview transcript. In other words, the raw interview transcript was more damaging to Ellis than this part of the 20/20 segment. Sentence 2: The interview portion of 20/20 was worse than this part is.

Currency exchange: How to get more for your downward dollars For Canadians travelling to the U.S., or to many other countries, there's no way around that falling Canadian dollar. But there are ways to save some money on your currency conversion. Three years ago, the Canadian and U.S. dollar were equal in value. The loonie has since fallen by nearly one-third. Options abound and it would be nice if there was a comparison-shopping website for currencies, but we didn't find one to recommend. Nilan Peiris, of TransferWise, a London-based online money-transfer company, says it's not easy for customers to find the best deal when it comes to money transfers. \\"It's almost impossible to figure out, as a consumer, if you're getting a good deal,\\" he says. Experts tell us, as a general rule, you will get the worst rates at currency booths in airports and train stations. It should cost less exchanging your Canadian dollars at your neighbourhood bank before leaving on your trip. But both the University of Toronto's Ambarish Chandra and Friedberg Mercantile Group's Michael Hart tell CBC News better rates exist elsewhere. \\"Banks do work to ensure that the rates they offer are competitive, and they can be better than other foreign exchange providers,\\" according to the Canadian Bankers Association. As a general rule, experts say you will get the worst rates at currency booths in airports and train stations. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press) Bank rates can be better, but they can also be worse. As with many purchases, it's \\"buyer beware.\\" Currency exchanges post rates for buying or selling a currency. Consumers want to exchange at a rate that's close to the midpoint of those buy-and-sell rates. Peiris refers to that mid-market rate as the only \\"real exchange rate.\\" So what's a consumer to do? Let's say your next-door neighbour has a relative who's just arrived from Europe and wants to convert Euros to Canadian dollars. Your neighbour, knowing you plan to soon leave for Europe, puts you in touch with her relative. If the two of you agree to make the exchange at the mid-market rate for the Euro and the dollar, you will both do better than you could at a bank or currency exchange. According to the Bank of Canada's rough estimate, the fee banks and other financial institutions charge consumers \\"is typically around four per cent of the amount being converted.\\" In the scenario above, both you and the neighbour's relative save that four per cent. Nilan Peiris is the vice-president of growth for TransferWise, a U.K.-based peer-to-peer online money transfer service. (TransferWise) That was the idea behind TransferWise. The company is currently improving their setup for transferring Canadian dollars, and by the end of March, Peiris says it will be cheap, easy and fast to transfer loonies into other major currencies using their website. TransferWise was started in 2011 by two friends who frequently travelled between the U.K. and Estonia: Kristo Kaarmann, a former management consultant, and Taavet Hinrikus, Skype's first employee. TransferWise does peer-to-peer money transfer, using the midpoint rate for the two currencies and charging a fee of about one per cent on transfers between 500 and 1,000 US, with the rate dropping slightly for larger amounts. The fee on a 50,000 transfer would be about 0.72 per cent. Peiris, the company's vice-president of growth, says TransferWire strives to be transparent with consumers. He views the rest of the industry as almost in collaboration \\"to obfuscate pricing and make it much more difficult for consumers to shop around.\\" If exchanging amounts over 5,000, U of T's Chandra recommends online currency exchanges. Chandra teaches business economics, with his current research focusing on travel and trade across the Canada-U.S. border. That includes websites like TransferWise, CanadianForex, XE Trade, NorthStar and Payline by International Currency Exchange. Ambarish Chandra, a business professor at the University of Toronto, says using your credit card for purchases in the U.S. will get you a slightly better rate than getting U.S. dollars at a bank. (Ken Jones/University of Toronto) In general, using these services requires some advance planning — the first time you use it, you will need to set up an account — and have bank accounts in both currencies. The exchange can take up to six business days but usually takes about three. You can pay off a foreign currency credit card this way, or use it to get cash, but that will require a visit to the bank. To get around not having the right foreign currency bank account, people sometimes have the money transferred to the account of a friend or relative where they will be travelling. In the trade, this is known as \\"using a friend as an ATM.\\" For most Canadian tourists going on short trips, most of the time Chandra advises using your credit card to make purchases in the U.S. and many other countries. Their exchange rate should be slightly better than the banks, he says. Expect to lose about 3.5 per cent using your credit card in the U.S., and more than four per cent in other countries. Frequent travellers can do even better using a U.S. dollar credit card, Chandra says. You may be able to get a card through a U.S. bank and some Canadian banks also offer U.S. credit cards, as well as U.S. dollar accounts. The key to saving is in how you pay that monthly credit card bill (and don't forget to check credit card fees). There are also credit cards available that don't charge foreign exchange transaction fees. Rogers Bank, from the telecom Rogers, offers one through MasterCard. Rogers says they don't add a 2.5-per-cent charge, the way the big banks do on their credit cards, and the exchange rate they use, for U.S. dollars at least, is the Bank of Canada's mid-market rate. The big bank credit cards use the MasterCard or Visa exchange rate, which costs the consumer another one per cent or so. Other credit cards that say they don't charge a foreign exchange fee include the Marriott Visa and Amazon Visa from Chase Canada. If you are travelling to a place where you have a friend or relative, you could do your currency exchange online and have the money sent to their bank account. You'll get a better rate and once you're there, they can easily withdraw the money. (Emrah Gurel/Associated Press) Chandra has another recommendation for a way to avoid foreign exchange fees. This method requires buying shares in an interlisted company on a Canadian stock exchange and then selling those shares on, say, a U.S. stock exchange. This method should get you U.S. dollars at the true mid-market rate, he says. He recommends this method for exchanging large sums and doing it through an online broker to keep the trade fees low. And of course, the stock price could go up or down in between your two trades. If you are trading large amounts, you can also negotiate a better rate than what the bank or exchange company posts, especially if you can prove other places are offering a better deal. While the loonie may be way down right now, Chandra advises against gaming the markets in hopes of getting a better rate. \\"It's not worth the trouble and the psychic costs of trying to look at the markets every day,\\" he says, adding that \\"you're very rarely going to win by a whole lot.\\" One of the best ways to save money on currency exchange is to pay with Canadian cash in the U.S. Despite the plunging loonie, some U.S. businesses still accept Canadian currency at par, although the number is dwindling. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"When traveling to another country, exchanging currency can be confusing and sometimes expensive. To get the best deal, try to exchange money at banks or online currency exchanges rather than at airports or train stations, and use credit cards when possible for slightly better rates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past.  The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions.  In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire. The tombs, chapel, exterior of Manjakamiadina and two traditional wooden houses (Besakana and Mahitsy) have since been restored with further restorations planned to continue until at least 2013.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that overcomes his prejudice? from the following article ?  MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea.  When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice.  Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya.

A. negative; B. positive; TEXT:Some of the best movies that are categorized as \\"comedies\\" actually blur between comedy and drama. \\"The Graduate\\" and \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\", which were made also in the late 1960's are perfect examples. Are they comedies with dramatic undertones, or dramas with a lot of humor? In many respects, \\"The Odd Couple\\" falls into this same category of being both comedy yet highly dramatic with deep underpinnings about human nature. Much of what happens may be funny to the audience but the characters are not laughing. Despite the rather light-hearted TV show of the 1970's, the original \\"Odd Couple\\" is not merely about a neat guy and messy guy who are forced to live together because of their marital situation. It's really about two opposites who must face why their marriages fell apart and how their detrimental idiosyncrasies reveal themselves outside of their marriage. Neatness, the characteristic of Felix Ungar (Jack Lemon perfectly cast) and messiness, the characteristic of Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau), are only the beginning and somewhat superficial. As the story unfolds, we find there is a lot more to these men than simply neatness versus messiness. Briefly, the story is really about Felix Ungar, who has to face an impending divorce from his wife Francis, who we never meet but is an important character throughout the story. On the verge of suicide, Ungar goes to the only place he knows: the apartment of Oscar Madison where a group of poker buddies hang out every so often. We learn that Ungar is not only a member of this \\"poker club\\" but the group knows what's happening to him and try, in their inept way, to help out. Madison figures the best way to help Ungar is to let him move in with him until his suicidal tendencies wear off. Unfortunately for Madison, he doesn't know what he's getting himself into. Madison is a carefree happy-go-lucky if rather irresponsible slob who's refrigerator was last cleaned probably when Herbert Hoover was still in the White House. Madison's idea of serving snacks is grabbing moldy cheese and sticking them in between two pieces of bread, and then throwing the contents of a bag of chips on the table. On the other hand, he enjoys booze and women, in short having a good time.  Ungar is not only altogether different, he is diametrically opposite. He is not only an obsessive neatness nut that finds more joy in disinfecting the apartment than meeting women but he knows more than most women do about cooking and fine eating. At one point, he calls his ex-wife, not to talk about reconciling, but to get her recipe for meatloaf. At another moment, Ungar was going to spend the rest of the evening cutting cabbage for coleslaw. When Madison seems unimpressed, Ungar finally confesses he was only doing it for his roommate because he can't stand coleslaw. Who is this guy? But he has another endearing trait: Felix is also a hypochondriac. He obsesses about his health to the point where he makes strange noises in public places claiming he's helping his sinuses. He seems to have every health condition in the book. And if they made up more, Felix would probably have them. Ultimately, he is overly self-absorbed. Running throughout the movie are references to marriage. At one point when Madison is trying to convince Ungar to move in, he says, \\"What do you want, a wedding ring?\\" But little does he know that it is not the neat guy who can't deal with the messy guy, but the other way around. Their friendship becomes an inadvertent hellish relationship. And the climax occurs when Oscar invites two lonely British sisters for a get-together with both comedic and tragic results. This is one of the best comedies of its type ever written and not to be missed, with superlative performances by Walter Matthau and Jack Lemon in roles that are hard to imagine better played by anyone else. It is unfortunate that writing of this caliber is sadly lacking from most comedies being produced today.","output":"B. positive"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Importance Foods that have similar carbohydrate content can differ in the amount they raise blood glucose. The effects of this property, called the glycemic index, on risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes are not well understood.      Objective To determine the effect of glycemic index and amount of total dietary carbohydrate on risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes.      Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized crossover-controlled feeding trial conducted in research units in academic medical centers, in which 163 overweight adults (systolic blood pressure, 120-159 mm Hg) were given 4 complete diets that contained all of their meals, snacks, and calorie-containing beverages, each for 5 weeks, and completed at least 2 study diets. The first participant was enrolled April 1, 2008; the last participant finished December 22, 2010. For any pair of the 4 diets, there were 135 to 150 participants contributing at least 1 primary outcome measure.      Interventions (1) A high–glycemic index (65% on the glucose scale), high-carbohydrate diet (58% energy); (2) a low–glycemic index (40%), high-carbohydrate diet; (3) a high–glycemic index, low-carbohydrate diet (40% energy); and (4) a low–glycemic index, low-carbohydrate diet. Each diet was based on a healthful DASH-type diet.      Main Outcomes and Measures The 5 primary outcomes were insulin sensitivity, determined from the areas under the curves of glucose and insulin levels during an oral glucose tolerance test; levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides; and systolic blood pressure.      Results At high dietary carbohydrate content, the low– compared with high–glycemic index level decreased insulin sensitivity from 8.9 to 7.1 units (−20%, P = .002); increased LDL cholesterol from 139 to 147 mg/dL (6%, P ≤ .001); and did not affect levels of HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, or blood pressure. At low carbohydrate content, the low– compared with high–glycemic index level did not affect the outcomes except for decreasing triglycerides from 91 to 86 mg/dL (−5%, P = .02). In the primary diet contrast, the low–glycemic index, low-carbohydrate diet, compared with the high–glycemic index, high-carbohydrate diet, did not affect insulin sensitivity, systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, or HDL cholesterol but did lower triglycerides from 111 to 86 mg/dL (−23%, P ≤ .001).      Conclusions and Relevance In this 5-week controlled feeding study, diets with low glycemic index of dietary carbohydrate, compared with high glycemic index of dietary carbohydrate, did not result in improvements in insulin sensitivity, lipid levels, or systolic blood pressure. In the context of an overall DASH-type diet, using glycemic index to select specific foods may not improve cardiovascular risk factors or insulin resistance.      Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00608049 ||||| If you generally eat a heart-healthy diet, then you might have one fewer factor to worry about: the \\"glycemic index\\" of the carbs you eat, new research suggests.      In a new study, researchers looked at how people's health is affected by the types of carbs they eat, using one measure of carbohydrates called the glycemic index. This index is a number, between 1 and 100, that reflects how much a given carb raises your blood sugar levels. For example, carbs such as apples and oatmeal have a low glycemic index, meaning they raise blood sugar less than carbs with a higher glycemic index, such as white bread and corn flakes.      The researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Harvard Medical School set out to examine whether healthy diets with a low glycemic index would provide more heart health benefits compared with similarly healthy diets that have a higher glycemic index. [5 Diets That Fight Diseases]      The researchers gave special diets to 163 overweight men and women for five weeks, and tracked their blood pressure, cholesterol levels and sensitivity to insulin. The participants were on four different diets that all contained the same number of calories, but two were high in carbohydrates and two were low in carbohydrates. Among the two that were high in carbs, one had a high glycemic index and the other had a low index. Similarly, of the two diets that were low in carbs, one had a high glycemic index and the other had a low one.      The results showed that the glycemic index of the diet didn't matter. The participants on diets with a low glycemic index did not have improvements in their insulin sensitivity, cholesterol levels or blood pressure during the study, according to the findings published today (Dec. 16) in the journal JAMA.      \\"We were really surprised,\\" says co-author Dr. Lawrence Appel, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins. \\"We did not detect any clear benefit of the low glycemic index diets on the major risk factors for heart disease, and we found no evidence of benefit for diabetes prevention.\\"      All four diets in the study were based on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. The DASH diet is designed to help treat or prevent high blood pressure by reducing people's salt intake and including foods rich in nutrients that help lower blood pressure, such as potassium, calcium and magnesium.      \\"The unexpected findings\\" of the study suggest that the concept of glycemic index is less important than previously thought,\\" Dr. Robert Eckel, a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado, wrote in an editorial accompanying the study. \\"These findings should therefore direct attention back to the importance of maintaining an overall heart-healthy lifestyle, including diet pattern,\\" he said.      An overall heart-healthy lifestyle includes the basic rules that most people already know, Appel said. \\"Don't drink sugar-sweetened drinks. Try to eat fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Try to avoid sweets, salt and foods high in saturated and trans fats. People who follow these principles will reap the benefits,\\" he said.      Email Bahar Gholipour.

Available choices: (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","output":"(C). no Based on the given premise, \\"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz, agreed Tommy with a grin,\\" the hypothesis \\"Tommy frowned, refused and instead said he would stroll round to the Ritz\\" is not true. There are several key points to consider when analyzing this premise and comparing it to the hypothesis: 1. Tommy's emotions: In the premise, Tommy is described as grinning when he agrees to the idea of strolling to the Ritz. This indicates a positive emotion and an acceptance of the suggestion. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that Tommy frowned, which typically represents a negative emotion or disagreement. These two descriptions of emotions are contradicting, meaning the hypothesis is not consistent with the premise. 2. Tommy's response: In the premise, Tommy seems to be accepting the idea of going to the Ritz, as evidenced by his agreement with a grin. His response is consistent with the action of strolling to the Ritz. In contrast, the hypothesis suggests that Tommy initially refused before saying he would stroll to the Ritz. This narrative does not align with the premise, where Tommy appears to be in agreement from the beginning. 3. Tone and context: The overall tone of the premise is more positive and casual, with Tommy agreeing to the idea of going to the Ritz while grinning. The hypothesis changes the tone to a more negative and conflicting scenario, where he first refuses and then changes his mind to stroll around the Ritz. This shift in tone and context does not match the original premise. In conclusion, based on the analysis of the key points mentioned above, the hypothesis \\"Tommy frowned, refused and instead said he would stroll round to the Ritz\\" is not true when considering the given premise \\"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz, agreed Tommy with a grin.\\" These situations are not consistent in terms of Tommy's emotions, his response, and the overall tone and context.

Review title: A somewhat pretentious classic Product review: This record is a classic. This is pure pop music at its best. I partially agree with another reviewer who thought that it was a pretentious album because of all the orchestral arragements. I think that only 2 songs could be so labeled. But for an album to have songs like ELDORADO and Mr. Kingdom and many others, it is just impossible to give it a bad review. If you buy this album, I assure you you will not regret it. Some of the sounds are somewhat dated but, you will understand that the melodies and lirics are the work of masters and if you think about it, this is what matters the most. I would think that if a new, stripped down version of this album is made, it would definately become a bigger classic than it is now. This is the only reason why I dont give it a full 5 star rating. Then again, 4 stars is pretty good...dont you think? A:","output":"The review presented would likely increase the chances of me buying the product. Below are the key points from the review that contribute to this decision: 1. The reviewer considers the record a classic and refers to it as \\"pure pop music at its best,\\" implying a high quality and enjoyable listening experience. 2. Their main criticism is that the album might be somewhat pretentious due to the orchestral arrangements, but they also mention that this only applies to two songs. 3. Despite this criticism, the reviewer highlights the strengths of specific songs such as \\"ELDORADO\\" and \\"Mr. Kingdom,\\" and states that it is \\"impossible to give it a bad review.\\" 4.

Lastly, the reviewer gives the album a rating of 4 stars out of 5, indicating a high level of overall satisfaction with the product. While the reviewer does point out some minor negatives, the overall tone of the review is positive and complimentary. Consequently, this review would increase the chances of me purchasing the product, as the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, and the reviewer's enthusiasm for the album is evident."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: In his chemistry lab David is experimenting with how NaOH and HCl gas reacts with each other. He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B. In experiment A he used solid pellets of NaOH, but in experiment B he used ground NaOH. He was surprised to see the difference it made in his experiment.  Would experiment A's hydroxide have smaller or larger surface area than experiment B's hydroxide?  Hint: For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur. Answer:","output":"In this case, Experiment A's hydroxide (solid pellet) would have a smaller surface area than Experiment B's hydroxide (ground NaOH).  As mentioned in the hint, when the solid pellet of NaOH is placed into the chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur. This is because there are fewer hydroxide ions exposed on the surface of the pellet, which can react with HCl molecules.  However, when the NaOH is ground up into smaller pieces (as in Experiment B), the total surface area of the hydroxide greatly increases. This increased surface area allows more hydroxide ions to be exposed and available to react with the HCl gas, thus increasing the overall reaction rate. So, Experiment B's hydroxide has a larger surface area compared to Experiment A's hydroxide, leading to a faster reaction between NaOH and HCl gas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the sentiment of the following review? So I'm not gonna lie, I was COMPLETELY disappointed with the Encore. My BF and I have stayed at the Wynn twice before and absolutely loved it. Since we had stayed in the past we both have our Red Cards and receive the promotions that come with it in the mail every so often. The last promotion we received was for the Encore and was for 109/night King Suites with 50 resort credit for staying two nights or more. With my BF and two friends birthdays coming up in the month of September the four of us decided to get two suites and celebrate. For months I bragged to our friends about how amazing the Wynn was and that I bet the Encore will be even better. We waited anxiously during the long month between our booking and the actual trip. We get there and are greeted by a beautiful lobby, over the top and so out there it's almost tacky, but it blends together as posh and classy. We are greeted immediately by someone who tells us to please stand in a specific line, though I can't remember what line that was (it was a special line). We waited for quite some time when another person came over and said she could help us right away at another computer. So we provide the lady our info, she pulls up the reservation, 2 suites with one couple in each suite, she offers us the upgrade to the 56th floor for an additional 20-25 (which was odd because the last two trips to Wynn had upgrades on the house). So we take the upgrade, sign permission for the additional upgrade charge and go to our suites. The suites are beautiful. Love that the TV turns completely around so you can watch it in either the living space or the bed, comfy chase lounge, great detail throughout and, like the Wynn, a gorgeous bathroom. We had a room facing the strip south (beautiful) and our friends had a room facing the strip north and downtown. It started out wonderfully. So we put our orders in for in-room breakfast the next morning, down a couple drinks, and head for the buffet. We have been to the buffet numerous times, and it is our favorite on the strip. We made our friends fans as well. The trip goes to plan, loved the pool, loved the casino, in-room breakfast is always a treat. So here comes check out. We go down stairs and the line is insane. We're talking at least a 45 minute wait. So a gentleman comes by and asks if we would like to give him our room number and an email address and they will send our bill to us right away. I made it a point to ask him should there be discrepancies if we could call back for them to be resolved. He said of course, no problem. So 4 days later (which in Wynn language means \\"right away\\") we receive our bill. For 448 more than our original reservation. So I call billing immediately. They only work 8-3 Monday through Friday, which the receptionist called bankers hours. I want to work at that bank! So the next day I call billing and the girl proceeds to tell me that I signed for the additional 100 a night (which came to 400 all together, plus 48 for their 12% tax) in addition to the room up-sell and that in doing that I had agreed to paying 209 a night instead of 109. I nearly lost it. Her and I went round and round and finally she says, \\"Oh I see the problem, it's because additional people were staying in the room\\". There were two people in each room. I asked her \\"Do you really believe I'm going to take a vacation by myself and leave my partner at home?! The average person vacations with their other half.\\" She keeps repeating to me that this was the reason and that I had agreed to it at check in. I finally asked to speak to a supervisor who immediately knew what the problem was. See, when I made the reservation I asked for 2 rooms for 4 people. The computer supposedly took this as 2 rooms with 4 people in each. She admitted they were wrong and promised me it would be taken care of and I should see the new correct bill in a couple days. Now 10 days later, with no new bill and no activity on my credit card I call back the billing department. I speak to some guy who says he sees the notes in my portfolio to correct the bill, but that no action has been taken on it. I nearly lost it again. I began asking him questions and you could tell through his phone demeanor he was getting irritated that I wouldn't just let him get off the phone and get back to the laughing I could hear in the background. He finally says he'll have to look through the bills to see what he can do and he will get back to me this evening or tomorrow. No call tonight, have a feeling I won't get one tomorrow. I love the Wynn, I really do, but I'm sad to say this may have been my last trip there. They lost an incredibly loyal fan. I hope no one else has to go through the mismanagement of this resort like we did. Choices: (A). negative (B). positive","output":"The sentiment of the review can be categorized as (A) negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with various aspects of their stay at the Encore, including issues with billing, customer service, and general disappointment after having high expectations from previous experiences at Wynn.

Mike (Matt Long), Shelby's ex-boyfriend, has a new girlfriend, Elizabeth (Jessica Stroup), and they are preparing to go to Mt. Bliss, Mike's hometown, because the football team is going to be retiring his jersey. Shelby has problems with the bank about the bowling alley she inherited when her mother died and still believes that she and Mike are still an item. After the football game Mike and Elizabeth decide to go to Shelby's bowling alley. When Shelby sees Mike she kisses him, but Mike tells her that he has a new girlfriend. Shelby befriends Elizabeth and after a few tequila shots, a drunk Elizabeth says she is going to meet Mike's parents after. Shelby then tells her that Mike's parents are over judgmental, making Elizabeth nervous. Wanting to give a good first impression to Mike's parents, Elizabeth decides to go to a motel and sleep her intoxication off, so gets driven to the nearest one from Mike's policeman cousin Billy. As she arrives at check-in, the man behind the counter tells her that there are not any rooms left because of the homecoming football games and the nearest motel is four miles away. Mike goes home to see his mother, who tells him that one of her friends said his new girlfriend got drunk at the alley.

Which is this about? Reuters - Rolling the dice at a craps table orwagering a paycheck playing poker may not be the most rationaluse of money, but one casino operator is hoping investors willfind its stock a better bet.","output":"This excerpt is about how a casino operator is trying to convince potential investors that investing in its stock would be a wiser and more rational decision compared to gambling at its casino tables. The underlying narrative focuses on the unpredictability associated with betting at games like craps and poker, which often results in loss of money, and presents the idea that investing in the casino's stock could be a more reliable way to generate returns. In casinos, the odds usually favor the house, which means that a majority of players - especially in games of chance like craps or poker - may end up losing money. Unlike these games, investing in the stock market, particularly in the shares of a specific company like the casino operator mentioned, could entail a more calculated approach by analyzing the company's financial statements, overall performance, and market position. The company is essentially arguing that despite offering gambling services, they understand the drawbacks of such activities for the average person. By promoting the idea that their stock represents a more secure investment, they aim to capture the attention of astute investors who might generally stay away from gambling. To further analyze the situation, we can break it down into several components: 1. Company background: The casino operator should be evaluated based on its past performance, target market, location, and growth potential. Additionally, exploring other aspects such as management efficiency, profitability, and debt levels can provide a clearer picture of its overall standing in the industry, which may contribute to the potential for stock appreciation. 2. Industry analysis: The outlook for the casino industry will play a vital role in assessing the company's future prospects. Factors such as local and global economic conditions, regulatory environments, competition, and industry growth rates should be taken into consideration. A favorable view of the industry can significantly support the argument that investing in the casino operator's stock can be rational and lucrative. 3. Psychological aspects: Gambling is well-known for stimulating emotions and releasing adrenaline, which doesn't always lead to rational decision-making. On the other hand, the process of investing in stocks requires thorough research and a more level-headed approach. This distinction is crucial in understanding why the company's management believes that investing in their stock would be a smarter financial choice compared to gambling. 4. Risk assessment: While investing in stocks carries inherent risks, it does offer the chance to diversify one's portfolio and potentially lower the overall level of risk. Conversely, gambling lacks the same opportunity for diversification and often results in even higher risks. Therefore, the company is aiming to convince potential investors that the purchase of their stock can be a less risky and more rational decision relative to gambling. In conclusion, the casino operator is attempting to appeal to potential investors by positioning its stock as a better and more rational use of money compared to gambling at their tables. By analyzing the company's background, assessing the industry's outlook, understanding the psychological factors at play, and evaluating the risk levels, one can determine the validity of this claim. Ultimately, it is essential for investors to approach investing in any stock, including that of a casino operator, with a proper understanding of the associated risks and potential rewards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England. Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below .  Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D.  Which electron would be closer to the nucleus, cat A or cat B? Answer:","output":"Based on Bohr's model and the categories defined by Greg, Cat A represents an electron with higher energy, and Cat B represents an electron with lower energy. In Bohr's model, electrons with less energy are found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Consequently, Cat B (the electron with lower energy) would be closer to the nucleus than Cat A (the electron with higher energy)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Definition of sterling (n) Bing Dictionary British currency: the currency in pounds and pence used in the United Kingdom of sterling silver: made of sterling silver admirable: admirable or valuable  Just wanted to make sure the definition I know did not change. They sure as hell dont do British currency. Unlike the definition, this place is not admirable or valuable. Yes they have certain meal deals that are good and cheap but the service or lack there of completely cancels out any specials they might have. I havnt even mentioned what I ended up getting and it was not good at all.  So I get my player card downstairs and proceed to go up the escalator towards the cafe. Wait time to sit down was about 10 minutes which was not bad at all.  Unfortunately everything went downhill from there.   After getting our drinks from the drink person, we all knew what we wanted to get already without even having to look at the menu. After about 15 minutes, our server finally got around to taking our order. Originally  I wanted to get the Half Rack of Ribs and 10 Hot Wings for 7.77 deal with player card but the lady said that was over and it was now Steak n Eggs for 9.99. That's stupid because just earlier one of my friends said that they saw the 7.77 deal advertisement on one of the cabs. Even still she would not honor it and acted like we were wasting her time. It was obvious that she did not like her job. The bad vibes I was getting from her almost made me want to get up and leave.   So I ordered the Prime Rib special for 9.99 since I saw somebody receive their order earlier. From that point on it seemed forever for our orders to come out. When I got my order, it looked decent to begin with but when I took my first bite the meat was bland and luke warm like it had been sitting out. Dipping it in the au jus that came with it helped a little. The onion rings that came with it were already soggy. How does that happen when she just brought it out? The mashed potatoes tasted like card board. Fail.  Besides the bad service and bad food, the main thing that really bothered me was the smoke factor. The whole time we were there in the cafe, all we smelled was cigarette smoke like a whole group of people were sitting next to us smoking one cigarette after another.  In closing, to reiterate my experience in a nut shell, bad food, bad service, bad ventilation, and just overall failure in ambience. I am definitely not coming back here no matter what food deals they have for getting treated poorly and the possiblility of getting lung cancer.

In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms.

Information:  - An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition or process. The invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process. It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result. An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough. Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field. An inventor may be taking a big step in success or failure.  - Charles II (29 May 1630  6 February 1685) was king of England, Scotland and Ireland. He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651, and king of England, Scotland and Ireland from the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 until his death.   - A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state. In federations, \\"governor\\" may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected. The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal and largely ceremonial power, while others having a complete control over the entire government.  - A Royal Commission is a major ad-hoc formal public inquiry into a defined issue in some monarchies. They have been held in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Saudi Arabia. A Royal Commission is similar in function to a Commission of Enquiry (or Inquiry) found in other countries such as Ireland, South Africa, and Hong Kong. It has considerable powers, generally greater even than those of a judge but restricted to the terms of reference of the Commission. The Commission is created by the Head of State (the Sovereign, or his/her representative in the form of a Governor-General or Governor) on the advice of the Government and formally appointed by letters patent. In practiceunlike lesser forms of inquiryonce a Commission has started the government cannot stop it. Consequently, governments are usually very careful about framing the terms of reference and generally include in them a date by which the commission must finish.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - In the United States, a design patent is a form of legal protection granted to the ornamental design of a functional item. Design patents are a type of industrial design right. Ornamental designs of jewelry, furniture, beverage containers (Fig. 1) and computer icons are examples of objects that are covered by design patents.  - Legal instrument is a legal term of art that is used for any formally executed written document that can be formally attributed to its author, records and formally expresses a legally enforceable act, process, or contractual duty, obligation, or right, and therefore evidences that act, process, or agreement. Examples include a certificate, deed, bond, contract, will, legislative act, notarial act, court writ or process, or any law passed by a competent legislative body in municipal (domestic) or international law. Many legal instruments were written \\"under seal\\" by affixing a wax or paper seal to the document in evidence of its legal execution and authenticity (which often removes the need for consideration in contract law); however, today many jurisdictions have done away with the requirement of documents being under seal in order to give them legal effect.   - Clan Cunningham is a Scottish clan. On 18 December 2013, Sir John Christopher Foggo Montgomery Cunningham, Baronet of Corsehill, was recognised by Lord Lyon as clan chief, after the chiefship had been vacant for over 200 years.  - A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an \\"ad hoc\\" act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration.  - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.  - The Lord Chancellor of Scotland was a Great Officer of State in pre-Union Scotland.  - A Scottish clan (from Gaelic \\"\\", \\"children\\") is a kinship group among the Scottish people. Clans give a sense of shared identity and descent to members, and in modern times have an official structure recognised by the Court of the Lord Lyon, which regulates Scottish heraldry and coats of arms. Most clans have their own tartan patterns, usually dating from the 19th century, which members may incorporate into kilts or other clothing.  - Under United States law, a patent is a right granted to the inventor of a (1) process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter, (2) that is new, useful, and non-obvious. A patent is the right to exclude others from using a new technology. Specifically, it is the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, inducing others to infringe, and/or offering a product specially adapted for practice of the patent.  - A president is the leader of a country or a division or part of a country, typically a republic, a democracy, or a dictatorship. The title \\"president\\" is sometimes used by extension for leaders of other groups, including corporate entities and social groups.  - A Commonwealth realm is a sovereign state that is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and shares the same person, currently Elizabeth II, as its head of state and reigning constitutional monarch, but retains a crown legally distinct from the other realms. As of 2017, there are 16 Commonwealth realms: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tuvalu, Barbados, Grenada, Solomon Islands, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, and the United Kingdom.   - William Cunningham, 8th Earl of Glencairn (15751630) was a Scottish politician.  - William Cunningham , 9th Earl of Glencairn ( 1610 -- 1664 ) , was a Scottish nobleman , Lord Chancellor of Scotland , and a cavalier . He was also the chief of Clan Cunningham . The eldest son of William Cunningham , 8th Earl of Glencairn , on 21 July 1637 this William obtained a ratification from King Charles 1st , under the Royal Sign Manual , of the original Glencairn Letters Patent of 1488 . He was sworn a member of the Privy Council of Scotland and in 1641 was appointed a Commissioner of the Treasury .  - Cavalier first used by Roundheads as a term of abuse for the wealthier male Royalist supporters of King Charles I and his son Charles II of England during the English Civil War, the Interregnum, and the Restoration (1642  c. 1679). It was later adopted by the Royalists themselves. Although it referred originally to political and social attitudes and behaviour, of which clothing was a very small part, it has subsequently become strongly identified with the fashionable clothing of the court at the time. Prince Rupert, commander of much of Charles I's cavalry, is often considered to be an archetypal Cavalier.  - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use.  - A monarch is the sovereign head of state in a monarchy. A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the state, or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Typically a monarch either personally inherits the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as \\"the throne\\" or \\"the crown\\") or is selected by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, acclamation or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns for life or until abdication.   - In the United Kingdom, the Great Officers of State are traditional Crown ministers, who either inherit their positions or are appointed to exercise certain largely ceremonial functions or operate as part of the government. Separate Great Officers exist for England and Scotland, and formerly for Ireland. Many of the Great Officers became largely ceremonial because historically they were so influential that their powers had to be resumed by the Crown or dissipated.  - A patent (or ) is a set of exclusive rights granted by a sovereign state to an inventor or assignee for a limited period of time in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem and is a product or a process. Patents are a form of intellectual property.

Summarize this article: There are different materials that you can buy to strap and support your elbow. Either trainer’s tape or kinesiology tape or tubular bandages can help limit your range of motion that is causing you discomfort, reduce stress on the injured tissue, and may allow more blood to flow to the injured area.  Trainer’s and kinesiology tape are often best for muscle injuries. The tape expands when you move, making the treatment comfortable and practical if you have an active lifestyle or continue to exercise.  If you have sensitive skin, consider trying quick release medical tape, which combines the strength of trainer’s and kinesiology tapes with less chance of irritating the skin during wear or removal.  Tubular medical bandages are wrapped around the affected area and then affixed with tape or a small fastener. This might also be a good option if you have sensitive skin. Tubular bandages are an especially good option for wrapping joints or even to cover tape.  You can purchase trainer’s and kinesiology tape and bandages at many pharmacies, medical supply stores, and sports stores. Some larger retailers may also carry it. Consider trying to strap your elbow with duct tape, which is as supportive as trainer’s or kinesiology tape.  Some professionals may recommend using black tape, as it can adhere better to sweaty skin. Purchase bandages to wrap, strap, and support your elbow. Bandages will support your elbow and they may also help to reduce any swelling you have.  You can use most types of medical wrap bandages at pharmacies, medical supply stores, and even some sports stores. Make sure to buy a bandage that is long enough to wrap your elbow enough to support and immobilize it. You will need to purchase medical tape or pins to keep the bandage in place. Prepare your arm skin for taping or bandaging by washing and shaving it, if necessary. This can not only help remove dirt and debris, make the tape stick more effectively, but also may prevent any discomfort when you remove the tape or bandage.  Wash away any oils, sweat or dirt that may be on your skin with a gentle cleanser and warm water. This can minimize the risk that the tape or bandage doesn’t adhere properly to your arm.  Any type of mild soap can effectively clean your arm. Make sure to rinse or wipe off all of the soap. If you have chosen not to use an underwrap (see next step) or have a lot of hair on your arm, you may want to shave your arm.  Shave with care to prevent cutting your skin and causing injury. If you prefer not to place the tape or bandage against your skin, place an underwrap between the tape and your skin. If you use an underwrap, be aware that it is not as effective as using tape only.  You do not have to use an underwrap or skin adhesives with tape or bandages.  Spray the skin adhesive and or apply the underwrap to the areas of your arm you plan to wrap.  You can buy underwrap and skin adhesive at most pharmacies, medical supply stores and some sports stores. You may need to cut the tape before you wrap your elbow depending on whether you bought strips or a round of tape. Pre-cutting the tape can help ensure you use the right amount and prevent you from wasting any tape.  Cut pieces of your tape to approximately the length of your forearm. You may also want some smaller pieces.  Rounding the edges of the tape can make it easier to apply.  If your tape has backing, remove it before application. Summary:","output":"Various materials can be used to strap and support your elbow, including trainer's tape, kinesiology tape, and tubular bandages. These can limit range of motion, reduce stress on injured tissue, and increase blood flow to injured areas. They are particularly suitable for muscle injuries and can be found at pharmacies, medical supply stores, and sports stores.

Summarize: If your expression is not already set up like a fraction, rewrite it this way. This makes it easier to follow all the necessary steps when dividing by a square root. Remember that a fraction bar is also a division bar. For example, if you are calculating 144÷36{displaystyle {sqrt {144}}div {sqrt {36}}}, rewrite the problem like this: 14436{displaystyle {frac {sqrt {144}}{sqrt {36}}}}. If your problem has a square root in the numerator and denominator, you can place both radicands under one radical sign. (A radicand is a number under a radical, or square root, sign.) This will simplify the simplifying process. For example, 14436{displaystyle {frac {sqrt {144}}{sqrt {36}}}} can be rewritten as 14436{displaystyle {sqrt {frac {144}{36}}}}. Divide the numbers as you would any whole number. Make sure to place their quotient under a new radical sign. For example, 14436=4{displaystyle {frac {144}{36}}=4}, so 14436=4{displaystyle {sqrt {frac {144}{36}}}={sqrt {4}}}. , if necessary. If the radicand is a perfect square, or if one of its factors is a perfect square, you need to simplify the expression. A perfect square is the product of a whole number multiplied by itself. For example, 25 is a perfect square, since 5×5=25{displaystyle 5times 5=25}. For example, 4 is a perfect square, since 2×2=4{displaystyle 2times 2=4}. Thus:4{displaystyle {sqrt {4}}}=2×2{displaystyle ={sqrt {2times 2}}}=2{displaystyle =2}So, 14436=4=2{displaystyle {frac {sqrt {144}}{sqrt {36}}}={sqrt {4}}=2}.","output":"Alright, let's imagine we are trying to divide two numbers inside those funny square root symbols. First, we need to write it like a fraction (one number on top and the other on the bottom).  Now, instead of having the square root symbol on both numbers, we can put them together under one square root symbol. Then, we divide the numbers just like we would normally do.  After that, if the new number we got is a special \\"perfect square\\" (like 4, because 2 times 2 is 4), we can simplify it even more. In our example, it was 4, and the square root of 4 is 2.

This movie appears to have been an on the job training exercise for the Coppola family. It doesn't seem to know whether to be an \\"A\\" or a \\"B\\" western. I mean, the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God's sake. William Boyd must be spinning in his grave. All the \\"B\\" western cliches are here. The two-gun pearly toothed hero in the white hat with the trusty steed (\\"C'mon Thunder\\"), the all-in-black bearded villain, the heroine in distress, the rancher in trouble, the cowardly sheriff, over the top bad guys etc. The acting, with few exceptions, is strictly from the Yakima Canutt School of Acting. Chris Lybbert (who?) as the hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) as the villain look like they would have been more at home in a 30's Poverty Row quickie. The addition to the cast of veteran performers Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps a little, but they are not given enough to do to salvage this one. What was the point of the Martin Sheen/Robert Carradine framing sequences? Are we to believe that the Sheen character was a ghost? What was the purpose of the black gloves? It just didn't make sense. Being a great lover of westerns from all genres, I tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this film. The cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic. Aside from the hero and main villain, the other characters looked authentic. If the producers were going to resurrect the Hopalong Cassidy character, they might have given some thought to portraying him as he was originally written - a grizzled foul-mouthed ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder, the kind of part Lee Marvin would have excelled in.

Answer: An attempt by U.S. President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson, using the unarmed merchant ship Star of the West , failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9, 1861. Question: what happened on april 11 1861 at fort sumter The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the provided answer does not accurately describe what happened on April 11, 1861, at Fort Sumter, although it does reference an earlier event in the timeline leading up to the Battle of Fort Sumter. On January 9, 1861, the Star of the West, an unarmed merchant ship sent by President James Buchanan, was indeed fired upon, preventing it from reinforcing and resupplying Fort Sumter. On April 11, 1861, a significant series of events unfolded at Fort Sumter, culminating in the Battle of Fort Sumter, which marked the beginning of the American Civil War. The events leading up to this day included escalating tensions between the Northern and Southern states due to differing views on slavery, economic disparity, and states' rights. South Carolina was the first state to secede from the Union on December 20, 1860, with six more states—Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas—joining it to form the Confederate States of America. In the early hours of April 11, 1861, Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard sent aides–Colonel James Chesnut, Jr., Captain Stephen D. Lee, and Lieutenant A.R. Chisolm–to Major Robert Anderson, the Union commander at Fort Sumter, to demand the fort's surrender. Anderson refused this demand, even though his small garrison of approximately 80 Union soldiers was running low on supplies and reinforcements. However, he did indicate that he would be forced to surrender within a few days if no supplies or reinforcements arrived. Later in the day, further negotiations were held between the Union and Confederate authorities. However, these negotiations proved unsuccessful, and General Beauregard received instructions from Confederate President Jefferson Davis to open fire on Fort Sumter if it had not surrendered by 4 a.m. on April 12, 1861. Thus, April 11, 1861, was a crucial day in the lead-up to the Battle of Fort Sumter, featuring failed negotiations and ultimatums that would ultimately ignite the American Civil War. The battle itself began in the early hours of April 12, when Confederate forces commenced their bombardment of the fort. After relentless shelling for more than 34 hours, Major Anderson and his Union forces surrendered Fort Sumter on April 13, 1861. The Battle of Fort Sumter marked the beginning of a long and bloody conflict that would last for four years, ultimately resulting in the deaths of more than 600,000 Americans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As Polish resistance collapses, Dr. Lutz Heck, head of the Berlin Zoo and Adolf Hitler's chief zoologist and Jan's professional rival, visits the zoo while Jan is away. He offers to house the prized animals until after the war, later returning with Nazi soldiers to shoot the rest. He develops a romantic interest in Antonina. The Jews of Warsaw are forced into the Ghetto. The Żabińskis' Jewish friends, Maurycy Fraenkel and his partner Magda Gross, seek a safe place for a friend's insect collection. Antonina offers to shelter Magda. Knowing they can be executed for helping Jews, Jan and Antonina decide to use the zoo to save more lives.

Attorney Robert Shapiro noted Simpson didn't testify in his murder case, Pistorius will      The mid-1990s murder trial of O. J. Simpson is different in several respects from the current murder trial of South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius, according to an attorney for Simpson in that trial, Robert Shapiro, right. (Photo: Vince Bucci, Associated Press) Story Highlights O.J. Simpson attorney Robert Shapiro downplayed police bungling in Oscar Pistorius case      Simpson murder case trial by jury; Pistorius murder case to be decided by magistrate      Shapiro says it will come down to whether magistrate believes Pistorius      Robert Shapiro, who once represented O.J. Simpson in the notorious murder trial of the mid-1990s in Los Angeles, said the Oscar Pistorius murder case in South Africa is very different except that both \\"have superstar athletes that are accused of killing beautiful significant others.\\"      In an interview with MSNBC on Thursday, Shapiro responded to assertions that Pistorius is South Africa's version of Simpson, with both cases rife with accusations of police bungling.      \\"I really don't think the detectives are really going to be much of an issue in this case,\\" Shapiro said, adding that he doesn't think forensics will be a key issue, either. \\"Pistorius is going to testify; Simpson did not.\\"      The Simpson case was a classic, 'Who was responsible for the murder case?' The Pistorius case is a case of, 'What is it?' \\" Shapiro said. Pistorius has \\"admitted to doing the shooting so the question is going to be, 'Was it a premeditated murder or was it a justifiable homicide?' \\"      STORY: Lead detective replaced in Pistorius case      The case has had its shares of twists and turns. Thursday, it was revealed that chief investigator Hilton Botha is facing attempted murder charges stemming from a 2011 incident.      Mark Fuhrman, the detective who led the investigation in the Simpson case, said charges filed against Botha and mistakes in his testimony don't matter.      \\"So what?\\" Fuhrman told FoxNews.com.      \\"The defense attorneys are doing what defense attorneys everywhere do,\\" Fuhrman said. \\"When you look at the facts, even omitting all the forensic evidence the police have produced, it's crystal clear.      \\"Here is what he admits: 'I shot my girlfriend.' And he has to admit he fought with her in the past, because the police had been there previously. That's really all you need to know here.\\"      Among the ways the defense has tried to discredit the prosecution's case is by noting an autopsy showed Reeva Steenkamp, Pistorius' girlfriend of three months, had a full bladder. The defense says that boosts Pistorius' claim that she had gone to use the toilet in the middle of the night. Iin an affadavit he says he shot her accidentally, mistaking her for an intruder.      \\"I've got news for them: When you're dead, your bowels and bladder relax,\\" Fuhrman told FoxNews.com.      How this case will be decided is the main difference between South Africa's legal system and the USA's, Shapiro said. Simpson had a trial by jury. A single judge will decide Pistorius' case.      In South Africa, jury trials were abolished in the 1930s because of apartheid, Shapiro said. People could not get a fair trial because of the race relations that existed.      \\"The judge (in the Pistorius case) is going to make one decision. He's not going to say, 'Do I have reasonable doubt?' \\" Shapiro said.      \\"He's going to say, 'Do I believe what Mr. Pistorius is telling us? Do I believe that he actually felt that there was a burglar in the house? And that he reasonably believed that his life was in danger if he didn't take action and shoot through a closed door at an unknown target.' \\" ||||| Olympian Oscar Pistorius, known as 'Blade Runner' charged with killing model girlfriend Oscar Pistorius, an Olympian who was at one point an icon in South Africa whose lower legs were amputated when he was less than a year old, claims he mistook his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp for an intruder when he shot her in a locked bathroom in his home. Prosecutors, however, say the couple had had a shouting match and Steenkamp fled to the bathroom, and locked herself in. Pistorius, 26, allegedly got up from bed and had to put on his prosthetic legs to reach the toilet door. The door was broken open after the shots were fired, prosecutors charge.      Attorneys for Oscar Pistorius, the so-called Blade Runner, are poking headline-grabbing holes in the forensic evidence arrayed against the South African double amputee, but none of it changes facts that show the Olympic sprinter killed his model girlfriend, said former LAPD investigator and author Mark Fuhrman.      The former lead detective in the Pistorius case is facing an attempted murder charge stemming from an on-duty incident, prosecutors may have been too quick to say steroids were found in the Pretoria mansion of the suspect and detectives missed a bullet lodged in the bathroom wall.      “The defense attorneys are doing what defense attorneys everywhere do.” - Mark Fuhrman, author and former LAPD detective      “So what?” says Fuhrman, who as a detective had a major role in the O.J. Simpson case and then went on to write several books analyzing the evidence in various high-profile murders.      “The defense attorneys are doing what defense attorneys everywhere do,” Fuhrman said. “When you look at the facts, even omitting all the forensic evidence the police have produced, it’s crystal clear.      “Here is what he admits: ‘I shot my girlfriend.’ And he has to admit he fought with her in the past, because the police had been there previously. That’s really all you need to know here.”      Fuhrman dismissed the latest revelation that South African detective Hilton Botha is facing attempted murder charges in connection with a 2011 shooting incident. That case, which involved Botha and two other police officers who allegedly fired at a minibus they were trying to stop, was reopened 10 days before Pistorius’ girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp was killed, after new evidence surfaced. Botha was taken off the Blade Runner case on Thursday.      “That wasn’t a shock,” Fuhrman said. “Any street cop knows you will be sued or involved in some type of litigation throughout your career. If the detective was compromised in any way, how does that change the actions of the suspect on the night in question?”      Although Botha admitted under questioning that nothing at the crime scene was inconsistent with Pistorius’ explanation, Fuhrman said the evidence is a much better fit with the explanation that prosecutors have offered.      Steenkamp, 29, was in a bathroom when she was shot four times through the door. Defense attorneys have sought to dispel the idea she was hiding from her enraged beau by noting her bladder was empty – suggesting she had gone to the room to use the toilet. Fuhrman scoffed at the explanation.      “I’ve got news for them: When you’re dead, your bowels and bladder relax,” he said.      Pistorius, 26, claims he awoke in the night and heard a noise in the bathroom and assumed it was an intruder, saying he felt a “sense of terror rushing over” him.      “He knew there were two people in the house, he lives there, and she’s over,” Fuhrman said. “He hears something in the bathroom, and he doesn’t think it’s his girlfriend? He has an extensive security system that apparently has not been set off, yet he assumes the person behind the bathroom door is a burglar?”      The defense has also disputed the “pre-meditated” aspect of the murder charge. But Fuhrman noted reports that a bloody cricket bat was found in the house, and Steenkamp had a blunt-force trauma wound to her head. The detective theorized that the pair fought, Pistorius bashed her over the head and she fled to the bathroom. If at that point, he went and got a gun and pursued her, pre-meditation applies.      “Pre-meditation can form in split seconds,” he said.      Botha may have made other errors at the crime scene, including missing a bullet that hit the toilet that was found by the defense's forensic team four days later. He also admitted on the stand that he did not wear protective clothing at the scene, which defense attorneys suggested could have contaminated evidence.      Botha said police found testosterone and needles in a bedroom dresser, but Pistorius’ attorney said it was a herbal remedy. It was not clear when the compound would be tested.      “Whether he was on steroids or not really has nothing to do with his defense, if he claims he thought he was shooting a burglar,” Fuhrman said.      Finally, defense attorneys attacked Botha’s assertion that the trajectory of the bullets showed Pistorius’ 9-mm. handgun was fired downward from a height differs with the suspect’s claim he was not wearing his prosthetics at the time. Once again, Fuhrman said the defense was grasping at straws.      “It doesn’t matter if he was on stumps or stilts,” Fuhrman said. “He already says he fired the shots.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Robert Shapiro, an attorney who represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial, commented on the Oscar Pistorius case, highlighting differences and similarities between the two high-profile trials involving superstar athletes. Shapiro downplayed the impact of police mistakes on the Pistorius trial and emphasized that Pistorius will testify, unlike Simpson. The case's outcome will depend on whether the magistrate believes Pistorius's account of thinking there was an intruder in his home, leading to the tragic shooting of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. The former lead detective in the Pistorius case, Mark Fuhrman, echoed Shapiro's views, stating that despite errors in the investigation, the facts of the case remain unchanged."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Either out of confusion or discomfort we sometimes express our feelings in an unclear way. One key to making your feelings clear is to realize that you most often can shorten them in a few words: hurt, glad, confused, excited, angry, and so on. In the same way, with a little thought you can probably describe very briefly any reasons you have for feeling a certain way. In addition to avoiding too long expressions, a second way to prevent confusion is to avoid  _ your feelings by saying \\"I'm a little unhappy\\" or \\"I'm pretty excited\\". Of course, not all feelings are strong ones. We do feel degrees of sadness and joy, for example, but some communicators have a tendency to downplay almost every feeling. Do you? A third danger to avoid is expressing feelings in an indirect or coded manner. This happened most often when the sender is uncomfortable about showing his or her feeling in question. Some codes are verbal ones, as when the sender hints more or less subtly at the message. For example, an indirect way to say \\"I'm feeling lonely\\" might be \\"I guess there isn't much happening this weekend, so if you're not busy, why don't you drop by?\\" Such a message is so indirect that chances are small that your real feeling will be recognized. For this reason, people who send coded messages stand less of a chance of having their feeling understood and their need met. Finally, you can express yourself clearly by making sure that both you and your partner understand that your feeling is centered in a specific set of environments rather than being indicative of the whole relationship. Instead of saying \\"I hate you\\", say \\"I hate you when you don't keep your promises\\"'. Rather than \\"I'm bored with you\\", say \\"I'm bored when you talk about your money.\\" Answer:","output":"Which of the following practices is NOT recommended in the article for expressing feelings clearly?

You deserve it  And that dress looks abselutely stunning!","output":"When describing the sentiment of this tweet, one can identify it as positive and supportive. To break it down, let's examine the various aspects of the tweet that contribute to its overall sentiment.  1. The tweet begins by tagging the user @mileycyrus, which indicates that the person is addressing Miley Cyrus directly. This direct address demonstrates engagement and attention towards the subject of the message. 2. The next part of the tweet is a URL (http://twitpic.com/6dvj4) that likely leads to an image or an event related to Miley Cyrus. While the content of the linked image cannot be determined from the context of the tweet alone, it is assumed that the user is referring to something positive based on the subsequent text in the tweet. 3. The user then congratulates Miley Cyrus by saying \\"Congratulations!\\" This further highlights a positive sentiment, as congratulations are typically given in response to an achievement or a milestone. 4. The user continues by stating, \\"You deserve it.\\" This phrase further bolsters the positive sentiment, as it implies that Miley Cyrus has earned or is worthy of the praise and congratulations. It is also a sign of encouragement, as the user acknowledges Miley Cyrus's hard work and achievement. 5. Finally, the user mentions Miley Cyrus's dress, stating, \\"And that dress looks absolutely stunning!\\" This compliment emphasizes a positive perception of Miley's appearance, specifically complimenting her fashion choice. The adjective \\"stunning\\" suggests that the dress is not only attractive but also has a strong and memorable impact. To sum up, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as positive and supportive, with the user congratulating Miley Cyrus on her achievements, acknowledging her worthiness, and complimenting her fashion choice. Such a tweet could likely lead to a sense of appreciation and validation for the subject, further strengthening the positive sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The White House has announced sanctions against 38 Russian individuals and companies, saying the United States is standing up to ongoing \\"malign activity\\" by the Russian government against Western democracies and around the world. At Friday's White House briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. still wants to work with Russia.  \\"Again, what we would like to see is the totality of the Russian behavior change. We want to continue having conversations and work forward to building a better relationship,\\" Sanders said. The sanctions will be imposed on seven Russian oligarchs — including Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — and 12 companies they own or control. Seventeen senior Russian government officials, as well as a state-owned Russian weapons trading company and its subsidiary, a Russian bank, also will be targeted. The group includes key members of Putin's inner circle. Those sanctioned will have their assets blocked in the U.S. and people in the U.S. are barred from doing business with them. Friday, a number of U.S. lawmakers and foreign policy experts welcomed the measure, saying the sanctions are overdue. Representative Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the move is the strongest action taken by the Trump administration to date for Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and \\"its murder of dissidents at home and abroad.\\" \\"The sanctioning of oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska, who is linked to Paul Manafort, Alexander Torshin and Putin's son-in-law, will send a strong message to the Kremlin,\\" Schiff said in a statement. Florida's Marco Rubio, a Republican senator and former presidential candidate, also welcomed Friday's announcement. \\"These new sanctions send a clear message to Vladimir Putin that the illegal occupation of Ukraine, support for … war crimes [under Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime], efforts to undermine Western democracies, and...

Pick from: A). slice into it. B). squeeze it to see how squishy it is.","output":"The correct answer is: B). squeeze it to see how squishy it is. Explanation:  The best way to determine whether an avocado is ripe and ready to eat is by gently squeezing it. You want the avocado to yield slightly to your pressure while maintaining some firmness — that indicates its ripeness. Overly squishy avocados, on the other hand, could be overripe. Option A, slicing into the avocado, is ineffective and inefficient for a few reasons. First, repeatedly slicing into avocados to determine their ripeness is a waste of food — especially if they're not ripe. Second, slicing an underripe or overripe avocado could potentially make it more difficult to cut and remove the pit safely. So this method could result in unnecessary waste and potentially unsafe cutting conditions. On the other hand, giving the avocado a gentle squeeze is quick, easy, safe, and wastes no food."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since we have -26 times the number of gold coins, we need to undo that by dividing both sides of the equation by -26: (-26*y) / -26 = -234 / -26 That gives us: y = 9 So, the number of gold coins (y) in our secret treasure chest is 9!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

W: You can't read just one. They say each presents a different theory.  Question: What does the woman tell the man he must do?   - Read an article on political science.  - Present a different theory to the class.  - Read more than one article. Answer:","output":"The woman tells the man that he must read more than one article for their political science class. She emphasizes the importance of this by explaining that each article presents a different theory, and by only reading one, he would not be able to fully grasp or engage with the variety of perspectives and ideas within the subject matter they are studying. In the dialogue, the man initially expresses his intention to read just one article, believing that it would be sufficient for the class. However, the woman corrects him by highlighting that a comprehensive and well-rounded understanding of the various theories in political science cannot be achieved through reading only one article. Each article presents a unique viewpoint, and it is crucial to explore these differing perspectives to better understand the complexity of the topic they are studying. By encouraging the man to read more than just one article, the woman is essentially conveying the importance of expanding one's knowledge and not limiting oneself to a single source of information within the context of their political science class. This approach is essential not only in the field of political science but across various disciplines, as it promotes critical thinking and deeper comprehension of the subjects being studied. In conclusion, the woman tells the man that he must read multiple articles to gain insights into the different theories and approaches in political science, rather than relying on just one article. This will enable him to have a more holistic understanding of the topic, which is ultimately beneficial for his academic growth and engagement with the subject matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and... A:","output":"The station that played Läther was the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ.

Given the following context:  In comparison to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute's Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, is relatively small and simple. The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but the expansion of the Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.This bedroom is also less richly ornamented than many in the castle, making extensive use of plain, stencilled geometrical patterns on the walls.

In normal conditions, the dew point temperature will not be greater than the air temperature because relative humidity cannot exceed 100%.[4]  Now, I have a new situation: Sam lived in Chicago for many years and experienced those high humidity days during the summer, the Indian summers in October and harsh and humid winters, so he decided to move to San Diego, in a warmer and much dryer climate.  Answer this question please: Which city has more humidity during winter? A:","output":"Chicago typically has higher humidity during winter compared to San Diego. Although San Diego experiences a more consistent and milder climate throughout the year, its winter months usually have lower humidity levels due to the influence of the Mediterranean climate and the relative dryness of Southern California. In contrast, Chicago experiences cold and harsh winters, with greater humidity levels because cold air can hold less water vapor. As temperature falls, relative humidity rises since less vapor is required to saturate the air, causing condensation to occur more frequently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That's the first step on our adventure: remove the outer shell from the fava beans. You can do this by taking off the pods, or outer part, so the hidden beans inside are free. Next, like a master wizard, you are going to make magic water. Fill a big pot with water and we are going to heat it up until it's boiling hot. It's like a bubbling potion!

Using a handy little strainer or slotted spoon, help them out of the water. Be careful, the water will be hot! Next, guess what? Those fava beans have a second secret layer!

Finally, sprinkle on some seasonings like salt or pepper, whatever you like to make your beans even more yummy. And voila! You have completed your cooking adventure!

The text states that the Palo Alto Art Center Foundation (PAACF) is a nonprofit organization, not a for-profit organization. Nonprofit organizations exist to fulfill a specific mission, to provide certain services, or to address specific social issues, and they do not distribute profits among their shareholders or members. Instead, they reinvest any revenue they generate back into the organization to further its mission. The paragraph mentions that the PAACF supports the Palo Alto Art Center by providing various art-related activities in the city of Palo Alto, California. Since its founding in 1971, the Art Center has served as a community hub for artistic and cultural endeavors. However, it remains financially backed and supported by the nonprofit PAACF, as opposed to being a for-profit venture aimed at generating profits for investors or shareholders.

Write the answer: Matabeleland is part of which African country?","output":"Matabeleland is a region located in the southwestern part of Zimbabwe, an African country situated in the southern portion of the continent. Zimbabwe is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. The name Matabeleland is derived from the Ndebele people, who inhabited the region before the colonization of Zimbabwe by the British. The Ndebele people, also known as the Matabele, are a Bantu ethnic group, and their language, Sindebele or Northern Ndebele, is one of the 16 official languages of Zimbabwe. Matabeleland is politically divided into three provinces: 1. Matabeleland North Province: This province is predominantly rural and has a wealth of natural resources, including the well-known Hwange National Park, which is the largest game reserve in Zimbabwe. It is also home to the Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, attracting thousands of tourists from around the globe. The provincial capital of Matabeleland North is Lupane. 2. Matabeleland South Province: This province is also mainly rural. It lies to the south of Matabeleland North Province, and its provincial capital is Gwanda. The Matopo (Matopos) National Park, located in this province, is known for its stunning landscapes and granite Kopjes, as well as its rich biodiversity. The park is also recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 3. Bulawayo Province: Bulawayo is the second-largest city in Zimbabwe, after the capital, Harare, and serves as the industrial and business center of Matabeleland. This city is known for its wide streets, well-planned infrastructure, and historical significance. Bulawayo is also the location of several important institutions, such as the National University of Science and Technology and the Bulawayo Railway Museum. Matabeleland has a diverse culture, as it is home to various ethnic groups. The region has experienced significant historical events, including the arrival of the Ndebele people, colonization by the British, and political turmoil during the Gukurahundi, a series of massacres committed in the 1980s to suppress perceived political dissent. In modern times, Matabeleland faces several challenges, including periodic droughts, limited economic opportunities, and developmental disparities in comparison to other regions of Zimbabwe. However, its vast natural resources, cultural heritage, and potential for ecotourism make Matabeleland a significant part of Zimbabwe's continued growth and future prospects."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The town is facing a unique, and troublesome issue – a massive bat infestation originating from a nearby cave system. As their numbers increase dramatically, the bats are becoming a threat to not only the town's residents and infrastructure but also to themselves, as the ecosystem can't sustain them any longer. Local residents have tried numerous ways to drive the bats away, only to be met with little to no success. Many in the town feel that the only solution left is to exterminate the entire bat population. Sheila, however, is determined to find a non-lethal solution that will restore order to both the town and the bats' habitat. Fueled by her passion for saving animal lives, Sheila starts working with a team of scientists and biologists to study the bats and their behavior. They learn that the bats have been drawn to the cave system due to the warmth provided by geothermal activity deep within the caves. Sheila hypothesizes that by significantly lowering the temperature in the caves, it could encourage the bats to migrate to another location while still preserving the environment for other cave-dwelling species. Sheila and her team collaborate with engineers to develop a system that would pump icy cold water from an underground river through pipes in the caves to reduce the temperature drastically. To prevent local residents from interfering, Sheila educates the town on the importance of safeguarding wildlife, convincing them that her plan will be the best solution. The town's mayor, initially a skeptic, begins to support Sheila's plan when he realizes the potential benefits of the plan for the town's tourism industry. As they work on the chilling project, Sheila and the team encounter several challenges – they must navigate tricky cave terrain, deal with equipment malfunctions, and battle against time as the bat population threatens to reach an unsustainably large number. At one point, their cold water system fails right when a group of bats is roosting near the cave entrance, almost causing a catastrophe. Fortunately, Sheila's determination and quick thinking avert disaster. In the end, Sheila's plan succeeds as the cave temperature drops significantly. The bats gradually leave the cave system, finding a new, more sustainable habitat farther away. Sheila and her team celebrate their victory over this environmental challenge, relieved they found a humane solution to the bat infestation. As life returns to normal in the town, Sheila's efforts to save the bats inspire other residents to advocate environmental conservation and respect wildlife. The story concludes with Sheila and the town starting a wildlife preservation organization that collaborates with neighboring communities to promote responsible coexistence between humans and animals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jordan put posters up to advertise the upcoming event to be held at the theater.  Given the question \\"How would bystanders feel as a result?\\", is \\"upset about the posters\\" a valid answer? Select from the following.  (1). Yes.  (2). No. The answer is:","output":"(2). No. The answer is \\"No\\" because there is not enough information or context to directly conclude that bystanders would feel upset about the posters. It is important to consider various factors and potential reasons for people's reactions to such an occurrence. First and foremost, the context of the upcoming event advertised on the posters matters significantly. If the event consists of a controversial or offensive subject matter, then a negative reaction from some bystanders might be understandable. However, if the event is benign or widely appealing, there is less reason to assume that the posters would create negative emotions. Additionally, the design and presentation of the posters can have an impact on bystanders' reactions. A well-designed and visually appealing poster can elicit positive emotions, while a cluttered or unattractive poster might leave people feeling indifferent or even annoyed. However, these emotions may be directed towards the design of the poster rather than the actual content it promotes. Moreover, personal preferences and biases play a role in determining people's reactions. While some people might be interested in the event and appreciate the advertisement, others may not be interested in the subject matter or may be against the event for various reasons. As a result, their reactions may differ significantly. Furthermore, geographical and cultural context can also have an influence on the bystanders' feelings. For instance, people in a community that values and supports theater and arts events may show more enthusiasm and appreciation for the advertisement, while those from a region where such events are frowned upon may indeed feel upset about the posters. In summary, there is a multitude of factors that contribute to the reactions of bystanders when exposed to an advertisement for an upcoming event at the theater. Considering the context, design, personal preferences, and cultural background, it is difficult to directly conclude that bystanders would feel upset about the posters without examining these aspects.

Choices: [A]. negative [B]. positive The answer is:","output":"[B]. positive The movie review sentence \\"to entertain\\" reflects a positive sentiment. This statement implies that the purpose of the movie is to provide amusement or enjoyment for the audience. The term \\"entertain\\" carries a positive connotation, as it is associated with enjoyment, fun, and receiving pleasure from a particular activity, in this case, watching a movie.  When reviewers assess movies as entertaining, they generally mean that the film holds the viewers' attention and provides an enjoyable experience. An entertaining movie can take various forms, such as action-adventure films, comedies, dramas, or any other genre capable of offering an engaging experience. The use of the term \\"entertain\\" indicates that the movie can effectively keep the audience engaged and perhaps even evoke emotional responses or stimulate thought processes. In contrast, a negative movie review sentence would include terms that express displeasure, boredom, or dissatisfaction with the movie. For example, saying that the movie is \\"boring,\\" \\"dull,\\" or \\"tedious\\" implies the film failed to entertain or engage the viewer. Negative reviews often point out flaws or shortcomings, such as poor acting, weak plots, or lackluster technical aspects, which detract from the film's overall impact.

TalkBack makes navigating my device considerably easier, enabling me to browse the internet, read messages, and even make phone calls effortlessly despite my visual impairment. One thing that particularly impressed me is the customization features this app provides. I can easily adjust the speech volume, pitch, and rate to my preference, which contributes to a rather seamless experience. The gesture controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing me to flick and tap my way through various screens and tasks. However, I had to knock off a star because there are a few areas where there's room for improvement. For instance, the app occasionally misses announcing specific elements on the screen, which can be slightly confusing. I've also noticed that it can have difficulty properly distinguishing between certain buttons, especially those that are close together in some applications.

Options: - train station - michigan - alaska - canada - countryside  The answer is \\"canada\\" because The answer to this question is:","output":"Canada because playing hockey on a frozen pond is a quintessential Canadian pastime that has deep cultural and historical roots in the country. While pond hockey may be played in other locations, such as Michigan or Alaska, it is most commonly associated with Canada due to several factors, which are as follows: 1. National sport: Hockey is considered Canada's national winter sport, and Canadians take great pride in their hockey heritage. It is a sport that is deeply ingrained in Canadian culture and identity. Many Canadians grow up playing pond hockey, learning the fundamentals of the sport on the frozen ponds and lakes during winter. 2. Climate: Canadian winters are known for their cold temperatures and thick layers of snow and ice. Many areas of Canada have naturally occurring frozen ponds, lakes, and rivers that provide ideal conditions for playing pond hockey. In contrast, in places like Alaska, while they may experience similar winter conditions, they do not have the same cultural history with hockey as Canada does. 3. Hockey development: Much of Canada's professional hockey talent has emerged from small towns and communities where children learn to play the sport on frozen ponds and lakes. This grassroots hockey development has given rise to many Canadian hockey legends and skilled players who have gone on to represent their country in international competitions, such as the Winter Olympics and the World Hockey Championships. 4. Community tradition: In many Canadian towns and cities, playing hockey on a frozen pond is a community tradition that brings together people of all ages. Locals in these areas often gather at the pond near train tracks or any other suitable location for friendly, casual games of pond hockey. These pick-up games serve as social events that promote camaraderie and shared experiences among community members. 5. Famous pond hockey tournament: Canada is home to the World Pond Hockey Championship, an annual event that takes place in Plaster Rock, New Brunswick. This tournament attracts teams from all over the world, showcasing the strong connection Canada has with pond hockey. Considering all these factors, playing hockey on a frozen pond near train tracks is a uniquely Canadian experience that resonates with the country's love for winter sports and its affinity for the great outdoors.

The man took the stairwell to the third floor instead of the elevator because the","output":"elevator was out of order. He didn't mind climbing the stairs, as it was a good way to get some exercise, and with all the hours he spent sitting at his desk, he knew he needed it. When he had first moved into the building, he would often choose to save time by taking the elevator. But over the years, he had become more conscious of the sedentary lifestyle he led, and began to embrace the stairwell as an opportunity to make a small, but positive change in his daily routine. As he made his way up the stairs, he noticed the familiar patterns of wear on the steps, a testament to the countless footsteps that had traversed them over the years. The paint on the walls was faded and scratched in some spots, with shades of beige blending into a dull gray. He had always meant to ask the building management to freshen up the stairwell, but somehow it never felt like a priority amidst his busy schedule. Upon reaching the third floor, he paused for a moment to catch his breath. For some reason, the climb felt more challenging that day. He wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, making a mental note to start incorporating more cardio into his workouts. The stairwell was quiet aside from the occasional sound of footsteps from the floors above, reminding him that he wasn't the only one opting to bypass the out-of-order elevator. As the man continued down the dimly lit hallway, he observed the array of doors before him. Each apartment door had its own distinct characteristics - from the varied colors and door knockers to the personalized doormats that welcomed residents and visitors alike. He appreciated the subtle reminders that behind these uniform wood-panelled doors lay a diverse community of individuals, each with their own unique stories and experiences. Arriving at his own door, he unlocked it and stepped inside, momentarily pausing to appreciate the warmth and safety that his home provided. The comforting smell of fresh coffee wafted from the kitchen, a signal that his partner had already started their morning routine. Their shared life was punctuated by small, blissful moments like these, and he made a mental note to ensure that he expressed his gratitude more often. As he took off his jacket, hung his keys on the rack by the door, and moved further into the cozy apartment, he couldn't help but think of the broken elevator that had set this morning's events in motion. Although it was an inconvenience that most of his neighbors likely viewed as a headache, to him, it had served as an unexpected opportunity to pause, reflect, and appreciate the small details that often went unnoticed in the hustle and bustle of daily life. Resolving to continue cherishing these moments of stillness – and to avoid taking the ease of modern conveniences for granted – he decided that even once the elevator was repaired, he would maintain the habit of taking the stairs, valuing the chance to be more active and to observe the often-overlooked nooks and crannies of the building he called home. After all, it was in those quiet, unassuming places that he found the inspiration to make small, meaningful changes in his life. And it was those small, meaningful changes that ultimately brought him closer to the person he aspired to be."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible answers: (I). No (II). Yes I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what are the top three laws in science Suggested answer: I.e. \\"the laws of motion require that\\" Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"No, the answer provided by the automatic system is not entirely accurate.  The top three laws in science are not specifically about motion but rather about fundamental principles that govern various aspects of science. Though the suggested answer seems to refer to Newton's laws of motion, it does not provide clear or comprehensive information about the top three laws in science. To provide you with a more accurate response: some of the most widely recognized and significant laws in science include Newton's Laws of Motion (in Physics), the Laws of Thermodynamics (in Physics and Chemistry), and Mendelian Inheritance Laws (in Biology). However, it is important to note that many other scientific laws exist, and their significance and impact may vary depending on the field of study. Here, we can explore each of the mentioned laws briefly: 1. Newton's Laws of Motion - Sir Isaac Newton developed these three laws in the late 17th century, and they provide a foundation to classical mechanics. The three laws are:    a. First Law (Law of Inertia) - An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion continues in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force.    b. Second Law (Law of Acceleration) - The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).    c. Third Law (Law of Action and Reaction) - For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. 2. Laws of Thermodynamics - These laws express the relationship between heat, work, and energy in physical systems. There are four laws:    a. Zeroth Law - If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.    b. First Law (Law of Energy Conservation) - Energy cannot be created nor destroyed; it can only be converted from one form to another.    c. Second Law - In any energy transfer or transformation, the total entropy of a closed system will always increase over time.    d. Third Law - The entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero. 3. Mendelian Inheritance Laws - Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, discovered these laws in the 19th century while studying pea plants. These laws laid the foundation for modern genetics and describe how traits are passed from parents to offspring. The three laws are:    a. Law of Segregation - Each inherited trait is determined by a pair of genes; during reproduction, an individual contributes only one of these genes to its offspring.    b. Law of Independent Assortment - The inheritance of one trait does not affect the inheritance of another trait.    c. Law of Dominance - If an organism inherits a dominant and a recessive allele for a specific gene, the dominant allele will be expressed. In conclusion, while the initially suggested answer had some relevance to important scientific laws, it is necessary to comprehend the broader scope and details of the top laws in science. The laws mentioned above are some of the most influential, but it is essential to remember the vast diversity of scientific laws that exist across different disciplines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Steve Sansweet, owner of Rancho Obi-Wan in California, asks collectors and fans to help recover items allegedly stolen by his friend of 20 years      The owner of the world’s largest Star Wars memorabilia collection has learned a hard lesson about trust. On Monday, he told his own saga in which 200,000 in collectibles were allegedly stolen from his California museum by a man he once considered a friend – and asked fellow movie fans for help in recovering them.            In a warehouse far, far away, the galaxy's top Star Wars collector holds court Read more      Steve Sansweet, the owner of Rancho Obi-Wan in Petaluma, California, said in a release to “Star Wars fans and collectors” that 100 items, which he referred to as “vintage US and foreign carded action figures, many of them rare and important pieces”, were taken from his collection between late 2015 through 2016, many of them resold.      He posted details of the crime on his website and asked fellow collectors and fans to email tips@ranchoobiwan.org with information.      The alleged culprit: Carl Edward Cunningham, 45 of Marietta, Georgia, a fellow Star Wars collector whom Sansweet has known for 20 years. Cunningham was arrested in March in Sonoma County, California, and charged with felony grand theft. He is free on 25,000 bail and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for 27 June.            “It’s devastating,” Sansweet told the Guardian on Monday about when he learned a friend was charged with the thefts. “It’s a feeling of utter betrayal that someone could stoop to this level, an alleged friend and confidant, someone I had invited to my house and shared meals with.”      Sansweet said he met Cunningham in 1996, while the museum proprietor was head of fan relations at Lucasfilm.      Since 1977, Sansweet has accumulated at least 350,000 franchise artifacts, stored inside a 9,000-sq-ft warehouse he calls Rancho Obi-Wan, located on a idyllic country lane an hour north of San Francisco. He has also written 18 Star Wars books and is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as owning the world’s largest collection of Star Wars paraphernalia.      The theft came to light in February when Philip Wise, a major Star Wars collector, posted news of the theft of a rare action figure from his Texas warehouse. Another dealer from southern California informed Wise that he had purchased the figure from Cunningham, a Georgia collector, Sansweet wrote in his release to movie fans Monday.      Meet the super-collectors: ‘I wish I had Geri’s union jack dress’ Read more      The California dealer, Zach Tann, told Wise that he had bought many other Star Wars collectibles from Cunningham and sent a detailed list. Wise concluded that the quantity and quality of the items suggested they had been taken from Sansweet’s sprawling Ranch Obi-Wan museum.      He contacted Sansweet who confirmed that the items were missing, including a rare three-pack of figures and a store display worth 20,000.      “When I saw the items missing, and considering the circumstances of the theft, my stomach physically sank,” Sansweet said. “I was queasy. I was dumbfounded,”      Sansweet said authorities were trying to retrieve items that had been resold and implored Star Wars fans to report anything they knew about the thefts or sightings of the items. He said two fans have contacted authorities to say they bought some of the items from a legitimate dealer and have offered to return them, even if they do not get their money back.      Actor Mark Hamill, who played the character Luke Skywalker in the film franchise, tweeted Monday about the theft, saying: “Maybe publish a list of stolen items to protect potential victims from purchasing ‘hot’ merchandise.”      Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) Maybe publish a list of stolen items to protect potential victims from purchasing \\"hot\\" merchandise. #TheFraudIsStrongInThisOne #SithHappens https://t.co/coFv1P6HL7      Sansweet said the thefts ran contrary to the collegial spirit of Star Wars fans.      “We’ve had thousands of visitors since we became a nonprofit museum in 2011,” he said. “And never once to our knowledge have we had a single item stolen.”      Sansweet said the museum had already upgraded security, but he refused to say that his trust in friendship had been ruined. “The message here is not to start mistrusting your friends,” he said. “Or you’d be the most miserable person in the world.” ||||| This morning, the man who owns, displays, and offers tours of the world’s largest privately-owned Star Wars collection announced that he’s been systematically robbed over the past several months.      Steve Sansweet—a prolific Star Wars author and collector, and the proprietor of Rancho Obi-Wan in Northern California—posted that over 100 items from his collection have been stolen, “the majority of them vintage U.S. and foreign carded action figures, many of them rare and important pieces.” Reportedly, several of those pieces have already been “resold or professionally appraised for a total of more than 200,000.”      Advertisement      According to Sansweet, the thefts were discovered when the sale of an ultra-rare Boba Fett action figure was tracked from its buyer to a man named Carl Edward Cunningham. Cunningham, whom Sansweet refers to as “a good and trusted friend,” surrendered to police at the end of March but is currently out on bail pending additional hearings.      The Rancho Obi-Wan site is urging any fans who have found themselves in possession of any too-good-to-be-true vintage Star Wars collectibles that may have been stolen by Cunningham to contact them to figure out if it’s one of the pieces in question.      “This has been a devastating betrayal from someone I considered a friend for 20 years,” Sansweet told io9. “But already the Star Wars community has offered its support and two of the purchasers have said they are returning the stolen items that they bought.”            Advertisement      All of the pilfered items were on display as part of Sansweet’s collection at Rancho Obi-Wan, which is run as a non-profit organization; proceeds from tours are donated to various charities. For more on this story, and information on how to contact the organization, visit the below link.      [Rancho Obi-Wan]      Update: We added the statement from Sansweet. ||||| Dear fellow Star Wars fans and collectors,      I need to share some distressing news with you because I need your help.      In February we at Rancho Obi-Wan found out that we had been the victim of a major theft that surreptitiously took place over many months in late 2015 through 2016.      There were more than 100 valuable items stolen, the majority of them vintage U.S. and foreign carded action figures, many of them rare and important pieces. Most have either been resold or professionally appraised for a total of more than 200,000.      The theft came to light after Philip Wise, a good friend, major collector and owner of several Star Wars websites, posted news of the theft of his rare prototype rocket-firing Boba Fett action figure from his Texas warehouse. Zach Tann, a respected toy dealer and collector in Southern California, immediately notified Philip that he had purchased that figure from Carl Edward Cunningham, 45, a well-known Star Wars collector and R2-D2 builder from Marietta, Georgia.      Tann further told Philip that he previously had bought many other rare Star Wars collectibles from Carl and sent a detailed list. Philip said that he quickly concluded by the quantity and quality of items that they had likely been stolen from my collection here in Petaluma, California.      Tann is working closely with us and authorities to help recover and return as many of the stolen collectibles as possible. Without Zach Tann’s call to Philip, which came despite great potential personal financial exposure to himself, we might still not know of the theft or its extent.      Carl surrendered on an arrest warrant from the Sonoma County, California Sheriff’s Department at the end of March and was charged with felony grand theft. He is currently free on bail with additional hearings in the case scheduled.      I have known Carl for many years, considered him a good and trusted friend, and played host to him at my home numerous times. I, and the staff at Rancho Obi-Wan, are devastated that he is the alleged perpetrator of the thefts. Not only have important items been stolen from the collection, but also our time, energy and ability to trust unconditionally have taken a blow.      If you have any information about Carl Cunningham’s activities or items that he has sold please write to tips@ranchoobiwan.org. If you think you may have purchased a stolen item, please be patient while we work through this process.

Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp: \\"I felt sorry for Roberto Mancini. To be put in that situation was not right. It wasn't fair. You wonder what the likes of [former Manchester City managers] Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison would have made of it. \\"I don't know what you can do. He [Tevez] holds all the aces. If you want to give him away someone will come forward and give him a fortune. \\"He is a great player but I can't condone what happened. It is unbelievable, what kind of a message does that send? I thought Roberto Mancini was magnificent after the game. He doesn't deserve that.\\" Players get disappointed and players have egos but you deal with it Stoke manager Tony Pulis: \\"Players get disappointed and players have egos but you deal with it. \\"I'm sure they will deal with it in the right and proper manner.\\" Wigan manager Roberto Martinez told Sky Sports News: \\"These things happen continuously. Football is a game of emotions and behind each player there is a person and sometime they react and make mistakes. \\"Those sort of situations happen very often and sometimes they come out in the press.\\" Former Northern Ireland and current Barnet manager Lawrie Sanchez told BBC Radio 5 live: \\"Manchester City fans will be looking for a statement from the manager explaining what they have decided to do. \\"There are massive egos involved in football when you get to that level of competence and ability - and an ego comes with it. \\"It is part of what got you there but sometimes you have to realise it is not tennis or golf but a team sport. You have to give 100% for the team.\\" Former Nottingham Forest manager Dave Bassett told BBC Radio 5 live: \\"It's not a surprise. It has been coming. In this day and age players are aware of their power and if they want to sulk they are well capable of it. \\"I'm inclined to believe Roberto Mancini's version of events. Now Tevez is doing a damage limitation exercise because of the backlash he has received and all he is worried about is his image. \\"It would be fantastic if the club owners told Tevez he had to see out the rest of his contract in the reserves but it will be interesting to see if they have the bottle to do it.\\" Former Manchester City player Francis Lee told BBC Radio 5 live: \\"It is a severe breach of your contract and what you are supposed to do for the football club, I just can't believe it. \\"The world of football is full of big stars but, to my knowledge, none of them have ever done something like this before. \\"This was done with some reason relating to his wanting to get away for the club because if you refuse to play you are well on your way to going. \\"You have done it to your team-mates. You work with them every day. \\"They are your best friends, you go through everything together, and then you go and do something like this and you have basically kicked them in the unmentionables.\\" Former Blackburn, Sunderland and England full-back Michael Gray told BBC Radio 5 live: \\"I have never known anything like that in my career. There have been players who have told the manager they have not wanted to play but nobody selected on the substitutes' bench who then refused to come on. \\"Last season he was the talisman for City but things change and Sergio Aguero has come in and [Edin] Dzeko has worked hard in pre-season and now Carlos Tevez has to wait his turn. It is unprofessional. If I was a manager that guy would never kick a ball for me again \\"If you are on the bench you have to be ready to come on and do a turn for the team.\\" Former Manchester United, Birmingham and Blackburn midfielder Robbie Savage told BBC Sport: \\"As a footballer, if you are paid £1 or £200,000-a-week, if your manager asks you to go on and do a job for your team, your team-mates and the fans and you refuse to, that is a disgrace. \\"If I was a manager that guy would never kick a ball for me again. \\"It is a complete disrespect to your manager and, more importantly, your team-mates. \\"Carlos Tevez could have altered that game last night because he is a top-class player.\\" Editor of King of the Kippax fanzine and spectator at the Allianz Arena Dave Wallace tells BBC Sport: \\"With today's technology, tablet computers and mobile phones, people at the match were getting messages from home saying he had refused to come on. \\"A lot of City fans paid a lot of money to get over there and every reaction I have had from them is that he is totally out of order. \\"Most fans think that is the end of Carlos Tevez at City and that is a great shame. \\"It is not just a one-off, this has been going on for a while. The club has bent over backwards for him, going back to the beginning of 2010 when we gave him compassionate leave and lost vital games at that time. \\"I think he has to go where we can get the money for him, I don't think we should do a cut-price deal or a loan deal.\\" toffeedaz on Phil McNulty's blog: \\"Millions of professional people have to deal with personal issues away from work, but they put them to one side when the boss asks them to put in their shift. \\"Professionals aren't paid because they can do a job. They're paid because they actually do the job required from them.\\" bellsouth on Phil McNulty's blog: \\"Honestly I don't think he refused to come on, I think he didn't feel he needed to warm up anymore as he had warmed up previously. \\"Part of the issue is clearly language, Mancini's English is not great and Tevez hasn't bothered to master the language despite being in England for years now.\\" mightybluoze on Phil McNulty's blog: \\"Tevez is a walking symptom of everything that is wrong with modern football. \\"An undoubted talent buried beneath petulance, limitless greed, and disrespect for his team mates, his employers, and very much last in his book, his fans.\\" Chief executive Gordon Taylor: \\"It is a serious employment issue. All the various options need to be considered because he is a human being and this is his career we are talking about.

It looks a very difficult situation to retrieve if he is going to stay. \\"In football you have a contract to go out and do the best you can and that didn't happen so there are going to be serious repercussions.\\" Daily Mail chief football writer Matt Lawton on Twitter:\\"Never mind Man City. I doubt we'll ever see Tevez play in England again. Toast. Wondering if Man Utd are working on a 'welcome' poster.\\" The Times Football correspondent Oliver Kay on Twitter: \\"Always disliked the off-pitch circus that surrounds Tevez. Always felt he gave his all on the pitch. No sympathy after tonight.\\" Daily Telegraph football correspondent Henry Winter on Twitter:\\"However galling for Mcfc (& damaging for Financial Fairplay) club need to bite bullet/pay up Tevez contract.

Too good a player, too much money involved. Easy to say it won't happen. I don't think it should. Whole thing stinks. But if there are injuries, suspensions, etc... The Guardian football writer Daniel Taylor: \\"This is a man who craves recognition as the biggest fish in his pond. And this season, at City, he has merely been part of the shoal.\\" FrontRow Legal specialist sports lawyer Richard Cramer speaking to BBC Sport: \\"Mancini has come out and said he will never pay for this club again. That in itself could be regarded as breach of contract on the part of Manchester City. \\"It is called a repudiatory breach - to say to a player that you will never play for this club again effectively deprives the player of the opportunity to carry out his work. \\"In hindsight Mancini would be better saying absolutely nothing and taking the appropriate disciplinary action against Tevez that would have been a two-week fine and a suspension. \\"There is a set procedure within a player's contract, usually consisting of a written warning, then a final written warning and then the last resort of dismissing a player. In exchange for a contract reportedly worth £250,000-a-week, the very least City should expect from Tevez is an agreement to play for the team and their supporters when requested by the manager Read more in Phil's blog \\"What we don't know is if Tevez is subject to ongoing disciplinary proceedings. But, if it is true that he refused to play yesterday, that borders on gross misconduct which would entitle City to sack him. \\"If they find that Tevez's act is beyond the realms of those of a normal player, City may just be able to construct a case against Tevez claiming he is deliberately putting himself in breach of contract, forcing the club to dismiss him for gross misconduct and that entitles them to recover some of the losses. \\"But that is unusual. If City want some compensation for him the best way to pursue that would be to sell him in the January window at the market value.\\" Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP Employment law partner at Peter Holt: \\"The fundamental issue here is whether Tevez, by refusing to do what he was employed to do and play football - does that constitute a fundamental breach of contract? \\"If it is a breach of contract, as an employer City have the option of terminating Tevez's contract with immediate effect. \\"One option they may want to consider is to follow the route that Chelsea took when they cancelled Adrian Mutu's contract. \\"Mutu made his way to Italy and ended up playing for Fiorentina. Chelsea then sued Mutu for compensation for the loss of the sell-on transfer value i.e. the transfer fee they would have received had it not been for his breach of contract. \\"The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld Chelsea's claim and Mutu was ultimately ordered to pay Chelsea 17m euros [£11.5m at the time] for breach of contract. \\"Whether that caluation would apply to Tevez is another matter.\\" Summary:","output":"Premier League managers, former players, and fans weigh in on the Tevez dispute, discussing its impact on his future and the consequences of his actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Alice and Luc are dumping a body The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: Dark Secrets Genre: Mystery/Thriller Tagline: Sometimes the past can't stay buried. Plot: Act 1: Scene 1 (Opening Scene): On a stormy, moonlit night, Alice and Luc struggle to carry a lifeless body wrapped in plastic to a deep, pre-dug hole in a remote wooded area. Their hands and clothes are stained with blood, and they argue in hushed tones over who is to blame for the situation they find themselves in. Shovels in hand, they hurriedly fill the hole with dirt, trying to erase all evidence of their dark secret. Scene 2: As they drive away from the burial site, Alice, a renowned psychologist, and Luc, a journalist with a knack for uncovering hidden truths, discuss how they became entangled in each other's lives. Through flashbacks, we learn about their chance encounter at a coffee shop and their subsequent friendship. Act 2: Scene 1: As Alice and Luc's lives continue, the weight of their shared secret begins to strain their relationship. Alice becomes paranoid, obsessively checking news reports for any mention of their crime. Luc delves into his work, determined to find information that could lead to their exoneration. Scene 2: Luc's investigation into the victim's past reveals a web of deception, crime, and unknown connections to both Alice and Luc. Suspense builds as unknown threats begin to close in on them, and they must work together to decode clues left by the victim before their own lives are put in danger. Act 3: Scene 1: Alice and Luc follow a trail that leads them to a powerful criminal organization that the victim was involved in. As they venture deeper into the dark underworld, they realize that their lives and freedom hinge on exposing the truth. The duo relies on their unique skills—Alice's psychological insight and Luc's unrelenting thirst for knowledge—to navigate the treacherous criminal world. Scene 2 (Climax): In a heart-stopping sequence, Alice and Luc confront the head of the criminal organization and unveil the dark secrets that led to the victim's death. The information threatens to bring down the entire operation, and Alice and Luc barely escape death at the hands of their enemies. Scene 3 (Resolution): As justice prevails, the once tight-lipped duo is able to breathe a sigh of relief. Their bond, forged through fire, brings them closer than ever as they both come to terms with the terrible events that have transformed their lives. The movie ends with a sobering view of the wooded area where it all began, a silent reminder that some secrets can never be fully buried."},{"instruction":"A funeral for Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a noted foreign policy expert and thinker, will be held Friday at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. Question: What did the engineer think about Fergus? Options: - She liked him - not enough information - She hated him - He's a rule breaker Answer:","output":"She liked him"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. There is bound to be ambiguous interpretation of the Commandments, which will result in student confusion and diminish the intended impact on children's morals. Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","output":"There is indeed a possibility that the ambiguous interpretation of the Commandments can result in student confusion and diminish their intended impact on children's morals. Here's some evidence to support this claim: 1. Language Ambiguity: The language in which the Commandments are written can be quite archaic and hard to understand for modern students. This can lead to misinterpretation and confusion about the intended meaning or moral lesson behind each commandment. Also, translations of the Commandments from their original language might not capture the true essence of the original text, leading to further confusion. 2. Cultural and Contextual Differences: The Commandments were written in a specific cultural and historical context, which might not align with the present-day experiences and beliefs of students. For example, certain commandments reference elements of society or actions that might no longer be relevant or relatable to children today. This gap in understanding can lead to confusion and decrease the moral impact of these teachings on students. 3. Multiple Interpretations: Since the Commandments are open to interpretation, different individuals, religious groups, and cultural traditions have developed their own unique understandings of these teachings. This diversity in interpretation can lead to confusion among students, as they might encounter multiple viewpoints surrounding the same moral lesson, making it difficult for them to figure out which interpretation to adhere to or incorporate into their understanding of morality. 4. Lack of Clarity: Some commandments lack comprehensive definitions or explanations, which can lead to ambiguous interpretations of these teachings. For instance, the commandment \\"Thou shalt not kill\\" can raise questions about whether it's acceptable to kill in self-defense, during a war, or if it applies to animals as well. The lack of clarity in these commandments can lead to varied and confusing interpretations among students. 5. Conflicting Norms in Society: Society today often sends conflicting messages about morality and what's right or wrong. Exposure to mixed norms in media, online platforms, and peer groups can confuse children about the true meaning of the Commandments and their Implementation in daily life. This confusion might result in diminished moral impact on students, as they struggle to navigate conflicting messages and values. 6. Moral Relativism: In today's increasingly pluralistic and globalized society, many individuals subscribe to the idea of moral relativism, or the belief that there's no absolute moral truth and that morals vary between individuals and societies. This belief can make the interpretation of commandments even more ambiguous, as students might question the validity and universality of the moral lessons derived from these Commandments. To sum up, the ambiguous interpretation of the Commandments can indeed lead to student confusion and potentially diminish the intended impact on children's morals. Factors like language ambiguity, cultural differences, multiple interpretations, lack of clarity, conflicting societal norms, and the rise in moral relativism all contribute to this confusion and impact the moral development of children navigating these ancient teachings in the modern world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael John Harrison (born 26 July 1945), known for publication purposes primarily as M. John Harrison, is an English author and literary critic. His work includes the Viriconium sequence of novels and short stories (1971-1984), Climbers (1989), and the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, which consists of Light (2002), Nova Swing (2006) and Empty Space (2012). He is widely considered one of the major stylists of modern fantasy and science fiction, and a \\"genre contrarian\\". The Times Literary Supplement described him as 'a singular stylist' and the Literary Review called him 'a witty and truly imaginative writer'. Harrison's enduring fantasy sequence concerning the fictitious city of Viriconium consists of three novels and various short stories and novels written between 1971 and 1984. Viriconium is known as the Pastel City. Both universal and particular, the city has a shifting topography and history, and is sometimes known by names such as 'Uroconium'.  The first book, The Pastel City (1971), presents a civilization in decline where medieval social patterns clash with the advanced technology and superscience energy weapons that the citizens of the city know how to use but have forgotten how to engineer. The more complex second novel is A Storm of Wings (1982). It is set eighty years later than The Pastel City. and stylistically it is far denser and more elaborate. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. Harrison brilliantly depicts the workings of civilization on the verge of collapse and the heroic efforts of individuals to help it sustain itself a little longer.  The third novel, In Viriconium (1982) (US title: The Floating Gods), was nominated for the Guardian Fiction Prize during 1982. It is a moody portrait of artistic subcultures in a city beset by a mysterious plague. Where the previous books in the series held some sword and sorcery elements, In Viriconium goes beyond black humour into a coma of despair.  The short story \\"A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium\\" (1985; later retitled \\"A Young Man's Journey to London\\") is set in our world. It explains that Viriconium can be visited via a mirror in a bathroom in a cafe in England.","output":"This text is about M.

News article: A novel twist on space launches In October, a small team of rocket scientists gathered in the middle of the Mojave Desert to watch a launch they hoped would help change space flight forever. Poised in front of them on the flat, open pan was a slender, 7.5-m (25-ft) tall, Garvey Prospector P-15 sounding rocket. To the untrained eye, the rocket was nothing special. But inside was a radical new engine technology that promises to cut the size, weight and therefore the cost of putting a rocket – and payload – into space. When the countdown clock ticked zero, the rocket fizzed into a roar and rose rapidly from its launch pad; its blazing engine pushing the rocket to 270 m/s (600 mph). After 30 seconds, the engine cut out and the first of the rocket’s red parachutes popped from their casing. The flight test was a success. For the crew from Orbital Technologies Corp (Orbitec) that built the test motor, it was another step in its decade-plus-long journey to prove its technology and show it to be an attractive alternative to a technology that’s been around since the birth of rocketry and one that is still used in most big rockets today. “Orbitec is ready and excited to compete for any future rocket engine and propulsion application,” Paul Zamprelli, business director at the firm said at the time. He and his colleagues believe that their “game-changing technology” could have a major impact on lowering the cost of space access. “We look forward to supplying the Air Force, Nasa and commercial markets with all of our affordable advanced engines and technologies.” To understand why Orbitec’s engines are different, you must first understand how larger liquid-fuel rocket engines – the ones that power astronauts and satellites into orbit – work. At their most basic these rockets have a combustion chamber that’s fed by two pressurised tanks – one of a rocket fuel and one of an oxidiser. When these two are forced into the chamber they mix, ignite and the exhausts are sent at high speed through a nozzle at the end of the rocket, propelling it forward. At full thrust, these engines get incredibly hot, reaching temperatures upwards of 3,000C (5,400F) or more, hot enough to melt the metal chamber in which the rocket fuel mixes with oxygen and burns. At these extremes, even rockets with sidewalls made of heat-resistant superalloys would fail catastrophically. To solve this problem, rocket scientists usually incorporate vein-like networks of cooling tubes through the sides of the combustion chamber which contain heat-absorbing liquid fuels that carry off excess thermal energy. The arrangement is like a car’s radiator system with internal coolant ducts arrayed around the outside of the engine core. It is only through this so-called \\"regenerative cooling\\" system that the rocket is able to maintain its structural integrity. Although the system works it adds considerable weight, cost and complexity to the engine. Orbitec’s alternative approach keeps the hot burning gases away from the chamber surfaces altogether. The company’s patented designs create a cyclonic swirl, or vortex, of fuel and oxygen that holds the searing gases and fumes in the very centre of the cylindrical combustion chamber, away from the vulnerable sidewalls. “Our vortex generator eliminates the high temperatures at the inner surfaces of the engine,” says Martin Chiaverini, principal propulsion engineer at the firm. “You can touch the exterior during lab-test firings and not get burned.” The vortex, or swirl, is produced by placing the oxidiser nozzles at the base of the combustion chamber and aiming them tangentially to the inner surface of its curving walls. This produces an outer vortex of cool gases that spiral up the walls forming a protective, cooling barrier. When this meets the top of the chamber it is mixed with rocket fuel and forced inward and down, forming a second, inner, descending vortex in the centre of the chamber that is concentrated like a tornado. The escaping downward stream of hot, high-pressure gases are then forced through the nozzle at the back of the chamber, producing thrust.

As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour, DreamWorks contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of Shrek 2. The band agreed, and frontman Black Francis and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children. Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while, and since her band The Breeders were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies. The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a \\"poppier, more kid-friendly thing,\\" and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two—in the previous two Pixies studio albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991), Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split. However, the two appeared at the time to have resolved their differences: Francis praised \\"Bam Thwok,\\" as \\"a really good song.\\" despite joking in interviews about how he planned to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a hypothetical new album.

Reports: Chicago police officer to be charged with murder of black teen shot 16 times A white Chicago police officer is expected to be charged with murder in the 2014 shooting death of an African American teenager caught on dash-cam video, individuals close to the investigation told the Associated Press, the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times Monday night. Unnamed officials told the news organizations that Officer Jason Van Dyke is expected to appear at a bond hearing at noon Tuesday at which time he is also expected to be charged with murder. His lawyer has said that the officer’s actions were lawful. “He believed in his heart of hearts that he was in fear for his life … he was concerned about the lives of [other] police officers,” Daniel Herbert told reporters last week. If Van Dyke is indicted, the case will mark the first time a Chicago police officer has been charged with first-degree murder for an on-duty fatality in 35 years, according to the Tribune. These reports come just a week after a judge ruled that the footage of the shooting must be released to the public by Wednesday. Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s administration has been accused of withholding incriminating evidence over the course of a 13-month investigation into the incident. Like so many deaths at the hands of police, Laquan McDonald’s seemed at first destined to be mired in an unending he-said, she-said. The Chicago Police Department initially stated that McDonald, a 17-year-old African American, “lunged” at officers with a knife in a Burger King parking lot. The department’s longtime spokesman, Pat Camden, said at the scene that McDonald posed “a very serious threat,” leaving one officer no choice but to lodge a fatal bullet into the teenager’s chest. Reporters and a few witnesses were skeptical of this account, especially after the Cook County Medical Examiner announced that McDonald in fact had “multiple” gunshot wounds. An autopsy later revealed that McDonald had been shot 16 times, in different places all over his body. Jamie Kalven, the freelance journalist who first obtained the autopsy through a Freedom of Information Act request, called these details “the silent testimony of Laquan McDonald’s corpse.” Gunshot wound of the left scalp. Gunshot wound of the neck. Gunshot wound of the right upper leg. And so on. At least two bullets appeared to have gone through McDonald’s back. The medical examiner described a “well-developed, well-nourished” young man with dreadlocks and several tattoos. One on the right arm read “Quan”; another on his right hand read “Good Son”; a last on the other hand depicted a pair of dice accompanied by the catchphrase “YOLO,” short for “You Only Live Once.” McDonald wore a black hoodie and jeans. He had PCP, a hallucinogenic drug, in his system at the time of his death — explaining spokesman Camden’s remark that he exhibited a “strange gaze” as he allegedly approached the officers. The autopsy declared McDonald’s death a homicide. But was it, as the police department maintained, justified? Shortly after Kalven reported on the autopsy and called for the release of relevant video, other requests came rolling into the mayor’s office — from the New York Times, ABC and more — demanding “any and all video” pertaining to the Oct. 20, 2014, confrontation. Had it not been for the existence of this footage, interest in and attention to the investigation might have faded. Data sets provided by the Chicago Police Department, released this month by the Invisible Institute, a police accountability nonprofit organization, revealed that there has been no discipline for more than 99 percent of the thousands of misconduct complaints against officers in 2015. Of the few officers punished, African American officers faced discipline at twice the rate of their white co-workers for the same transgressions. Van Dyke, the officer expected to be indicted for McDonald’s death, has had 18 civilian complaints filed against him and was punished for none of them, according to the New York Times. Allegations included excessive force and racial slurs against black and Latino residents, all of which he denied. But as far as the McDonald case goes, many believe that the dash-cam video could prove dispositive. [White suspects sought after 5 people shot near Minneapolis Black Lives Matter protest] The footage has been viewed by several people who told the AP that it shows the young man walking away from the officers, and that Van Dyke opened fire from 15 feet away, continuing to shoot after McDonald slumped to the ground. The sequence of events was similarly relayed to the Chicago Sun-Times by Jeffrey Neslund, an attorney for the McDonald family: “He is walking. … When the officer begins shooting, the first shots spin McDonald around. The officer continues to fire from a distance of between 12 and 15 feet. McDonald falls. The only movement is the puffs of smoke coming from the teen’s torso and his head. The police officer comes into view and kicks the knife out of the boy’s right hand.” Neslund told NBC that one witness called the shooting “an execution.” Until recently, the Chicago Police Department maintained that releasing the video would hamper ongoing investigations. But a lawsuit filed this summer by reporter Brandon Smith prevailed last week, as a Cook County judge ruled in favor of lawyers who argued that the department had no legal right to withhold the video because the case is being investigated by other agencies — including the city’s Independent Police Review Authority and the FBI — and not by the Chicago police. Van Dyke’s lawyer, Daniel Q. Herbert, told reporters last week that the officer was “scared to death” and concerned for the safety of his wife and two school-aged children in the event release of the video leads to violence. Herbert urged the public not to judge Van Dyke solely based on the footage. The police department has acknowledged that he is the only officer who shot at McDonald. The judge ordered that the department release the video by Wednesday, though the city has yet to announce precisely how and when it will be made available for viewing. To many onlookers, the decision is long overdue. “The McDonald footage will come out, but a great deal turns on how it comes out,” Kalven wrote in February. “Will the city be forced to release it in a way that deepens the crisis of public confidence in law enforcement, or will it be released in a way that helps restore the ‘foundation of trust’ between residents and police on which effective law enforcement depends?” Mayor Emanuel office’s has been widely criticized for its handling of the investigation and its longstanding refusal to release the video. It drew suspicion in April when it agreed to pay the McDonald family 5 million even before the family’s lawyers had filed a suit. In recent meetings with ministers and aldermen, the Tribune reports, Emanuel said: “What happened here is wrong. There is no justification and it’s profoundly hideous.” He emphasized that “one individual” needs to be held accountable and that citizens should express their First Amendment rights in a “respectful, peaceful” way. Community leaders saw Emanuel’s statements as a last-minute attempt to quell the protest that is expected upon the video’s release. “Many in my community feel betrayed, many are so very angry and protests are imminent, and from the meeting today it’s very clear that Mayor Emanuel knows that,” the Rev. Ira Acree, a pastor present at the city hall meeting with ministers, told the Tribune. He said: “There is a group that is not listening to him and not listening to us either, but nevertheless we are hoping these protests and demonstrations will be peaceful. But we know they are coming, because if there was no protest that would mean we’ve become immune to this madness.” Whole Foods Thanksgiving turkeys endure ‘horrific conditions’ at Calif. farm, animal rights activists say ACLU sues Indiana Gov.

After countless battles against the creatures of the night and the tragic loss of his beloved, he has succumbed to a burnt-out existence. The shadows of his past continue to haunt him, and he seeks solace in alcohol to numb his pain. Peter's relentless struggle to stay afloat threatens to drag him into the depths of despair. He has no way of knowing that an imminent supernatural storm is about to engulf him once again. The movie begins with a series of unexplained, gruesome incidents occurring around the city. The media labels it as the work of a vicious serial killer, but Peter senses a much darker force at play. Unbeknownst to him, a sinister vampire leader, Luciana, has emerged and desires to make the city her kingdom of eternal night. Working on the sidelines, Luciana commands her horde of vampires to eliminate those who dare stand against her. As a former vampire hunter, Peter becomes the target of one of Luciana's loyal vampire lieutenants, Sebastian. However, Peter's faded skills, coupled with his severe alcoholism, result in him barely escaping Sebastian's grasp. Frustrated and humiliated, Peter suddenly finds himself craving redemption and purpose.

Empowered by this knowledge and his reborn fighting skills, Peter rallies the remaining hunters and prepares to wage war against Luciana's growing empire. As the city faces the brink of eternal darkness, the final showdown between Peter's hunters and Luciana's vampires ensues in an epic battle of good versus evil. Bloody and brutal, the night is marred by betrayal, revelation, and sacrifice. Ultimately, Peter faces off against Luciana in a spectacular duel that will determine the fate of the city and all its inhabitants. Despite overwhelming odds and the crushing weight of his past, Peter Vincent emerges victorious.

Additionally, Sentence 2 has a period before \\"Government\\", making it more structurally sound as two separate, complete sentences.  Step 4: Determine if any differences change the overall meaning The difference in the words \\"medicines\\" and \\"medication\\" does not change the overall meaning, since both words are used to describe substances used to treat or cure diseases. The structural change in Sentence 2 does not change the meaning, but it improves the clarity by separating the two ideas.

Lucille, a crippled man who is in a wheelchair from injuries sustained in the Gulf War, searches New Orleans for his friend Melvin so a documentary crew can follow Melvin.  They find him passed out on the street.  Melvin, an alcoholic and drug abuser, is in a downward spiral and spends most of his time partying with his friends.  His estranged ex-wife, Doreen, has filed a restraining order against him and taken sole custody of their young son, Rex.  Lucille wants Melvin to clean up and get sober, but Melvin only makes empty promises to eventually get his life together. Lucas, a science teacher at the local community college, performs regular tests on Melvin, who has telekinetic powers – the ability to move objects with his mind. Lucas can not explain this except that Melvin has a slightly different brain structure than ordinary people.  Melvin will not see a specialist despite Lucas' urging. Besides Lucas' tests, Melvin uses his powers to perform street shows for drug money.  Lucille, however, blames the local drug dealer, Nathan, of being behind violence in the neighborhood and does not like him.  This is echoed by Jimmy, a local cop.

Math Problem Solve 569*j - 561*j + 329 = -492 + 213 for j.","output":"To solve this equation, we must first simplify it before isolating the variable 'j'. Given the equation: 569*j - 561*j + 329 = -492 + 213 Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining like terms. Subtract 561j from 569j on the left side of the equation, and add 213 to -492 on the right side. (569 - 561) * j + 329 = -492 + 213 8*j + 329 = -279 Step 2: Now, we have simplified the equation to: 8j + 329 = -279 The next step is to isolate 'j' by moving the constant term, 329, to the right side of the equation. To do this, subtract 329 from both sides: 8j = -279 - 329 8j = -608 Step 3: Finally, to find the value of 'j', we will divide both sides of the equation by 8: j = -608 / 8 j = -76 So, the solution to the equation is: j = -76"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  At 1600 °C, quartz melts to yield a viscous liquid. When the liquid cools, it does not crystallize readily but usually supercools and forms a glass, also called silica. The SiO4 tetrahedra in glassy silica have a random arrangement characteristic of supercooled liquids, and the glass has some very useful properties. Silica is highly transparent to both visible and ultraviolet light. For this reason, it is important in the manufacture of lamps that give radiation rich in ultraviolet light and in certain optical instruments that operate with ultraviolet light. The coefficient of expansion of silica glass is very low; therefore, rapid temperature changes do not cause it to fracture. CorningWare and other ceramic cookware contain amorphous silica. Silicates are salts containing anions composed of silicon and oxygen. In nearly all silicates, sp3-hybridized silicon atoms occur at the centers of tetrahedra with oxygen at the corners. There is a variation in the silicon-to-oxygen ratio that occurs because silicon-oxygen tetrahedra may exist as discrete, independent units or may share oxygen atoms at corners in a variety of ways. In addition, the presence of a variety of cations gives rise to the large number of silicate minerals. Many ceramics are composed of silicates. By including small amounts of other compounds, it is possible to modify the physical properties of the silicate materials to produce ceramics with useful characteristics.

Question: What is Jerry Ryan's profession? Movie plot title: Two for the Seesaw Movie plot: As the story opens, Jerry Ryan (Robert Mitchum) walking alone in lower Manhattan. Ryan was a lawyer in Lincoln, Nebraska, working in the law firm of his wife's father. No kids. After twelve years, she wants a divorce. Ryan leaves Lincoln while the divorce is pending and goes to New York to find himself. He is alone, living in a cheap room, and almost broke. He has an invitation from an old friend to an eclectic/beat party in Greenwich Village. He shows up and meets Gittel Mosca (Shirley MacLaine) at the party. Mosca is a Brooklynite who left home on her own and rented an apartment in Greenwich Village when she was fifteen. She works as a dancer of sorts, and has had a number of relationships. Ryan and Mosca hook up after a day or so and start a relationship. The core theme of the picture is how their relationship expands and develops their self-respect of themselves. The turning point for Mosca comes when she gets sick and, as Ryan is storming down the stairway, she leans over the railing and begs for help. Ryan takes her to the hospital and looks after her when she is released. Mosca discovers intimacy within love. Class rears its ugly head, but they get over it. They are acting like married people in love. Ryan receives notice that the divorce is final, but he is still conflicted about his ex (Tess). After the divorce is final, Tess calls and wants Jerry back. He agrees, but will work on his own in Lincoln and Tess must accept nothing from her father live in poverty with Jerry until his practice gets on its feet. In the final scene the couple have broken up and are in two separate sets in the same dual scene. This technique is used in the theater but rarely in movies.

Write an article based on this summary: Acknowledge that the pregnancy is not viable. Ask your doctor any questions you might have. Have a friend or loved one with you for support, if possible. Get an injection of methotrexate to dissolve the ectopic pregnancy. Consent to surgical treatment, if necessary. Article:","output":"Title: Understanding Ectopic Pregnancy and Navigating Treatment Options Introduction An ectopic pregnancy happens when a fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. This is a potentially life-threatening condition for the pregnant person, as the growing embryo cannot thrive outside the uterus and may cause severe internal bleeding if not treated. The following article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of ectopic pregnancy and the steps to take when dealing with this difficult situation, including seeking medical advice, understanding treatment options, and empowering patients through emotional support. 1. Acknowledge the reality of the situation Coming to terms with the fact that your pregnancy is not viable can be an emotionally distressing process. The hope of carrying a baby to term and becoming a parent is suddenly replaced with feelings of loss and grief. It is important to remember that you did not cause the ectopic pregnancy and that it is not your fault. Allow yourself to process these emotions and acknowledge that a non-viable pregnancy is an unfortunate but normal part of the reproduction process. Speak openly with a healthcare professional about your feelings and concerns for further support and guidance. 2. Communicate with your doctor One of the most essential steps in dealing with an ectopic pregnancy is maintaining an open line of communication with your healthcare provider. Ask any questions that you might have, no matter how trivial they may seem. Inquire about the different treatment options available to you, potential side effects, and recovery times. Seek advice on what you can do to ensure the best possible outcome for your health and future fertility. 3. Surround yourself with support During this delicate time, having the support of friends and family can be vital in mitigating emotional distress. If possible, have a loved one accompany you to medical appointments to provide emotional support and to help clarify any questions you may have. Consider joining a support group for individuals who have experienced ectopic pregnancies or pregnancy loss, or seek professional counseling to help you cope with the emotional aftermath of losing a pregnancy. 4. Methotrexate treatment If diagnosed in the early stage, an ectopic pregnancy can be treated with an injection of methotrexate. This medication is administered to help dissolve the pregnancy tissue, preventing the need for surgical intervention. Methotrexate acts by inhibiting the growth of rapidly-dividing cells, such as those found in pregnancy tissue. It is essential to follow your doctor's guidance on the administration of methotrexate to achieve the best possible outcome. Regular blood testing and ultrasound monitoring will be implemented to ensure the success of the treatment and monitor your recovery. 5. Surgical intervention In some cases, methotrexate may not be the preferred or effective treatment for an ectopic pregnancy. In these situations, your healthcare provider may recommend surgical intervention. This can include laparoscopic surgery, which involves making small incisions in the abdomen and removing the ectopic pregnancy using a laparoscope (a thin tube with a tiny camera), or a laparotomy, which is more invasive and requires a larger incision in the abdominal area. Always ensure that you understand the risks and benefits associated with your treatment option and provide informed consent before proceeding. Conclusion An ectopic pregnancy is a challenging and emotionally taxing experience. It is essential to acknowledge the reality of the situation, communicate openly with your healthcare provider, and surround yourself with the necessary support during this time. By understanding the different treatment options and working closely with your healthcare team, you can navigate your ectopic pregnancy with confidence and focus on healing and recovery."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms.  I am facing a new situation today: Mike has to learn more about the periodic table for his chemistry exam. To make things easier for him he chose two elements from the table, element A and element B. Element A has higher electronegativity and element B has lower eletronegativity. David found it easier to learn about elements by comparing their properties.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which element would have increased effect of electron shielding, element A or element B? The answer is:","output":"Element B would have an increased effect of electron shielding compared to Element A. This is because Element A has a higher electronegativity, which typically correlates with being higher in the periodic table and moving from left to right across a row. Conversely, Element B has a lower electronegativity, which typically correlates with being lower in the periodic table or to the left of a row. As you go down the columns of the periodic table, the number of electron shells around the nucleus increases, causing a greater electron shielding effect. Electron shielding is the phenomenon where inner electrons partially block the positive charge of the nucleus from outer electrons. As more electron shells are added, the outer electrons experience a weaker attractive force to the nucleus due to the increased shielding, which in turn leads to a decrease in electronegativity. Therefore, considering the trends in electronegativity and electron shielding, Element B would experience an increased effect of electron shielding compared to Element A."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.
