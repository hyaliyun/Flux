Think slowly and carefully, before giving your answer.","output":"The University of Pittsburgh was founded in 1787 as the Pittsburgh Academy. Although multiple individuals were involved in its founding, the most noted person is often Hugh Henry Brackenridge. Hugh Henry Brackenridge was a lawyer, judge, writer, and politician during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Judith Sheindlin, also known as Judge Judy, is a retired Family Court judge and television personality who presided over the courtroom based reality TV show, \\"Judge Judy.\\" Her experiences were mainly in the field of law, particularly family court matters. While both Brackenridge and Sheindlin had careers in the field of law, it is necessary to highlight their different focuses, time periods, and contributions to society. Brackenridge's main contribution is in founding and shaping the early years of the University of Pittsburgh, whereas Sheindlin's primary claim to fame is her television show and contributions to family court matters. In summary, while there may be some commonality in their legal professions, it might be considered a stretch to say that University of Pittsburgh founder Hugh Henry Brackenridge and Judith Sheindlin had a \\"great deal\\" in common.

When we meet him, he's jumping a mail truck on his mo-ped, yes, a mo-ped, and almost makes it. This would be worthy of a 'Jackass' movie if he wasn't honestly trying to do this. Isla Fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl-next-door, Denise. She seems to like Rod enough to join his 'crew'. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half brother, Kevin, who documents the stunts with a camcorder. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mom, Marie. She remarried Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank's a real tough guy who enjoys beating Rod in some real drag out brawls. It's clear that Rod's not going to earn Frank's respect till he can beat him. We find out Frank needs a 50,000. heart transplant and Rod is determined to raise the money just so he 'can beat his ass' once he's healed, and prove himself a man. A long fall down a mountain side convinces Rod to 'go big' on one stunt. Rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life.

Movie title: The Departed Movie plot: In voiceover, Irish-American mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) explains that he doesn't want to be the product of his environment, he wants his environment to be a product of him. Grainy historical film depicts violent riots in Boston during earlier generations. Costello, proudly Irish, unapologetically racist, explains that what annoys him about African Americans is their refusal to realize that they won't be given anything. Costello's belief is you have to do whatever possible to take what you want.Costello is in a small convenience store and collects protection money from the shop owner, who is visibly unnerved by Costello. Costello warns him to have more money next time. Costello asks the shop owner's young teenage daughter behind the counter if she's got her period yet. His attitude is nonchalant and all the more threatening for it. The daughter is both affronted and compelled by the powerful Costello and answers his rhetorical question. The shop owner doesn't show any emotion.A small boy, a young Colin Sullivan (Conor Donovan), is at the counter and witnesses Costello's interaction with the shop owner. Costello notices him and asks him if he's the son of a man Costello knows. He tells the store owner to give the boy two full bags of groceries and then presses some coins into the boy's hand. He tells the boy to remember he can get more money from Costello when he gets older.As Sullivan grows, Costello grooms him and steers him into a job as a police officer, where he can keep Costello informed. Sullivan completes the Police Academy and is immediately transferred to the State Police force. He is accepted into the Special Investigations Unit led by Ellerby (Alec Baldwin) which focuses on organized crime. The primary target of the unit is Costello.

So the correct choice is [2]. yes."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: How often do people who are conditioned to prefer a calorie-dense diet probably eat high salt foods? Options: A. More than once a week. B. Most times that macaroni and cheese is served. C. not enough information D. Usually at lunch time. Answer:","output":"C. Not enough information"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: - Release them into the air by process of sporulation - Spores are carried by the wind - Land in a hospitable growing environment - The spores germinate into the soil - The mushroom starts growing - The adult mushroom produce spores of its own to repeat the process. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The important context to understand here is that the statements provided outline the life cycle of a mushroom - specifically, the way in which mushrooms propagate and grow via the production and dispersal of spores. Spores are tiny, microscopic cells that certain fungi, including mushrooms, release into their environment. These spores can travel long distances, carried by wind, water, insects, animals, or other means, and when they land in a suitable environment, they can germinate, eventually giving rise to a new mushroom. Following the series of statements you provided, the first step of this process can be inferred to be: The adult mushroom undergoes a process called 'sporulation'. Sporulation is when a mature mushroom produces and releases spores into the environment. Different types of fungi have different mechanisms by which they achieve sporulation. In mushrooms, this generally occurs in specialized cells located on the gills, teeth, or pores underneath the mushroom’s cap. During sporulation, the genetic material within the mushroom is partitioned into spore cells, which are then released. Depending on the species, a single mushroom can produce billions of spores in this way. This is a critical part of the mushroom's reproductive cycle. When conditions are right, such as when the air is humid or when the mushroom is mature, the spores are released into the environment. The wind can play an important role in helping the spores scatter widely, enabling them to colonize new areas. Therefore, sporulation in the adult mushroom would be the first step in the cycle you've described. This method of reproduction allows for a widespread distribution of the species, ensuring that at least some spores land in a hospitable growing environment to begin the germination process. This process is advantageous for mushrooms, ensuring their survival and proliferation across diverse habitats."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The APBA Gold Cup is primarily referred to as the \\"Gold Cup\\" because it represents the top prize in hydroplane racing and serves as a prestigious and highly coveted trophy in the powerboat racing world. The name \\"Gold Cup\\" emphasizes the importance of the trophy rather than explicitly suggesting it is made of gold.

The question is asking about how many social classes existed in the Han Dynasty, and the answer you provided does not offer a specific number of classes. For more clarity, the Han Dynasty society was mainly composed of four social classes. These were the emperor and his court, the scholars (also known as gentry), the farmers (or peasants), and the merchants. 1. Emperor and his court: The ruling class comprised the emperor and his extended family, his many courtiers and civil servants. 2. Scholars (Gentry): This was a literate class, often from noble families or were officials that passed civil service examinations. 3. Farmers (Peasants): They are common people and were considered the backbone of the empire because of the basic need of food. 4. Merchants: Despite being successful, wealthy, and contributing to the economy, merchants were generally considered to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy because they were thought to get rich from the works of others. Apart from these four major classes, there was another class of people that one could say were outside the social classes, which the Chinese call the \\"mean people\\". These were people who did not own land, and it also included craftsmen and skillful artisans, making this situation more like a caste system than a rigid social stratification system.

The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre. Byam Shaw commented \\"The one major setback the Sadler's Wells Opera Company suffered from its transplant was that unheeding taxi drivers kept on taking their patrons up to Rosebery Avenue\\".Harewood...

I found the following answer on Google: A more complete picture of mortality is given by a life table which shows the mortality rate separately for each age. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, the answer you found on Google does not directly provide the crude death rate for 1990. While a life table does indeed give a more complete understanding of mortality rates by separating the data by age, it still doesn't answer your question about the specific crude death rate in 1990. The crude death rate (CDR) is a number that illustrates the number of deaths in a certain year for every 1,000 people in a population. It's an important demographic metric which helps assess the mortality situation of a region or a country. The crude death rate for 1990 varied depending on the country or region in question. For a more accurate answer, you would need a specific region or data source to find the rate you are looking for. For instance, in 1990, the crude death rate for the United States was approximately 8.6 deaths per 1,000 population. On the other hand, the global crude death rate in 1990 was estimated to be around 9.3 deaths per 1,000 population. To find the specific crude death rate for a certain country or region in 1990, I would recommend searching for reliable statistical databases or using credible data sources like the World Bank, the United Nations, or country-specific statistical agencies."},{"instruction":"Facts: - clubs: troyes ac cd tenerife dijon fco - caps: 149 56 1 62 - position: midfielder - currentclub: dijon fco - height: 1.81 - years: 2002 -- 2004 2004 -- 2005 2005 -- - clubnumber: 8 - pcupdate: 20 january 2007 - birth date: 5 october 1975 - name: david linarès - birth place: lons-le-saunier , france - goals: 3 0 0 1 Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of david linarès .

Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the meaning of 'global city' A global city, also known as a world city or an alpha city, is a city that is considered to be an important node in the global economic system. These cities serve as key centers for global capital and trade, and possess a high level of influence in terms of culture, politics, and technology. Step 2: Research about cities in Pakistan Research various cities in Pakistan to determine which one(s) might fit the criteria for being a global city. Some of the major cities in Pakistan include Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar. Step 3: Evaluate the cities in terms of global city criteria Evaluate the major cities based on their extent of influence in the global economy, as well as their cultural, political, and technological impact. a) Karachi: As Pakistan's largest city and economic hub, Karachi is home to the country's largest collection of businesses, industries, and financial institutions. The city also hosts the largest seaport in the country, Port of Karachi, making it an essential player in international trade. Karachi's diverse cultural scene and role as a key city in Pakistan's media industry further contribute to its status as a global city. b) Lahore: Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is known for its rich cultural heritage, architectural landmarks, and educational institutions. While Lahore is an important city in Pakistan, its global influence may not be as extensive as that of Karachi. c) Islamabad: As the capital city of Pakistan, Islamabad holds significant political power and influence. The city is home to numerous government institutions, international organizations, and embassies. However, its impact on the global economy and culture is less pronounced than Karachi's. d) Peshawar: Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, has a strategic location near Afghanistan and serves as a significant trade center linking Central Asia to South Asia. Its role in regional trade and historical significance contribute to its global status, but its overall global impact may be less than that of Karachi. Step 4: Determine the most suitable city based on the evaluation Based on the evaluation, Karachi appears to have the strongest claim as a global city in Pakistan, given its crucial role in international trade, its economic clout, and its cultural influence. Answer: The city in Pakistan that can be considered a global city is Karachi, due to its significant contributions to the global economy, extensive international trade connections, and cultural impact."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"All of them are needed for social cohesion, employability and personal development.\\" to Finnish?","output":"To translate the given sentence into Finnish, I will take the following steps: 1.

There are various types, such as wall-mounted, keychain, waiter's friend, or winged corkscrew. I will describe how to use a common handheld bottle opener for both crown cap bottles and wine bottles with corks. Using a handheld bottle opener for crown caps: 1. Identify the side of the opener with the curved metal portion. This is where you'll create leverage on the bottle cap. 2. Place the curved metal part of the opener underneath the ridged edges of the crown cap. Be sure that the curve of the opener sits snugly against the bottle cap ridge to minimize slippage. 3. Apply slight pressure on the opener to hold it in place and maintain your grip on the bottle. The end of the opener should be anchored against the top of the bottle cap while the rest of the opener handle should be aligned perpendicular to the bottle. 4. Gently push down on the handle of the bottle opener away from the bottle. This will create leverage that lifts the bottle cap up and breaks the seal. 5. Once the seal is broken, continue to push down on the handle until the bottle cap comes off completely. Using a handheld bottle opener for wine bottles with corks (waiter's friend or winged corkscrew): 1. Start by removing the foil covering the cork. Use the built-in foil cutter on your opener or carefully use the tip of the corkscrew to cut and peel away the foil. 2. For a waiter's friend, hold the wine bottle with one hand and use the other hand to grip the opener. Extend the corkscrew and position it on the center of the cork. For a winged corkscrew, position the corkscrew on the center of the cork and hold onto the base of the corkscrew with one hand while turning the handle with the other hand. 3. Begin twisting the corkscrew clockwise into the cork, making sure it's going in straight and not at an angle. Continue until the corkscrew is almost fully embedded in the cork. For a winged corkscrew, the wings should be fully raised by now. 4. For a waiter's friend, position the lever arm's edge on the lip of the bottle. Using your thumb, anchor the lever arm on the bottle lip for leverage. Gently pull back on the handle while simultaneously pushing down on the lever arm to lift the cork out. For a winged corkscrew, press down on the wings simultaneously to lift the cork out of the bottle. 5. Once the cork has been removed from the bottle, twist the corkscrew counterclockwise to release the cork from the opener. Remember to always be cautious while using a bottle opener and control your movements to avoid any spills, injuries, or breaking the bottle."},{"instruction":"How is \\"Meanwhile, Capital Investment Minister Velimir Ilic announced the allocation of 1m euros for an embankment project in the Zrenjanin municipality.\\" said in Turkish?","output":"\\"Öte yandan, Sermaye Yatırım Bakanı Velimir Ilic, Zrenjanin belediyesindeki bir set projesi için 1 milyon euro tahsis ettiğini duyurdu.\\" diye Türkçe söylenir.

Her mother tells her a story of a person who wanted to see the ocean; then she explains that sometimes one must learn to see some things (through her mind's eye) without looking. The film flashes forward to Sita, a newly married young woman, trying to perceive some emotion from her husband Jatin. Jatin appears distant and shows little interest in Sita or in being married. Sita is given a perfunctory welcome by Jatin's family. Jatin is in a typical joint family arrangement. He lives with his older brother Ashok, his sister-in-law Radha, his invalid mother (Biji) and the family servant Mundu. Their apartment is on the second floor of a two story dwelling in a crowded marketplace in New Delhi. Ashok and Jatin run a small store (on the first floor) that sells food (for takeout) and rents videotapes. Sita is gradually exposed to various difficulties. She is also in a typical arranged marriage, but she learns that Jatin married her only to put an end to Ashok's incessant nagging. Jatin continues to date his Chinese girlfriend. Sita does not rebuke him for fear that it may bring dishonour to her parents. The rest of Jatin's home is not rosy either. Biji is paralysed and without speech after a stroke, and Sita and Radha must constantly attend to Biji (even her hygiene). Sita spends her days slaving in the hot and greasy kitchen, and she finds herself lonely and frustrated at night because Jatin is out dallying with his girlfriend. On the financial front, the store provides a modest income but their expenses are very high and they are unable to expand their business or buy a bigger home. Sita resignedly accepts these difficulties, but yearns to break out of this stifling and hopeless situation. It is later revealed that Radha faces a somewhat similar problem.

Interviewer: Right then, Roger, what made you take off to the country in the first place? Roger: Well, I suppose any one who moves to the country wants their life to be different in some way. I mean, if you have always lived in a city, as I had, then something must happen to make you want to move. In my case I was made redundant, and, when it came to looking around for a new job, I just couldn't face going back into an office again. So I sat down and thought about what I'd really like to do. Interviewer: And that, I suppose, turned out to be something in the country? Roger: No, initially I didn't think of moving, but just of getting a different kind of job, you know social work with kids or old people, that kind of tiring. Interviewer: So what happened, why didn't you? Roger: Well, I hadn't got any of the right qualifications, and it would have taken me two years to get qualified and I certainly didn't want to go back to formal education again. Interviewer: Couldn't you have learned while on the job sort of picked it up as you went along? Roger: No, you have to have a diploma.

So, where did you go when you did decide to move? Roger: I went right out to Shropshire. After all I thought if you're going to go rural you might as well do it properly. The first problem though was how I was going to make a living. There are fewer jobs in the country, so I decided to start up on my own. Interviewer: That's pretty ambitious, a townie moving off to the depths of the country and setting up his own business. How did you start, had you got any skills? Roger: I'd always had a garden and grown some vegetables and flowers, you know, usual things, salad stuff, carrots, peas, beans, a bit of fruit, some roses.., so I thought of a small holding, a kind of small farm. But when I looked at the prices to buy, I changed my mind; I didn't...

Answer: Some have posited that the facts of lower socioeconomic status for people of color suggest that Brazil practices a kind of one-drop rule, or discrimination against people who are not visibly European in ancestry. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Available choices: - yes - no","output":"Unequal living standards can manifest through various patterns in different aspects of society, which in turn can accentuate social stratification based on income, race, gender, and geographical location. Here are seven key patterns consistent with unequal living standards: 1. Education: Socioeconomic disparities often reflect in unequal access to quality education. Students from underprivileged backgrounds are likely to attend schools with fewer resources and opportunities, hindering their chances to excel academically. This in turn limits their long-term prospects for higher education and high-paying jobs, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. 2. Healthcare: Unequal living standards often result in disparities in healthcare access and outcomes. Low-income individuals and communities may lack access to high-quality healthcare facilities and services, suffer from inadequate access to preventative care, and face higher rates of illness and mortality. These disparities can further deepen socioeconomic inequalities. 3. Employment: Job opportunities and income levels can also reflect unequal living standards. Lower-income individuals typically face more significant barriers to employment opportunities, such as limited education or job training. These barriers can perpetuate income inequality, as individuals struggle to climb the socioeconomic ladder and continue to face limited job options that may not provide a living wage. 4. Housing: Access to affordable and high-quality housing plays a crucial role in living standards, health, and overall well-being. The poor and the working class may be concentrated in segregated areas or experience housing discrimination, which allows for poor infrastructure, limited access to services, and exposure to environmental hazards. 5. Social mobility: In societies characterized by unequal living standards, social mobility may be limited. Research has shown that intergenerational economic mobility varies significantly across different regions, socioeconomic groups, and racial and ethnic backgrounds, further perpetuating economic and social inequality. 6. Access to basic amenities: Unequal living standards can also manifest in unequal access to basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation, electricity, and transportation infrastructure. The unavailability or inadequacy of these basic services negatively impacts the quality of life for individuals and communities and continues the cycle of inequality. 7. Racial and gender disparities: Societies with unequal living standards are often characterized by systematic racial and gender disparities. Marginalized groups may face more considerable obstacles and prejudices in their access to education, healthcare, employment, and housing. These discriminatory practices can lead to persistent intergroup inequalities, reinforcing social divisions and unequal living standards. In conclusion, unequal living standards are not an isolated or straightforward issue. Instead, they manifest through a complex interplay of various social, economic, and political factors. Addressing these patterns is essential in moving towards a more equitable society where all individuals can realize their full potential and enjoy an equal quality of life."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

A. gas B. full stomach C. feeling satisfied D. have energy E. bloated The best answer is","output":"C. feeling satisfied Eating breakfast provides a myriad of benefits, and one of the primary goals is to feel satisfied and content after a meal. Not only does breakfast provide necessary nutrients after an overnight fast, but it also helps set the tone for the rest of the day. The best answer as to why you eat just enough when eating breakfast is because of the feeling of satisfaction it provides. Let's explore the various aspects of this phenomenon in detail. 1. Satiety: Consuming just the right amount of food in the morning helps to satisfy hunger pangs and provide a sense of fullness that can help to curb cravings and overeating throughout the day. Foods rich in fiber, protein, and healthy fats tend to be more filling and can help regulate appetite more effectively. 2. Hormonal balance: Eating a balanced breakfast meal helps stabilize blood sugar levels and prevent sudden fluctuations that can trigger hunger and cravings. It also helps maintain hormonal balance, including leptin and ghrelin, which regulate hunger and fullness cues. 3. Energy levels: When you eat just enough for breakfast, you provide your body with the fuel it needs to function optimally without excessive energy dips or spikes. This can help improve your mood, focus, and productivity throughout the day. 4. Portion control: Consuming a balanced breakfast in appropriate portions can set the stage for healthier eating habits throughout the day. It reinforces the importance of mindful eating and being attuned to your body's hunger and fullness cues. 5. Preventing overeating: Eating just enough food in the morning prevents you from feeling excessively hungry or deprived later in the day, which could lead to overeating or poor food choices. In this way, eating a satisfying breakfast is instrumental in supporting weight management and overall health. 6. Digestion: Eating breakfast in moderate amounts can also help your digestive system function more effectively. Overeating can lead to bloating, indigestion, and other digestive discomforts, while eating just enough will comfortably sustain you until the next meal. In conclusion, eating just enough when having breakfast can be attributed to the feeling of satisfaction that it provides. By consuming a balanced meal that provides necessary energy and nutrients, you are setting yourself up for success throughout the day. This approach to breakfast contributes to overall health and well-being by promoting satiety, hormonal balance, healthy digestion, and improved weight management."},{"instruction":"If \\"A woman throwing a frisbee on a beach.\\" does that mean that \\"A woman is catching a ball.\\"?

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 0 = -8069*p + 8099*p + 150 for p, we shall first simplify the equation by combining like terms. 0 = (-8069*p + 8099*p) + 150 Since -8069*p and 8099*p are like terms (both have the variable p), we can add their coefficients: (-8069 + 8099) * p = 30 * p So, the simplified equation is: 0 = 30*p + 150 Now, we need to isolate the variable p. We can do this by moving all the terms involving p to one side of the equation and all the constants to the other side. In this case, we want to get rid of the constant term 150 on the right side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 150 from both sides: 0 - 150 = 30*p + 150 - 150 -150 = 30*p Now, we can solve for p by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of p, which is 30: -150 / 30 = 30*p / 30 -5 = p So, the solution to the equation 0 = -8069*p + 8099*p + 150 is p = -5."},{"instruction":"Gwen owns a sauna. She wants to try something new and decides to make the room air tight, meaning no air can escape the room. After trialing this with a few customers she asks them for some feedback. The customers say they really like how there is never a draft in the room but they feel weird when they leave the room and their ears pop like when they are are on an airplane and the pressure is uneven. Will the pressure of a sealed container increase or decrease when a gas inside it is heated?","output":"To determine if the pressure of a sealed container will increase or decrease when a gas inside it is being heated, we can refer to the ideal gas law equation: PV = nRT Where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. In this situation: 1. The room is airtight, so no air can escape or enter the room, meaning the number of moles of the gas (n) remains constant. 2. The room's volume (V) is fixed because the walls, ceiling, and floor are rigid and don't change. 3. When heating the gas in the room, the temperature (T) increases. Since n, R, and V are constant in this case, we can rewrite the equation to: P1/T1 = P2/T2 Where P1 and T1 are the initial pressure and temperature, and P2 and T2 are the final pressure and temperature after heating the gas in the sealed room. Assuming the initial pressure and temperature are at a comfortable room condition, T2 > T1 because the gas is being heated. Given the equation P1/T1 = P2/T2, if T2 > T1, then P2 must also be greater than P1 for the equation to hold true. Therefore, the pressure inside the sealed room will increase when the gas is heated. The customers feeling their ears pop when leaving the room indicates that there is indeed a pressure difference created by the heating of the gas, with the pressure inside the room being higher than the outside pressure."},{"instruction":"Vom lupta pentru punerea în aplicare a acestuia, deoarece Tratatul de la Lisabona a intrat acum în vigoare. Translate to English English:","output":"\\"We will fight for the implementation of this treaty, as the Treaty of Lisbon has now come into force.\\" The Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force on December 1, 2009, is an international agreement that amends the two previously existing treaties constituting the foundation of the European Union (EU): the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC). The Lisbon Treaty aimed to improve the institutional structure, decision-making process, and overall functioning of the EU, as well as to enhance its role on the global stage. As an AI language model, I understand that the request is to fight for the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. From the perspective of a supporter of this treaty, there are several reasons to do so: 1. Strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the EU: The Lisbon Treaty increases the role of the European Parliament (EP) by giving it more legislative powers under the ordinary legislative procedure, which extends its coverage to new policy areas, ensuring a more democratic process in the EU. 2. Enhance citizens' participation in the EU: The treaty introduces the European Citizens' Initiative, which allows citizens to directly participate in the development of EU policies. By collecting one million signatures, citizens can ask the European Commission to propose legislation on a particular issue. 3. Increase transparency and accountability: The Lisbon Treaty brings more transparency to the decision-making process by extending the rights of national parliaments to participate in EU affairs. It enables them to scrutinize legislative proposals more effectively and to object to them in case they violate the subsidiarity principle. 4. Streamline the EU's institutions: The treaty establishes the position of a permanent President of the European Council and a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, allowing for better coordination and consistency in the EU's external actions. 5. Concrete steps towards a more united and effective Union: The treaty introduces new provisions that allow for further integration, such as Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in defense matters. This emphasizes the commitment of the Member States to work together and foster a stronger European defense capability. In conclusion, those who support the Treaty of Lisbon believe that its full implementation will result in a more democratic, transparent, and efficient European Union, which is capable of addressing the challenges it faces in an increasingly interconnected world. Advocating for its implementation will contribute to achieving these objectives and ensure that the European Union upholds its founding principles and values."},{"instruction":"Given the following question, let's solve step-by-step.

A:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct, but I will provide you with a more detailed and comprehensive explanation to help you understand the meaning of \\"add my two cents\\" better. \\"Add my two cents\\" is a common phrase used in conversation that signifies a person is sharing their opinion or thoughts on a particular matter. The phrase is derived from the original expression \\"put(or throw) in one's two cents,\\" which has evolved over time. The \\"two cents\\" in the phrase refers to a metaphorical and minimal amount of money, representing the idea that the speaker's contribution to the conversation might not be significant or valuable, but they still want to express their views. In American currency, two cents is a small value, so using this term emphasizes the humility or cautiousness with which the person is speaking. The phrase often carries a tone of humility as it suggests that the speaker is aware that their input might not be the most important or essential part of the discussion. They want to acknowledge that they are respectfully offering their perspective without dominating or overwhelming the conversation. As mentioned in your original answer, \\"add my two cents\\" can also be used with a touch of irony when someone has a strong opinion about something and wants to make their point emphatically. In these cases, the phrase is used to indicate feigned modesty as the speaker knows that their opinion may be more influential or important than they are making it out to be.

The fire department plans to replace four of its five thermal imaging cameras, which allow firefighters to see through heavy smoke and identify fire hotspots, using a 30,000 donation from the Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, according to Bangor Fire Chief Tom Higgins. “It’s an aid for them. It’s another tool in the toolbox,” said Higgins. The Kings “are kind people who want to give back to the community and we are appreciative of what they do.” A representative for the Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation did not immediately return a phone message on Monday. Over the past 30 years, Bangor’s most famous couple has given millions to cities, towns and organizations throughout the state through their foundation. In 2015 it gave about 150 grants totaling almost 3 million to schools, towns, churches, libraries, theaters, museums, fire departments, law enforcement agencies, health centers, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and a host of other charities and organizations across Maine, according to its 990 form. Bangor has often been the recipient of several significant King family donations over the years. In 2013, the Kings donated 3 million to help pay for the 9 million renovation of Bangor Public Library and funded other million projects including the construction of Mansfield Stadium in 1991 and Beth Pancoe Pool in the early 2000’s. The Bangor Fire Department received about 20,000 in 2015 from the Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation for the purchase of specialized washer-dryer equipment, which wash carcinogens and other harmful substances from firefighters’ turnout gear and clothes. The latest donation allows the fire department to replace thermal imaging cameras that were purchased in 2009, Higgins said. Those cameras allow firefighters to see objects through heavy smoke and the temperatures of various sections of a burning building. The new, more technologically advanced models are lighter than their current cameras and have clearer images, said Higgins. Assuming the city council votes to accept the grant at a future meeting, Higgins expects the cameras to be purchased and put in use within the next 60 days. ||||| King Foundation Grant Buys Bangor Fire Thermal Imaging Cameras Thanks to a 30K grant, courtesy of the Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, the Bangor Fire Department will be purchasing thermal imaging cameras.

Commissioner Carolyn Bivens became increasingly unpopular with the LPGA Tour's playing members. It announced on Tuesday that Rear Admiral Marsha J. Evans, a member of the board of directors, would stand in until a replacement could be found. Retired former world No. 1 golfer Annika Sorenstam will be helping the board in its quest. \\"We'll soon have in place a Commissioner to lead us into 2010 and beyond, but until then, it's important that we immediately appoint an Acting Commissioner whom we know and trust,\\" chairman Dawn Hudson said. \\"As a board of players and independent directors, we wanted an Acting Commissioner with experience leading large organization, one who appreciates and listens to our player members and tournament owners, understands sponsors and their challenges and needs, and has a track record that commands respect.\\" Bivens stood down a day after the U.S. Women's Open was won by South Korea's Eun Hee Ji, with the build-up to the tournament having been largely overshadowed by the row. World No. 1 Lorena Ochoa had been among 15 leading players who a week earlier signed a letter to the tour's board of directors calling for Bivens to step down. The 56-year-old had been in charge since 2005, when she became the first woman to hold the role in the LPGA's 55-year history. The appointment was not popular, with seven high-ranking LPGA executives quitting in her first eight months in charge. She courted controversy last year when she announced an \\"English-only\\" speaking policy for players on the tour, which has become increasingly international with 45 players from South Korea alone -- and many have been claiming regular victories. The LPGA was forced to backtrack following storms of protest and bad publicity. In May, Bivens was criticized after being quoted as saying that players should use the social networking Web site Twitter during tournaments to keep fans updated with their progress. The LPGA quickly released a statement claiming she had been misquoted, but it raised the ire of the players. With difficult economic times, the tour has lost some key sponsors and tournaments -- there are only 10 events scheduled in the U.S. for next year. During Bivens' tenure, the LPGA acquired the developmental Duramed FUTURES Tour and ownership of two tournaments: the LPGA Championship and the ADT Championship, which this year was canceled due to its sponsors' financial problems. Bivens secured photo licensing rights in a deal with Getty Images and brokered TV rights contracts with two channels. Highlights:","output":"1.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What is Davis obsessed with owning? Movie plot title: How to Steal a Million Movie plot: Paris, 1966...Monsieur Charles Bonnet (Hugh Griffin), the current head of the Bonnet family, custodian of the family's legendary collection of fine art, and a noted collector in his own right, is offering one of his prized paintings at auction. A Cezanne, it sells for a fabulous 515,000, the high point of the auction. When Bonnet's daughter, Nicole (Audrey Hepburn), hears the news on her car radio on her way home from work, she is shocked...and dismayed. The moment she arrives at their elegant old chateau, she runs upstairs calling her father. In his bedroom on the second floor, she opens the door to an antique wardrobe and steps inside, opens a false panel at the back of the wardrobe and climbs a hidden spiral staircase to her father's secret studio in the attic.Bonnet, it turns out, is a forger of fine art...cheerful and charming, but an unrepentant scoundrel. He is putting the finishing touches on his latest project, a flawless rendition of a famous lost Van Gogh. He has even found another painting from the same period, by an unknown artist, and has brushed dirt from the back of that canvas to transfer to his forgery. \\"I doubt if even Van Gogh himself would have gone to such pains with his work,\\" he boasts. \\"He didn't have to, Papa,\\" Nicole retorts, \\"he WAS Van Gogh!\\" She tells him in a tired voice (for what must surely be the thousandth time) that it's a crime to sell fake masterpieces. He replies that he only sells them to wealthy, private buyers, who get an undeniably fine painting in return.A noise in the driveway sends them both to the window: An armored car, a police van, a black limousine and half a dozen motorcycles have arrived and parked in front of the house. Nicole is terrified that the authorities have at last discovered Bonnet's hobby, but Bonnet explains that he has simply agreed to let the Claver-Lafayette Museum display their exquisite statuette of Venus, purportedly carved by 16th Century sculptor Benvenuto Cellini, in their latest exhibit. Nicole is not reassured: Their Cellini Venus is...","output":"not an original, but another one of Bonnet's forgeries. Now, her primary concern is to protect her father from any potential consequences of his criminal enterprise. As the movie progresses, we not only delve into the world of art forgery and the high society of 1960s Paris but also witness the development of a romantic relationship between Nicole and Simon Dermott (Peter O'Toole), an expert thief. This central romantic subplot adds depth to the characters and humanizes them, while also providing an interesting dichotomy between the world of forgery and outright thievery. To answer the question about Davis's obsession with owning something, there is no character named Davis in the movie \\"How to Steal a Million,\\" and therefore no specific item or object that such character is obsessed with owning. It can be assumed that by \\"Davis,\\" the question actually refers to one of the central characters in the movie, like Charles Bonnet or Simon Dermott. However, neither of them has a specific obsession with owning something. Instead, Charles Bonnet's main motivation and intrigue revolve around the challenge and artistry of forging masterpieces and getting away with it, not particularly owning any specific artwork, even though he does appreciate the genuine art pieces. On the other hand, Simon Dermott is more focused on stealing artworks for the thrill and challenge of the caper, rather than being obsessed with owning them. In conclusion, there is no definitive answer to the question about Davis's obsession with owning something, as there is no character by that name in the movie and neither central character has an obsession with owning a specific item. The plot of \\"How to Steal a Million\\" centers around art forgery, theft, and the relationships the characters develop while navigating the criminal world of art. The obsessions, if any, lie more in the art of forgery and thievery itself rather than owning a specific piece."},{"instruction":"1.

Britain, along with much of Northern Europe, has a non-touch culture, so personal space is very important. In a formal situation, we would usually greet each other with a handshake.

The purpose of this prohibition is to set aside time for worship, reflection, and celebrating the event or festival. The holy convocation serves as a reminder for people to gather together and bond with their community, remembering their shared beliefs and values. Such gatherings provide an opportunity for everyone to pause from their daily routines and lay aside their work-centric mindset, allowing them to focus on their spiritual growth and gratitude. One of the key aspects of these holy days is the exclusion of servile work, which means that tasks that are considered monotonous, labor-intensive or ordinary should be avoided. This helps the community prioritize their spiritual well-being over everyday tasks or personal goals. It creates an atmosphere conducive to inner reflection and fosters strong relationships rooted in faith and shared beliefs. In many cultures and religions, there are days or periods designated as special, sacred, or spiritual. These observances may vary significantly, but the common principle underlying them all is the importance of setting aside specific moments for introspection, connection, and gratitude. These moments are crucial in allowing individuals to refocus and realign their lives with their spiritual well-being, emphasizing the fact that life isn't solely about worldly pursuits. To sum up, the verse \\"28:18 In the first day shall be a holy convocation: you shall do no servile work;\\" highlights the significance of holy gatherings and the importance of refraining from common, labor-intensive tasks during those times. Such special days encourage personal growth, gratitude and strong community bonds. Setting aside time for spiritual development ensures a more balanced and fulfilling existence, reminding people that life is about more than just labor and material success."},{"instruction":"Teacher:You are given a review of Amazon's food products.

If the brightness of the light is multiplied by a factor and the exposure of the film decreased by the same factor by varying the camera's shutter speed and aperture, so that the energy received is the same, the film will be developed to the same density. This rule is called reciprocity. The systems for determining the sensitivity for an emulsion are possible because reciprocity holds. In practice, reciprocity works reasonably well for normal photographic films for the range of exposures between 1/1000 second to 1/2 second. However, this relationship breaks down outside these limits, a phenomenon known as reciprocity failure. How is the brightness of a light changed? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The brightness of a light can be changed by varying several factors, both in the light source itself and in the environment where the light is being emitted. Here are some ways in which the brightness of a light can be altered: 1. Intensity of the light source: By increasing or decreasing the power supplied to a light source, its intensity can be changed. For example, a dimmable LED light bulb can be adjusted to different brightness levels by changing the amount of electrical power it receives. 2. Distance from the light source: The brightness of a light also depends on the distance between the light source and the illuminated object or surface. According to the inverse square law, the intensity of light diminishes with the square of the distance from the source. This means that an object placed twice as far away from a light source will receive only one-fourth of the illumination. 3. Angle of incidence: The angle at which light strikes a surface can also affect its apparent brightness. A light source shining directly on a surface (at a 90-degree angle) will appear at its brightest, while lights hitting the surface at more oblique angles will appear less bright due to reflection and scattering. 4. Diffusion and reflection: Diffusion can be used to soften and spread light, reducing harsh shadows and creating a more even distribution of brightness. Reflectors can bounce light toward or away from specific areas, also enabling control over brightness levels. 5. Environmental factors: The brightness of light can also be affected by environmental factors such as the presence of dust, fog, or haze. These can scatter and absorb light, ultimately reducing the perceived brightness. 6. Contrast with surroundings: The brightness of a light source can also be perceived in relation to the overall ambient lighting in the environment. A light source will appear brighter in the dark surroundings as compared to a well-lit environment. By controlling these factors, the brightness of a light can be effectively adjusted, allowing for a variety of creative and practical applications in photography, film, and other visual arts."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end...

Title: Underworld: Evolution Movie plot: NOTE: Sequel to Underworld (2003).Underworld: Evolution opens with Vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) recapping the events in Underworld. Selene is a Hungarian Vampire who had been a Death Dealer for the Vampire clan throughtout Europe for 600 years when she was betrayed. She explains how Kraven (Shane Brolly), the ruler of the Vampire clan, formed a secret alliance with Lucian (Michael Sheen), ruler of the Lycan clan. When the Lycans found a third bloodline (human) that also descended from ancestor Alexander Corvinus, they tracked down descendent Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) and turned him into a Lycan. After a big fight between Lycans and Vampires, Lucian was killed by Kraven. Before Michael died, however, Lucian told Selene to bite Michael: \\"Half Vampire, half Lycan -- they're stronger than both.\\" Thus, Selene turned Michael into the first Hybrid. Selene then beheaded Elder Viktor, and she and Michael went into hiding.With two of the three vampire Elders destroyed (see Underworld), Selene's only hope is to awaken the last remaining Elder, Marcus (Tony Curran), who is still in hibernation, and expose the truth before Kraven can kill Marcus. Selene hides Michael in a safehouse and heads over to the Vampire mansion to plead her case. Unfortunately, Kraven has already attempted to awaken Marcus, who has morphed into some sort of bat-like creature, and Marcus has killed Kraven as well as all of the other Vampires in the mansion, including Erika (Sophie Myles) (Note: Erika's brief appearance just before her death appears to be taken from archive footage from the previous movie).

Jack Andraka from Crownsville, Maryland, developed a simple dip-stick test for levels of mesothelin, a biomarker for early stage pancreatic cancer found in blood and urine. It promises to revolutionise treatment of the disease, which currently kills 19 out of 20 sufferers after five years - largely because its so difficult to detect until its final stages. Prodigy: Jack Andraka speaks after receiving Smithsonian Magazine's first annual American Ingenuity Award for youth achievement in Washington, DC. last November. He has invented a new test for pancreatic cancer. Jack's invention, for which he was last month awarded the grand prize of 75,000 in scholarship funds at the 2012 Intel Science Fair, means that patients now have a simple method to detect pancreatic cancer before it becomes invasive. His novel patent-pending sensor has proved to be 28 times faster, 28 times less expensive, and over 100 times more sensitive than current tests. Thanks to the test, pancreatic cancer. patients could now get an early earning to seek medical help when it. still has a chance of working, which could, he claims, potentially bump. up survival rates to 'close to 100 per cent'. Deadly: Pancreatic cancer is the same form of the disease that caused late Apple CEO Steve Jobs' long decline and eventual death. The test works in a similar way to diabetic testing strips, with his paper strips using only a drop of blood to determine whether patients carry the mesothelin biomarker. It is said to be over 90 per cent accurate, practically instant - and costs only 3 cents. And what's more, his simple test can also be used to detect ovarian and lung cancer, and it could be easily altered to detect the biomarkers of a range of other conditions. 'What’s so cool about that is its applicability to other diseases…for example other forms of cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, environmental contaminants like E Coli, salmonella,' Jack told Take Part. 'All for three cents for a test that takes five minutes to run.' Jack was moved to come up with the. test after a family friend passed away from pancreatic cancer, but it. was as he surreptitiously read a journal article about carbon nanotubes. in a biology lesson that he had his 'epiphany'. But. that eureka moment was not enough; the persistent teenager was rejected. by 197 scientists he solicited for help with his research - with some. plainly telling him his idea simply would not work. A cluster of pancreatic cancer cells: The disease currently kills 19 out of 20 sufferers after five years - largely because its so difficult to detect until its final stages when patients are less likely to respond to treatment. To come up with his new pancreatic cancer test, Jack mixed human mesothelin-specific antibodies with conductive single walled carbon nanotubes. He used the mixture to coat strips of ordinary filter paper, making them conductive, and determined the optimal layering using a scanning election microscope. Cell media spiked with varying amounts of mesothelin was then tested against to the paper biosensor and any change in the electrical potential of the sensor strip (due to the changing conductivity of the nanotubes) was measured. Changes in conductivity occurred because the antibodies on the strips binded to the mesothelin and enlarge, spreading the nanotubes further apart and changing the electrical properties of the network. The more mesothelin applied, the more the antibodies would grow and the weaker the electrical signal would become. Andraka's sensor costs 3.00 and 10 tests can be performed per strip, taking 5 minutes each. The test is said to be 168 times faster, 26,667 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive than current testing methods. Finally Dr Anirban Maitra, a professor of pathology and oncology at Johns Hopkins University, agreed to give him space in the lab and mentored him through the process of developing the test. To create the test, Jack mixed human mesothelin-specific antibodies with single-walled carbon nanotubes used the product to coat strips of ordinary filter paper. The nanotubes make the paper conductive, but when mesothelin is applied the antibodies would bind to the biomarker and enlarge, spreading the nanotubes apart and changing the strips' electrical properties. The more mesothelin present, the more antibodies bind and grow, and the weaker the electrical signal becomes - allowing scientists to accurately measure the levels of the biomarker. Now the teenage prodigy has plans to mass-market the tests and make them widely available to the public, which he believes could alter the balance of power in medicine. 'Essentially what I’m envisioning here is that this could be on your shelf at your Walgreens, your Kmart,' he said. 'Let’s say you suspect you have a condition…you buy the test for that. And you can see immediately if you have it. 'Instead of your doctor being the doctor, you’re the doctor.'

Saint Anthony Falls, the only waterfall of its height on the Mississippi, played an important part in the development of Minneapolis. The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills. In 1870, only a small number of flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain. Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the milling industry. Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling. To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology. They invented the middlings purifier, a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process. They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones. A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the gluten with the starch. These improvements led to the production of \\"patent\\" flour, which commanded almost double the price of \\"bakers\\" or \\"clear\\" flour, which it replaced. Pillsbury and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of General Mills) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry. This leadership in milling later declined as milling was no longer dependent on water power, but the dominance of the mills contributed greatly to the economy of Minneapolis and Minnesota, attracting people and money to the region.

See options at the end Maria had a lot less friends than Tanya because Choose from: 1). Maria had always been a shy person.; 2). Tanya had always been a shy person.;","output":"Maria had a lot less friends than Tanya because Maria had always been a shy person. This trait is often characterized by a lack of self-confidence, feelings of inadequacy, and a general reluctance to engage in social situations. This distinction between the two girls wasn't a judgment on their qualities, abilities, or values but rather, a distinct difference in their social dispositions that played a significant role in how their lives played out, specifically in terms of forming friendships. Growing up, Maria's shyness manifested in various ways. She tended to avoid eye contact, struggled to voice her opinions or join in group discussions, and often found herself hesitating to participate in activities for fear of being judged or criticized. Additionally, her introverted nature made it challenging for her to navigate school functions, extracurricular activities, and other settings where making new friends was a common expectation. Consequently, others may have perceived Maria as distant or aloof, which further diminished her ability to connect with her peers and establish meaningful relationships. On the other hand, Tanya's personality and social skills enabled her to form multiple connections with ease. As an outgoing, friendly, and warm person, she naturally drew others towards her. She wasn't afraid of stepping out of her comfort zone, and her open, approachable demeanor made it easy for her peers to feel at ease around her. This magnetism translated into a larger circle of friends and acquaintances for Tanya, helping her foster relationships that could range from surface-level connections to deep, lasting friendships. Despite their different social experiences, it is essential to recognize that Maria's and Tanya's individual traits are not inherently superior or inferior in any way. Shyness, introversion, extroversion, boldness – all have their unique strengths and challenges. What's important is understanding and embracing those differences and learning how to navigate social situations to form meaningful connections. For Maria, taking small steps to build her self-confidence, enhance her communication skills, and push herself to explore new experiences could help her expand her social circle. In turn, Tanya could continue leveraging her outgoing personality to uplift others, offering her support and friendship to those who may feel less comfortable in social situations. Ultimately, Maria had a lot less friends than Tanya because Maria had always been a shy person, but every person has their own unique journey when it comes to building and maintaining friendships. Acknowledging these individual differences and working together to support one another's growth can lead to stronger, more diverse, and meaningful relationships."},{"instruction":"Build a movie plot around this: Who is a psychopathic killer? Cho Kyu-hwan","output":"Title: \\"Path of The Psychopath\\" Our movie begins in Seoul, South Korea. Cho Kyu-hwan, a humble, soft-spoken man of the city, leads a double life. He's revered as an outstanding psychiatrist by day, applying unprecedented intelligence and empathy. However, there's a sinister side to him that only emerges in the cloak of darkness; he's a psychopathic serial killer. He conducts his killings subtly, using his medical knowledge to derive pleasure from the pain of his victims; leaving them helpless, before killing them ceremoniously. Meanwhile, Detective Han, a brilliant and tenacious investigator, is trying to crack the case of mysterious deaths in the city. He realizes there's a connection between all the victims; they were all patients of Cho Kyu-hwan. Detective Han's tireless investigations reveal horrifying clues leading him straight to the timid psychiatrist. Simultaneously, Cho, aware of Detective Han's suspicions, initiates a game of cat and mouse, taunting Han without leaving any trace evidence to conclusively link him to the murders. Cho manipulates Han with psychological ploys he applies to his patients, causing Detective Han to question his own sanity. He creates a facade of being a victim, showcasing his innocence. As the game intensifies, Cho intensifies his killings. He leaves deceptive trails for the detective to follow, throwing him off the path repeatedly. However, when Cho makes a mistake by involving Han's sister in his malicious game, Han is filled with a rage and determination he's never known before. Soon, Detective Han discovers the horrifying truth behind Cho's calm demeanor, leading their cat and mouse game to a climatic duel. When the final confrontation arrives, Han must overcome his worst fears to stop a disaster that would undoubtedly claim more lives. In the end, Detective Han manages to outsmart and capture Cho, putting an end to his reign of horror.

Beehives -either recorded or real-may even prevent elephants from damaging farmer's crops. In 2002, scientist Lucy King and her team found that elephants avoid certain trees with bees living in them. Today, Lucy wants to see if African honeybees might discourage elephants from eating crops. But before she asked farmer to go to the trouble of setting up beehives on their farms, she needed to find out if the bees would scare elephants away. Lucy found a wild beehive inside a tree in northern Kenya and set up a recorder. Then she threw a stone into the beehive, which burst into life. Lucy and her assistant hid in their car until the angry bees had calmed down. Next,Lucy searched out elephant families in Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya and put a speaker in a close to each family. From a distance, Lucy switched on the pre-recorded sound of angry bees while at the same time recording the elephants with a video camera. Half the elephant groups left the area within ten seconds. Out of a total of 17 groups, only one group ignored the sound of the angry bees. Lucy reported that all the young elephants immediately ran to their mothers to hide under them. When Lucy Played the sound of a waterfall instead of the angry bees to many of the same elephant families, the animals were undisturbed. Even after four minutes, most of the groups stayed in one place. Lucy is now studying whether the elephants will continue to avoid the sound of angry bees after hearing it several times.

If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): how are the shopping center corridors treated","output":"The shopping center corridors within Hoog Catharijne are treated as public spaces, just like streets. This means they are accessible to all and have been designed not only for shopping purposes, but also to facilitate movement and gathering, just like a public street in a city. As such, these corridors are maintained by either the shopping center's ownership or its retailer tenants and would likely involve cleaning services, security measures, and other maintenance tasks to ensure the comfort, safety, and convenience of the shoppers and visitors. In terms of accessibility, these corridors are open 24 hours, serving as a public thoroughfare between Utrecht Centraal railway station and the city centre. This allows people to move between these locations at any time of day or night, providing a key convenience and accessibility feature for the residents, visitors, and workers in Utrecht. Maintaining these corridors as public spaces contributes not only to the day-to-day operations of Hoog Catharijne as a large indoor shopping center but also to the overall urban design and functionality of Utrecht as a city. They act as connectors between major parts of the city, integrating the shopping center with the surrounding urban fabric and enhancing the overall cohesion and movement within the city. Looking forward, with the 20-year renovation plan starting from 2004, parts of Hoog Catharijne will be redeveloped as part of the improvements to the larger station area, including the recreation of parts of the city's network of canals. These renovations and changes will likely play into how the shopping center corridors continue to function as public places and how they contribute to the overall character and dynamics of the city of Utrecht."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Man giving female a leg up onto tree.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A man is beneath a woman.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Hypothesis: Investors all need the same information. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that a benefit of better meeting diverse information needs of investors is in evaluating funds, which becomes harder as the number of funds increases. This implies that different investors may have various information needs when it comes to evaluating funds. The diverse information needs also suggest that each investor may have unique preferences and priorities when assessing fund performance, investment risks, and potential opportunities. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that \\"investors all need the same information,\\" which contradicts the premise. By suggesting that all investors have identical information needs, the hypothesis overlooks the fact that investors have different profiles, risk tolerance levels, and investment goals. These varying factors logically lead to diverse information requirements while evaluating funds. To gain a deeper understanding, let's examine the key differences between the premise and hypothesis in greater detail: 1. Diversity of information needs vs. uniform information needs: The premise emphasizes the requirement for diverse information to cater to the individual preferences of investors. This is based on the understanding that each investor may have specific details they value or require while making investment decisions. In contrast, the hypothesis assumes that all investors share identical information requirements, discarding the likelihood of any diversity in their preferences or decision-making criteria. 2. Challenges arising from an increasing number of funds: The premise acknowledges that as the number of funds grows, it becomes more challenging for investors to evaluate them properly based on their unique needs. The presence of a large number of funds also necessitates better-tailored information and greater customizability to cater to a vast range of investor preferences. However, the hypothesis contradicts this notion by asserting that all investors need the same information, regardless of the variety and complexity of the available funds. In conclusion, the premise and hypothesis represent opposing viewpoints, with the premise suggesting the significance of diverse information needs to cater to a variety of investors while the hypothesis argues that all investors require the same information. As such, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the two cannot be logically reconciled."},{"instruction":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Movie title: Haeckel's Tale Movie plot: Beginning[edit] The story, set in the late 19th century, begins with a young man named Edward Ralston (Steve Bacic), coming to an old woman, Miz Carnation, who lives in an old cabin deep in the woods of upstate New York. Ralston asks Miz Carnation, a necromancer, to revive his recently deceased wife; she refuses, but then decides to tell him the story of Ernst Haeckel, and says that, if he still wishes to revive his wife afterwards, she will do as he asks. Main story[edit] The story mainly concerns Ernst Haeckel (Derek Cecil), who is trying to follow in the footsteps of Victor Frankenstein, but is unsuccessful with his attempts to create life. He learns of Montesquino, a necromancer, but believes that the man is a charlatan. Learning of his father's ill condition, he travels and encounters Walter Wolfram (Tom McBeath) and his wife Elise (Leela Savasta). Haeckel is oddly drawn to Elise and vice versa. Wolfram seems undisturbed by the attraction but when unearthly shrieks echo outside, Elise is drawn to them. Haeckel also notices that Elise is caring for a baby. Elise finally goes outside and the despondent Wolfram notes that he can't satisfy his wife, although he has sold everything he has to take care of her. Haeckel goes after Elise and follows the shrieks to a nearby necropolis. There he discovers that Elise is having sexual consort with her dead husband and the other resurrected corpses. Wolfram has paid Montesquino to raise the dead so that they can satisfy Elise. When Wolfram tries to take her home, the corpses kill him. Haeckel confronts Montesquino and demands that he make it stop. The necromancer says that he cannot, and an angry Haeckel shoots him as he tries to escape. The dying Montesquino shoves Haeckel into a tombstone, knocking him out. The next morning, Haeckel wakes up and returns to the cabin, where he finds Elise nursing the baby: a corpse-child, the son of her \\"true\\" husband. The baby rips out Haeckel's throat.

A mantle plume is a column of hot rock that continuously brings hot rock up from the mantle toward the crust. It is a geologically active feature that can result in the formation of hotspot volcanoes and volcanic islands as the rocks reach the surface. The rising and spreading of the hot rock trigger melting of the mantle, which leads to the creation of magma. This magma can form into volcanic features on the Earth's surface, such as volcanic islands and seamounts.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step in the process of recycling aluminum begins with the collection and transportation of used aluminum materials to a central recycling facility. This can be carried out by a town or a private company that specializes in waste management and recycling services. Collection and transportation of aluminum waste involves several sub-steps, which include: 1. Setting up effective collection systems: To start with, a well-organized collection system needs to be established. This may include placing dedicated recycling bins for aluminum waste in residential areas, offices, schools, and other public spaces. These bins allow people to dispose of their aluminum waste, such as cans, foil, containers, or any other aluminum-based product, separately from other types of waste materials. 2. Educating the public: Raising awareness among the public about the importance of recycling aluminum and how to correctly dispose of it is crucial for the success of the recycling program. This can be done through various channels, such as social media campaigns, community outreach programs, and educational materials distributed to schools and businesses. 3. Scheduled waste collection: Once an effective collection system has been established, waste management teams or private companies in charge of gathering aluminum waste can set up regular pick-up schedules. This typically includes the use of specialized recycling trucks that travel to various neighborhoods and designated collection points to collect the aluminum waste that has been separated. 4. Consolidating and transporting aluminum waste: The collected aluminum waste is then taken to the central recycling facility. The waste may first be transported to a local consolidation center, where aluminum materials from many different collection points are gathered and sorted. Once this step is complete, the aluminum waste is then transported to the central recycling facility, often using large, specialized vehicles designed for carrying large volumes of waste materials. Once the aluminum waste has arrived at the central recycling facility, it can then be sorted, cleaned, and prepared to undergo further processing as outlined in the subsequent steps.

Soak the area in a bicarbonate solution. Take an oatmeal bath or make an oatmeal paste. Use aloe vera on the area. Use fresh mint. Article:","output":"Title: Soothing Remedies for Irritated Skin: From Cold Baths to Fresh Mint Introduction Irritated or inflamed skin is a common problem, and one most of us have experienced at some point in our lives. Skin irritation can be caused by various factors, including allergies, sunburn, insect bites, dryness, or exposure to harsh chemicals. Finding efficient and natural ways to soothe irritated skin is essential in order to provide immediate relief and promote the healing process. Here we discuss six effective remedies for irritated skin that will help you feel better in no time. 1. Take a Cold Shower or Bath A cold shower or bath is one of the quickest ways to provide relief to irritated skin. The cold water helps to constrict blood vessels, reducing inflammation and redness. It also has a numbing effect, which can provide temporary relief from itching or burning sensations. To maximize the benefits of a cold shower or bath, let the cold water flow over the affected area for at least 10 to 15 minutes. If you cannot handle the cold water for this long, try to alternate between cold and lukewarm showers to provide relief while minimizing discomfort. 2. Make a Cold Compress A cold compress is an excellent way to soothe irritated skin, especially on localized areas. To make a cold compress, wrap a few ice cubes or a bag of frozen vegetables in a clean towel, and apply it to the affected area for approximately 20 minutes. Be sure not to apply the ice directly to your skin, as this can cause further irritation and skin damage. Reapply the cold compress as necessary to maintain relief. 3. Soak the Area in a Bicarbonate Solution Baking soda, also known as bicarbonate of soda or sodium bicarbonate, is a common household item that can be used to soothe irritated skin. Make a solution by mixing one cup of baking soda with a few cups of water, and soak the affected area in this solution for approximately 15 minutes. Rinse gently with cool water afterward. The alkaline nature of baking soda helps to neutralize any acidity on the skin, providing relief from itchiness and inflammation. 4. Take an Oatmeal Bath or Make an Oatmeal Paste Oatmeal, especially the colloidal kind, is a time-tested remedy for irritated skin. It contains compounds known as avenanthramides, which help to reduce inflammation and soothe itchiness. To take an oatmeal bath, pour one to two cups of colloidal oatmeal into a bathtub filled with warm water, and soak for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Alternatively, you can make an oatmeal paste by mixing colloidal oatmeal with water until a smooth consistency is achieved. Apply the paste to the affected areas and let it dry for 15 minutes before rinsing gently with cool water. 5. Use Aloe Vera on the Area Aloe vera is well-known for its soothing, cooling, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is an excellent solution for treating irritated skin, including sunburnt skin. Using pure aloe vera gel or juice extracted from an aloe vera plant, apply a thin layer to the affected area, and let it air-dry. Reapply as needed to maintain relief. Keep in mind that some store-bought aloe vera products may contain alcohol or other additives, which can make irritation worse, so be sure to choose a pure aloe vera product or use the plant directly. 6. Use Fresh Mint Mint is a natural cooling agent, thanks to its high content of menthol. If you have access to fresh mint leaves, you can crush them and apply them to the irritated skin. The menthol in mint leaves will help to numb the pain and reduce inflammation, providing relief from itching and burning. Alternatively, you can steep mint leaves in boiling water for a few minutes, strain the liquid, and use a cotton ball to apply the mint-infused water to the irritated area. This can also be placed in the refrigerator for a few minutes for an extra cooling effect. Conclusion Irritated skin can be uncomfortable and bothersome, but with these six effective, natural remedies, you can find relief quickly and easily. Always remember to test each remedy on a small patch of skin first, to ensure you don't have an adverse reaction. If your skin irritation persists or worsens, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for further advice and treatment."},{"instruction":"On 28 May 1975 James Whetter left MK to form the Cornish Nationalist Party which was campaigning for full Cornish independence. The party declined in the 1980s and was close to collapse by 1990. It did not contest the 1984 European Parliament election; it received 1.9% of the vote in Cornwall and West Plymouth in the 1989 election. During this period, the party focussed on its opposition to the creation of a South West England region. It also campaigned against the construction of a nuclear station at Luxulyan and proposals to increase house-building in Cornwall. In 1988, MK established the Campaign for a Cornish Constituency, which won the support of Cornwall County Council, all the district authorities, several Cornish organisations and three of Cornwall's five MPs. The campaign was well-publicised, attained national attention, and collected over 3,000 signatures in three months. Loveday Jenkin was elected its leader in 1990. The party's vote share declined further to 1.5% of the vote in the 1994 European Parliament election, in the new constituency of Cornwall and West Plymouth. In 1996, MK published 'Cornwall 2000 - The Way Ahead', its most detailed manifesto to date.

His NHL career began in 1987. McGeough was one of the last NHL officials to officiate NHL games without wearing a helmet when he was on the ice. In the 200607 NHL season, McGeough was forced by the NHL to wear a helmet on ice, as it was the first season that dictated that all on-ice officials had to do so. He now is helping the NHL bring up new recruits from the AHL. Entering the 200708 NHL season, McGeough had officiated 1,023 regular season and 63 post season games. - James McGeough ( born April 13 , 1963 in Regina , Saskatchewan ) is a retired Canadian ice hockey player . He is the brother of former NHL referee Mick McGeough . Drafted in 1981 by the Washington Capitals , McGeough also played for the Pittsburgh Penguins . - The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - Regina (is the capital city of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The city is the second-largest in the province, after Saskatoon, and a cultural and commercial centre for southern Saskatchewan. It is governed by Regina City Council. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No. 159. - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.

Article: Should we be afraid of sharks ? Maybe not. New research into the reasons for shark attacks suggests that sharks don't like the way humans taste! In fact, most people who are attacked by the shark are still alive after receiving only one bite . Why is this? There are many opinions to explain why sharks sometimes attack people. One opinion is that sharks are just curious . We know that sharks are the strongest animals in their environment, so they are not afraid of anything. Naturally, that means they are curious when they meet something unusual. Because they don't have hands or feet., the only way they can find out an object is to bite it! It is thought that sharks sometimes bite humans for this reason, and then swim away. Scientists also say that sharks would not waste energy trying to eat a human, as we have a lot of bones . It is hard for a shark to eat us because sharks don't have hands, and they can't pull the meat off our bones. Maybe that's why they only bite us once. Unluckily, one bite from a large shark is serious enough to hurt people greatly! Another opinion is that sharks attack humans by mistake. Some sharks may sometimes mistake humans for a seal. An example of this is when a shark attacks a surfer. A surfer lying on a surfboard looks like a seal when seen from below. Sharks like seals because they have thick fat. Whatever the reason for shark attacks on humans, sharks should be afraid of us. Sadly, we kill almost 40 million of them each year.

Young was there with the Squires, a Winnipeg group he had been leading since February 1963, and Stills was on tour with The Company, a spin-off from the Au Go Go Singers. When Stills' band broke up at the end of that tour, he moved to the West Coast, where he worked as a session musician and auditioned unsuccessfully for, among other bands, the Monkees. Told by record producer Barry Friedman there would be work available if he could assemble a band, Stills invited fellow Au Go Go Singers alumnus Richie Furay and former Squires bass player Ken Koblun to come join him in California. Both agreed, although Koblun chose to leave before very long and joined the group 3's a Crowd. In early 1966 in Toronto, Young met Bruce Palmer, a Canadian who was playing bass for a group called the Mynah Birds. In need of a lead guitarist, Palmer invited Young to join the group, and Young accepted. The Mynah Birds were set to record an album for Motown Records when their singer Ricky James Matthews--James Ambrose Johnson, Jr., later known as Rick James--was tracked down and arrested by the U.S. Navy for being AWOL.

Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The badly burned former nanny of two of Moammar Gadhafi's grandchildren was receiving medical treatment Tuesday in the burn unit of a Tripoli hospital. Shwygar Mullah says the wife of Gadhafi's son Hannibal poured boiling water on her for failing to keep a child quiet. She is being treated with antibiotics for an infection. Her burns are dressed. CNN first met Mullah on Sunday while visiting the luxurious former home of Hannibal Gadhafi. As a CNN crew was about to leave, one of the staff members mentioned a nanny who worked for Hannibal Gadhafi. He said that Hannibal's wife, Aline, had burned the nanny. In soft tones, she said","output":"that the incident occurred several months ago when Aline Skaf, Hannibal Gadhafi's wife, had become increasingly irritable and impatient due to the unrest in the nation, as well as the mounting pressure on the Gadhafi family. She recalled that on that fateful day, the young child under Mullah's care had been persistently crying, causing Skaf's anger to erupt, leading her to pour boiling water onto Mullah as punishment for her perceived inadequacy in calming the child. As the boiling water seared her skin, Mullah fell to the floor in excruciating pain, her screams echoing through the luxurious home. However, she was offered no immediate medical assistance, which allowed the burns to worsen and ultimately became infected. Mullah went on to explain that throughout her time working for the Gadhafi family, there had been several instances of physical and verbal abuse directed towards her and other members of the household staff. She hesitated to report these incidents to the authorities, fearing repercussions for both herself and her family that could potentially harm them further. It was only when the CNN crew unintentionally stumbled upon her in the course of their visit that the extent of Mullah's injuries and suffering were brought to public attention. As her story began to spread, there was an outpouring of support and offers of assistance from individuals and organizations committed to ensuring her well-being and a swift recovery. The medical staff at the Tripoli hospital where Mullah was being treated worked tirelessly to stabilize her condition, and eventually, she began to show signs of improvement. The dedicated, round-the-clock care provided to Mullah exemplified the compassion and professionalism of the hospital staff, as they not only treated her physical wounds but also provided her with the emotional support she so desperately needed. While there is still a long road to a full recovery ahead for Mullah, her case has shed light on the broader issues of human rights abuses and the treatment of domestic workers, both in Libya and around the world, prompting public discussions, investigations, and renewed calls for action to address these concerns. As Mullah's health continues to improve and her future prospects grow brighter, her story remains a harrowing reminder of the tragic and inhumane consequences that can arise when power and privilege become a breeding ground for violence, oppression, and the disregard for the dignity and humanity of others. Ultimately, Mullah's ordeal has become a symbol of resilience, inspiring hope and a renewed determination among people everywhere to continue fighting for a world where all individuals can live free from fear, abuse, and persecution."},{"instruction":"Student: Given the sentence \\"A child at the top of a fake rock wall.\\" can we conclude that \\"The child is doing a math test.\\"?

Night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected. Infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space, such as molecular clouds; detect objects such as planets, and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe. Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, and to detect overheating of electrical apparatus. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What technology allows infrared thermal imaging cameras to observe people or animals without being detected?","output":"Infrared thermal imaging cameras are able to observe people or animals without being detected due to a combination of specialized sensor technology and passive detection. To understand this technology, we must first break down the workings of an infrared thermal imaging camera and discuss how these components contribute to stealthy observation. 1. Infrared Spectrum: Infrared radiation falls within the range of the electromagnetic spectrum between visible light and microwaves. This portion of the spectrum is invisible to the human eye, meaning that when infrared cameras detect and capture this radiation, they do so without emitting visible light. This makes the cameras difficult to detect from the subject’s point of view. 2. Passive Detection: Infrared thermal imaging cameras use passive detection systems, meaning they only receive incoming radiation without sending out any radiation of their own. This is unlike active near-infrared systems used in night-vision devices, which emit IR radiation (usually invisible to humans) to bounce off objects and return to the sensor. Because thermal imaging cameras do not emit any radiation while detecting infrared, they remain covert during operation. 3. Specialized Sensors: These cameras are equipped with sensitive detectors called microbolometers or cooled infrared detectors that can capture even the slightest variations in infrared radiation emitted by warm bodies, such as animals or humans. These sensors are capable of detecting temperature differences as small as 0.1°C, allowing them to create a detailed thermal image. 4. Processing and Display: Once infrared radiation has been detected by the camera's sensors, the information is processed and displayed as a thermal image. This typically uses a color palette to represent different temperatures: warmer objects appearing in shades of red, orange, or yellow, and cooler objects in blue or purple. This allows the user to easily identify the presence of people or animals based on their body heat. 5. Atmospheric Effects: Infrared thermal imaging cameras often employ advanced algorithms and filters to compensate for the effects of the atmosphere on the captured radiation. This helps improve image clarity and accuracy despite factors such as distance, humidity, or airborne particles that may interfere with the radiation reaching the sensor. To sum up, infrared thermal imaging cameras’ ability to observe people or animals without being detected is a result of the combination of infrared spectrum usage, passive detection, specialized sensor technology, and advanced processing methods. These elements come together to create a precise and covert thermal imaging system ideal for applications where stealth is a priority."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area.

Leaving it in the garbage until then can generate smells, attract animals, and breed flies. Ideally it should be made of glass, such as a pickle or spaghetti sauce jar, with a tight-fitting lid. Plastic jars can also be used, but may leak some odor. Sealable metal cans, such as coffee cans, can be used, but may create a rust ring if left in sink. Cardboard containers, like the cylinders oatmeal comes in, should be avoided. They may leak when they get wet from decomposing food. Ideally the jar should be small enough for a single use. Don't reopen it later, as this will let odor and potentially flies or fruit flies out, unless it has been kept frozen. (It's also possible to dump the contents in the garbage and then rinse and reuse the slop jar, but this is messy, and should be done outside.) This will halt the decomposition process and kill any insects or larva. This method can either be used in conjunction with a slop jar, or else large items, like a watermelon rind, can be placed in the freezer whole. However, it's easy to forget these items on garbage day, so a Post-it note on the trash can is a good reminder. Summary:","output":"Disposing of food waste can be challenging when garbage collection is not frequent, as it can cause unpleasant odors, attract animals, and breed flies. To manage food waste, using a slop jar made of glass with a tight-fitting lid is ideal, as it prevents odors and pests. Plastic jars and sealable metal cans can be used, but they have their drawbacks, such as leaking odors or causing rust rings. Cardboard containers should be avoided as they can leak when wet. Slop jars should be small and used only once before disposal to prevent releasing odors and pests when reopened. An alternative method is freezing food waste, which halts decomposition and kills insects, either in a slop jar or by freezing large items.

A few hours later, I received a call from Rex stating that he was finishing up a job not too far away and that he could be at my house in 45 minutes if that was okay with me. I knew that I would be home so agreed to the appointment. Rex showed up on time and was extremely friendly. He thoroughly explained what he was going to do, answered all of my questions, and was very friendly and professional during the whole visit. In my opinion Rex is a true professional and reflects well on the company he is representing.

These phrases involve short events and might include generic participant names such as PersonX, PersonY, or PersonZ. You need to determine if the Head is a part, portion, or makeup of the Tail. To complete this task, follow these simple steps: 1. Read and understand the given phrases (Head and Tail). 2. Think about their meanings and their relationship to each other. 3. Decide whether the Head can be considered as a part, portion, or makeup of the Tail. 4. If it is, classify your answer as \\"Yes\\"; otherwise, classify it as \\"No\\". For example: Head: telescope<sep>Tail: prism Step 1: Read the phrases. Head: telescope Tail: prism Step 2: Analyze the meanings and their relationship. Telescope is an instrument used for observing distant objects. Prism is a transparent object usually made of glass, used for splitting light into its component colors or for reflecting rays of light. Step 3: Decide if the Head is a part, portion, or makeup of the Tail. In this case, a telescope is not a part, portion, or makeup of a prism. Step 4: Classify your answer as \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\".

Rat Terriers have been around since the early 1800s, when they were developed in England as one of dozens of terrier breeds created to exterminate rats that carried disease and raided food supplies in town and country. Originally called “Feists” as a testament to their feisty temperament, these proto–Rat Terriers were prodigious ratters. They were employed on farms (where one ferocious barnyard Feist was said to have dispatched 2,500 rats on a single day) and in the infamous rat pits, where spectators bet on the number of rats that their favorite terrier could kill. In the late 1800s, Feists were brought to rural America by British miners who sought a new life. It was here that the Feist was stabilized as a breed with crosses to the Smooth Fox Terrier. It is said that President Theodore Roosevelt, who adored his Feist named Skip, coined the name Rat Terrier. Fast-forward some 70 years, from Roosevelt’s time to 1972. It was then, in Trout, Louisiana, that a strange thing happened: A hairless was born into a litter of midsize Rat Terriers of normally coated parents. (This is a good place to note that the hairless pups are born with a birth coat that falls out when they are several weeks old.) A couple named Edwin and Willie Scott acquired the hairless and named her Josephine. She was bred and produced Gypsy, a hairless female. Eight years later, after producing several litters of coated pups, Josephine gave birth to a pair of hairless siblings, Jemima and Snoopy. In 1983, Snoopy was bred to his sisters and sired several hairless offspring. A new breed, the American Rat Terrier, was born. The Scotts continued their breeding program, kept careful records, and founded the first club devoted to their new breed. The breed’s AKC parent club, the American Hairless Terrier Club of America, was established in 2009; the breed gained full AKC recognition in 2016. ||||| The Sloughi has been assigned the Hound Group designation. They first entered FSS in 1997. Share The Sloughi is one of two African Sighthound breeds recognized by FCI. Whereas the Sloughi originates from North Africa, the Azawakh is to be found in Central Africa (Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali). The Sloughi is also known as the Arabian Greyhound. Share The Sloughi exists in coat of many colors. The most common are the sand black mask, and the sand brindle. But Sloughis can also be found in all shades of Sand, with or without Black Masking, Brindling or Mantling. Share The Sloughi breed in Europe and the USA are from dogs imported directly from Tunisia, Libya, morocco and Algeria. Share December 2003 - the board approved the eligibility of some foundation stock breeds (including the Sloughi), which meet certain criteria, for competition in AKC Companion Events (obedience, tracking, and agility), effective January 1, 2004. Share Training & temperament because of its long history as a coursing and guard breed of nomads, the Sloughi is skeptical about strangers and is aloof. Sloughi puppies require socialization, such as puppy classes and exposure to many new people and situations in order to become properly adjusted adults. Being a sensitive sighthound, the Sloughi requires training methods that are based in the principles of positive reinforcement. Harsh or punitive methods will not be successful with the Sloughi. Share The Sloughi was originally bred by the Berbers and the Bedouins in North Africa, the Azawakh by the Touareg (a Berber tribe) in Central Africa and the Saluki by the Bedouin in the Middle East. Share From the May 2011 board meeting the American Sloughi Association will serve as the AKC parent club to represent the Sloughi. Share Although Sloughis are sighthounds which chase their prey on sight, they are also excellent trackers who can flush out game by scent before the final chase. Share From the August 2006 board meeting - the Sloughi will be eligible to compete in lure coursing events, effective October 1, 2006.

The American Kennel Club describes the event as an \\"opportunity to meet and play with hundreds of adorable dogs and fabulous felines while learning about responsible pet ownership.\\" The cats have been part of a separate event previously, but now will share the showcase with the dogs, Westminster Kennel Club director of communications Gail Miller Bisher tells All Things Considered.

The exhibition also includes some fancy footwork from the felines. As Bisher tells All Things Considered, \\"They will be putting on a cat agility demonstration where the cats are being led through an obstacle course of sorts.\\" One of the participants is a particularly striking Bengal cat, who has the memorable name of Jungletrax Abiding Ovation. \\"There's so much love out there in the world, why just limit it to dogs and puppies?\\" Anthony Hutcherson, the owner and breeder of Jungletrax, said at a recent press conference, according to AM New York. \\"She's the love of my life.\\" The news has garnered some strong reactions on Twitter: internet: the westminster kennel club dog show will feature cats me: pic.twitter.com/HLmBoFFCDL — Alex Lawson (@AlexxLawson) January 31, 2017 Cats at the Westminster Dog Show?!

This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL: and the situation: An inventor named Nelly is tinkering around in her home office where she has created two new types of material that could be used in products. The first one she is calling Glubber, and the second she has named Malk. To try to figure out what type of products these new materials may be used for, Nelly is performing various tests. The first test she is doing is securing one end of the material to a table and then pulling on it and letting it go. When she performs this test on some Glubber, the material quickly snaps back toward the table. Performing the same process with some Malk, the material slowly crawls along the floor as it makes its way back to the table. Answer the following question: Which material is less resistant to changing shape? The answer to this question is:","output":"Malk is less resistant to changing shape. In the given situation, Nelly tests the two materials, Glubber and Malk, by securing one end to a table and pulling on the other end before letting it go. When she performs this test on Glubber, it quickly snaps back to its original shape, indicating a strong elastic force. This suggests that Glubber is highly resistant to changing shape due to its elasticity. On the other hand, when Nelly performs the same test on Malk, the material slowly crawls back to its original shape. This slow return to its original form implies weaker elastic force and a lower resistance to changing shape compared to Glubber. Therefore, Malk is less resistant to changing shape than Glubber."},{"instruction":"Which movie is the following review about? a very good movie with great acting, but it needed a bit of pizzazz to make it a movie you can't miss.","output":"With just the information in the review, it is impossible to identify the exact movie being discussed.

He twice served in the United States Senate, representing Minnesota from 1949 to 1964 and 1971 to 1978. He was the Democratic Party's nominee in the 1968 presidential election, losing to Republican nominee Richard Nixon. Humphrey and his running mate, Ed Muskie, who had not entered any of the 13 state primary elections, went on to win the Democratic nomination at the party convention in Chicago, Illinois even though 80 percent of the primary voters had been for anti-war candidates, the delegates had defeated the peace plank by 1,567 3/4 to 1,041 1/4 . Unfortunately for Humphrey and his campaign, in Grant Park, just five miles south of International Amphitheater convention hall (closed 1999), and at other sites near downtown Chicago, there were gatherings and protests by the thousands of antiwar demonstrators, many of whom favored McCarthy, George McGovern, or other \\"anti-war\\" candidates. These protesters - most of them young college students - were attacked and beaten on live television by Chicago police, actions which merely amplified the growing feelings of unrest in the general public. Humphrey's inaction during these activities along with President Johnson and Chicago Mayor Richard Daley's behind the scenes convention influencing, public backlash from securing the presidential nomination without entering a single primary, as well as Humphrey refusal to meet McCarthy half way on his demands, resulting in McCarthy's lack of full endorsement of Humphrey, highlighted turmoil in the Democratic party's base that proved to be too much for Humphrey to overcome in time for the general election. The combination of the unpopularity of Johnson, the Chicago demonstrations, and the discouragement of liberals and African-Americans when both Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated during the election year, were all contributing factors that caused him to eventually lose the election to former Vice President Nixon. Although he lost the election by less than 1% of the popular vote, 43.4% for Nixon (31,783,783 votes) to 42.7% (31,271,839 votes) for Humphrey, with 13.5% (9,901,118 votes) for George Wallace, Humphrey carried just 13 states with 191 electoral college votes.

He said: “It is impossible to put an accurate estimate on this unique piece of history. “It is probably the first time that such a personal piece of Churchill’s history has been offered on the open market. This year marks the 50-year anniversary of Churchill’s death. The blood is a poignant reminder of an injury which marked the beginning of the end for Churchill and, as such, we expect there to be great interest in it. It could sell for thousands.” The blood will be sold together with a signed declaration by Fitzgibbon detailing the circumstances in which she acquired the phial. In 2010 she recalled that, despite the severity of his injury, Churchill remained steadfast throughout his stay. She said: “I remember that he would never settle at night until after he had read the first edition of all the daily newspapers, which he had specially delivered. He habitually smoked cigars in bed … [and] regularly mixed the first and second courses of his meal into one bowl before eating it.” The auction will take place at Duke’s of Dorchester in Dorset on 12 March. ||||| A few drops of blood taken from Sir Winston Churchill as he recovered with a broken hip are going under the hammer. The sample was collected in 1962 when the ‘blood, toil, tears and sweat’ orator was at The Middlesex Hospital being treated for a fractured hip. Student nurse Patricia Fitzgibbon asked if she could keep the small glass tube that was labelled ‘Sir Winston S Churchill WWB9’, and her request was granted. Following her death it is now being put up for sale at Duke’s of Dorchester in Dorset on March 12. In 1962, Churchill, aged 87, was on holiday in Monte Carlo when he reportedly fell out of his bed, fracturing his hip. He was flown back to London in an RAF VC10 jet at the request of the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. He spent several weeks recovering in the Woolavington Wing for private patients at the hospita, when the phial of blood was taken. His recovery was slow as he contracted bronchitis and pneumonia which in turn led to thrombosis. It was widely anticipated that he would not survive the ordeal at his advanced age. The blood was about to be thrown away when nurse Fitzgibbon was given permission to keep the 7cm-long tube. In 2010 she remembered how, despite the severity of his injury, Churchill remained steadfast throughout his stay. She said: “While the ward sister generally kept nurses out of his room, I did have occasional duties to carry out. “I remember that he would never settle at night until after he had read the first edition of all the daily newspapers which he had specially delivered. \\"He habitually smoked cigars in bed … [and] regularly mixed the first and second courses of his meal into one bowl before eating it!” The blood – taken three years before Churchill’s death – is going under the hammer with an estimate of £300-600. Timothy Medhurst from Duke’s said: “It is impossible to put an accurate estimate on this unique piece of history. “There are just a couple of drops in the phial that is clearly labelled. “At the time this blood was taken Churchill had already experienced a catalogue of injuries. “So to have another devastating injury occur at such an old age was a threat to his stalwart ‘British Bulldog’ image. “Though Churchill largely relied on his walking stick by the time this broken hip occurred, the operation to fix the fracture would have a caused a shortening in his leg and photographs following 1962 always show Churchill leaning on his iconic walking stick. “This injury was also at a poignant moment in Churchill’s personal life – his beloved poodle Rufus II died whilst he was in hospital recovering. “The blood will be sold together with a signed declaration by Patricia Fitzgibbon detailing the circumstances in which she acquired the phial. “It is probably the first time that such a personal piece of Churchill’s history has been offered on the open market. “This year marks the 50th anniversary of Churchill’s death. The blood is a poignant reminder of an injury which marked the beginning of the end for Churchill and as such, we expect there to be great interest in it. It could sell for thousands.” On May 10, 1940, Churchill became Prime Minister and when he met his Cabinet on May 13 he told them: “I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.” He repeated that phrase later in the day when he asked the House of Commons for a vote of confidence in his new all-party government that would stand up to the Nazi aggressors. Also in the sale are a set of Churchill’s ‘The Second World War’ books, which he has inscribed as a gift for Mabel Johnson, who worked with Lady Spencer Churchill during the war. These have an estimate of £4,000-8,000.

In the 18th century, the course in North Yorkshire became one of the biggest and most celebrated attractions in the racing calendar with a prize of 100 guineas or more. This large ‘double gilt’ cup was – by tradition – paid for by general subscription and the worthy gentleman of the town with the silversmith being ordered to ‘make the best cup he can for 100 guineas’. The cup would generally weigh one hundred ounces or more. Subsequent cups were based on Adam’s original design and in the hands of the most eminent silversmiths, they evolved over the decades. This example is engraved on the rim ‘Richmond 1802’ and also engraved with the names of the stewards, Charles Brandling and Timothy Hutton. In addition, it is engraved ‘MAKEPEACE, FECIT’ on the rim of the lid. This fine and historic trophy comes with its original transit case and retains the retailers label for ‘Robt Makepeace, Goldsmith and Jeweller, Serle Street, Lincolns Inn Fields’.

Is it true that mental math can exercise your brain and make you smarter in general? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choices: [i] no; [ii] yes;","output":"[i] no; While both questions are related to the concept of improving intelligence, they are not paraphrases of each other. The first question inquires about the relationship between exercising (presumably physical exercise) and intelligence, while the second question focuses on mental math as a means to exercise the brain and improve general intelligence. To address the first question, numerous scientific studies have shown that engaging in regular physical exercise can have a positive impact on cognitive function and overall intelligence. Some of the benefits of exercise are more immediate, such as improvements in memory, attention, and problem-solving skills, while others develop over time, such as increased neural connections and enhanced neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to form and reorganize synaptic connections). Physical exercise has been shown to increase the production of hormones such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays a critical role in the growth, maintenance, and survival of neurons. Additionally, exercise improves blood flow and oxygenation to the brain, contributing to better cognitive function. Furthermore, exercising also helps reduce stress and anxiety levels, which may lead to improved mental clarity and focus. Overall, a consistent exercise routine can positively influence brain health and cognitive abilities, thereby making a person \\"smarter\\" to some extent. Regarding the second question, mental math can indeed help exercise the brain and improve cognitive skills. Mental math challenges the brain to make calculations and solve problems in one's head, without external tools such as paper or calculators. This process requires the brain to engage in various cognitive functions, such as working memory, attention, and concentration. Practicing mental math can improve one's numerical abilities, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Moreover, engaging in consistent mental math exercises can support the development of memory, attention, and reasoning abilities, leading to an overall improvement in general intelligence. However, it is important to note that mental math is just one aspect of cognitive training. Balance and variety in cognitive exercises help ensure overall mental development. As such, engaging in a range of brain activities, including the arts, puzzles, reading, and learning new skills, can contribute to a more well-rounded improvement in general intelligence. In conclusion, while both physical exercise and mental math can have positive effects on cognitive function and general intelligence, these two questions focus on different aspects of intelligence improvement and are not simply paraphrases of each other."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Atlantic City International Airport, location, Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey.

The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation. But I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

The phrase \\"only worships God\\" signifies that the people of Libya are devoted to their faith and would not indulge in worshipping other deities or symbolic figures. This unwavering loyalty to their religion can be seen as an essential aspect of the Libyan national identity, as well as an important guiding force within their society. The phrase \\"fears only God\\" further emphasizes the importance of religious faith in Libyan culture. In this context, fear should be interpreted as a form of respect or awe, rather than a negative, paralyzing emotion. It means that the people hold God in such high regard that they consider Him as the ultimate authority in their lives and the only being truly worthy of their fear or veneration. By extension, the statement also implies that the people of Libya are not easily intimidated by external forces and threats – because their devotion is to a higher power, they may remain true to their core values even in the face of adversity.

Answer: Communities were established in Germany and England in the 11th and 12th centuries, but Spanish Jews, long settled in Spain under the Muslims, came under Christian rule and increasing pressure to convert to Christianity. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Yes, the question is partially answered, but more details can be added to provide a comprehensive understanding of the development of the Jewish community in England. Here's an improved version of the answer: The history of the Jewish community in England can be traced back to the Norman Conquest in the 11th century. Jewish communities began to develop in England during two primary periods: the medieval period (11th-13th centuries) and the early modern period (17th century onwards). 1. The Medieval Period (11th-13th centuries): Jewish immigration to England started after the Norman Conquest of 1066. During the late 11th century, Jews from northern France, Flanders, and Germany began to settle in England. This immigration wave can be attributed to the invitation of William the Conqueror, who aimed to establish a stable community of merchants and financiers capable of providing loans to the English crown. The medieval Jewish community reached its peak during the 12th and 13th centuries, with significant communities in a number of English towns such as London, Lincoln, Oxford, Norwich, and Winchester. The Jewish community during this period played a crucial role in the development of national and international trade and banking. However, the situation took a turn for the worse in the late 13th century. Negative public sentiment and religious tensions led to violence against and persecution of the Jewish community. In 1290, under the Edict of Expulsion decreed by King Edward I, the Jews were expelled from England. 2. The Early Modern Period (17th century onwards): Following the expulsion in 1290, there was no legitimate Jewish community in England for nearly four centuries. The period of Jewish resettlement in England began in the 17th century, particularly after the readmission of Jews in 1656 under Oliver Cromwell. Sephardic Jews, who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal in the late 15th century, began to establish communities in London. Gradually, Ashkenazi Jews from Central and Eastern Europe also made their way to England. Notably, the Sephardic Bevis Marks Synagogue in London—established in 1701—marks a significant point in the early modern history of the Jewish community in England. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Jewish population in England steadily increased, and communities were established in larger cities such as Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, and Leeds. Jews began to make significant contributions to the British society in various fields such as business, arts, science, and politics. In the 20th century, Jewish emigration from Eastern Europe and Germany—particularly in response to the Holocaust—led to a further influx of Jewish families in England. Today, the Jewish community in England remains an integral part of the nation's vibrant cultural landscape. In summary, the development of the Jewish community in England spanned primarily over the medieval period (11th-13th centuries) and the early modern period (17th century onwards). Over the centuries, the Jewish community has been influential in shaping England's cultural, economic, and social development."},{"instruction":"P.S. my tummy hurts so baddd I want a massive cuddle.

Identifying the key elements of the tweet: In this tweet, the user mentions that they have a stomach ache and expresses a strong desire for a massive cuddle. 2. Analyzing the emotions conveyed: The tweet conveys feelings of discomfort and distress primarily due to the stomach ache the user is experiencing. The use of the word \\"baddd\\" with multiple \\"d's\\" emphasizes the intensity of the discomfort they are feeling. 3. Understanding the context of the desire for cuddling: The desire for a massive cuddle is an expression of the user's need for comfort and emotional support during their time of physical discomfort. Cuddling can make people feel better, as it releases oxytocin, a hormone that is associated with bonding and soothing sensations. 4. Interpreting the overall sentiment: The sentiment expressed in this tweet is a mixture of negative emotions (due to the stomach ache) and a strong need for comfort and support (desire for a massive cuddle). This is likely a plea for empathetic understanding and physical reassurance from the people in the user's life or their social media audience. 5.

Options: - person - bloodbank - vein - capillaries - hospital Reasoning process:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze each option and use reasoning to determine which one has blood and parents. 1. Person: A person is a human being, and as such, they have a circulatory system that contains blood. Moreover, every person has biological parents since they are conceived through the union of a sperm and an egg from their respective mother and father. Therefore, a person does have blood and parents. 2. Blood bank: A blood bank is a facility or institution that stores and provides blood for medical use, typically for transfusion purposes. While a blood bank does contain blood, it is an organization or establishment and does not have parents or lineage. 3. Vein: A vein is a type of blood vessel that carries blood towards the heart. Veins are part of the circulatory system in living organisms, including humans. While they contain and transport blood, they are a part of an organism's anatomy and do not have parents themselves. 4. Capillaries: Capillaries are the smallest and most numerous blood vessels that connect arteries and veins. They play a crucial role in exchanging nutrients, oxygen, and waste between blood and body tissues. Like veins, capillaries contain blood but do not have parents since they are part of an organism's anatomy. 5. Hospital: A hospital is a healthcare institution designed to provide medical care and treatment for various diseases, injuries, and other health issues. Hospitals do contain blood for medical use (often obtained from blood banks) and might be the location where people are born, but they do not have parents because they are merely a building or institution. Based on this reasoning process, the most suitable answer is \\"person\\" since a person has blood (through their circulatory system) and has parents (biological mother and father)."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Richard for the following movie plot: Leah (Kellner) is a translator who is traveling international cities in search of romance and closure with her estranged boyfriend Jeff.

Hypothesis: Buying a 3'x2'x4' cage for a an eclectus habitat is always possible.","output":"The hypothesis states that buying a 3'x2'x4' cage for an eclectus habitat is always possible. While the original paragraph suggests this size as the minimum requirement for an eclectus parrot, the hypothesis, however, cannot be regarded as universally true. There are several factors that can influence the feasibility of purchasing such a cage. Here, we will analyze various situations that would impact the validity of this hypothesis. 1. Availability: The availability of a 3'x2'x4' cage depends on multiple factors, such as the region, local market trends, and demand for such cages. It may not always be possible to find an appropriate cage with these exact dimensions in every location or market. If the demand for such cages is low or if they are not typically stocked by local suppliers due to regional preferences, purchasing that specific cage size might be difficult. 2. Financial constraints: Depending on individual financial situations, obtaining a 3'x2'x4' cage may not always be feasible. The cost of such a cage can vary based on different factors, like the material, craftsmanship, brand, and location. For people with limited budgets or living in areas with high cage prices, buying this size of the cage may not be possible, prompting them to opt for alternative solutions. 3. Space limitations: The physical space available for an eclectus habitat can also impact the feasibility of buying a 3'x2'x4' cage. If a person has limited space in their home or apartment, they may not be able to accommodate a cage of this size, and therefore, will have to look for alternative housing options for their eclectus parrot that can better fit into their living situation. 4. Customization: In some cases, an eclectus owner may prefer or require a customized habitat rather than a standard cage available in the market. Depending on specific needs, like the addition of specific accessories or introducing multiple birds into the habitat, the size of the cage could change, making the 3'x2'x4' dimensions not suitable anymore. 5. Legal regulations: In certain regions, there may be legal requirements and restrictions regarding pet ownership, which could affect the feasibility of buying a 3'x2'x4' cage. For instance, if local laws stipulate that an eclectus habitat must have specific dimensions that deviate from the 3'x2'x4' size, it would impact the hypothesis's validity. In conclusion, although the paragraph suggests a 3'x2'x4' cage as a minimum size for providing an adequate eclectus habitat, asserting that it is always possible to buy such a cage is not accurate. Availability, financial constraints, space limitations, customization, and legal regulations should be taken into account when evaluating the feasibility of purchasing a 3'x2'x4' cage for an eclectus parrot."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the character who plans to take Stanton to Mexico? from the following article ?

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first.

Therefore, out of the given options, the most fitting choice according to the context would be: B: Pay Austin This answer is suitable, as it suggests Jordan acknowledging Austin's life-saving assistance and expressing thanks by offering some form of compensation. However, it is essential to consider that the specific way in which Jordan chooses to express gratitude can vary significantly. This could involve monetary compensation, or it could take the form of services, gifts, or other genuine acts of appreciation. Option A – \\"Go to a doctor\\" – would indeed be a reasonable action for Jordan to take after the car accident.

Article: Today, home-ownership has reached extremely high levels. Modern generations tend to believe there is something wrong with them if they rent. However, is high home-ownership really as rosy as people imagine? Staring at data first, we realize that the most successful, stable, attractive country in the Western world is Switzerland. It has tiny unemployment; wealth; high happiness and mental-health scores. Does it have high home-ownership rates? Absolutely not. In Switzerland, about seven in ten of the population are renters. Yet, with Europe's lowest home-ownership rate, the nation thrives. Now go to the other end of the misery distribution. Spain has approximately the highest home-ownership rate in Europe (at more than 80%). But one-quarter of its population are unemployed. A likely reason is that high levels of home-ownership mess up the labour market. In a sensibly functioning economy it is easy for people to move around to drop into the vibrant job slots thrown up by technological change. With a high degree of owner-occupation, everything slows. Folk get stuck. Renters can go to new jobs. In that way they do the economy a favour. As Friedman said, the rate of unemployment depends on the flexibility of the housing market. Next we come to economic breakdown.

Question: suppose more water vapor is collected happens, how will it affect MORE POWERFUL hurricanes. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If more water vapor is collected in the atmosphere, it will likely lead to MORE POWERFUL hurricanes. The reason for this is that hurricanes draw their energy from the warm, moist air that rises from the ocean surface. Specifically, the heat energy from the evaporation of warm ocean water fuels the hurricane's development and intensification. In the process you described, several thunderstorms come together and form around an area of low pressure to create a tropical cyclone or hurricane. The energy from the continuous evaporation of warm ocean water fuels the storm and allows it to continue developing. As more water vapor is added to the atmosphere, the potential energy for hurricane formation and intensification increases. This additional water vapor can cause hurricanes to become more intense and powerful due to the increased energy available to them. Regarding the second effect you mentioned, which is the area of low pressure causing rotation, the increased presence of water vapor may not have a direct impact on the rotation process. The rotation of the storm is mainly influenced by the Earth's rotation and the Coriolis effect, which is not directly affected by the amount of water vapor present. However, the intensified storm due to more water vapor could lead to stronger winds, indirectly enhancing the rotation process. In summary, the presence of more water vapor in the atmosphere can lead to more powerful and intense hurricanes, but it may have no direct effect on the area of low pressure causing rotation. The perturbation's indirect influence on the second effect can lead to stronger winds, enhancing the rotation process but not directly affecting the low pressure itself."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Taking place over the course of a single day, November 30, 1962, a month after the Cuban missile crisis, A Single Man is the story of George Falconer (Colin Firth), a middle-aged English college professor living in Los Angeles. George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode), at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier.

With the new zinc pennies, there is the potential for zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1 kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis, whereas another patient, who ingested 12 grams of zinc, only showed lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins. Why have people reported zinc intoxication?","output":"Zinc intoxication, also known as zinc toxicosis or zinc poisoning, has been reported in several cases involving the ingestion of large amounts of zinc coins, particularly zinc pennies minted in the United States after 1982. There are several reasons why people have reported zinc intoxication in such cases, which can be attributed to the following factors: 1. Composition of zinc pennies: As you mentioned, post-1982 US pennies are composed of a zinc core (97.5% zinc, by weight) with a thin outer layer of copper (2.5% copper, by weight). This composition makes them a relatively large source of zinc when ingested, as compared to older copper-based pennies. 2. Solubility of zinc in the stomach: When ingested, zinc coins can react with the acidic environment of the stomach, leading to the dissolution of zinc ions. This results in an increased concentration of zinc in the gastrointestinal tract, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream and lead to toxic levels of zinc in the body. 3. Susceptibility to zinc toxicosis: The severity and symptoms of zinc toxicosis can vary depending on a person's age, overall health, the amount of zinc ingested, and the duration of exposure. In some cases, small amounts of ingested zinc may cause only mild symptoms, while a larger quantity or prolonged exposure can lead to severe or even fatal reactions. The cases you mentioned exemplify the varied response to zinc intoxication: one individual died after ingesting over 1 kg of zinc pennies, while another experienced lethargy and ataxia after consuming just 12 grams of zinc. 4. Physiological role of zinc: Zinc is an essential trace element for various physiological functions, including cellular metabolism, immune system function, and growth and development. However, as with many essential nutrients, there is a fine balance between the required amount of zinc for proper bodily function and the levels that can be toxic. When this balance is disrupted due to overexposure to zinc, the affected individual can experience a range of symptoms associated with zinc intoxication, such as gastrointestinal distress, lethargy, ataxia, and, in severe cases, organ damage or failure. 5. Limited public awareness: Many people may not be aware of the potential dangers of zinc intoxication, and thus may not recognize the symptoms or the cause of their illness when ingesting large amounts of zinc coins. This lack of awareness, combined with the fact that coins are small and easily accessible, can contribute to the prevalence of zinc poisoning cases. In summary, people have reported zinc intoxication from ingesting zinc-containing coins, like post-1982 US pennies, due to the substantial amount of zinc present in these coins, the solubility of zinc in the stomach, varied susceptibility to zinc toxicosis, the essential nature and narrow therapeutic range of zinc, and a general lack of public awareness about the risks of ingesting zinc coins. It is crucial to educate the public about the potential hazards of consuming coins and to emphasize the importance of seeking medical attention if an incident occurs."},{"instruction":"Here is a goal: Remove cloudy, white spots from wooden furniture.

Repeat both steps until the white, cloudy spot is completely removed from the wooden furniture. This method makes more sense for accomplishing the goal of removing cloudy, white spots from wooden furniture, as it involves using heat to break up the moisture trapped within the finish that causes the white, cloudy appearance, and then applying a small amount of olive oil for rejuvenating the wood. First, by placing a pressing cloth over the cloudy spot, you are providing a protective layer between the furniture's surface and the iron. This helps prevent any direct heat damage to the wood. Ironing in a circular motion for 5 seconds allows for even distribution of heat over the area, effectively raising the temperature throughout the spot. This will cause the moisture trapped inside the finish to evaporate, thus removing a significant part of the cloudy appearance. Once the area has been heated, applying a small amount of olive oil with a paper towel helps to recondition the wood and replenish any natural oils that may have been lost during the heating process. This step helps to restore the wood's natural luster and provide a protective layer, which can prevent future cloudy spots from forming. Repeating the process of heating and oiling will gradually help to remove the entire cloudy, white spot from the wooden furniture. It also allows you to monitor the progress and ensure that you're not causing any harm to the furniture. Consequently, this method is a sensible approach to removing cloudy spots from wooden furniture, ensuring a gentle yet effective treatment for the affected area."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Manuel Rosales, who ran against Mr Chavez in the 2006 presidential election, faces corruption charges he says are baseless.

My friends and I visited Las Vegas for the first time the week of 6/30 through 7/7. We decided that Saturday night we would enjoy a fine dining experience and then see what the nightlife had to offer. We got dressed and headed out to the strip sometime around 7PM. After debating on where to eat we settled on Giada (she is my partner and I's favorite chef after all!). We were all dressed in appropriate attire, however at the reception desk we were treated as though we had walked in wearing flip-flops and tattered shorts. We made our way up the escalator and I approached the desk. A young dirty-blonde haired woman greeted me and I stated that I had a party of 6 and we wished to have dinner. She started to say \\"Oh I\\"m sorry but we...\\" At that moment another blonde haired woman (slightly older) literally nudged her with her elbow and said \\"be nice\\". She then preceded to ask me if I would perhaps like to see the menu before we were seated. Essentially she was insinuating that we obviously could not afford a meal there and looked the part to boot. I was infuriated, however being the opposite of what hey assumed I was I played along and agreed to see the menu. We were then whisked away on a tour of the kitchen area and finally seated. The drink menu was very unique (based on Giada's father's favorite films), I had a Hannibal which was great and my partner had the Barbarella (his favorite film) which was equally refreshing. We ordered Giada's favorites and calamari for the table as the antipasto, spaghetti and tortellini for the pasta and shared the porterhouse steak with a side of polenta. The food was amazing just as we expected, however the treatment by the staff left a sour taste in our mouths. There were other patrons sitting near us wearing shorts and t-shirts whom I am sure were not treated as we were. The main reason in my opinion is because we mostly looked Hispanic unlike the fairer skinned individuals who were poorly dressed. While the food was amazing, we will not be visiting Giada again. I myself have experienced true Italian hospitality, unfortunately it was nowhere to be found at Giada....OPTIONS: 1. negative. 2. positive. I think the answer is","output":"1. negative. To justify my answer, let's examine the review step-by-step: 1. The user and their friends went to Las Vegas and wanted a fine dining experience. 2. They chose Giada's restaurant, as Giada is the user's favorite chef. 3. Despite being dressed appropriately, the user felt they were treated poorly at the reception desk. 4. The user mentioned the staff making insinuations about their financial status, which infuriated them. 5. The user enjoyed the unique drinks and the food at the restaurant. 6. However, the user suspected that they were treated poorly due to their Hispanic appearance, as other patrons with more casual attire did not seem to face the same treatment. 7. The user states they won't be visiting the restaurant again because the negative treatment by the staff overshadowed their experience. While there are positive aspects mentioned (the food and drinks), the overall sentiment of the review is negative, as the user expresses dissatisfaction with their treatment at the restaurant and a reluctance to return."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\") and the answer to that question.

Marta sells tomatoes in a grocery store. On Friday, a shipment of 1000 kg of tomatoes arrived at the store. On Saturday, Marta sold a total of 300 kg of tomatoes to customers. On Sunday, the store was closed, causing 200 kg of tomatoes to rot and to be thrown away. On Monday morning another shipment arrived, twice the size of the first one. How many kilograms of tomatoes did Marta have ready for sale on Tuesday?","output":"Step 1: Determine the initial amount of tomatoes that arrived on Friday. Marta received a shipment of 1000 kg of tomatoes on Friday. Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount of tomatoes after Saturday's sales. On Saturday, Marta sold 300 kg of tomatoes. So, the remaining amount after sales would be: 1000 kg (initial shipment) - 300 kg (sold) = 700 kg. Step 3: Account for the tomatoes that rotted on Sunday. On Sunday, 200 kg of tomatoes rotted and were thrown away. The remaining amount of good tomatoes is: 700 kg - 200 kg = 500 kg. Step 4: Calculate the size of the Monday shipment. The Monday shipment is twice the size of the Friday shipment. The Monday shipment would be: 2 * 1000 kg (Friday's shipment) = 2000 kg. Step 5: Add the Monday shipment amount to the remaining good tomatoes from before. To find the total amount of tomatoes ready for sale on Tuesday, add the Monday shipment to the remaining good tomatoes: 2000 kg (Monday's shipment) + 500 kg (remaining good tomatoes) = 2500 kg. Final Answer: Marta had 2500 kg of tomatoes ready for sale on Tuesday."},{"instruction":"Southern Nevada (often abbreviated as SNV) is the region of Nevada which includes the Las Vegas Valley.

It once housed the enigmatic \\"Dark Institute\\" - an institution shrouded in mystery, which conducted horrifying experiments on its patients. Act 1: Sarah moves into her inherited mansion, hoping to transform it into a mental health retreat center to help those in need. As she explores the property, she comes across strange documents and trinkets, hinting at the dark past of the place. Determined to uncover the truth, Sarah starts her research on the so-called \\"Dark Institute\\" previously run by its founder, Dr. Alfred Grimson. Grimson was obsessed with unlocking the potential of the human mind and used unorthodox methods to treat his patients, which ultimately led to their demise. Act 2: Rumors about the return of the notorious mansion spread through the town, driving people to reminisce about the horrible past. Former patients, who had survived the Institute's dark experiments, begin to contact Sarah, warning her of the supernatural forces entwined with the house and the dangerous knowledge it holds. Intrigued and alarmed, Sarah continues to dig into the past, connecting the dots between Dr. Grimson's research and the unexplained phenomenon she experiences in the mansion. Act 3: As the house's haunting presence grows stronger, Sarah is tormented by bizarre dreams that blur reality and the supernatural. With the help of local historian, Jack Harker, she starts uncovering the horrifying truth about the Institute's experiments. They find out that Dr. Grimson used a mix of science and dark rituals to fracture patients' minds, which accidentally unleashed malevolent forces.

They have always been highly respected and considered pillars of the community, until the day their lives take an unexpected turn. When John's youngest son, Michael, gets involved in an illegal logging scheme that causes a deadly accident, the entire family's reputation is put on the line. Act 2: Facing mounting pressure from the community and local authorities, the Blackbear family finds themselves the center of a high-profile court case helmed by the no-nonsense Judge Maria Dawson. Throughout the trial, the Blackbears defend their innocence, but dark family secrets and the testimony of disconnected family members paint a picture of a family governed by greed and pride. The townspeople become increasingly skeptical of the once-beloved family. As the trial unfolds, we see the Blackbear family's internal struggles, as well as how they cope with the newfound animosity from the town. Some family members fight to maintain their power and influence, while others, like John's daughter Sarah, are torn between family loyalty and a desire for justice and redemption. Act 3: In the climactic courtroom scene, Judge Dawson delivers her verdict. While she finds the Blackbear family as a whole to be responsible for the tragedy, she also acknowledges that Michael, specifically, acted recklessly and without concern for others. In order to account for the lives lost and the damage caused, Judge Dawson orders the Blackbear family to pay 6,000 in restitution to the affected families and the town. In the aftermath of the verdict, the Blackbear family is left to pick up the pieces of their shattered reputation and rebuild their bonds with each other and their community.

It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - Air chief marshal (Air Chf Mshl or ACM) is a four-star air officer rank which originated in and continues to be used by the Royal Air Force, where it is the most senior peacetime air force rank. The rank is also used by the air forces of many countries that have historical British influence and it is sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure. Air chief marshal is a four-star air officer rank and has a NATO ranking code of OF-9. An air chief marshal is equivalent to an admiral in the Royal Navy or a General in the British Army or the Royal Marines. In other forces, such as the United States Armed Forces and the Canadian Armed Forces, the equivalent four-star rank is General. - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved. What object entity has the relation of 'conflict' with the subject 'david evans '? Choices: - battle of britain - cold war - first barbary war - second barbary war - world war - world war i - world war ii The answer is:","output":"- battle of britain"},{"instruction":"Background: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. Paragraph: Two farms used AM fungi for the plants. Brown farm also decided to grow cover crops on those parcels of land to help mycorrhizal growth. Orange farm didn't grow cover crops. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm didn't provide extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn?

Turkey yesterday shelved plans to criminalise adultery which were threatening the country #39;s prospects of joining the European Union.","output":"Okay, let me explain this to you in a simple way. Turkey is a big country with many people, and they have their own rules. One rule they were thinking about making was that if someone is married and they love someone else who is not their husband or wife, they could get into big trouble. This is called adultery. But, there is a big group of countries called the European Union, and they have their own special rules. Turkey wanted to be friends with these countries and join their group. However, the European Union didn't like the idea of making adultery a very serious, punishable trouble. They think it's not a good rule. So, when Turkey realized this, they decided not to make adultery a serious trouble anymore because they want to be friends with the European Union. They put this plan away, or \\"shelved\\" it, so that they have a better chance of joining the European Union later."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - Arithmetic or arithmetics (from the Greek \\"arithmos\\", \\"number\\") is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics. It consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations between themaddition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms \\"arithmetic\\" and \\"higher arithmetic\\" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for \\"number theory\\" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory. - A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines. - The Corporate Machine is a strategy computer game from Stardock in which the goal is to create a corporation in one of four industries ( automobiles , aircraft , computers , or soft drinks ) and eventually dominate rival companies . To win the player must dominate the chosen market ( getting 55 % to 65 % of the market share depending on the number of opponents . ) The Corporate Machine is a follow up to the game Business Tycoon , which was itself a sequel to the game Entrepreneur , all developed by Stardock . - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies. - Stardock Corporation is a software development company founded in 1991 and incorporated in 1993 as Stardock Systems. Stardock initially developed for the OS/2 platform, but was forced to switch to Microsoft Windows due to the collapse of the OS/2 software market between 1997 and 1998. The company is best known for computer programs that allow a user to modify or extend a graphical user interface as well as personal computer games, particularly strategy games such as the \\"Galactic Civilizations\\" series, \\"\\", \\"\\", and Ashes of the Singularity. - Galactic Civilizations is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Stardock and released in March 2003. The game is a remake of a vintage OS/2 series of the same name. An expansion pack entitled \\"Altarian Prophecy\\" was released in July 2004. A sequel, \\"\\", was released February 21, 2006. On May 14, 2015 Stardock released \\"Galactic Civilizations III\\". - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile. - A Company is a legal entity made up of an association of persons, be they natural, legal, or a mixture of both, for carrying on a commercial or industrial enterprise. Company members share a common purpose and unite in order to focus their various talents and organize their collectively available skills or resources to achieve specific, declared goals. Companies take various forms such as: - A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques. - In consumer electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, used to operate the device wirelessly from a short distance. Remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the consumer, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. - A smartphone is a mobile phone (also known as cell phones or cell mobiles) with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the Priv/Passport BlackBerrys, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features. - A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an \\"ad hoc\\" act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. - A mobile device (or handheld computer) is a small computing device, typically, small enough to hold and operate in the hand and having an operating system capable of running mobile apps. These may provide a diverse range of functions. Typically, the device will have a display screen with a small numeric or alphanumeric keyboard or a touchscreen providing a virtual keyboard and buttons (icons) on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or near field communication (NFC). Integrated cameras, digital media players, mobile phone and GPS capabilities are common. Power is typically provided by a lithium battery.

Lazar Markovich Lissitzky (Russian: Ла́зарь Ма́ркович Лиси́цкий, listen ; November 23 [O.S. November 11] 1890 – December 30, 1941), known as El Lissitzky (Russian: Эль Лиси́цкий, Yiddish: על ליסיצקי‎), was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works – a Soviet propaganda poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against Nazi Germany.

It was said that there less than 20 jaguars in the world, one of which was living in the national zoo of Peru. In order to help this jaguar, Peruvians set up a zoo for it, where there were sheep and deer for the jaguar to eat. However, strange enough, no one had ever seen the jaguar hunt the deer and sheep. What they could see was its lying in its cave, sleeping and eating the meat provided by the zoo keepers. At first, people thought that the jaguar felt too lonely, so they found a female tiger to accompany it. However, it did not make too much sense. The jaguar just sometimes went out of its cave with its \\"girlfriend\\" for a while before it came back to its house again' It is normal for the jaguar to be lazy here. Tiger is the king of forest but you simply put some small animals around him. That is why the jaguar shows no interest in going out' a visitor said. So people put five wolves into the jaguar's zoo.

The World health Organization (WHO) observes that the introduction of air conditioning and energy conservation measures have been accompanied by growing problems of indoor air quality. Some pollutants arise from insulation products, some from moving cars, and others from modern housing materials. As many Europeans spend up to 90% of their lives in buildings, the health effects of the indoor climate are very important. Some construction materials, including fiberboard, insulation foams and certain glues for man-made wood floor boards, for example, give out organic products such as formaldehyde . Heat and humidity increase the release of formaldehyde and the gas seriously harms the eyes. Paint, lacquer, etc. can also release dangerous gas into indoor air. Construction materials can cause serious damage, especially when they contain asbestos . Asbestos is naturally present in rock formations worldwide. It belongs to a family of mineral substances made up of solid, non-combustible fiber. These properties make asbestos a highly sought-after construction material.

The land on which a building is sited may also contribute to pollution. Some kinds of granite or similar rocks contain traces of radium. As it breaks down, this naturally radioactive element produces some kind of radioactive gas that goes through tiny cracks in walls, floors and building materials, and makes its way into the building and the rooms.

A survey last year by the Radcliffe Public Policy Center in Cambridge, Mass., revealed just how sharp the generational divide has become. Men aged 20 to 39 said having enough time with their family was the most important aspect of their jobs, above things like salary, job security and status, says Leslie Cintron, a research associate at the center. \\"Eighty-two percent said they wanted a balanced work schedule,\\" Cintron says, while just 46 percent said they wanted more pay. Two-thirds of men aged 40 to 49 identified time with family as a desirable job characteristic, but a bigger majority  82 percent  said challenging work was most important. For men 50-59, having good relationships with co-workers ranked first. \\"The findings gel with focus groups we did,\\" Cintron says. \\"The younger men didn't want to replicate the paths taken by their fathers and grandfathers they would consistently say that the best use of an extra hour or an extra day would be to spend time with the family, not more money or more leisure time.\\" The impact on children of growing up in homes with two wage earners may also contribute to changing attitudes, says Cintron. The Radcliffe researchers noted that many of the survey participants putting a premium on family time \\"recognized the difficulties of having two parents working,\\" Cintron says. For Rothberg and his wife, the decision to downscale came with the understanding that they would forgo a a bigger house in a more posh Minneapolis suburb, and that they'd have to make due a while longer with their 7-year-old car.

The events last weekend were apparently “live tweeted” by a rapper living beside the spot where Michael Brown, 18, died. The mostly black neighbourhood has been rocked by protests ever since, threatening to ignite a race war, as locals demand to know how an unarmed man could be shot dead in broad daylight as he apparently tried to surrender to police. Officers have been widely condemned for being out of touch and for using excessive force against the demonstrators. They have also come under fire for claiming that Brown was stopped because he was a suspect in a robbery - only to backtrack hours later when it emerged the officer involved did not know of his alleged crime. Using the street slang of rap culture, Emanuel Freeman, who goes by the Twitter label of @TheePharaoh , gave a blow by blow account of what unfolded last Saturday at about midday. <noframe>Twitter: Bruh. - I JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE OMFG</noframe> His first tweet said: “I JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE OMFG.” He then posted a photograph of a man lying face down in the street outside his house. To a friend, he said: “The police just shot someone dead in front of my crib yo.” An angry crowd soon gathered in the street. “Its blood all over the street, n----s protesting nshit. There is police tape all over my building. I am stuck in here omg,” he wrote. Michael Brown (Facebook) TheePharoah then went on to answer questions from other Twitter users, saying that he thought the man was shot seven times - twice from behind, and then five further shots as the victim turned to face police. More photographs follow, including a police officer with a rifle in his hand. The killing has sent shockwaves across America, igniting protests in 60 other cities. Civil rights campaigners compare the death with the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager killed by a neighbourhood watch organiser who was later acquitted of murder in a racially charged case. The local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan has reportedly begun raising money as a “reward” for the officer involved. But for many, the case highlights the gulf between communities and the officers who police them. In Ferguson, a down-at-heel neighbourhood of strip malls, a local force of 53 officers has just three black members for an area that is two-thirds African-American. Five years ago, police there charged a black man with property damage for bleeding on four uniforms as officers allegedly beat him. And this week’s disturbing scenes of officers with armoured vehicles has raised questions about whether America has allowed its police to morph into a paramilitary force. Ferguson, for example, is one of the areas that has signed up to a Pentagon programme to receive surplus military supplies, including automatic weapons and armoured vehicles, such as MRaps, or Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles of the sort more usually seen in Afghanistan. Barack Obama interrupted his summer holiday to condemn the police’s heavy handed approach, arresting journalists and denying peaceful protesters their right to express themselves. <noframe>Twitter: Bruh. - Just got told to stay inside. Scene will be clear hopefully in a couple hours.</noframe> Details of the killing remain contested. Police say Brown was shot dead after a scuffle with officers that left one policeman with a swollen face. On Friday, they released video footage showing Brown and a friend apparently stealing a 49 box of cigars from a convenience store. The pictures show Brown pushing a member of staff into a display stand. In American police jargon it was described as a “strong arm” robbery - one that did not involve a weapon. That was why, according to the official version of events released on Friday morning, Brown and his friend had been stopped in the street. However, the revelations added fuel to an already combustible situation. Locals accused police of trying to shift attention from the killing and of concocting a cover story. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Brown family, said it amounted to a character assassination. A statement released by the Brown family said: “There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.” Even then the police were forced to change their story later in the day. Thomas Jackson, the chief of Ferguson police, was forced to admit that the officer responsible for the shooting, named as Darren Wilson, had not known Brown was a suspect in the robbery. Instead, he had asked Brown not to walk in the middle of the street so a police car could pass. After 24 hours of calm on Thursday, when state police were given responsibility for calming the protests, the result was inevitable. Protesters gathered outside a looted QuikTrip store - focal point for anger in four of five previous nights. Al Aitkins, a crane operator, said the accusations would enflame simmering anger. “It will make things worse,” he said. “They may try to shift the blame but we will carry on demanding justice for Mike.” The evening started peacefully. Dancers and drummer created a carnival spirit despite steady drizzle. Witnesses said the atmosphere changed at midnight, when dozens of protesters confronted police, shouting abuse. A hard core threw bottles which were met with a single teargas round, sparking an attack on the Ferguson Market and Liquor store, the scene of Brown’s alleged robbery. TV pictures showed masked looters emerging with bottles of wine and even the cash register. Police stayed away, and trouble died down as other protesters formed human barriers in front of shops to keep looters at bay. It left the black officer drafted in to restore calm at the end of the week exasperated. Captain Ron Johnson, of Missouri Highway Patrol, who has won praise for his sensitive handling of the protests, told a local television station he had spent all day trying to ease concerns after local police released the video. “We had concerns that this would happen,” he said.

But the Klan –– desperate for publicity and any opportunity to spread hate and terror –– is climbing atop the powder keg that Ferguson has become following the police killing of an unarmed college-bound black teenager last Saturday. The South Carolina-based New Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan says its Missouri chapter is raising money for the still unidentified white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, 18, who was scheduled to begin college classes this week. “We are setting up a reward/fund for the police officer who shot this thug,” the Klan group said in an email. “He is a hero! We need more white cops who are anti-Zog and willing to put Jewish controlled black thugs in their place. Most cops are cowards and do nothing while 90% of interracial crime is black (and non-white) on white.” In a Tuesday editorial about the case headlined “The Death of Michael Brown: Racial History Behind the Ferguson Protests,” The New York Times expressed hope that the FBI will be able “to answer the many questions surrounding the death” of the teenager” while focusing on St. Louis’ history of racial problems. |||||","output":"Photographs of the moment a black teenager, Michael Brown, was shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri, emerged on social media, igniting protests and violence in the small suburb.

Nicole Vaisey, 25, and boyfriend Stephen Howells II, 39, were named in a five-count indictment in Syracuse. The charges included conspiracy to sexually exploit the two Amish girls along with a third female minor, according to a statement released by U.S. Attorney Richard Hartunian. Howells also was charged with possession of child pornography. The pair had previously been charged with the kidnapping of the two Amish girls -- ages 6 and 12 -- about 50 miles from the Canadian border on August 13. \\"This indictment charges Howells and Vaisey with enticing and coercing children to engage in sexual conduct and making a video recording of it,\\" Hartunian said in a statement. Vaisey and Howells both face a maximum of 30 years in prison on the sexual exploitation charges against children. Howells faces a maximum of 20 years on the child pornography charge. If convicted, both could be fined up to 250,000 on each count. The pair also faces criminal court charges of first-degree kidnapping after luring the young Amish girls into a car with a puppy, authorities in New York's St. Lawrence County said. Details about the abduction in Oswegatchie emerged during a preliminary hearing in St. Lawrence County in August. Detective Sgt. Brooks Bigwarfe detailed the couples' alleged plan and kidnapping of the girls, as related to him by Vaisey. Vaisey told investigators that she and Howells were on a \\"shopping trip\\" for \\"slaves\\" when they allegedly kidnapped the girls. \\"They had been planning this for several weeks,\\" Bigwarfe said. The girls were picked up at a vegetable stand outside a family farm. Howells and Vaisey pulled up to the stand in a location where they couldn't be seen, and waited for the girls to approach the car, Bigwarfe said. Howells allegedly scouted out the stand the previous week. Howells asked the girls whether they wanted to pet the dog, a Doberman pinscher-golden retriever mix named Kaleidoscope, police said. When the older child grew suspicious, Bigwarfe said, Howells pushed the girls into the back of the car. \\"When he started forcing them into the vehicle, they were both screaming and yelling,\\" Bigwarfe said. The girls were held captive for nearly 24 hours, during which they were handcuffed together, shackled to a bed and sexually abused, according to the sheriff's department. With widening media coverage, a large police response in the area and an Amber Alert, the couple began to worry and decided it was too risky to keep the girls, he said. Howells abandoned the two girls in an isolated area 12 miles from where they were being held, Bigwarfe said. Attorneys for Vaisey and Howell did not immediately return calls seeking comment. After her August arrest, Vaisey's attorney, Bradford Riendeau, told CNN that his client was allegedly in a master-slave relationship with Howells and that she was not the mastermind of the planned kidnapping.

The attitude towards Japanese rearmament in the Philippines, itself colonised by","output":"Japan during World War II, has shifted significantly in recent years. This change can be attributed to growing concerns over China's expansionist policies and military assertiveness in the region. As the Philippine foreign minister suggests, a stronger and more proactive Japan could serve as a stabilizing force and provide a much-needed balance to China's growing influence. The Philippine government's embrace of such a notion indicates its willingness to put aside historical grievances and prioritize regional peace and stability. This decision is likely driven by the desire to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity amidst ongoing disputes with China over the South China Sea. Moreover, the upcoming election in Japan and the potential return of Shinzo Abe to the position of prime minister adds another layer of complexity to the situation. With Abe's commitment to revise Japan's pacifist constitution and strengthen its military capabilities, the Philippines finds itself in a position where it must align its strategic interests with the evolving dynamics of the region. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage is to highlight the shifting attitude of the Philippines towards Japanese rearmament due to concerns about China's military assertiveness, the necessity for a regional balance of power, and the changing political landscape in Japan. The Philippines is willing to support a rearmed Japan to ensure regional stability and safeguard its own interests, even if it means risking disagreements with China."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The moon looks bigger than the stars at night.

The USS Houston arrives in Pearl Harbor for routine maintenance, during which the leak was found. The leak was found on the USS Houston, a Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine, after it went to Hawaii for routine maintenance last month, Navy officials said. Navy officials said the amount of radiation leaked into the water was virtually undetectable. But the Navy alerted the Japanese government because the submarine had been docked in Japan. The problem was discovered last month when a build-up of leaking water popped a covered valve and poured onto a sailor's leg while the submarine was in dry dock. An investigation found a valve was slowly dripping water from the sub's nuclear power plant. The water had not been in direct contact with the nuclear reactor, Navy officials said. Officials with knowledge of the incident could not quantify the amount of radiation leaked but insisted it was \\"negligible\\" and an \\"extremely low level.\\" The total amount leaked while the sub was in port in Guam, Japan and Hawaii was less than a half of a microcurie (0.0000005 curies), or less than what is found in a 50-pound bag of lawn and garden fertilizer, the officials said. The sailor who was doused, a Houston crew member, tested negative for radiation from the water, according to Navy officials. Since March, the Houston had crisscrossed the western Pacific, spending a week in Japan and several weeks in both Guam and Hawaii, Navy officials said. See a timeline of the sub's movements ». The Navy on Friday notified the Japanese government of the leak, the officials said, and told them it was possible the ship had been leaking while in port in Sasebo, Japan, in March. While Japan has agreed to allow U.S. nuclear-powered ships in Japanese ports, the decision was a not popular in Japan. The Houston incident comes at a time when the Navy is trying to smooth over a problem with a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The USS George Washington was due to replace the aging, conventionally powered USS Kitty Hawk this summer as the United States' sole carrier based in Japan. While en route to Japan this May, a massive fire broke out on the George Washington, causing 70 million in damage. The fire was blamed on crew members smoking near improperly stored flammable materials. There was no damage or threat to the nuclear reactor, but the ship was diverted to San Diego, California, for repairs. It now is expected to arrive in Japan at the end of September. The Navy this week fired the captain and his deputy, saying an investigation into the fire led to a lack of confidence in the leadership of both men. Just two weeks ago, thousands of Japanese protested the pending arrival of the George Washington.","output":"A U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Houston, may have leaked water with trace amounts of radioactivity for months while traveling around the Pacific to ports in Guam, Japan, and Hawaii.

In real-world scenarios, it is quite common to find a telephone inside the entrance hall of a building or facility, especially in office buildings, hotels, or public spaces.

Efficiently: It implies that the robot operates with minimal waste of time, energy, or resources. In other words, it carries out its tasks effectively without unnecessary delays or consumption of energy. 4. Samples: Portions or specimens taken to represent a larger whole. In this case, the robot is collecting small pieces of Martian rocks to be analyzed and observed. Samples help scientists understand the properties, formation, and history of the materials found on Mars. 5. Martian rocks: Rocks and other geological materials native to the planet Mars. These rocks can provide information about the planet's surface, atmosphere, geological history, and the potential for life on Mars, which makes them valuable targets for future missions. 6. Autonomous exploration: The ability of the robot to explore on its own without direct human intervention. This independence is essential for efficient exploration of Mars, given the communication latency and complexities associated with managing a robot remotely. 7. Data: Information collected during the robot's mission, which is then sent back to Earth. This could include images, geologic information, and other details about the Martian environment, all of which are crucial for our understanding of the planet. 8. Earth's scientists: Researchers based on Earth, who are studying and analyzing the data transmitted by the robot. These scientists are interested in learning more about Mars, its geology, and its potential for supporting life. 9.

A: Unlike the Baroque style that it replaced, which was mostly used for palaces and churches, and had little representation in the British colonies, simpler Georgian styles were widely used by the upper and middle classes. Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Yes, the answer correctly highlights that the Baroque style was little represented in British colonies. However, while it goes on to describe that Georgian style was widely prevalent among the upper and middle classes, the primary focus should be on providing more details about the Baroque style and its limited representation. The Baroque style, which originated in Italy around the 17th century, was an ornate and highly decorated architectural and artistic movement that was popular throughout Europe. It was characterized by grandeur, boldness, dramatic forms, and emotional intensity. Baroque architecture often featured complex, curving forms, intricate ornamentation, frescoes, and murals. However, this elaborate style did not find much representation in British colonies. Some of the reasons for this limited representation included the following: 1. Cultural differences: Baroque architecture was most popular in Catholic countries, such as Italy and Spain, where religious institutions had considerable influence and resources to commission large-scale projects. In contrast, British colonies were often dominated by Protestantism, which did not emphasize such grand displays of religious or artistic expression. 2. Austerity of British colonial life: Early settlers in British colonies faced various challenges, including harsh living conditions and limited resources, which made it impractical to adopt elaborate architectural styles like Baroque. Instead, they preferred more straightforward and functional designs that could be easily constructed. 3. Influence of Georgian style: By the time British colonies became more established, the Baroque style had been gradually replaced by the simpler Georgian style in Britain. Georgian architecture offered a more modest, symmetrical, and restrained alternative to the grandeur and extravagance of Baroque and thus appealed to the sensibilities of the British colonial society. 4. Local adaptation: In many British colonies, local materials, craftsmanship, and architectural traditions were often merged with European styles, resulting in unique hybrid styles. However, the complex and intricate features of Baroque architecture were generally not conducive to such adaptations, thus limiting its representation in colonial settings. In summary, the Baroque style was little represented in British colonies due to its extravagant and ornate features, which did not align with the cultural, religious and practical aspects of colonial life. As a result, simpler architectural styles like Georgian became more prevalent among the upper and middle classes in these regions."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: The survey also found that many people-particularly those planning to work the longest-underestimate how long they will live in retirement.

The MPQ (also called the McGill pain index), is a scale of rating pain developed at McGill University in Canada in 1971. It's a written questionnaire that allows people in pain to give their doctors a good idea of the quality and intensity of pain they're feeling / experiencing. Patients basically choose descriptive words from different categories that best describes their pain. The MPQ is a well-validated measure of pain with extensive clinical research backing up it's relative accuracy. People can rate their pain in sensory terms (sharp or stabbing, for examples) and choose affective terms (sickening or fearful, for examples), so a doctor or therapist can review 15 total selected descriptors. Each selected descriptor is rated on a 4-point scale that ranges from none to severe, so the type and intensity of the pain can be better understood by health professionals. The BPI is a questionnaire used to measure pain developed by the Pain Research Group of the WHO Collaborating Center for Symptom Evaluation in Cancer Care. The BPI comes in 2 formats: the short form, which is used for clinical trials; and the long form, which contains additional descriptive items that may be useful to a doctor in a clinical setting. The main purpose of the BPI questionnaire is to assess the severity of a person's pain and the impact it has on their daily functions. The BPI questionnaire is best for people with pain from chronic diseases, such as cancer, osteoarthritis or low back pain. The BPI can also be used to assess acute pain, such as postoperative pain or pain from accidents and sports injuries. The main areas of assessment for the BPI include: location of pain, severity of pain, impact of pain on daily activities and response of pain levels to medication. The ODI is a numbered index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain questionnaire developed in 1980 and used by health care professionals and researchers to quantify disability caused by low back pain. The questionnaire contains 10 topics concerning pain intensity, sexual function, social life, sleep quality and the abilities to lift, sit, walk, stand, travel and care for yourself. The ODI is a 100-point scale derived from the questionnaire and considered the \\"gold standard\\" for measuring disability and estimating quality of life in people with lumbar spinal pain. The severity scores from the questions (ranging from 0-5) are added up and multiplied by two to obtain the index, which ranges from 0-100. Zero is considered no disability, whereas 100 is the maximum disability possible. ODI scores between 0-20 indicate minimal disability, whereas scores between 81-100 indicate either extreme disability (bed-bound) or exaggeration. The questionnaire is more accurate for people with acute (sudden) low back pain than it is for those with chronic (long term) back pain. The TOPS is the longest and most comprehensive survey for patients with chronic pain. The survey is designed to measure quality of life and function for a variety of causes of pain. The TOPS actually contains items from the BPI and ODI questionnaires, as well as questions on coping styles, fear avoidance beliefs, potential substance abuse, satisfaction levels of treatment and demographic variables. The full TOPS contains 120 items and is about as thorough of a questionnaire that measures pain that you'll come across. TOPS gives quantitative information on pain symptoms, functional limitations, perceived disability, objective disability, treatment satisfaction, fear avoidance, passive coping, solicitous responses, work limitations and life control. Because of the time it takes to fill out the TOPS, it may not be appropriate for people in severe pain.

I've certainly noticed some pupils being feverishly overgenerous of late. Last year, I received not one bottle of wine but four for helping a disaffected pupil through his GCSEs. By and large, my colleagues report the gifts differing along gender lines. Gentlemen get ties, mugs, booze and, if they're really lucky, tickets to football matches. The ladies are often presented with flowers, jewels, chocolates and so on. When my son was at private school, I noticed there was a real competitiveness between the students about giving presents to teachers, with expensive baskets from fancy stores and huge bouquets being handed out on the last days of term. Since my wife and I only let my son give thank-you cards, it was clear we were not \\"classy\\". Now he is at an inner-city primary, we've noticed that this kind of _ seems to have more or less disappeared. For one thing, there isn't that kind of money floating around - but there isn't that kind of competitive culture either. Personally, I think gifts to teachers should be banned beyond the thank-you card: they cause many more problems than they solve, creating insecurity in both parents and staff. Perhaps the recession and the lack of money in people's pockets might be a good excuse for the government to issue some guidelines to schools that gifts shouldn't be accepted by teachers.

Step 2: Establish a logical continuation of the story given the choices. - Since Jason is the one outside during the rainstorm, it makes sense that he would be the one getting drenched. Step 3: Add details to make the story engaging and consistent. - Describe the rainstorm and its impact on both characters. - Show some interaction and emotions between Nelson and Jason. Continuation: Jason ended up getting drenched in the rainstorm, his clothes clinging to his body as torrents of rainwater poured down on him. Nelson, on the other hand, was relatively dry, the thick animal hides of the teepee protecting him from the worst of the downpour. As the rain continued to pelt down, Jason grumbled to himself in discomfort. He tried seeking shelter under a nearby tree, but that proved to be no help whatsoever. The wind had picked up, and the rain was now coming at him sideways. Eventually, Jason could bear it no longer and shouted for Nelson to let him in. Nelson, hearing Jason's miserable cries, hesitated for a moment. He considered the extra space taken up by their limited supplies, but ultimately, he couldn't leave his friend out in the rain. Opening the flap of the teepee, he gestured for Jason to hurry inside. Once inside the teepee, Jason shivered violently, his fingers pruned and teeth chattering. Nelson quickly fetched a blanket and handed it to Jason, who wrapped it around himself eagerly, grateful for the warmth. Despite the unpleasant situation, the two friends couldn't help but share a laugh over their misfortune, knowing that they'd look back on this adventure and savour the memory in the years to come."},{"instruction":"This is an email Hi Everyone, I have accepted a position with Duke Energy and will be starting there effective Monday, January 21st, but before I go I wanted to let you all know how much it has meant to me to be able to work with such outstanding people as yourselves over the years.

A forward, he played for several clubs including Liverpool and Hamburger SV. He went on to manage Newcastle United, Fulham and Manchester City, winning promotion as champions in his first full season at all three clubs. He also managed the England national team. After weeks of speculation, Keegan was named as the new England manager on 18 February 1999, succeeding Glenn Hoddle, who had been sacked two weeks earlier following a newspaper interview in which he suggested that disabled people were being punished for their sins in a previous life. He led the team to a winning start with 3-1 victory over Poland to reignite England's Euro 2000 qualifying campaign, and they entered the qualification playoff with Scotland. Two goals from Paul Scholes gave them a 2-0 win in the first leg, and despite a 1-0 defeat in the second leg, they qualified for the championships for the fourth tournament in succession (though on the third occasion, they had qualified automatically as hosts). After an initial popular period as manager, he began to come under fire for his perceived tactical naivety. This came to a head during the unsuccessful Euro 2000 campaign, which began with a 3-2 defeat against Portugal, despite England having taken a 2-0 lead after 17 minutes. A 1-0 win in the next game over Germany, the first English victory over Germany in a competitive match since 1966, cost their opposition (the defending champions) progression to the quarter-finals, but in the final group game against Romania, England once again lost 3-2, this time after taking a 2-1 lead, and their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals were over. Keegan resigned as England manager on 7 October 2000, after England lost to a Dietmar Hamann goal for Germany in their first 2002 World Cup qualifier, in the last game to be played at Wembley Stadium, before the old stadium was rebuilt. Keegan won only 38.9% of his games in charge, the lowest such percentage of any permanent England manager - although unlike Don Revie (1974-1977) or Steve McClaren (2006-2007), Keegan achieved qualification to a major tournament for England. When Sven-Goran Eriksson became England manager, Eriksson appointed the 64-year-old Tord Grip as his assistant. This caused Keegan to complain that when he was England manager, the FA had told him that he could not have Arthur Cox as his assistant because at 60, Cox was too old. Keegan went on, \\"I wasn't allowed to bring in the people I wanted and that was wrong. Mr Eriksson was and I'm delighted for him because that's the way it should be.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Punished how?","output":"In the above article, the quote referring to punishment is in the context of Glenn Hoddle's controversial newspaper interview. Hoddle had suggested that disabled people were being punished for their sins in a previous life.

The Telegraph reports Idaho teen Erik Finman, after dropping out of high school, made a bet with his parents that if he made 1 million by the time he turned 18, he wouldn't have to go to college. \\"I won the million dollar bet,\\" Finman triumphantly tweeted Tuesday. Finman's journey to teenage millionaire started with 1,000 his grandma gave him when he was 12. He invested the money in bitcoin—which then cost 12 each—and by 2013, his bitcoins were worth 100,000, CNBC reports. Finman cashed out some of his bitcoins to start online teaching company Botangle, for which an investor gave him another 300 bitcoin. Flash forward to 2017, and Finman's 403 bitcoins have a value of 1.09 million. Finman left school because he thought it was a waste of time and his teachers were too negative. He says they made his poor academic performance \\"seem like a bad thing.\\" Since dropping out of high school, Finman has moved to San Francisco and interned at various start-ups.

He decided to make a bet with his parents. He told them that if he could make one million dollars before he turned 18 years old, he wouldn't have to go to college. His parents agreed to the bet. When Erik was 12, his grandma gave him a special gift of 1,000.

By the time Erik was 15, the value of his bitcoins had gone up a lot! They were worth 100,000! Erik decided to use some of his bitcoins to start a new business called Botangle. It was a place where people could learn things online without going to school. A kind person who liked Erik's idea gave him 300 more bitcoins to help his business grow. Time went by, and when Erik was 18, he had 403 bitcoins in total. Guess what? The value of those bitcoins was 1.09 million! Erik had won the bet with his parents!

While entertaining a girl in his dorm room, he finds that when he reads from his adolescent journals, he travels back in time, and he is able to \\"redo\\" parts of his past, thereby causing the blackouts he experienced as a child. There are consequences to his choices, however, that then propagate back to his present life: his alternate futures vary from college student, to prisoner, to amputee. His efforts are driven by the desire to undo the most unpleasant events of his childhood which coincide with his mysterious blackouts, including saving his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh (Amy Smart) from being molested by her father (Eric Stoltz) and tormented by her sadistic brother (William Lee Scott).The actions he takes, and those he enables others to take during his blackouts, change the timeline in the new future where he awakes. As he continues to do this he realizes that even though his intentions are good his actions have unforeseen consequences. Moreover, the assimilation of dozens of years' worth of new memories from the alternate timelines causes him brain damage and severe nosebleeds. Ultimately, he decides that his attempts to alter the past end up only harming those he cares about. But Evan realizes that the main cause of everyone's suffering in all the different timelines is himself.At the conclusion of the film, Evan purposely travels back in time one final time to the first day he met Kayleigh. By scaring her away, he makes sure that she is never a part of his life, and thus finally succeeds in saving her life. He then destroys all of his journals and memories so that he is not ever tempted again to make any more changes.

Are the two sentences saying the same thing?","output":"Yes, the two sentences are essentially conveying the same message, but they are presented in different linguistic structures and formats. In the first sentence: \\"With the test, Hubbard said, \\"I believe that we have found the smoking gun.\\" The sentence reports a direct quotation of Hubbard's statement and presents it with a specific context, which is \\"the test.\\" The use of the phrase \\"I believe\\" indicates that Hubbard is expressing his personal conviction or opinion that the test has led them to find the definitive evidence or the \\"smoking gun.\\" Thus, this sentence emphasizes Hubbard's thoughts about the situation at that moment, showing his confidence in the outcome of the test. In the second sentence: \\"We have found the smoking gun,\\" investigating board member Scott Hubbard said. This sentence also quotes Hubbard directly but omits his personal belief by not including \\"I believe.\\" The statement appears more objective, as it confirms that they have indeed discovered the smoking gun. Additionally, the sentence emphasizes Hubbard's position as an \\"investigating board member,\\" which lends credibility to his statement and might prompt the reader to give more weight to the claim. In summary, both sentences convey the central idea that the \\"smoking gun\\" has been found. However, the sentences emphasize different aspects of the situation: the first sentence underscores Hubbard's belief, while the second sentence highlights his authority as an investigating board member and presents the finding as more definitive. Despite their different formats and nuances, the core message remains the same—that the key piece of evidence has been discovered—and so the two sentences can be considered as saying the same thing."},{"instruction":"How is \\"And a saga shield?\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the phrase \\"And a saga shield?\\" can be translated as \\"A štít ságy?\\". Here is a more detailed explanation of the translation: 1. \\"And\\" can be translated in Czech as \\"A\\". Note that the capitalization is not necessary in this context, as the sentence translation assumes a conversational context. The capitalization of \\"A\\" in the translation is used for clarity purposes only. 2. \\"a saga\\" refers to a long narrative, usually a story about the history or the heroic achievements of a certain person or a group. The Czech word for \\"saga\\" is \\"sága\\". 3. \\"shield\\" can be translated to Czech as \\"štít\\". It refers to a protective piece of armor, traditionally carried by warriors, that serves to deflect or absorb the impact of blows, projectiles, or other forms of attack. 4. The word order in Czech sentences may sometimes be different than in English. In this case, the word order of the translated phrase is \\"A štít ságy?\\", which corresponds to \\"And a shield of saga?\\" in English. The preposition \\"of\\" is not used in Czech for this phrase, so it is not included in the translation.

As the credits continue, voices and clanking sounds are heard. One says \\"Camera - rolling!\\" and another follows with \\"Group 36 Training Film.\\" After some more fumbling sounds, the training film begins. A crude map of Berlin in 1987 appears, filmed by an unsteady camera. A narrator, one of the previously heard voices, explains that Allied occupation forces rule the city, and almost every squat has been evacuated. Only one block remains: Machnow Street, zip code SO36, in the American sector. The film then gives way to footage of a crowd of jeering people in a run-down neighborhood. They begin to throw objects at a line of police holding riot shields. For a moment, the camera freezes, and the film's title, \\"Was Tun, Wenn's Brennt?\\" (What to Do in Case of Fire?) appears on the screen. Then the rioters rush the line of policemen, jumping on cars, screaming, and generally causing mayhem. The camera focuses on some of the rioters, whose names appear onscreen, introducing Tim (Til Schweiger) and Flo (Doris Schretzmayer). A water cannon, a huge, tank-like vehicle equipped with a high-pressure water hose, begins to rumble down the street. Its spray knocks down several rioters, and they begin to flee. Rioters with signs continue to mock the policemen. Two more new characters appear in the same way as the others, Maik (Sebastian Blomberg) and Nele (Nadja Uhl). Another, Terror (Matthias Matschke) urinates on the policemen from an upper-story window. Yet another, Hotte (Martin Feifel), leads a mob down a street, waving a flag bearing the symbol for anarchy. All the while, the rioters are heard shouting in the streets. The narrator begins to speak again, informing viewers that Machnow street residents live in terrible conditions. A female voice adds that they are always inebriated or on drugs. More voices chime in that these people commit vandalism, resist arrest, and are misguided and sexually...

The earthquake magnitude is the energy released during the quake. Q: What term is used describe energy released during an earthquake? A: A:","output":"The term used to describe the energy released during an earthquake is referred to as the \\"earthquake magnitude.\\" This is an important metric that helps scientists to classify and understand the severity of an earthquake. The earthquake magnitude is a precise measurement that provides information on the size of the seismic waves originated by the quake. The concept of earthquake magnitude was developed in the early 20th century by Charles F. Richter, a seismologist from the California Institute of Technology, who introduced the Richter Scale in 1935. The earthquake magnitude on the Richter Scale is determined by the log to the base 10 of the maximum amplitude of the seismic waves recorded by seismographs, hence it isn't a simple linear scale, but a logarithmic one. This means that each whole number increase on the Richter Scale actually represents a tenfold increase in measured amplitude and about 31.6 times more energy release. In essence, the term magnitude in the context of an earthquake references the seismic energy that's been released during the quake. This energy is transported in the form of waves initiated at the earthquake focus, and spreads out through the Earth's crust. The magnitude represents the most fundamental property of the earthquake, and it is the most commonly used single number to indicate an earthquake's size. When reporting earthquake sizes, scientists usually provide the magnitude of the quake to describe the total amount of energy that has been released. Depending on the magnitude, the consequences of an earthquake can range from going almost unnoticed by humans to causing significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, and can even result in loss of human life. Earthquake magnitude is, therefore, a critically important factor for developing effective strategies for earthquake preparedness, early warning systems, and response mechanisms."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Cotto eatType coffee shop; Cotto food Japanese; Cotto priceRange high; Cotto customer rating 3 out of 5; Cotto area city centre; Cotto near The Portland Arms","output":"Cotto, a high-priced Japanese coffee shop in the city centre near The Portland Arms, boasts a modest 3 out of 5 customer rating."},{"instruction":"Given the question: - clubs is Örebro sk grankulla ifk - position is goalkeeper - nationalcaps is 27 - years is 1962 -- 1975 1976 -- 1978 - nationalyears is 1965 -- 1974 - nationalgoals is 0 - birth date is 10 may 1940 - nationalteam is sweden - birth place is sweden Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Answer: John Key is a prominent figure in New Zealand and has served as a politician."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that made recorded works by more than fifty composers? is inside the article: Monteux made a large number of recordings throughout his career. His first recording was as a violist in \\"Plus blanche que la blanche hermine\\" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, \\"if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions\\".

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, that answer does not correctly describe how the capital of Brazil, Brasília, was created. Let me give you a detailed answer. The idea of building a new capital for Brazil had been considered since the country's independence in 1822, primarily to promote the development of the interior and to reduce the country's coastal concentration. In the late 1950s, Brazilian president Juscelino Kubitschek decided to move forward with constructing a new capital to achieve these goals. The location for Brasília was chosen through a wide national competition, with the winning proposal situated in the Central Plateau region of Brazil. The city was designed by renowned Brazilian architect and urban planner Lúcio Costa and prominent architect Oscar Niemeyer, who was responsible for designing many of the city's signature buildings. Construction of Brasília took place at a rapid pace, officially starting in 1956 and being completed by 1960, when it was inaugurated as the country's new capital. The city was designed in a modernist style with a unique layout resembling the shape of an airplane or bird, consisting of various \\"sectors\\" designated for specific purposes, such as residential, commercial, and government areas. As for the population, Brasília currently ranks as the fourth-largest city in Brazil. However, as you mentioned, it has a lower population ranking when considering the metropolitan area, placing sixth in the country. In summary, Brasília was created to promote the development of Brazil's interior and reduce coastal concentration by establishing a new and modern capital city, designed and built with efforts led by key figures like Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer."},{"instruction":"Where can you buy opera glasses that are old?

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Input: Step 1: For each row in Tryout table, find corresponding rows in College table and in Player table. Step 2: find the average HS in the results of step 1 whose state equals no Output:","output":"To accomplish this task, you can use the following SQL statement: \`\`\`sql SELECT AVG(Tryout.HS) AS average_HS FROM Tryout JOIN College ON Tryout.college_id = College.id JOIN Player ON Tryout.player_id = Player.id WHERE College.state = 'no'; \`\`\` Explanation of the SQL statement: 1. I used the \\"SELECT\\" statement followed by the aggregate function \\"AVG\\" to calculate the average of the \\"HS\\" column in the Tryout table. 2. I used the \\"FROM\\" statement to specify the main table, which is the Tryout table in this case. 3. I used the \\"JOIN\\" statement to join the Tryout table with the College table using the condition \\"Tryout.college_id = College.id\\". 4. I used another \\"JOIN\\" statement to join the Tryout table with the Player table using the condition \\"Tryout.player_id = Player.id\\". 5. I used the \\"WHERE\\" statement to filter the results based on the condition \\"College.state = 'no'\\".

His team had four riders in the top six before Leipheimer’s crash. Now it is down to three, with Contador still in second place, six seconds back. Armstrong, the seven-time Tour champion, is in third, eight seconds back. Andreas Kloden is in fifth, 54 seconds behind first place. “For us, this changes a lot,” Bruyneel said. “It makes us weaker and will obviously motivate other teams to attack. That’s the situation where other teams will take advantage of.” But on Friday none of the teams with riders in contention for the overall lead made a move on Astana. Nocentini, an Italian rider on the AG2R La Mondiale team, retained the yellow jersey after the stage, which was won by Heinrich Haussler, an Australian-born German rider on the Cervélo Test Team. Haussler, 25, finished alone after taking off on a multiple-rider breakaway early in the stage. For his courageousness on a day when other riders were cautious, the crowd rewarded him with cheers. And at the end of a long, wet day that included several steep climbs and several scary descents, he deserved them. “It’s the Tour de France; it’s the biggest race in the world,” he said, speaking English with an Australian accent. “It means a lot to me. You could see on the finish line what happened. The emotions just went crazy on me. I couldn’t hold the tears back.” While Haussler celebrated, Astana joined in, happy to be in a good position for yet another day. The overall standings of the top riders have not changed much since Contador attacked on Stage 7, the first stage in the Pyrenees. Even so, the Astana riders said Friday’s stage felt empty without Leipheimer in the peloton. “We really missed him today because he’s one of the best descenders and he’s really good at guiding us down the mountain in a safe way,” Contador said. “We can keep fighting, but the most important thing is that he recovers.” Leipheimer posted his thoughts on his Twitter page before Stage 13, while his teammates went on without him. He also posted a photo of the surgery, as well as an X-ray showing the screw stabilizing his wrist. The injury happened in the closing moments of Stage 12 when he lost control of his bike during an unexpected turn in the course. He ended the day with contusions on his right wrist and back and road rashes on his shoulder and back. Now, with most of the season over, Leipheimer said he would try to recuperate and maybe squeeze in a race or two before the year was over. “Who knows,” he said when asked which race he would shoot for. “Maybe the Tour of Missouri.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Leipheimer Can Only Watch As Astana Teammates Move On.

The clerk at the store made our lives more enjoyable each day, and so we returned again and again. She had found her own way of enjoying life and her job. I'm not even sure if she realized that her warmth and brightness put a smile upon the face of each customer .

And the answer is?","output":"The answer is Rosalind Franklin. Rosalind Franklin's research on X-ray diffraction of DNA crystals played a pivotal role in helping Francis Crick and James Watson during the race to discover the structure of DNA. Rosalind Franklin was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer who specialized in using X-ray diffraction techniques to study the molecular structure of various biological compounds. In 1951, she joined King's College London to work on the X-ray diffraction of DNA fibers, which was a critical yet unsolved problem at the time. During her time at King's College, Franklin made significant advances in the understanding of the structure of DNA. She discovered that DNA exists in two forms – a wet, more biologically relevant \\"B-form\\" and a drier \\"A-form.\\" Franklin improved the wet B-form X-ray diffraction images, producing the famous Photograph 51. This image revealed crucial information about the B-form DNA's dimensions and a clear indication of the helical structure with repeating units. Unbeknownst to Franklin, her colleague Maurice Wilkins shared Photograph 51 with James Watson. Watson and Crick, who were working at the University of Cambridge, used this critical piece of information to build their now-famous double helix model of the DNA molecule. They published their groundbreaking findings in the journal Nature in April 1953. Despite her immense contribution to the discovery of the DNA structure, Rosalind Franklin's role was not fully acknowledged during her lifetime. While Watson, Crick, and Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their work on DNA structure, Franklin, who had passed away in 1958 from ovarian cancer, was not awarded the prize due to the Nobel committee's policy of not awarding the prize posthumously. However, in subsequent years, Rosalind Franklin's invaluable contributions to the field have been more widely recognized, and her role in the discovery of the DNA structure is now acknowledged as pivotal to the advancement of modern molecular biology."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text.

I'd had to psyche myself up for a week in advance because I have a real 'thing' about directors, producers and editors who keep putting over blown, over long quasi epics in front of us and I feel that on the whole, 2 to 2.5 hours is about right for a movie. So 4 hours seemed to be stretching the limits of my tolerance and I was very dubious about the whole enterprise. But I will say upfront that this is a beautifully  I might say lovingly  made movie and I'm really glad I saw it. Director Steven Soderbergh is to be congratulated on the clarity of his vision. The battle scenes zing as if you were dodging the bullets yourself. If there is a person on the planet who doesn't know, Ernesto 'Che' Guevara was the Argentinian doctor who helped Fidel Castro overthrow Fulgencio Batista via the 1959 Cuban revolution. When I was a kid in the 1960s, Che's image was everywhere; on bedroom wall posters, on T shirts, on magazine covers. Che's image has to be one of the most over exploited ever. If the famous images are to be relied on, then Che was a very good looking guy, the epitome of revolutionary romanticism. Had he been butt ugly, I have to wonder if he would have ever been quite so popular in the public imagination? Of course dying young helps. Movies have been made about Che before (notably the excellent Motorcycle Diaries of 2004 which starred the unbearably cute Gael Garcia Bernal as young Che, touring South America and seeing the endemic poverty which formed his Marxist politics) but I don't think anyone has ever tackled the entire story from beginning to end, and this two-parter is an ambitious project. I hope it pays off for Soderbergh but I can only imagine that instant commercial success may not have been uppermost in his mind. The first movie (The Agentine) shows Che meeting Castro in Mexico and follows their journey to Cuba to start the revolution and then the journey to New York in 1964 to address the UN. Cleverly shot black and white images look like contemporary film but aren't. The second film (Guerilla) picks up again in 1966 when Che arrives in Bolivia to start a new revolutionary movement. The second movie takes place almost entirely in the forest. As far as I can see it was shot mostly in Spain but I can still believe it must have been quite grueling to film. Benicio Del Toro is excellent as Che, a part he seems born to play. Personally, I felt that The Argentine (ie part one) was much easier to watch and more 'entertaining' in the strictly movie sense, because it is upbeat. They are winning; the Revolution will succeed. Che is in his element leading a disparate band of peasants, workers and intellectuals in the revolutionary cause. The second part is much harder to watch because of the inevitability of his defeat. In much the same way that the recent Valkyrie - while being a good movie - was an exercise in witnessing heroic failure, so I felt the same about part two of Che (Guerilla). We know at the outset that he dies, we know he fails. It is frustrating because the way the story is told, it is obvious fairly early on that the fomentation of revolution in Bolivia is doomed; Che is regarded as a foreign intruder and fails to connect with the indigenous peoples in the way that he did with the Cubans. He doggedly persists which is frustrating to watch because I felt that he should have known when to give up and move on to other, perhaps more successful, enterprises. The movie does not romanticise him too much. He kills people, he executes, he struggles with his asthma and follows a lost cause long after he should have given up and moved on, he leaves a wife alone to bring up five fatherless children. But overall, an excellent exercise in classic movie making. One note; as I watched the US trained Bolivian soldiers move in en masse to pick off Che and his small band of warriors one by one, it reminded me of the finale to Butch Cassidy. I almost turned to my husband and said so, but hesitated, thinking he would find such thoughts trite and out of place. As we left the theatre he turned to me and said \\"Didn't you think the end was like Butch Cassidy!\\" Would you say this review is positive or negative? Available choices: [+] negative.

A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the Siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led naval officers to be sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the Garde Mobile. As the autumn storms of the North Sea forced the return of more of the French ships, the blockade of the north German ports diminished and in September 1870 the French navy abandoned the blockade for the winter. The rest of the navy retired to ports along the English Channel and remained in port for the rest of the war.\\"?

Elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the polar regions have been called Alpine. A rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere causes the temperature to decrease (see adiabatic lapse rate). The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain. The height of the Alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and a dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks.

Combine the terms with the variable k on one side of the equation. To do this, you'll need to add 99*k to both sides of the equation. This will allow you to eliminate the -99*k on the right side: 206*k + 99*k + 3050 = -99*k + 99*k 2. Now, simplify by combining the terms with k on the left side: (206 + 99)*k + 3050 = 0 305*k + 3050 = 0 3. Next, isolate the term with k by getting rid of the constant term on the left side. To do this, subtract 3050 from both sides of the equation: 305*k + 3050 - 3050 = 0 - 3050 305*k = -3050 4. Finally, solve for k by dividing both sides of the equation by 305: k = -3050 / 305 5.

Logic test: A penguin is forced to swim at a low rate of speed through icy water, but can swim rather quickly through clear water. Which water is the most rough? (A) icy water (B) clear water Answer:","output":"(A) icy water Step 1: Understand the question - The question here presents a situation where a penguin has to swim through icy water and clear water. We need to determine which water is most rough based on the penguin's swimming speed. Step 2: Analyze the information - We know from the question that the penguin swims at a low rate of speed through icy water and can swim rather quickly through clear water. Step 3: Apply logic - Logically, something that impedes the penguin's speed (i.e., makes it swim slower) would be considered \\"rougher\\". Since it's stated that the penguin swims slower in icy water, we can interpret that the icy water must be rougher for the penguin. Step 4: Reach a conclusion - Therefore, the answer to the question \\"Which water is the most rough?\\" would be (A) icy water."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end?

The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave.

The equation given is 7*s - 16 + 9 = 0. Step 2: Combining like terms, I would simplify -16 + 9 (these are constants). This gives us -7. Therefore the equation becomes 7*s -7 = 0. Step 3: The next step is to isolate the term with the variable (7*s). I'd do this by moving -7 (on the left hand side of the equation) to the right hand side of the equation. As a rule, when a term is moved over the equality sign, its sign changes. So the equation becomes 7*s = 7. Step 4: Finally, to isolate s, we need to get rid of 7 (multiplying s). Since we're multiplying s by 7, we do the opposite operation which is division to isolate s. We divide both sides of the equation by 7. The equation becomes s = 7/7. Step 5: Simplify the right side to get the final answer, s = 1.

Gregory Hill was playing music in his garage on an afternoon in 2014 when a neighbor called the police to complain, the New York Times reports. Deputy Christopher Newman and another officer responded to the call and confronted 30-year-old Hill, a warehouse employee, in the garage of his Fort Pierce home. The police said Hill was holding a gun during the confrontation, and toxicology reports later concluded Hill was intoxicated at the time. After a less than two-minute encounter, the garage door (which had been opened for the deputies) was closed again and Newman shot at Hill through the door four times, striking him twice in the abdomen and once in the head. Hill was found dead inside the garage with an unloaded gun in his back pocket. The family filed a wrongful death suit and requested damages for the pain and suffering of Hill’s three children. Last week, a federal jury delivered a verdict that baffled them. It found Newman had not used excessive force, but that St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara had been negligent (due to Newman's actions)—but only minimally so. Specifically, the sheriff's office was found to be just 1% at fault for Hill's death, so the damages (1 for funeral expenses and 1 for each child’s suffering) were reduced to 4 cents from 4. The family's lawyer says, due to Hill's intoxication, the judge will further reduce the award from 4 cents to nothing. “I don’t get it,” the family's lawyer tells the Times. \\"I think [the jurors] were trying to insult the case. Why go there with the 1? That was the hurtful part.\\"","output":"Imagine you are listening to some music in your garage, having fun on your own, and then suddenly something very bad happens. That's what happened to a man named Gregory Hill in Florida in 2014. He was in his garage one afternoon, playing some tunes, when someone living nearby didn't like it and called the police. Mr. Hill was a 30-year-old man who worked in a warehouse. Two police officers, including one named Christopher Newman, came to Gregory's house because of the music. The police say Gregory had a gun with him during this visit from the police. They also say he had had too much alcohol. Things happened really quickly - in less than two minutes. The big door to the garage, which had been open when the police came, closed again. Then Officer Newman fired his gun at the garage door four times. Mr. Hill was hit by three of these shots, twice in his belly, and once in his head. He was later found inside the garage, no longer alive, with a gun that had no bullets in his back pocket. Gregory's family was very sad and upset. They said that it wasn't right for him to die this way, so they asked a court to give them money for the pain and loss they felt. They especially thought about Gregory's three children who now had to grow up without their dad. But then, something strange happened. A group of people called a jury, those who are called in to help decide what's right in a case, said that Officer Newman didn't use too much force. That meant they didn't think the officer was totally wrong for shooting Gregory. They did say, though, that the boss of all the police in the area, Sheriff Ken Mascara, was a little bit at fault because of what Officer Newman did, but only 1%. That 1% was equal to 4 - 1 for the cost of the funeral, and 1 for each of Gregory's children's pain. But then the jury said that because Gregory had been drinking too much, the award should be even less than 4. In fact, they said it should be just 4 cents! Gregory's family and lawyer were shocked and confused. The lawyer even said he thinks the jury was trying to insult them by offering such a small amount of money. He wondered why they even mentioned giving 1 for the different ways the family was hurt, when they then decided to give so much less. The whole thing is very sad, and hard to understand.

Choices: - roots - stems - seeds - leaves A: A:","output":"The part of a plant whose primary role is to collect sunlight and make food by photosynthesis is the leaves. Leaves are the primary site where photosynthesis takes place in plants. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in the form of glucose and other complex sugars. This process is essential for plants to grow and develop, as it provides them with the energy necessary to carry out their various life processes. Leaves are typically flat and broad, which increases their surface area to maximize the absorption of sunlight. The green pigment found in leaves, called chlorophyll, plays a crucial role in the process of photosynthesis. It absorbs light energy from the sun and uses it to power the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The internal structure of a leaf is highly specialized to support the process of photosynthesis. A leaf's outer layers, the epidermis and cuticle, provide a protective barrier that shields the delicate inner tissues from water loss and external harm. Below the epidermis lies the mesophyll, which contains two types of specialized cells: the palisade mesophyll and the spongy mesophyll. The palisade mesophyll consists of tightly packed, elongated cells rich in chlorophyll, and is the primary location for photosynthesis. The spongy mesophyll is made up of loosely arranged, irregularly shaped cells that provide air spaces for the exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, which are essential for photosynthesis. Another important structure in leaves is the vascular tissue, which includes the xylem and phloem. The xylem transports water and dissolved minerals absorbed by the roots to the rest of the plant, while the phloem carries the products of photosynthesis, such as glucose, from the leaves to other parts of the plant where they are needed for growth and energy. To summarize, the part of a plant with the primary role of collecting sunlight and making food through photosynthesis is the leaves. The leaves possess a flat and broad structure to maximize sunlight absorption, contain chlorophyll for the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, and have specialized cells, such as the palisade mesophyll, to facilitate efficient photosynthesis. The products of photosynthesis, such as glucose, are then transported throughout the plant to provide energy and support growth."},{"instruction":"Instructions: Given a sentence in English language, translate the sentence to Tagalog language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact.

In all the confusion of locking down the museum and capturing the robbers, Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) slips into an adjacent room and steals the painting of San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk by Monet. The insurers of the 100 million artwork send investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) to assist NYPD Detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) in solving the crime. In reviewing video of the rooms involved in both robberies, one of which was strangely \\"blank\\", Banning follows clues to discover how both robberies are connected. She quickly comes to suspect that the wealthy financier Thomas Crown is behind the theft. Banning is intrigued at his motivations and begins a game of cat-and-mouse to recover the painting. Despite the fact that both of them intuitively know what the other is up to, the two of them continue to meet in high class locations and intimate surroundings while Banning continues to search for the painting. The constant contact, matching of wits (and the romantic pursuit of Crown), cause Banning to fall in love with him. But her commitment to her job and her doubts about Crown's true intentions make her hesitate. To prove his love to her, Crown promises to return the stolen artwork to the museum. In her doubt, Banning betrays Crown's plan to Detective McCann who fills the museum with dozens of police officers in an attempt to catch him in the act. After a grand game of misdirection, the painting is returned and another one is stolen; one which Banning had previously expressed a desire to possess. Since the second stolen painting is insured by another company and her job is now finished, Banning's knowledge of Crown's plan allows her to meet him at a prearranged spot.

In his generation money was thought of as a real commodity that could be carried, or stolen. Consequently, to attract the custom of a sensible man, a bank had to have heavy walls, barred windows, and bronze doors, to affirm the fact, however untrue, that money would be safe inside. If a building's design made it appear impenetrable , the institution was necessarily reliable, and the meaning of the heavy wall as an architecture symbol reflected people's prevailing attitude toward money. But the attitude toward money has, of course, changed. Excepting pocket money, cash of any kind is now rarely used; money as a has largely been replaced by credit. A deficit economy, accompanied by huge expansion, has led us to think of money as product of the creative imagination. The banker no longer offers us a safe: he offers us a service in which the most valuable element is the creativity for the invention of large numbers. It is in no way surprising, in view of this change in attitude, that we are witnessing the disappearance of the heavy-walled bank. Just as the older bank emphasized its strength, this bank by its architecture boasts of imaginative powers. From this point of view it is hard to say where architecture ends and human assertion begins. Question: 37. How do the older generation and the younger one think about money respectively? Yes or no, is the answer \\"To the former money is a real commodity but to the latter be a means to produce more money.\\"?","output":"The answer to the question of how the older and younger generations think about money is accurately summarized by the statement \\"To the former money is a real commodity but to the latter be a means to produce more money.\\" The older generation views money as a tangible commodity, often associated with physical cash that can be carried or stolen. This perspective led to the belief that banks needed to have heavy walls, barred windows, and secure doors to keep the money safe within their premises. The architecture of banks symbolized the sense of security and a conservative approach to managing money. On the other hand, the younger generation has a different mindset towards money. They see it more as a means to generate wealth through creativity, imagination, and the use of credit. In this modern perspective, money is more about the services banks provide for its management and growth, rather than focusing on the physical protection of cash. This shift in attitude has significantly impacted bank architecture, as buildings no longer need to emphasize impenetrability but rather innovation and imagination."},{"instruction":"You are presented with the quiz \\"What produces a hormone that helps cells absorb sugar from the blood?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. “When we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements.

They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains. and the situation: Frank owned two parcels of land. He called them Forest and Field. The Forest parcel was covered in old-growth pine, while Field one was covered in grass and wildflowers. Frank was very proud of his properties. Answer the following question: Which parcel had fewer plants with large and feathery stigma? Answer:","output":"Given the background information on anemophilous pollen grains and the two parcels of land owned by Frank, it is likely that the parcel with fewer plants possessing large and feathery stigmas is the Forest parcel. The Forest parcel is covered in old-growth pine, which belongs to the Pinus species. The pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and less dense compared to typical anemophilous pollen grains. The trees usually rely on wind currents for the transportation of pollen. In contrast, the Field parcel is covered in grass and wildflowers, which can include plants that have entomophilous pollen grains, as well as grass flowers that may be visited by bees for pollen collection. Entomophilous plants, which depend on insects for pollination, often have nutrient-rich pollen grains that attract insects. An important characteristic of entomophilous plants is their sticky pollen, usually followed by well-adapted structures like the large and feathery stigma to easily trap the pollen grains carried by their pollinators, like bees. In this situation, the Field parcel that consists of grass and wildflowers is more likely to have a variety of entomophilous plants than the pine-covered Forest parcel. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Forest parcel has fewer plants with large and feathery stigmas compared to the Field parcel."},{"instruction":"Use some thinking to answer the following question. If x and y are unique prime integers, which of the following must be odd? Options: (A) xy^2 (B) 2x+2y (C) 2x−2y (D) 2x/2y (E) x−y","output":"Let's analyze each option: (A) xy^2: Since x and y are unique prime integers, the lowest values they can have are 2 and 3 (or vice versa). x = 2 and y = 3 make xy^2 = 2 * 3^2 = 18, which is even. However, if both x and y are odd prime numbers, xy^2 would be odd. So this option is not always odd. (B) 2x + 2y: Let's factor out the 2: 2(x + y). Since x and y are integers, their sum (x + y) is also an integer. Therefore, the expression 2(x + y) must be even, as it is always a multiple of 2. (C) 2x - 2y: Similar to (B), we can factor out 2: 2(x - y). The difference between x and y, (x - y), is also an integer. Thus, the expression 2(x - y) must be even, as it is always a multiple of 2. (D) 2x / 2y: Simplifying this expression, we get x / y, which is not guaranteed to be even or odd as it might not be an integer. (E) x - y: Since x and y are unique prime integers, one of them must be 2, as 2 is the smallest prime integer and the only even prime. Thus the other prime number must be odd. When subtracting an even number from an odd number (or vice versa), the result will always be odd. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) x - y, as it must always be odd."},{"instruction":"Translate from Spanish to English: Estamos dedicados a brindar Abington Pennsylvania Quiebra abogados y bufetes de abogados con la calidad del sombrero blanco y los servicios de marketing online que mejoren su marca, aumentar la visibilidad de su web, y generar más negocio en línea.","output":"Step 1: Read the given text in Spanish to understand the context and specific meanings.

Which object takes longer to speed up? (A) motorcycle (B) tank. What is the most sensical answer between \\"tank\\" and \\"motorcycle\\"? Answer:","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"tank\\" and \\"motorcycle\\" would be (B) tank. To better understand why the tank takes longer to speed up compared to the motorcycle, let's delve into the fundamental principles of physics that govern the motion of objects. Newton's second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object (how fast it speeds up or slows down) is directly proportional to the net force applied on the object and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, this can be represented as: Acceleration = Force/Mass In simple terms, this means that for a given force, objects with a larger mass will have a smaller acceleration. Therefore, they take longer to speed up compared to objects with a smaller mass. Now let's consider Mike's tank and motorcycle. Tanks are typically much heavier than motorcycles. They are heavily armored and are designed to be sturdy and robust to withstand enemy fire on the battlefield. Motorcycles, on the other hand, are lightweight and designed for quick maneuverability and fast acceleration. Therefore, the tank's substantially larger mass directly affects its acceleration capabilities. Imagine Mike applying an equal amount of force on both the tank and motorcycle. Due to its higher mass, the tank will have a smaller acceleration as per Newton's second law, meaning it will take longer to speed up. Conversely, the motorcycle's smaller mass means it will have a larger acceleration and will speed up faster when the same force is applied. It is important to consider other factors that could affect the acceleration and speed of both vehicles, such as engine power, traction, and aerodynamics. However, when solely comparing the mass and resulting acceleration of Mike's tank and motorcycle, the most sensical answer is that the tank (B) takes longer to speed up."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text.

He is best known for writing and presenting, in conjunction with the BBC Natural History Unit, the nine natural history documentary series that form the Life collection, which form a comprehensive survey of animal and plant life on Earth. He is a former senior manager at the BBC, having served as controller of BBC Two and director of programming for BBC Television in the 1960s and 1970s. He is the only person to have won BAFTAs for programmes in each of black and white, colour, HD, 3D and 4K. Context: Attenborough was born in Isleworth, Middlesex (now part of west London), but grew up in College House on the campus of the University College, Leicester, where his father, Frederick, was principal. He is the middle of three sons (his elder brother, Richard, became an actor and director and his younger brother, John, was an executive at Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo), and the only surviving child among them. During World War II, through a British volunteer network known as the Refugee Children's Movement, his parents also fostered two Jewish refugee girls from Europe. Attenborough spent his childhood collecting fossils, stones and other natural specimens. He received encouragement in this pursuit at age seven, when a young Jacquetta Hawkes admired his \\"museum\\". He also spent a considerable amount of his time in the grounds of the university, and, aged 11, he heard that the zoology department needed a large supply of newts, which he offered via his father to supply for 3d each. The source, which wasn't revealed at the time, was a pond less than five metres from the department. A few years later, one of his adoptive sisters gave him a piece of amber filled with prehistoric creatures; some 50 years later, it would be the focus of his programme The Amber Time Machine. In 1936 David and his brother Richard attended a lecture by Grey Owl (Archibald Belaney) at De Montfort Hall, Leicester, and were influenced by his advocacy of conservation. According to Richard, David was \\"bowled over by the man's determination to save the beaver, by his profound knowledge of the flora and fauna of the Canadian wilderness and by his warnings of ecological disaster should the delicate balance between them be destroyed. The idea that mankind was endangering nature by recklessly despoiling and plundering its riches was unheard of at the time, but it is one that has remained part of Dave's own credo to this day.\\" In 1999, Richard directed a biopic of Belaney entitled Grey Owl. Attenborough was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and then won a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge in 1945, where he studied geology and zoology and obtained a degree in natural sciences. In 1947 he was called up for national service in the Royal Navy and spent two years stationed in North Wales and the Firth of Forth. In 1950 Attenborough married Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel; she died in 1997. The couple had two children, Robert and Susan. Robert is a senior lecturer in bioanthropology for the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University in Canberra. Susan is a former primary school headmistress.

Some gathered to mourn at Washington National Cathedral, while investigators continued to pore over the charred red brick home. “I can’t even express my sorrow,” Masser said. “I can’t even say anything.” Savvas Savopoulos and Amy Savopoulos at the Starlight Children’s Foundation MidAtlantic’s Wine Dinner in 2008. (Tony Powell/Washington Life Magazine) Lanier said police had positively identified two of the dead as Savvas Savopoulos, 46, and his wife, Amy, 47. They have tentatively identified the other victims as the couple’s 10-year-old son, Philip, and a 57-year-old housekeeper, Veralicia Figueroa, of Silver Spring, Md. Lanier said that three victims suffered blunt-force or sharp-object wounds and that all four deaths in the upscale neighborhood near the vice president’s residence were being investigated as homicides. “Evidence collection will go on for several days,” Lanier said. “There’s still a lot more we don’t know.” Lanier renewed a call she originally made Thursday for information about the family’s blue 2008 Porsche 911, which disappeared from the home Thursday morning. She asked the public to contact authorities if anyone had seen it between Wednesday and Thursday at 5 p.m. — a longer time frame than authorities had initially requested. Lanier declined to explain why investigators now wanted to know about the car’s whereabouts a day earlier. The Porsche was found burning in Prince George’s County on Thursday evening, Lanier said. Prince George’s County Fire spokesman Mark Brady said firefighters extinguished the fire about 5:30 p.m. behind a church at 8201 Annapolis Rd. in Lanham, Md. Lanier said it was unclear who had been driving the vehicle. Lanier said there was no evidence to suggest random or forced entry into the Savopouloses’ home but asked anyone who had seen anything suspicious in the area to call police. Asked whether the house had been ransacked, Lanier said it was “difficult to make that determination” because of the fire. Authorities have been going through the home to try to determine whether anything was stolen, according to two officials with knowledge of the case. Police say three of the four victims found in a burning Northwest D.C. home on Thursday suffered blunt force or sharp object wounds. Their deaths are being investigated as homicides. (WUSA9) The Savopouloses are survived by two teenage daughters, who friends said were at their boarding schools Thursday. Abigail Savopoulos is a senior at Mercersburg Academy, an elite private school in Pennsylvania, and is scheduled to graduate next week. Her younger sister, Katerina, is a junior at Peddie School near Princeton, N.J. Philip was a student at St. Albans School in the District. Neighbors said the family had lived on the block for more than a decade. They described the community as tightknit and said the Savopouloses were an integral part of it. They regularly held gatherings at their home for neighbors and friends. They attended church at the nearby St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral for about 10 years. Coco Palomeque, a friend who lives in the neighborhood, said the Savopouloses were “a beautiful family.” “The community where they lived really loved them,” she said. Savvas Savopoulos was the president and chief executive of Hyattsville-based American Iron Works, which played a role in building Verizon Center and ­CityCenterDC. His Facebook page says he also worked for Sigma Investment Strategies in Puerto Rico. American Iron Works officials declined to comment. Amy Savopoulos was widely known as a deeply involved mother who spent much of her time volunteering at her children’s schools or raising funds for them. On her Facebook page, her daughter Abigail posted a tribute on Mother’s Day: “I am so grateful for everything you do. Thank you for always believing in me and supporting me. Thank you for the early morning crafts, upside down clowns on my birthday, gingerbread decorating parties, and for always showing up. . . . Thank you for the past 19 years and I look forward to the many more to come. I love you so much.” About 180 people gathered to mourn the family Friday afternoon in a lower-level chapel at Washington National Cathedral. The 30-minute service included prayer, singing and periods of silence. Many who had come were struggling not only with what happened, but also with how to discuss it with their children, said the Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, who helped lead the service. “When people grieve, they want to be with other people,” Budde said. “Everyone is really sad, and really shocked.” Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who has known the family for more than 20 years, said in a statement that he was saddened. Savvas Savopoulos raised money for Van Hollen’s campaigns. “My heart goes out to the Savopoulos family at this time of unspeakable tragedy,” the statement read. “They were an important part of the community and will be deeply missed.” As friends and relatives grieved, investigators wearing yellow hard hats walked in and out of the gutted Savopoulos home. Yellow police tape still blocked off sections of Woodland Drive and 32nd Street NW, and a large ATF explosives and fire investigation vehicle was parked out front. Joe Carregal, a neighbor, said he saw the fire unfold Thursday. About 1:15 p.m., he said he saw smoke pouring from the upper-story windows of the home and a man knocking on the front door in an attempt to get the family out. Soon after, fire trucks came roaring down the street. Firefighters broke windows on the house, deployed ladders and clambered onto the roof to extinguish flames. Carregal said he watched them pull three victims from the house. Chris Vorobek, who lives in the neighborhood, said he would see Amy Savopoulos, walking her dog in the neighborhood, and her son racing around on his bicycle. “He was a great kid,” Vorobek said. Keith L. Alexander, Lynh Bui, Alice Crites, Abigail Hauslohner, Peter Hermann, Roxanne Roberts, Valerie Strauss, Julie Tate and Clarence Williams contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"On Thursday, a fire broke out at the house owned by Savvas and Amy Savopoulos in the upscale Woodley Park neighborhood of NW Washington D.C., where four bodies were later discovered.

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. When will the tax plan be made law? - Before the plea deal between Michael Flynn and Mueller - Before economic growth and jobs occur due to the plan? - After the start of the Russia investigation. - not enough information A:","output":"It is unclear exactly when the tax plan will be made law, but House and Senate negotiators are working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks."},{"instruction":"Premise: A brown dog is starting to walk into water.

What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","output":"The first step of the process involves the pancreas creating digestive juices, also known as pancreatic enzymes, that aid in breaking down the food components in the gastrointestinal tract. The pancreas, an essential organ in the digestive system, produces these enzymes to facilitate the efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients. The pancreatic enzymes primarily consist of proteases, amylases, and lipases, which break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, respectively. When the stomach's content, in form of a semi-liquid substance called chyme, is released into the small intestine, it signals the pancreas to secrete digestive juices. These secretions contain various enzymes that are crucial for breaking down complex nutrients into simpler forms. For example, trypsin and chymotrypsin are proteases that digest proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids. Amylases break down carbohydrates, such as starch, into simple sugars like glucose, while lipases break down fats into fatty acids and glycerol. Apart from producing digestive enzymes, the pancreas also has an essential role in regulating blood glucose levels. The Islets of Langerhans, specialized cells within the pancreas, produce hormones such as insulin and glucagon. Insulin helps facilitate the movement of glucose from the blood into the cells, lowering the blood sugar levels. In contrast, glucagon increases blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogen breakdown in the liver. The intricate coordination between the pancreas and other parts of the digestive system ensures that the required enzymes are produced on demand and released into the small intestine to assist in the digestion process. This collaboration is primarily regulated by hormonal communication and neural signals. For instance, the release of cholecystokinin (CCK) and secretin in response to the presence of chyme in the small intestine stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes, further continuing the digestion process. In conclusion, the first step in the process described is the creation of digestive juices by the pancreas, which consists of essential enzymes to break down food components and facilitate efficient nutrient absorption. This crucial process not only affects digestion and absorption but also plays a significant role in maintaining the body's overall metabolic balance."},{"instruction":"Do these mean the same?

The scarcity of food affects the availability of prey in the environment, which in turn influences the success of echolocation for foraging purposes. With more bats competing for limited resources, there might be increased difficulty in locating and catching prey using echolocation. This would primarily affect the following steps in the process: 1. The sound waves hit an object (reduced availability of prey means fewer targets for echolocation) 2. The bat hears the echo and figures out where the object is located (increased competition may make it more challenging to identify and locate prey successfully) Although these steps are impacted, it is important to note that the basic echolocation process itself remains unchanged.

These countries tend to have greater acceptance of the single parent because there are fewer nearby family members to disapprove, Riche, a Census Bureau director, said. Just as in the US, those changes raised new questions about how involved govenment should be in helping single parent families. Some research suggests children raised in two-parent families are better off than those who depend on one. \\"The position of one-parent families in any country is very much a gender issue-women's opportunities, especially working-class women on low income,\\" said Sue Cohen, coordinator of the Single Action Parents Network in England.

I wonder why he goes there if he doesn't live on it.\\" She tilted her head, considering the possible reasons. \\"You know, I've seen him do various things on the boat. Sometimes, he would be working on maintenance tasks – scrubbing the deck, updating the electrical system, and fixing miscellaneous things.

He rubbed his chin, clearly lost in thought. \\"Perhaps, being out on the water reminds him of something – a memory, a person, or even just a pleasant feeling. It's not uncommon for people to have hobbies that remind them of their past or provide a sense of comfort.\\" \\"You're right,\\" she agreed, nodding earnestly. \\"I think working on the boat and keeping it in good shape also helps him feel a sense of accomplishment. It's not an easy task to maintain a boat, especially if it's just a hobby.

Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"1. Calculate the cost of the clown for 4 hours: The clown charges 100 per hour, so for 4 hours, the cost would be 4 * 100. 2. Calculate the cost of the bounce house per hour: Since the bounce house costs 3 times as much per hour as the clown, the cost per hour would be 3 * 100. 3. Calculate the duration the bounce house was rented for: The bounce house was rented for half the time of the clown, which was 4 hours. So, the bounce house was rented for 4 * 0.5 hours. 4. Calculate the cost of the bounce house for its rental duration: Multiply the cost per hour of the bounce house by the duration it was rented for. 5. Add up the costs of the clown, the bounce house, and everything else to find the total cost of the birthday party. Let's compute the values step by step: 1. Cost of the clown: 4 * 100 = 400 2. Cost of the bounce house per hour: 3 * 100 = 300 3. Duration of the bounce house rental: 4 * 0.5 = 2 hours 4. Cost of the bounce house rental: 300 * 2 = 600 5.

Article: When was the last time your family sat down together to have a dinner? The speed at which we live today no longer allows for slow eating habits. Most people work long hours. There is lots of fast food and eating out is now on the increase. Often, food is eaten in front of the television in silence, or a child eats alone in front of the computer. When I was a child, every evening around the same time, one of the children would be asked to set the table, and then we'd go and wash our hands: before the meal. This was the time of day when we would talk about our day at school. But now things have changed a lot. A family environment plays an important role for children in learning to communicate with others and understanding table manners, such as waiting for others to finish before leaving the table and not speaking with a mouth full of food. Parents' likes and dislikes of a certain food will also influence a child's own likes and dislikes. Studies have shown that children who often eat with their families have better results at school than children who eat with their families less than twice a week. Regular meal times give children the chance to discuss their problems with family members. They can also learn to respect others around the table.

A giant crane eased the 18-tonne scanner down an alleyway with inches to spare on each side, then through a hole in the wall of the new building. Once it is installed and calibrated it will be used to research - and help treat - a variety of conditions such as stroke, vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. In its current condition it looks like a space capsule - a huge, upended metal doughnut with a hole where the patient will go. And like many a space shot it is a thing of superlatives. There is enough wire wrapped around its huge magnets to stretch from London to Brussels. When it is operating, those magnets - but not the patient - will be cooled to minus 269 Celsius. That is the temperature of deep space. So this particular corner of Glasgow will become one of the coldest places in the universe. The unit of strength of a magnetic field is a Tesla (T), named after the Serbian-American pioneer Nikola Tesla. The magnetic fields of the MRI scanners currently in use in Scotland range from around 1.5T to 3T. The new scanner's field strength will be 7T. Or to put it another way, 140,000 times stronger than the magnetic field of planet Earth itself. The head of Glasgow University's College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Prof Dame Anna Dominiczak, sees it as an endorsement of the pioneering work already done there. \\"Glasgow is a centre of excellence for chronic disease research and management, and also for clinical trials,\\" she says. \\"So as a leader in this area we think we are the best to get a 7 Tesla scanner.\\" With that field strength will come more detail than existing scanners. Much more. It has been likened to going from an ordinary TV picture to HD. That added detail will mean far greater opportunities to research and teach - and to treat patients from the QEUH campus with new precision medicine techniques. MRI scanners may seem new-fangled to many of us. If so, we are just showing our age. Glaswegians have been getting scanned for more than 30 years now. If we ourselves haven't been scanned, chances are we know someone who has. But do we know what's going on in there? Happily the university's professor of clinical imaging, Keith Muir, can explain. \\"Essentially we're using a very strong magnetic field which is going to line up all the water in your head in one direction,\\" he says. \\"And then by applying clever radio pulses it's going to spin them round in various ways that can be detected as very small radio signals which are used through vast computing power to reconstruct a detailed picture of the bit we're imaging.\\" As with many big ticket science projects, collaboration and co-funding are key. The university is taking the lead, in partnership with NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde. The ICE which now houses the scanner is costing £32m, with money coming from the UK government's Medical Research Council, the European Regional Development Fund, The Sackler Trust and the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation. The scanner's proper name is the Siemens Magnetom Terra. It will take months to set up but once the electrical and civil engineering are over, the science can begin.

Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. and the situation: Barry and Will are two geologists.

As a geologist specialized in montology (study of mountains), his expertise is focused on the formation, structure, and evolution of mountains, rather than on seafloor spreading and subduction zones.

Sentence 1: And do you agree with him that it was worth having made the start, even if the end was likely to be bad? This sentence is asking if you agree with a person's belief that initiating something (the start) was worthwhile, even if it is anticipated to yield an undesirable outcome (the end likely to be bad). Sentence 2: Do you agree that it's going to succeed? This sentence is asking if you agree with the proposition that something will be successful. Step 1: Identify the propositions presented in both sentences. - Proposition 1: It was worth having made the start (even if the end was likely to be bad) - Proposition 2: It's going to succeed Step 2: Compare the propositions. - Proposition 1 implies that there is value in starting an action despite potential negative consequences. - Proposition 2 suggests that the action will be successful. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. - The first sentence does not imply that it will be successful. Instead, it focuses on the value of beginning the action, even if the outcome is likely negative. The second sentence is about agreeing on the success of the action.

Donald grew smaller flowers than Samuel because","output":"Donald grew smaller flowers than Samuel because he cultivated them following a specific set of gardening methods and preferences that prioritized particular qualities and aspects of flower growth, rather than achieving significant size. Firstly, Donald may have chosen to grow smaller flower species initially in his garden, whereas Samuel focused on larger varieties. The selection of seeds and plants could significantly influence the size of flowers that bloom in their respective gardens. Small flowers often possess unique and delicate characteristics, such as intricate detailing and vibrant colors, which could be the desired features Donald sought after when selecting the seeds. Secondly, the difference in flower size could be attributed to the environmental conditions maintained by each gardener. Donald may have provided limited space and nutrients for his flowers, effectively curbing their growth, while Samuel might have chosen to cultivate his flowers under more favorable conditions such as larger pots or garden beds. The availability of space is a crucial factor in determining the size of a plant; therefore, Donald's decision to allocate less room for his flowers deliberately promoted smaller blooms. Another aspect that could contribute to the disparity in flower size between Donald's and Samuel's gardens is the varying techniques utilized in pruning and plant maintenance. Regular pruning can significantly impact a plant's secondary growth, further reining in the flower sizes. It could be that Donald actively employed controlled pruning to manage his flower growth, while Samuel allowed his plants to grow more freely and expand. Donald may have also employed the technique of intercropping, wherein different types of flower species are assigned close-growing pairs, creating a denser garden plot. Intercropping supports pollination, pest resistance, and mutual benefits for both species. However, it can lead to limited nutrient availability, resulting in smaller flower sizes. Additionally, Donald could have implemented sustainable gardening practices, prioritizing natural fertilizers and organic soil amendments. Organic practices favor the growth of smaller flowers as plants might not receive the same surge in nutrients they would from chemical-based fertilizers. On the other hand, Samuel may have opted for conventional fertilization, adding to the disparity in flower size between the two gardens. Lastly, it must be considered that the specific flowering plants cultivated by Donald and Samuel exhibit varying rates of maturity. Donald might have chosen plants that naturally bloom smaller, taking a shorter period to reach maturity, whereas Samuel might have opted for flower species that require more time to attain their full bloom, resulting in larger blossoms. In conclusion, the sentence ends with \\"Donald grew smaller flowers than Samuel because he employed specific gardening preferences and techniques aimed at producing a diverse range of flower characteristics, environmental factors, and sizes that suited his aesthetic vision and gardening goals.\\""},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s. The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers. The number 1293 was also restored to the engine. In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton.

What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"To determine the sentiment of this review, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. Analyzing the content of the review: The review seems to be about a movie starring Eddie Murphy involving him talking to animals. The reviewer mentions that the movie was called Eddie Murphy's comeback, but the reviewer doesn't agree with that claim. 2. Identifying negative expressions: The reviewer uses phrases like \\"stupid animals,\\" \\"lame jokes,\\" and \\"I should have walked out on this one.\\" Additionally, they express disappointment with Eddie Murphy's performance, suggesting that it's not enough for a comeback. 3. Identifying positive expressions: There are no particular positive expressions used by the reviewer. 4. Weighing the expressions: Since all the expressions are negative and the reviewer doesn't mention any positive aspects of the movie, the sentiment of the review is predominantly negative. Based on the analysis, the sentiment of this review is negative."},{"instruction":"You're given a fill-in-the-blank question where the answer is PersonX. You need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to PersonY. This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"sympathetic\\" to \\"stern\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two i.e. the trigger word/phrase. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For your question, PersonY should be a well-agreed answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people or generic names (e.g., Donald Trump, John Doe, etc.) in your question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity.

Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms. - Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science, an ideal \\"intelligent\\" machine is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term \\"artificial intelligence\\" is applied when a machine mimics \\"cognitive\\" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as \\"learning\\" and \\"problem solving\\". As machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For example, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an exemplar of \\"artificial intelligence\\", having become a routine technology. Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at a high level in strategic game systems (such as Chess and Go), self-driving cars, and interpreting complex data. Some people also consider AI a danger to humanity if it progresses unabatedly. - Prolog is a general-purpose logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. - Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages according to the style of computer programming. Features of various programming languages determine which programming paradigms they belong to; as a result, some languages fall into only one paradigm, while others fall into multiple paradigms. Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such as grouping code into units along with the state that is modified by the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and grammar. - Carcassonne is a fortified French town in the Aude department, of which it is the prefecture, in the Region of Occitanie. - Datalog is a declarative logic programming language that syntactically is a subset of Prolog. It is often used as a query language for deductive databases. In recent years, Datalog has found new application in data integration, information extraction, networking, program analysis, security, and cloud computing. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - A computer scientist is a scientist who has acquired the knowledge of computer science, the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their application. - Logic programming is a type of programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. Major logic programming language families include Prolog, Answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of \\"clauses\\": - Aude is a department in south-central France named after the river Aude. The local council also calls the department \\"Cathar Country\\". Aude is also a frequent feminine French given name in Francophone countries, deriving initially from Aude or Oda, a wife of Bertrand, Duke of Aquitaine, and mother of Saint Hubertus's brother Eudo. Aude was the name of Roland's fiancée in the chansons de geste. - Answer set programming (ASP) is a form of declarative programming oriented towards difficult (primarily NP-hard) search problems. It is based on the stable model (answer set) semantics of logic programming. In ASP, search problems are reduced to computing stable models, and \\"answer set solvers\\" programs for generating stable modelsare used to perform search. The computational process employed in the design of many answer set solvers is an enhancement of the DPLL algorithm and, in principle, it always terminates (unlike Prolog query evaluation, which may lead to an infinite loop). - Alain Colmerauer ( born 24 January 1941 , Carcassonne ) is a French computer scientist and the creator of the logic programming language Prolog . - Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. What is the relationship between 'alain colmerauer' and 'computer science'? Answer:","output":"Alain Colmerauer is a French computer scientist who is known for creating the logic programming language Prolog, which is associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. Therefore, the relationship between Alain Colmerauer and computer science is that he is a computer scientist who has made significant contributions to the field, particularly in the development of a programming language relevant to artificial intelligence and computational linguistics."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You need to create a question containing a blank (_), based on the given context word.

This immune response includes the following key actions: 1. Activation of the immune system: When the body detects the presence of harmful bacteria and their toxins, it triggers the immune system. The immune system is composed of various components, such as white blood cells, antibodies, and the complement system, which work together to defend the body against infections. 2. Release of chemical signals: The immune system releases chemical signals called cytokines to recruit immune cells to the site of infection. These chemical signals also stimulate inflammation, which increases blood flow and delivers more immune cells and nutrients to the affected area. 3. Phagocytosis: Immune cells called phagocytes engulf and destroy the bacteria. These phagocytes include neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. They are capable of identifying, engulfing, and digesting harmful bacteria and cellular debris, effectively removing the source of infection. 4. Antibody production: The immune system also produces antibodies, which are specialized proteins designed to recognize and neutralize specific bacteria and their toxins. B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, produce antibodies that bind to the bacteria, marking them for destruction by other immune cells or inhibiting their ability to produce toxins. 5. Memory cells: Once the infection is cleared, some immune cells become memory cells. These cells are capable of rapidly responding to future infections by the same type of bacteria, providing long-lasting immunity and prevention of reinfections. In summary, the final step of the process is the immune response, where the immune system works in a coordinated fashion to identify, neutralize, and destroy the invading bacteria and their toxins, ultimately restoring normal function and health in the body."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Russian: The attack would be the first with nuclear weapons since 1945, when the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.","output":"To translate the given sentence to Russian, I will follow these steps: 1.

Several lakes and small lochs have formed around Neilston: Long Loch, Loch Libo, and Loch Cawpla. Aboon the Brae (Scots language for \\"above the hill\\") is the site of a spring. There are a number of small named-localities in and around Neilston: Arthurlie, Holehouse, Crofthead, Kirkstyle, Coldoun, Gateside, Hollows, Broadley, Nether Kirkton and Neilstonside.Neilston's built environment is characterised by its mixture of 19th- and 20th-century detached cottages, single and two-story buildings. Several mansion houses were built for the owners of former mills and factories. Many of Neilston's dwellings are painted in whites or ivories. In his book Ordnance Survey of Scotland (1884), Francis Hindes Groome remarked that Neilston \\"presents an old-fashioned yet neat and compact appearance\\", a view echoed by Hugh McDonald in Rambles Round Glasgow (1910), who stated that Neilston \\"is a compact, neat, and withal somewhat old-fashioned little township\\", although continued that it has \\"few features calling for special remark\\".

Which path is followed by a star after the red giant phase depends on its mass. During the fusion life of a star, its size is the result of a competition between fusion heat pushing the material out and gravity pulling the material in. At the end, gravity always wins. After the star has lived through its red giant stage, the fusion essentially ends (the star runs out of fuel) allowing gravity to collapse the star. Some of the outer layers of material will be blown away and the core becomes smaller and denser. The core will become either a neutron star, a white dwarf, a black dwarf, or a black hole.

He leaves the cup of water overnight and when he checks in the morning the cup has shattered. Confused he fills another cup with water and just leaves in on his kitchen counter. When he checks in the morning the glass is in tact. Will the amount of space water takes up increase or decrease when frozen? Answer:","output":"To answer the question of whether the amount of space water takes up increases or decreases when frozen, let's consider the given scenario step-by-step: 1. Samuel fills a glass cup with water and places it in the freezer. 2. The water in the glass cup begins to freeze. As the temperature of water drops, the water molecules start to slow down and form a more structured arrangement called a crystalline structure. 3. When water turns into ice, its crystalline structure causes it to expand and occupy more space than it did as a liquid. This is because the water molecules are now arranged further apart from each other in the frozen state compared to the liquid state. 4. In the first case, as the water in the glass cup freezes and expands, it exerts force on the glass walls. Eventually, the pressure caused by the expanding ice becomes too much for the glass to withstand, causing it to shatter. 5. In the second case, Samuel leaves the glass cup filled with water on the kitchen counter, and the water does not freeze. Thus, there is no change in the amount of space the water occupies, and the glass remains intact.

As I sat parked at the old service station, I pulled out the maps and tried to do a little backtracking. It didn't take me long to figure out where I had made the wrong turn. I had tried following my memory instead of Luna's directions and wound up about eighty miles off course. My gas tank was pushing 'E' but fortunately the service station was open. When I stepped out of my Jeep, I could feel the soles of my boots melt on the asphalt. The heat coming off the cracked and pitted cement peeled off in waves that rolled out in every endless direction. The barren mountains in the distance looked unstable, like I was looking at them through a window pane slicked with olive oil. I slogged my way over to the gas pump and wrapped my shirt around the handle to keep my skin from burning against the desert-baked metal. The heat was so great I worried the fumes would ignite. A dirty round man stood in the shadowy doorway of the ramshackle service station and stared at me while he rubbed his hands inside an oily red rag.

Every day, Kevin would walk into the school with a wide grin on his face, knowing that he could rely on the company of numerous friends. Aaron, on the other hand, found it challenging to fit in. He was introverted and preferred to avoid the hustle and bustle of high school social life. Kevin's popularity made him feel confident and secure in his relationships. His friends often gathered around him during lunch breaks, exchanging stories and laughter. They admired and respected Kevin for his wit, kindness, and easy-going nature. He was never short of invitations to parties or after-school events, and this allowed him to create numerous meaningful memories throughout his high school years. Aaron, in contrast, felt more comfortable spending his time alone or in the company of a smaller group of friends. He struggled with jealousy at times, as he observed Kevin's flourishing social life from afar. Aaron secretly wished he could effortlessly form connections with others, just as Kevin seemed to do. However, he found solace in the few close friendships he managed to form – a small circle of friends who shared his interests and appreciated his quiet, intellectual nature. As time went on, both Kevin and Aaron focused on their own paths, shaping the high school experience that best suited their individual personalities. Kevin continued to be the social butterfly, attending various events and enjoying the company of those who adored him. Meanwhile, Aaron, though less popular, nurtured his passions and ambitions. He started to excel academically, frequently spending time in the library to further explore his areas of interest. His small group of friends also grew closer as they supported each other in their pursuit of knowledge. Ultimately, though Kevin had more friends than Aaron, each teenager found value and fulfillment in their respective circumstances. Kevin's popularity provided him with a wealth of cherished memories and a strong sense of belonging, while Aaron's smaller, close-knit group of friends offered a more intimate and supportive environment that fueled his personal growth. In the end, as high school came to a close, both Kevin and Aaron had thrived in their own unique ways, showing that the number of friends one has does not dictate the quality or satisfaction of one's high school experience.

However, having these features does not necessarily confirm that the man is a punk musician. - Sitting outside: Both the premise and hypothesis mention the man is outside, but the hypothesis specifies that he is sitting on the steps outside a studio, while the premise makes no reference to the location. - Drink Vs. Beer: The premise mentions the man is holding a drink, while the hypothesis specifies that he is drinking a beer. The premise does not clarify the nature of the drink. Step 3: Analyze the entailment Based on the comparison, we can see that there is not enough information in the premise to fully support the hypothesis. We cannot confirm that: - The man is a punk musician, as his appearance (beard and mohawk) alone does not provide enough evidence. - The location is outside a studio, as the premise does not mention a specific location. - The drink in his hand is a beer, as the premise does not describe the type of drink.

This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada. - A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \\"Btss\\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds. - Ethnic Channels Group (ECG) is a Canadian television broadcasting, distribution and communications company, specializing in multicultural television channels for the Canadian and United States markets. ECG has been in operation since 2004 and was co-founded by Slava Levin. - Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video content or other messages to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term \\"broadcasting\\", borrowed from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about, was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of \\"one-to-many\\" communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners. - The Gaza Strip (' ), or simply Gaza\\"', is a small self-governing Palestinian territory on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, that borders Egypt on the southwest for and Israel on the east and north along a border. Gaza, together with the West Bank, comprise the Palestinian territories claimed by the Palestinians as the State of Palestine. The territories of Gaza and the West Bank are separated from each other by Israeli territory. Both fall under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, but Gaza has since June 2007 been governed by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic organization which came to power in free elections in 2006. It has been placed under an Israeli and U.S.-led international economic and political boycott from that time onwards. - The Israeli Network is a Canadian exempt Category B Hebrew language specialty channel . It is wholly owned by Ethnic Channels Group , with its name used under license from the owners of the Israeli - based TV channel , The Israeli Network . - A television channel is a physical or virtual channel over which a television station or television network is distributed. For example, in North America, \\"channel 2\\" refers to the broadcast or cable band of 54 to 60 MHz, with carrier frequencies of 55.25 MHz for NTSC analog video (VSB) and 59.75 MHz for analog audio (FM), or 55.31 MHz for digital ATSC (8VSB). Channels may be shared by many different television stations or cable-distributed channels depending on the location and service provider. - Hebrew (\\"\\" or ) is a language native to Israel, spoken by over 9 million people worldwide, of whom over 5 million are in Israel. Historically, it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors, although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh. The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE. Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. The Hebrew language is the only living Canaanite language left. - A specialty channel can be a commercial broadcasting or non-commercial television channel which consists of television programming focused on a single genre, subject or targeted television market at a specific demographic. - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea.

He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century.

President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors.

Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. Human beings remained in Africa until about 40,000 years ago. After that, they spread throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia. By 10,000 years ago, the first human beings colonized the Americas. During this long period of time, the total number of human beings increased very slowly. Birth rates were fairly high but so were death rates, producing low rates of population growth. Now, I have a new situation: Archaeologists studied data about human settlements. One was 100,000 years old called village R, and the other one was about 9,000 years old called village N. The older settlement was located in Africa, the other one wasn't. Answer this question please: Which village had more people that were hunters? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, it is likely that Village R had more people who were hunters as compared to Village N. The rationale behind this assertion stems from two primary factors: the timeline of human evolution and the geographical location of the settlements. 1. Timeline of human evolution: Village R, being 100,000 years old, was situated during a time when early humans were predominantly nomadic hunters and gatherers. This lifestyle required them to rely heavily on hunting for sustenance as agriculture had not yet been developed. On the other hand, Village N, being approximately 9,000 years old, existed during a time when human societies had begun transitioning to more sedentary, agriculture-based lifestyles. As a result, the reliance on hunting as a primary means of survival might have been decreasing in Village N. 2. Geographical location: Village R, which was located in Africa, was situated within the continent where human evolution first began. This implies that the residents of Village R would have been in closer proximity to their hunter-gatherer roots, and thus more likely to depend on hunting for survival. In contrast, Village N, located outside of Africa, would have been part of human settlements that had begun spreading to other regions worldwide. These settlers may have brought with them new ways of living and diversified subsistence strategies, such as agriculture and animal domestication, which could have reduced the need for hunting. In conclusion, based on the given information about the timelines and locations of the settlements, it is reasonable to presume that Village R had a higher number of people who were hunters as compared to Village N. However, it is essential to consider that the presented information is limited, which may impact the accuracy of this analysis. To form a more reliable and accurate understanding, it would be beneficial to perform a detailed study of archaeological findings and evidence from each village to determine their primary means of obtaining sustenance."},{"instruction":"Available to students under 25 years of age.

Question: suppose a time of heavy daily rain happens, how will it affect fish will die faster. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"More Effect. To understand the impact of heavy daily rain on the acid rain process and its subsequent effects on fish and soils in trees, let us first break down the process mentioned. 1. Acid rain enters the atmosphere and lands: Acid rain is caused when pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are released into the atmosphere from activities such as burning fossil fuels and industrial processes. These pollutants combine with water vapor and other atmospheric elements to form acidic compounds like sulfuric acid and nitric acid. 2. Makes water acidic: When these acidic compounds fall to the ground with precipitation, they lower the pH of surface waters, such as lakes, rivers, and streams. This causes the water to become more acidic. 3. Kills fish: As the pH of the water decreases, certain fish species begin to struggle to adapt to the changing environment. They may suffer from physiological stress or even die off, as their gills and other organs can be damaged by the acidity. Furthermore, the increase in acidity can lead to the release of toxic substances, such as aluminum, which can be lethal to fish. 4. Kills the soils in trees: Acid rain has a significant effect on soil chemistry as well. When it seeps into the soil, it removes essential nutrients such as calcium and magnesium and replaces them with hydrogen ions. This makes the soil more acidic and reduces its ability to support plant growth. As a result, trees may become weak and vulnerable to stress, disease, and pests. 5. Leaves are also harmed: The effect of acid rain on leaves is related to the damage done to the soil by acid rain. Nutrient deficiencies will affect the tree's ability to produce healthy leaves, which can then make the tree more susceptible to stressors such as harsh weather, disease, or pests. Now, if we introduce heavy daily rain into this scenario, it will have the following effects: 1. Increased acid rain deposition: With more rain, there is an increased probability of acid rain being deposited onto water bodies and soil. This could lead to a faster accumulation of acidic compounds in these environments. 2. Quicker change in water acidity: Heavy daily rain will make water bodies become acidic more quickly, as it introduces a higher concentration of acidic compounds in a shorter period. Greater volumes of acidic water will pose a higher risk to fish populations. 3. Accelerated impact on fish: As the water bodies become more acidic at a faster rate, fish mortality rates may also increase. As the pH levels drop, there will be less time for fish to adapt or seek out less acidic environments. Consequently, fish populations will experience increased stress and will likely die off more rapidly. 4. Perturbation influence on soil: Heavy daily rain will also result in more significant soil acidification, which will further damage tree health. Soil nutrient depletion will happen more quickly, thus affecting tree growth and resilience. In conclusion, heavy daily rain has a more significant effect on the second outcome mentioned in the initial process - fish death - as well as on the other outcomes, such as soil acidification. Therefore, the supposed perturbation will have a more detrimental impact on the entire ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - Alicia Augello Cook (born January 25, 1981), known by her stage name Alicia Keys, is an American singer, songwriter, pianist and actress.

Solution 1: Using fabric glue 1. Choose the appropriate fabric glue for felt and the sweatshirt material. Look for a glue that is designed for use on fabric, is suitable for adhering felt material, and dries clear. 2. Lay out the sweatshirt on a flat surface and smooth any wrinkles. 3. Measure and cut out the white felt pieces according to your Totoro costume design. 4. Apply the fabric glue on the back side of the felt pieces, making sure to cover corners and edges. 5. Carefully position the glued felt pieces on the sweatshirt, matching the design layout. 6. Press the glued felt pieces onto the sweatshirt for a few seconds to ensure a strong bond. 7. Allow the fabric glue to dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions. Solution 2: Using fusible web 1. Choose a suitable fusible web for the felt and sweatshirt material. Ensure it is designed for attaching fabric and can be used with an iron. 2. Lay out the sweatshirt on a flat surface and smooth any wrinkles. 3. Measure and cut out the white felt pieces according to your Totoro costume design. 4. Trace the felt shapes onto the fusible web and cut them out. 5. Follow the fusible web manufacturer's instructions for ironing the web onto the back of the felt pieces. Usually, this involves placing the web's adhesive side on the felt and then applying heat with an iron. 6. Peel off the fusible web backing from the felt pieces, exposing the adhesive. 7. Carefully position the felt pieces on the sweatshirt with the adhesive side down, matching the design layout. 8. Following the fusible web instructions for applying heat, iron the felt pieces onto the sweatshirt. Comparison: Fabric glue is more accessible, easier to use, and can be quicker, but it may not be as durable or effective as fusible web. It might also leave visible residues on your fabric. Fusible web, on the other hand, provides a stronger bond between the felt and the sweatshirt, with little to no residue. Conclusion: Considering the goal is to apply white felt to a sweatshirt without seams for making a Totoro costume, the better solution would be using fusible web. Although it requires some extra steps and equipment (e.g., iron and ironing board), the bond between the felt and sweatshirt is stronger and cleaner. This should result in a visually appealing and durable Totoro costume."},{"instruction":"Teacher:Categorize the comment on the basis of severe toxicity.

City were dominant and two clinical counter-attacks led to Kelechi Iheanacho and Raheem Sterling tap-ins. Ilkay Gundogan calmly slotted in a fourth but City had Nolito sent off late on for an attempted head-butt. The Spaniard was involved in a clash with Adam Smith and, while any contact with his head looked slight, referee Jon Moss had little option but to dismiss the winger. Relive Manchester City's win over Bournemouth Follow action and reaction to Saturday's games City's passing and movement was a joy to watch and the influential De Bruyne was at the heart of their play. The Belgian midfielder, who scored in the win over against Manchester United last week, played behind main striker Iheanacho and caused Bournemouth all sorts of problems as he was involved in all his side's goals before going off to a standing ovation. De Bruyne's absence for two months last season was a huge setback for City as they dropped from second to fourth in the Premier League, and from three points behind leaders Leicester to 15. The 25-year-old's intelligence, running with the ball and vision made him a constant threat and his link-up play with Sterling, Nolito and Iheanacho left Bournemouth bemused. \\"The performance from Kevin was terrific, amazing,\\" said City boss Pep Guardiola. \\"He is on another level. He is a fantastic player and helps us a lot.\\" Sterling did score a hat-trick against the Cherries at the Etihad last season but, for most of the campaign, was a subdued presence following his £49m move from Liverpool. However, the 21-year-old appears to be back to his livewire best as he closely pushed De Bruyne in the man of the match stakes. The dribbling skills and pace that make him such a threat were impressively on show against Bournemouth and he has clearly benefited from the arrival of Guardiola. The City boss phoned Sterling during the summer before officially taking over to tell the winger he was a big part of his plans, and the Spaniard looks to have restored his confidence. Apart from his goal, and his assist for Iheanacho, Sterling also went close when he dispossessed Charlie Daniels on the right flank, producing a mesmerising run across the Cherries box - past a host of defenders - before seeing his shot hit the post. Overall, Sterling has now had a hand in eight goals in his seven appearances for Manchester City this season, scoring three and assisting five. Like his team, Wilshere looked out of his depth on a chastening afternoon for both as he made his first start of the season following his loan move from Arsenal. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe replaced striker Callum Wilson, who scored the winner against West Brom last week, with the England man to reinforce his midfield, but the move did not pay off. Wilshere clumsily shoved Nolito off the ball to concede the free-kick from which City scored their opener and the 24-year-old struggled to have an impact on the game. The visitors were also guilty of giving the ball away too cheaply and, although Josh King's pace did cause City some moments of concern, they rarely had the ball long enough to use that as a weapon. Bournemouth, who saw Wilson's shot hit the crossbar, had 35.7% possession in the match. \\"It was difficult for Jack in the first half, because he's at his best when he has the ball, and we didn't have too much of it,\\" said Howe. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \\"Our high pressing was not perfect today - we had problems with controlling the Bournemouth build-up, but we created a lot of counter-attacks. On the sending off of Nolito: \\"The referee took a decision and we have to accept that.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \\"It was a tough day. Manchester City were excellent. The nature of the first two goals against us was disappointing. \\"They're a very impressive team. When you play against the best, your learning is accelerated.

Article: Getting enough sleep on a regular basis is one important way to protect the health of your heart. Poor sleep is associated with a range of cardiovascular problems, including high blood pressure, heart attack, and heart failure. Both men and women are at increased risk for these conditions. But we continue to learn that when it comes to health problems associated with sleep, the particular risks to men and women are not always the same. A new study suggests that for women who already have heart disease, poor sleep may be particularly dangerous to their heart health. Research indicates that poor-quality sleep--and waking too early in particular--is associated with increased inflammation among women with heart disease. There was no similar association found for men, suggesting that women with heart disease and sleep problems may be at particular risk for inflammation that can be damaging to the heart. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco investigated the relationship between sleep quality and inflammation linked to coronary heart disease. They also sought information about how an association between sleep and inflammation might differ between men and women. Their investigation included 980 men and women at first, and 626 completed the 5-year study. All of those included were suffering for coronary heart disease. The average age of men in the study was 66. Women were slightly younger, with an average age of 64. Researchers measured sleep quality by asking participants to rate their sleep over the previous month. They also asked for reports of some of the most common sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking frequently throughout the night, and waking too early in the morning. After 5 years, researchers repeated tests for inflammation and once again sought reports on sleep quality and sleep problems. When they analyzed data for both men and women together, researchers found no links between inflammations and sleep quality. However, when they...

The prudish Angela did not like hanging out with the uninhibited Lindsey , as","output":"she felt particularly uncomfortable around people who had no inhibitions about expressing their feelings and desires, especially since her conservative upbringing had ingrained in her the idea that certain topics and behaviors should be kept private. Nevertheless, fate had other plans. Unbeknownst to them, the two girls were about to go on an unforgettable adventure that would forever change the dynamics of their relationship. It all began one sunny afternoon, when Angela reluctantly agreed to accompany Lindsey to a new, mysterious attraction that had just opened in their small town. The attraction, known as \\"The Enchanted Maze,\\" promised visitors an experience unlike any other - one full of magic, wonder, and excitement. Curiosity piqued despite her reservations, Angela found herself drawn to the idea of exploring a magical world. As they entered the maze, there was an instant feeling that something magical was indeed afoot – the air crackled with energy, the towering hedges seemed almost alive, and every step they took felt like they were being transported to another realm. As they ventured deeper into the maze, they stumbled upon a small, enchanted potion room tucked away in a hidden corner. The room was filled with delicate glass bottles containing various shimmering liquids that emitted a soft, ethereal glow. A peculiar-looking creature, who introduced himself as Mortimer the alchemist, stood guard over the potion collection. He explained that each potion had the ability to grant unique powers, but only for a limited period of time. Intrigued, Lindsey impulsively grabbed a random bottle and uncorked it, taking a swig before Angela could caution her against it. Suddenly, Lindsey began to feel strange. Her usual carefree attitude was replaced with a deep and intense feeling of vulnerability. She realized she had become an open book, unable to hide how she felt or what she truly wanted from Angela. Angela, intrigued by the sudden change in Lindsey's demeanor, decided to drink a potion as well. The potion turned her braver, bolder, and made her lose her inhibitions. This sudden shift in their personalities created an unanticipated openness in their communication. Lindsey admitted that she admired Angela's strength of character and her commitment to her values. Angela, in turn, expressed her secret desire to be able to express herself more freely without always worrying about societal expectations. During their time in the maze, they encountered magical creatures, bizarre situations, and challenges that forced them to work together and rely on each other's strengths. Lindsey's newfound vulnerability allowed Angela to see the depth of her character and understand her better. Likewise, Angela's invigorated sense of bravery helped her to let go of some of her ingrained fears and judgments. As they navigated their way through the maze, both of them began to appreciate the unique qualities that each one brought to their friendship. They realized that their differences were not necessarily a source of discomfort, but, rather, complementary. As the effects of the potions began to fade, Angela and Lindsey found their way out of the maze, forever transformed by their shared magical experience. From that day on, they embraced their differences and grew closer as friends. The prudish Angela learned to be more open and understanding of the uninhibited Lindsey, and Lindsey discovered the value of Angela's stability and morals. The Enchanted Maze not only provided them with a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, but also taught them the importance of recognizing, accepting, and celebrating the unique characteristics that make up a true friendship. The girls' initially incompatible personalities, as it turned out, contributed to a powerful bond that surpassed their initial expectations. In the end, they were grateful for the experiences they shared, which led them to grow as individuals and strengthen their friendship beyond measure. It was an adventure that they would forever carry in their hearts, a magical escapade that defied logic and reason, but, ultimately, embraced the intricacies and complexities that make us human."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. and the situation: Uncle Tom and uncle Sam both have high cholesterol. Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and uncle Sam is not. Answer the following question: Which uncle doesn't take an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis? Answer:","output":"Uncle Sam is the one who doesn't take an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. As mentioned in the background, statin drugs are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. These drugs help to decrease blood cholesterol levels by inducing the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver, subsequently stimulating the catabolism of plasma LDL and removing cholesterol from plasma. This process reduces the risk of atherosclerosis, a major cause of heart disease. Uncle Tom is already taking statin drugs to manage his high cholesterol levels, which means he is utilizing the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to regulate cholesterol biosynthesis in his body. On the other hand, Uncle Sam is not taking statin drugs for his high cholesterol, and thus he is not taking an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. It's important to note that individuals may have different responses to statin drugs due to genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms. Pharmacogenomics, the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, could potentially help identify the most effective statin for each individual based on these genetic differences. Therefore, the effectiveness and response to statins can vary among individuals, but in this specific situation, it is clear that Uncle Sam is not taking an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis."},{"instruction":"\\"All We Ever Knew\\" is a song written and recorded by American folk band The Head and the Heart, released as the lead single for their third studio album \\"Signs of Light\\" by Warner Bros.

Options： A. pantry B. exhaust pipe C. vegetable soup D. pot E. shopping bags The answer to this question is:","output":"B. exhaust pipe Placing a potato in an exhaust pipe can potentially cause an explosion. While it might seem like an unlikely situation, this scenario has the greatest potential for ill effects among the given options. Allow me to provide some reasoning behind this choice as well as an explanation about why the other options are not ideal for causing an explosion. A. Pantry: Storing a potato in a pantry should not lead to any explosions. Potatoes are commonly kept in pantries, as they are a regular food staple in many households. As long as they are stored in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated area, there should be no problems. C. Vegetable Soup: Adding a potato to vegetable soup would not cause an explosion either. As potatoes are a regular ingredient in many types of soup, adding them to vegetable soup should only enhance the flavor and texture without any adverse effects. D. Pot: Boiling a potato in a pot of water does not result in an explosion. Though it is true that a potato can explode if heated without any incisions to release steam build-up, when properly prepared (such as poking holes) and cooked in a pot, the likelihood of an explosion is minimal to none. E. Shopping Bags: While keeping a potato in shopping bags could lead to the potato becoming damaged, it would not cause an explosion. It is common for people to transport potatoes in shopping bags when bringing them home from the grocery store. As for the chosen answer, B. Exhaust Pipe: Technically, when a potato is lodged in an exhaust pipe, it obstructs the flow of exhaust gases from the vehicle's engine. These backlogged gases produce increased pressure within the exhaust system, potentially resulting in an explosion or other types of damage to the vehicle.

As social workers, educators, and policymakers struggle to identify the root causes and implement necessary reforms, an independent review has been launched to examine the underlying reasons for this phenomenon. The review aims to shed light on why so many youths, who should be receiving support and care from the state, ultimately end up in the criminal justice system. The Importance of Understanding the Issue It is crucial to understand the factors involved in the link between children in care and their eventual involvement in criminal activities. Identifying and addressing these factors can help reduce the number of youths entering the criminal justice system and ensure that they receive the support they need to lead productive lives. The independent review will assess the mechanisms currently in place for children in care, such as foster care, residential care, and adoption services, to determine whether these strategies effectively prevent young people from turning to crime. Furthermore, the review will explore the effectiveness of current intervention and support strategies aimed at tackling the root causes of criminal behavior among these youths. Factors Contributing to the Problem Several factors potentially contribute to the increased risk of youths in care becoming involved in criminal activities. Some of these factors may include: 1. Trauma and mental health: Many children in care have experienced traumatic events that can lead to emotional and mental health challenges. These challenges may make them more vulnerable to involvement in crime. 2. Lack of stability: Frequent changes in living arrangements and support systems can disrupt a child's ability to form healthy relationships and develop stable routines. In turn, this lack of stability can lead to behavioral issues and an increased likelihood of criminal activity. 3. Limited support and resources: Many children in care lack the necessary support from social workers, educators, and other professionals who could help them overcome their challenges. The overall lack of resources and personalized support may exacerbate their problems. Review Process and Anticipated Outcomes The independent review team will comprise experts from a wide range of fields, including social work, psychology, education, and criminal justice. They will gather data through various sources, such as interviews, surveys, and case studies, to better understand the issue and formulate recommendations for improvement. The anticipated outcomes of this review include: 1. Identifying key areas of improvement: The review will pinpoint the gaps in the current care system and develop a clear understanding of which aspects should be improved to better support youths in care. 2. Formulating recommendations: Based on the findings, the review team will outline specific recommendations, including policy changes, funding priorities, and improvements in care practices, to help reduce the likelihood of children in care becoming involved in criminal activities. Conclusion As a society, it is our responsibility to ensure that all children are provided a safe, nurturing environment to grow and thrive. The independent review is a crucial step towards understanding the complex interplay between the care system and youth involvement in criminal activities. By identifying shortcomings and designing targeted interventions, we ultimately aim to break the cycle that leads so many youths in care to the criminal justice system."},{"instruction":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

In suburban Seattle, John rents a large, old and eerie Victorian-era mansion and begins piecing his life back together. However, John soon discovers that he has unexpected and unwelcome company in his new home: the unhappy ghost of a murdered young boy. The ghost makes its presence felt by various phenomena such as shattering windows, abruptly opening and shutting doors, and manifesting itself dramatically during a seance. John investigates the identity of the dead child and finds that the mystery is linked to a powerful local family, the heir of which is a wealthy United States senator, Joseph Carmichael. John subsequently discovers that the real Joseph Carmichael (who was born in 1900) was murdered in 1906 by his father, Richard. Joseph was a crippled, sickly child, and in the event of his death before his 21st birthday, the family fortune (which in 1905, he inherited from his late maternal grandfather) would pass to charity. Desperate to keep control of the fortune, Joseph's father drowned young Joseph in the bathtub, secretly replaced him with a healthy orphan, and took the orphan to Europe in the guise of seeking a treatment or cure.

Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you’re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good. YOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS You really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat! I WANT TO BREAK FREE!! The only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now. Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table. Have any of them given you permanent weight loss? What happens after you break free from the diet cycle? A. not enough information B. You burn more fat C. You no longer believe the unhealthy diet stories and body images you tell yourself D. You continue to carve to be thin","output":"C. You no longer believe the unhealthy diet stories and body images you tell yourself Breaking free from the diet cycle mentality involves changing your mindset and rejecting the common myths and misconceptions that are often associated with dieting and weight loss. By understanding that there is no \\"magic cure\\" or \\"one last diet\\" that guarantees permanent weight loss, you can start to focus on developing a healthier relationship with food and exercise. This involves listening to your body's hunger signals, eating mindfully, and engaging in physical activities you genuinely enjoy, rather than obsessing over calorie intake and workout routines. Once you break free from the diet cycle, you will no longer be trapped in the constant loop of losing and regaining weight, and will instead be able to create long-term, sustainable habits that promote a healthier lifestyle. This shift in mindset can help improve your overall mental and emotional well-being, while also contributing to a more stable and positive body image."},{"instruction":"U2 has been a familiar sight to iTunes Music Store visitors in recent weeks, with the online music store featuring everything from a U2-themed iPod to a digital boxed set of the Irish rock band #39;s recordings.

It highlights various U2-related products that were made available on the platform to attract the attention of visitors and fans of the band.

How do you deal with Internet trolls? What is the best way to deal with an Internet troll?","output":"Though the following two questions appear similar, they are not exactly the same. They share the subject of dealing with internet trolls, but the nuances in their construction impact the types of answers they elicit. Let's break down the differences between the two questions: Question 1: \\"How do you deal with Internet trolls?\\" This question is framed as a personal inquiry, asking for the individual's perspective or experience in handling internet trolls in their online interactions. The response you might receive from this question could vary greatly as it seeks opinions or anecdotes from the person being queried. Question 2: \\"What is the best way to deal with an Internet troll?\\" This question aims at establishing more of a universal and objective framework for addressing internet trolls. The emphasis on \\"the best way\\" implies that the response should provide well-accepted, proven methodologies, or strategies that have been commonly agreed upon as effective in combating trolls. Now let's delve deeper into each question with a detailed answer that considers their different scopes. Answer 1: \\"How do you deal with Internet trolls?\\" As an AI assistant, I am not a human being with personal experiences. Therefore, I'll provide an example of how someone might answer this question based on their individual approach. \\"When I encounter internet trolls, I tend to follow these steps: 1. Ignore them: I don't engage in any form of communication with the trolls. By not responding, I avoid giving them the attention they often crave. 2. Block or report: When possible, I'll block or report the troll's account to limit their ability to interact with me or my content further. 3. Stay positive and maintain perspective: I remind myself that their comments are not personal attacks on me but rather a reflection of their own behavior and insecurities. 4. Keep my information safe: I try to avoid sharing personal details on public forums that trolls could potentially use to harm my reputation or well-being. 5. Support others or seek support: If it becomes overwhelming, I reach out to my friends and online community to share my experience. A strong support system helps me persevere and navigate such situations.\\" Answer 2: \\"What is the best way to deal with an Internet troll?\\" There's no one-size-fits-all solution, but there are several best practices to effectively deal with internet trolls: 1. Do not engage: Refrain from responding to their provocative comments or messages. Trolls thrive on attention, so choosing not to engage in a dialogue can often be the most efficient way to discourage their behavior. 2. Maintain a civil discourse: If you decide to respond, do so in a calm and respectful manner. Displaying emotional reactions or aggressive language can further fuel the troll's actions. 3. Understand the context: Sometimes, seemingly hostile comments may just stem from misunderstandings or miscommunication. Before labeling someone as a troll, try to consider the context and clarify things if necessary. 4. Block or mute: Utilize the block or mute functions on social media platforms and other websites to cease seeing content from trolls or to prevent them from directly interacting with you. 5. Report problematic behavior: Many online platforms have reporting systems in place to handle abusive behavior. Report instances of harassment or threats to the moderators or administrators for appropriate action. 6. Strengthen your online security: Ensure your personal information and privacy settings are safeguarded to minimize the risk of trolls gaining access to sensitive data. 7. Create a positive environment: Encourage open, constructive conversations on your online forums and social media channels. Setting clear guidelines and moderating discussions can help prevent trolling and create a more positive online experience for everyone. 8. Seek support or offer help: It's essential to remember that you're not alone in dealing with internet trolls. Reach out to friends, family, or online communities for support, advice, or shared experiences. Offer help to others going through similar situations and foster a supportive environment. In summary, while the two questions deal with the same subject—internet trolls—the first question seeks the individual's perspective, while the second aims to identify universal and proven methodologies. The answers provided took into account these nuances and offered tailored information for each question."},{"instruction":"How do you do this: get pet home","output":"Getting a new pet and bringing it home may sound quite exciting, but there are several factors to consider and steps to follow in order to ensure a smooth transition for both you and your new companion. Here is a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to get a pet and bring them home: 1. Research and choose the right pet: Before making any decisions, conduct thorough research on what kind of pet would be suitable for you and your living situation. Take into consideration factors like size, exercise needs, temperament, grooming requirements, health issues, and compatibility with children and other pets. It is important to choose a pet that aligns well with your personality, lifestyle, and living arrangements. 2. Prepare your home: Before bringing your new pet home, make sure your living space is safe and pet-friendly. This might include: - Removing potential hazards (sharp objects, toxic plants, harmful chemicals). - Setting up a designated pet area with a comfortable bed, food and water dishes, toys, and a litter box or potty area for dogs. - Installing baby gates or other barriers to keep your pet contained in specific areas or away from dangers. - Investing in pet-proofing items like cord covers, pet-safe furniture fabric, and non-slip mats. 3. Find a reputable source: Once you have chosen the ideal pet for you, find a reputable source to obtain your pet from. This might be a responsible breeder, a shelter, or a rescue organization. Make sure to research the organization or breeder thoroughly and confirm that they follow ethical breeding and adoption practices. 4. Meet and interact with your potential pet: Spend time interacting with the pet before finalizing the adoption or purchase. Observe their temperament and behavior to ensure they are a good fit for you and your household. 5. Gather the necessary supplies: Before bringing your pet home, get everything you need for their care. This includes food, grooming supplies, toys, a collar or harness, a leash, and any required medication or supplements. 6. Schedule a veterinary appointment: Set up an initial appointment with a veterinarian to get your new pet examined and to discuss vaccination schedules, spaying/neutering, microchipping, and preventive care. 7. Arrange transport: Plan how you'll transport your new pet to your home. For smaller pets or short distances, a pet carrier might suffice. For larger pets or longer distances, consider hiring a pet transport service to ensure a stress-free and safe journey. 8. Bring your pet home: On the day you pick up your pet, bring along a familiar item, such as a blanket or a toy from their previous place, to help comfort them during the transition. 9. Introduce your pet to their new environment: Once you arrive home, show your pet their designated area and give them a tour of their new surroundings. Offer them water, food, and an opportunity to use the bathroom. Be patient and give your pet time to adjust to their new environment. 10. Gradual introductions: If you have other pets or family members, introduce them to your new pet slowly and supervise the interactions to avoid any potential conflicts. Keep in mind that some pets may take more time to adjust and acclimate to their new environment and companions. 11. Establish routines: Help your new pet settle in by establishing consistent routines for feeding, exercise, playtime, and sleep. 12. Training and socialization: Begin to work on basic training and socialization to ensure your pet becomes a well-mannered and well-adjusted member of your family. Maintaining a supportive, nurturing, and patient environment will help your pet feel at ease and secure in their new home. Adjusting to a new home can take time, so be ready to provide plenty of love and care as your pet grows and thrives in their new surroundings."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"Was Origin published in Spanish or Polish first?\\" Context: \\"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878.

Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol. Who is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight? Answer:","output":"Ronaldo is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight because he follows a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol, while Jeff consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol.

Question: suppose the rock is in a cold climate where freezing weather is common happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER weathering occurring. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"In a cold climate where freezing weather is common, weathering will predominantly occur through a process known as \\"freeze-thaw\\" or \\"frost-wedging.\\" This particular type of weathering is caused by the expansion of water when it freezes into ice within the cracks in rocks. As the temperature fluctuates and water repeatedly freezes and thaws, the pressure caused by the expansion of ice forces the rock to break apart into smaller pieces. Given that freezing weather is common in these cold climates, it would be reasonable to deduce that weathering will occur at a faster rate than in areas with relatively stable temperatures. This is because the repeated cycles of freezing and thawing allow for more opportunities for the expansion of water and subsequent breaking apart of rocks. Consequently, the answer to the question of how this cold climate will affect the rate of weathering would be option A: more. The high frequency of freezing weather conditions in this region will lead to increased instances of freeze-thaw cycles, thereby accelerating the weathering process and causing rocks in these cold environments to break down more quickly than they would in climates with more stable temperatures."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Persian.

Cheryl talks her friend Kathy into going with her and they skip class to go see the film. At the crowded theater, they meet two preppy college boys, George and Ken, who take an immediate liking to the girls and help them get a can of cola out of the vending machine.

There are many people from all walks of life in the audience; a blind man and his guide daughter; an elderly married couple; a boyfriend and girlfriend; and a pimp named Tony along with his two prostitutes, who look at the theater's display props in the foyer. One of the prostitutes, Rosemary, scratches her face with a bizarre display mask before they go in to watch the film.

In a White House statement on Obama's telephone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Obama took his most direct position yet on the escalating violence in Libya. \\"The president stated that when a leader's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people, he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving now,\\" it said. Obama's stance comes after he signed an executive order Friday freezing assets held by Qaddafi and four of his children in the United States. The Treasury Department said the sanctions against Qaddafi, three of his sons and a daughter also apply to the Libyan government. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced further sanctions Saturday, revoking visas for senior Libyan officials and their immediate family members. She said future applications from those blacklisted for travel to the United States would be rejected. Qaddafi \\"should go without further bloodshed and violence,\\" Clinton said in a separate statement. Obama has been conferring with world leaders about the unrest in Libya. The administration is hoping that the world speaks with a single voice against Qaddafi's violent crackdown on protesters, and Obama is sending Clinton to Geneva on Sunday to coordinate with foreign policy chiefs from several countries. The U.N. Security Council met urgently Saturday and voted unanimously to impose new sanctions against Libya. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon wants immediate action to protect Libyan civilians. The U.N. chief was due in Washington on Monday for talks with Obama at the White House. The administration had been facing increasing pressure to more forcefully condemn Qaddafi and explicitly call for his ouster, as French President Nicolas Sarkozy has done. Witnesses in Libya said Qaddafi is arming civilian supporters to set up checkpoints and roving patrols in Tripoli, the capital. The U.S. held back, but its tone shifted sharply on Friday after Americans in Libya were evacuated to safety by ferry and a chartered airplane. Shortly after, Obama signed an executive order outlining financial penalties designed to pressure Qaddafi's government into halting the violence. The order said that the instability in Libya constituted an \\"unusual and extraordinary threat\\" to U.S. national security and foreign policy. A nonviolent revolt against Qaddafi's government began Feb. 15 amid a wave of uprisings in the Arab world. Most of Libya's eastern half is under the control of rebels. Witnesses say Qaddafi's government has responded by shooting at protesters in numerous cities. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Space utilization: Corners are often underutilized spaces in a room. By placing the floor lamp in a corner, James can make better use of the available space and avoid cluttering other areas. 2. Light distribution: Floor lamps generally emit light in an upwards and outwards direction. Placing the lamp in a corner will allow the light to bounce off the walls, creating a more even and visually pleasing dispersion of light throughout the room. 3. Aesthetic appeal: A floor lamp in a corner can serve as a decorative piece and help fill an otherwise empty space, providing visual balance in the room's interior design. 4. Safety: Placing a floor lamp in a corner, particularly if it is tall and potentially top-heavy, can reduce the risk of the lamp being accidentally knocked over, as it is less likely to be in a high-traffic area. 5. Minimizing Obstruction: Putting the floor lamp in a corner reduces the likelihood of it obstructing pathways or taking up valuable floor space in the middle of the room.

Article: \\"Does my smile look big in this?\\" Future fitting-room mirrors in clothing stores could subtly adjust your reflection to make you look - and hence feel - happier, encouraging you to like what you see. That's the idea behind the Emotion Evoking System developed by Shigeo Yoshida and colleagues at the University of Tokyo in Japan. The system can manipulate, or in other word, control your emotions and personal preferences by presenting you with an image of your own smiling or frowning face. The principle that physiological changes can drive emotional ones - that laughter comes before happiness, rather than the other way around - is a well-established idea. The researchers wanted to see if this idea could be used to build a computer system that manipulates how you feel. The system works by presenting the user with a web-camera image of his or her face - as if they were looking in a mirror. The image is then subtly altered with software, turning the corners of the mouth up or down and changing the area around the eyes, so that the person appears to smile or frown . Without telling them the aim of the study, the team recruited 21 volunteers and asked them to sit in front of the screen while performing an unrelated task. When the task was complete the participants rated how they felt. When the faces on screen appeared to smile, people reported that they felt happier. On the other hand, when the image was given a sad expression, they reported feeling less happy. Yoshida and his colleagues tested whether manipulating the volunteers' emotional state would influence their preferences. Each person was given a scarf to wear and again presented with the altered webcam image. The volunteers that saw themselves smiling while wearing the scarf were more likely to report that they liked it, and those that saw themselves not smiling were less likely. The system could be used to manipulate consumers' impressions of products, say the researchers. For example, mirrors in clothing-store fitting rooms could be replaced with... Question: What's the main purpose of the Emotion Evoking System? - To see whether one's feeling can be unconsciously affected. - To see whether one's facial expressions can be altered. - To see whether laughter comes before happiness. - To replace the mirrors in future clothing-store fitting rooms.

An early pioneer of fifties rock and roll, he is most popularly known for his work in the 1960s and 1970s with his then-wife Tina Turner in the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. Hypothesis: The state of current rock and roll is due in part to Ike Turner.","output":"In order to evaluate the hypothesis that the current state of rock and roll is due, in part, to Ike Turner, it is important to consider his contributions to the genre and analyze the impact of these contributions in the years that followed. Ike Turner was an influential musician during the 1950s, a time when rock and roll was still in its early stages. As a bandleader, songwriter, arranger, talent scout, and record producer, Turner played a significant role in shaping the sound of early rock and roll. One of his key contributions during this period was his role in the production of \\"Rocket 88\\" - a song considered by many to be one of the first rock and roll songs ever recorded. Turner's work in the 1960s and 1970s, when he gained more widespread popularity working with his then-wife Tina Turner in the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, further helped to solidify the foundations of rock and roll. The duo's energetic and powerful performances, coupled with their soulful and bluesy sound, laid the groundwork for many artists that came after them. However, it is also essential to acknowledge that rock and roll has evolved significantly since the time of Ike Turner, influenced by numerous artists and bands who have brought their own innovations to the genre. For example, artists like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and many others also played key roles in defining the sound of rock and roll throughout the years. That being said, Ike Turner's influence as a pioneering figure in rock and roll cannot be underestimated, as he helped to set the standard for numerous genres such as rhythm and blues, funk, and even soul music. His contributions, especially in the early days of rock, provided an essential foundation for the genre to grow and evolve. In conclusion, it is reasonable to state that the current state of rock and roll is due, in part, to Ike Turner. His early pioneering work in the 1950s, as well as his continued contributions through the 1960s and 1970s with the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, has left a lasting impact on the genre. However, it is also important to recognize that rock and roll has been shaped by countless other artists and bands over the years, and that Ike Turner's contributions represent just one facet of the genre's rich history."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the first name of Sir Terence Aubrey Murray's wife? The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"Let's analyze the given information step by step and assign variables accordingly: 1. There are 8 parrots. We denote this as P = 8. 2. There are 3 times the number of snakes than parrots. Therefore, the number of snakes, S = 3 * P. 3. There are 2 times the number of monkeys than snakes. Therefore, the number of monkeys, M = 2 * S. 4. The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, E = (P + S) / 2. 5. There are 3 fewer zebras than elephants, Z = E - 3. Now, we'll plug in the relevant values and solve for each variable one step at a time: 1. P = 8 (already given) 2. S = 3 * P = 3 * 8 = 24 snakes 3. M = 2 * S = 2 * 24 = 48 monkeys 4. E = (P + S) / 2 = (8 + 24) / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16 elephants 5. Z = E - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 zebras Now that we have the number of zebras and monkeys, we can find the difference between them: Difference = Monkeys - Zebras Difference = 48 monkeys - 13 zebras Difference = 35 So, there is a difference of 35 between the zebras and monkeys in the zoo.

Though the hummingbird is no bigger than a bee and weighs only 2 to 3 grams, it can fly as fast as 50 meters in a second. It can fly forwards as most birds do, and it can fly backwards as well. The strangest thing about it, however, is that it can stay still in the air, just like a _ . Whenever a hummingbird needs food, it will fly slowly towards a flower. It won't stand on the flower, as bees do, but just hangs to the flower and then begins to sunk the honey from inside the flower with its needle-like beak.

Given the context: How would you describe Cameron? A:","output":"Given the context, Cameron can be described as someone who picks the winning team, or in this case, the team they perceive to be more appealing based on their appearance. Cameron might not have a strong understanding of the game or the actual skill level of the players involved but has rather chosen to support the team that appears more attractive or well-presented. Their decision could be influenced by factors such as team colors, uniforms, or even the attractiveness of the players. This kind of behavior may reveal a few things about Cameron's personality and preferences. First, it can suggest that Cameron is more concerned with aesthetics and appearance when choosing which team to support, rather than the actual ability or skill of the players on the field. This may mean that Cameron is drawn to things that visually appeal to them, rather than relying on data or statistics while making a decision. Second, the fact that Cameron took sides with the better-looking team may indicate that they are swayed by popular opinions or want to fit in with what they believe the majority would find attractive. Cameron might be impressionable, seeking to conform to what's commonly perceived as popular or successful. Lastly, Cameron's choice could also hint at an inherent optimism or confidence in their judgment. They might assume that a better-looking team is more likely to succeed, showing an inclination towards associating external appearances with internal qualities or capabilities. This can be viewed as a form of the \\"halo effect,\\" which is a cognitive bias where our overall impression of a person or group influences how we feel and think about their character or abilities. In summary, based on the context, Cameron can be described as someone who picks the winning team while paying more attention to appearance and aesthetics. They might conform to popular opinions and demonstrate a belief that a better-looking team has a higher chance of success."},{"instruction":"They escort him to the cafeteria for breakfast , and do not allow him out again until lunch time , when Harley had the most unfortunate opportunity to run into the very man she 'd been avoiding for three long days . \\" Now , I ' m really beginning to think you do n't like me . \\" It was amazing how a man with so recognizable a face could so easily blend into the crowd .

This change had left him slightly uneasy, as he had always relied on his trusty personalized helmet to give him a sense of comfort and confidence on the field. Step 1: The athlete needs to adjust his mindset about the helmet situation Justification: It's important for him to remain positive and focus on his performance rather than stressing about external factors beyond his control. The athlete spent time each day during his training sessions consciously working on his mindset, reminding himself that his skills and abilities mattered far more than the specific helmet he wore. He also reminded himself that all his rivals were in the same situation, giving him no relative disadvantage. Slowly but surely, his anxiety about the change in rules began to fade away. Step 2: Focus on improving physical performance Justification: As his mindset improves, now is the time to ensure his training and physical preparedness is at its peak. The athlete began to train more vigorously, pushing himself to improve his speed, endurance, and agility. The thought of succeeding at the final competition without his personal helmet energized him and acted as a driving force to perfect his skills. He sought advice from his coach, analyzed his past performances, and made necessary adjustments to his training regimen. Step 3: Familiarize himself with the new helmet Justification: This will help him feel more comfortable and adapt to the change, ultimately minimizing its impact on his performance. Once the organizers revealed the new helmets they'd be providing, the athlete made sure to get his hands on one as soon as possible. He carefully examined it, noting its fit, weight, and feel. Each day during practice, he wore the new helmet, ensuring that by the time the competition arrived, it would feel like a natural extension of his body.

On the day of the final competition, the athlete donned the provided helmet with confidence, knowing that he had done everything in his power to prepare for this moment. As he stepped out onto the field, any lingering concerns about the helmet had vanished. His focus was entirely on the task ahead of him, and he knew he was ready to give it his best. With each moment of the intense competition, the athlete showcased his incredible skill and determination, proving that the absence of his personalized helmet did not affect his performance. He tackled challenges fearlessly, pushed through fatigue and pain, all while wearing the helmet he had grown accustomed to. In the end, his efforts paid off – he emerged victorious, securing the championship title. Both his personal growth and adaptation to the new rules had helped shape the athlete he had become.

A state investigation has found no. evidence of child abuse by a Kennedy heir who tried to take his newborn. son from a maternity ward, a family lawyer said today. Attorney Robert Gottlieb said Douglas. Kennedy, son of the late Senator Robert F Kennedy, received a letter from. New York's child protection agency declaring that a report of child. abuse had been determined to be unfounded. On January 7, he tried to take the. newborn boy from the maternity ward at Northern Westchester Hospital in. Mount Kisco, more than 30 miles from Manhattan. Nurses objected, and the. hospital reported the incident to the state. Charges: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with wife Molly and their son Bo, or 'Boru', was charged over the fracas. The Office of Children and Family Services investigated after Kennedy was charged with child endangerment in February. Susan Steele, an agency spokeswoman, said today by email that confidentiality laws prohibit her from commenting. Gottlieb said the agency's. investigation is separate from the criminal prosecution and doesn't. negate the endangerment charge against Kennedy, but he hopes prosecutors. will take it into consideration. 'It is our fervent hope that the. Westchester district attorney will continue to evaluate this case, and. we remain hopeful that the DA will ultimately dismiss that charge,' he. said. Hospital: Douglas Kennedy is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk outside. 'Attack': A figure shown falling over in the corridor is said to be a nurse kicked in the crotch by Mr Kennedy. Gottlieb said the probe covered the hospital encounter and a home visit. 'They investigated everything,' he said. He said the agency's finding was 'the first glimmer of reason that has surfaced in this case since it erupted in the press.' The finding has nothing to do with charges of physical harassment against Kennedy stemming from the same encounter. One nurse says Kennedy twisted her arm as she tried to keep him from leaving with the baby, and another says he kicked her. Anna Margaret Lane and Cari Maleman. Luciano told MSNBC they were involved in a vicious scuffle with the 44-year-old after he tried to get in a lift with his son. Scene: The altercation happened at the Northern Westchester Hospital in suburban New York on January 7. Kennedy, 44, has said he was. protecting the child as the nurses tried to grab him. ‘We kept saying to him: “We need to. step out of the elevator, we need to get the baby to your room”,’ Ms. Luciano said, adding that Mr Kennedy replied: ‘I don't have to listen to. you. It's my child.’ Mr Kennedy claims that as he was. leaning against a door to back out of the maternity ward, a nurse came. toward him, he lifted his left knee and it came into contact with the. nurse to protect his son. That. nurse, Ms Luciano, fell backwards and Ms Lane then accused Kennedy of. twisting her arm. But Mr Kennedy denies this. He returned the baby to. the maternity ward rather than go outside. ‘I. still have pain in my arm,’ Ms Lane told MSNBC. Ms Luciano added: ‘I. wanted to make sure the baby was safe and secure and he brought his leg. up and kicked me. I went flying through the air.’ Fox. News reporter Mr Kennedy, who is married to Molly, is the son of late. politician Robert ‘RFK’ Kennedy - brother of former president John ‘JFK’ Kennedy. RFK was fatally shot in 1968. ‘It is sickening to think that our. simple desire to take our son outside for fresh air has been warped into. a charge of child endangerment,’ Douglas and Ethel Kennedy said in a. statement. Lucian Chalfen, spokesman for the. district attorney, wouldn't comment. Douglas Kennedy, a reporter for Fox. News, is due in Mount Kisco Court on April 12. Mr Kennedy is the. 10th child of Ethel and Robert F. Kennedy, a U.S. senator, Attorney General and presidential. candidate assassinated in June 1968 in Los Angeles, California - five. years after the death of his brother JFK. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A man named Douglas Kennedy, whose dad was a famous person named Robert F Kennedy, got into some trouble when he tried to take his newborn baby out of the hospital for a walk.

Douglas is in trouble with the law for what happened, but a separate investigation said he did not abuse the baby. Now, his lawyer hopes that this finding will help him with his other legal troubles. People are still talking about what happened and trying to figure out what's right and wrong in this case."},{"instruction":"Premise: One of his eyebrows seems permanently raised. Hypothesis: One eyebrow was permanently raised and the other was painted on.

However, it does not provide any information as to why this might be the case. The hypothesis offered is that \\"one eyebrow was permanently raised and the other was painted on.\\" This statement presents a potential explanation for the permanently raised eyebrow, implying that the individual has one natural eyebrow which has a permanently raised appearance, and the other eyebrow has been artificially created or manipulated, perhaps through makeup or other means. To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must evaluate if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise. Entailment means that the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis, or that the hypothesis must be true given the information provided by the premise. In this case, the premise and the hypothesis are not necessarily related in a way that implies entailment. The premise simply describes the appearance of the individual's eyebrows, whereas the hypothesis offers a potential explanation for that appearance. However, there could be several other reasons for one eyebrow to appear permanently raised, such as a genetic trait, an injury, or a facial muscle imbalance. Therefore, the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as there are numerous possible explanations for one eyebrow appearing permanently raised. The hypothesis is one of many potential reasons for the appearance described in the premise but is not guaranteed to be true based on the information provided."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who used instruments of the continuo group as independent parts? , can you please find it? Bach's early cantatas are Choralkonzerte (chorale concertos) in the style of the 17th century, different from the recitative and aria cantata format associated with Neumeister that Bach started to use for church cantatas in 1714. Wolff points out the relation of Bach's early cantatas to works by Dieterich Buxtehude, with whom Bach had studied in Lübeck. Christ lag in Todes Banden shows similarities to a composition of Johann Pachelbel based on the same Easter chorale. Although there is no evidence that Bach and Pachelbel met, Bach grew up in Thuringia while Pachelbel was based in the same region, and Bach's elder brother and teacher Johann Christoph Bach studied with Pachelbel in Erfurt. Another of Pachelbel's works appears to be referenced in the early Bach cantata, Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150, and there has been recent speculation that Bach wanted to pay tribute to Pachelbel after his death in 1706.The texts for the early cantatas were drawn mostly from biblical passages and hymns. Features characteristic of his later cantatas, such as recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry, were not yet present, although Bach may have heard them in oratorios by Buxtehude, or even earlier. Instead, these early cantatas include 17th-century elements such as motets and chorale concertos. They often begin with an instrumental sinfonia or sonata (sonatina). The following table lists the seven extant works composed by Bach until 1708, when he moved on to the Weimar court. Bach uses the limited types of instruments at his disposal for unusual combinations, such as two recorders and two viole da gamba in the funeral cantata Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, also known as Actus Tragicus. He uses instruments of the continuo group as independent parts, such as a cello in Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich and a bassoon in Der Herr denket an uns. The cantata for the inauguration of a town council is richly scored for trumpets, woodwinds and strings. Wolff notes: The overall degree of mastery by which these early...

Article: What's life like on a deserted island? Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona decided to find out. The adventurous senator took a vacation from Capitol Hill and went on a fourday Robinson Crusoe style holiday with his two teenage sons to a remote, deserted island in the North Pacific Ocean. The senator and his sons, 15yearold Tanner and 13yearold Dallin, traveled 5,200 miles from Phoenix, Arizona to the island of Biggarenn. They didn't carry any food or water. The island is part of the Marshall Islands. It offered no basic supplies, so the Flakes had to catch and cook their own food and purify their water. Their diet was made up of coconuts, crabs and fish. They caught the crab and fish themselves and cooked the food over an open fire started with a magnifying glass . The Flakes brought along a lobster trap in the hope of having some delicious treats, but lost it within the first few hours after it was attacked by a shark. They also carried two pumps to remove salt from ocean water. It took them hours each night to pump for just a few gallons of fresh water. One of the most memorable moments of the trip, the father said, was when he and his 15yearold son were almost caught by sharks after spearing a fish in the ocean. Still, it was quite an enjoyable holiday for them. \\"For a dad it was a wonderful thing. No video games around, no television, no disturbance, no texting,\\" Flake recalled.

The government maintained a tight grip on media coverage and international attention on the issue began to grow. As the situation escalated, human rights organizations condemned the actions of the Chinese government and called for an independent investigation into the unrest and the treatment of the Uyghur people. The release of detained Uyghur protestors became a key point of discussion at international forums, with major world leaders urging the Chinese government to address the concerns of the Uyghur community and safeguard their rights as citizens. Faced with mounting pressure and negative publicity, the Chinese government eventually agreed to a dialogue with Uyghur community leaders to discuss their grievances. This led to the release of a significant number of detainees, though not all. Additionally, the government pledged reforms aimed at improving economic opportunities and social rights for the Uyghur population in Xinjiang. Despite these pledges, tensions between the Uyghur residents and the government persisted, as progress was slow and full implementation of the promised reforms was yet to be realized. The international community continued to monitor the situation, urging the Chinese government to further address the concerns of the Uyghur population and ensure their rights are respected. While the unrest in Urumqi gradually subsided, the underlying issues that fueled the protests remain unaddressed at the core. The story ends with the city attempting to return to a semblance of normalcy, but the delicate balance between the Uyghur community and the Chinese authorities continues to be tested. The future of the region remains uncertain, as the struggle for equality, dignity, and justice for the Uyghur people continues."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: For other shrines dedicated to Artemis, see Temple of Artemis (disambiguation) Coordinates: This model of the Temple of Artemis, at Miniatürk Park, Istanbul, Turkey, attempts to recreate the probable appearance of the first temple. The Temple of Artemis or Artemision (Greek: Ἀρτεμίσιον; Turkish: Artemis Tapınağı), also known less precisely as the Temple of Diana, was a Greek temple dedicated to an ancient, local form of the goddess Artemis. It was located in Ephesus (near the modern town of Selçuk in present-day Turkey). It was completely rebuilt three times, and in its final form was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. By 401 AD it had been ruined or destroyed.[1] Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain at the site. The earliest version of the temple (a temenos) antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, and dates to the Bronze Age. Callimachus, in his Hymn to Artemis, attributed it to the Amazons. In the 7th century BC, it was destroyed by a flood. Its reconstruction, in more grandiose form, began around 550 BC, under the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes. The project was funded by Croesus of Lydia, and took 10 years to complete. This version of the temple was destroyed in 356 BC by Herostratus in an act of arson. The next, greatest and last form of the temple, funded by the Ephesians themselves, is described in Antipater of Sidon's list of the world's Seven Wonders: Location and history [ edit ] The fame of the Temple of Artemis was known in the Renaissance , as demonstrated in this imagined portrayal of the temple in a 16th-century hand-colored engraving by Martin Heemskerck The Temple of Artemis was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about 75 km south from the modern port city of İzmir, in Turkey. Today the site lies on the edge of the modern town of Selçuk. The sacred site (temenos) at Ephesus was far older than the Artemision itself. Pausanias was certain that it antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, being older even than the oracular shrine of Apollo at Didyma.[3] He said that the pre-Ionic inhabitants of the city were Leleges and Lydians. Callimachus, in his Hymn to Artemis attributed the earliest temenos at Ephesus to the Amazons, whose worship he imagined already centered upon an image (bretas) of Artemis, their matron goddess. Pausanias says that Pindar believed the temple's founding Amazons to have been involved with the siege at Athens. Tacitus also believed in the Amazon foundation, however Pausanias believed the temple predated the Amazons.[4] Modern archaeology cannot confirm Callimachus's Amazons, but Pausanias's account of the site's antiquity seems well-founded. Before World War I, site excavations by David George Hogarth identified three successive temple buildings.[5] Re-excavations in 1987–88[6] confirmed that the site was occupied as early as the Bronze Age, with a sequence of pottery finds that extend forward to Middle Geometric times, when a peripteral temple with a floor of hard-packed clay was constructed in the second half of the 8th century BC.[7] The peripteral temple at Ephesus offers the earliest example of a peripteral type on the coast of Asia Minor, and perhaps the earliest Greek temple surrounded by colonnades anywhere. In the 7th century BC, a flood[8] destroyed the temple, depositing over half a meter of sand and flotsam over the original clay floor. Among the flood debris were the remains of a carved ivory plaque of a griffin and the Tree of Life, apparently North Syrian, and some drilled tear-shaped amber drops of elliptical cross-section. These probably once dressed a wooden effigy (xoanon) of the Lady of Ephesus, which must have been destroyed or recovered from the flood. Bammer notes that though the site was prone to flooding, and raised by silt deposits about two meters between the 8th and 6th centuries, and a further 2.4 m between the sixth and the fourth, its continued use \\"indicates that maintaining the identity of the actual location played an important role in the sacred organization\\".[9] Temple of Artemis and the other Wonders of the Ancient World Timeline and map of theand the other Wonders of the Ancient World Heraclitus deposited his book \\"On Nature\\" as a dedication to Artemis in the great temple. Second phase [ edit ] The new temple was sponsored at least in part by Croesus, who founded Lydia's empire and was overlord of Ephesus,[10] and was designed and constructed from around 550 BC by the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes. It was 115 m (377 ft) long and 46 m (151 ft) wide, supposedly the first Greek temple built of marble. Its peripteral columns stood some 13 m (40 ft) high, in double rows that formed a wide ceremonial passage around the cella that housed the goddess's cult image. Thirty-six of these columns were, according to Pliny, decorated by carvings in relief. A new ebony or blackened grapewood cult statue was sculpted by Endoios,[11] and a naiskos to house it was erected east of the open-air altar. A rich foundation deposit from this era yielded more than a thousand items, including what may be the earliest coins made from the silver-gold alloy electrum. Fragments of bas-relief on the lowest drums of the temple, preserved in the British Museum, show that the enriched columns of the later temple, of which a few survive (illustration below) were versions of this earlier feature. Pliny the Elder, seemingly unaware of the ancient continuity of the sacred site, claims that the new temple's architects chose to build it on marshy ground as a precaution against earthquakes. The temple became an important attraction, visited by merchants, kings, and sightseers, many of whom paid homage to Artemis in the form of jewelry and various goods. It also offered sanctuary to those fleeing persecution or punishment, a tradition linked in myth to the Amazons who twice fled there seeking the goddess' protection from punishment, firstly by Dionysus and later, by Heracles. Destruction [ edit ] In 356 BC, the temple was destroyed in a vainglorious act of arson by a man, Herostratus, who set fire to the wooden roof-beams, seeking fame at any cost; thus the term herostratic fame.[12] For this outrage, the Ephesians sentenced the perpetrator to death and forbade anyone from mentioning his name; but Theopompus later noted it.[13] In Greek and Roman historical tradition, the temple's destruction coincided with the birth of Alexander the Great (around 20/21 July 356 BC). Plutarch remarked that Artemis was too preoccupied with Alexander's delivery to save her burning temple.[14] Third phase [ edit ] Alexander offered to pay for the temple's rebuilding; the Ephesians tactfully refused, and eventually rebuilt it after his death, at their own expense. Work started in 323 BC and continued for many years. The third temple was larger than the second; 137 m (450 ft) long by 69 m (225 ft) wide and 18 m (60 ft) high, with more than 127 columns. Athenagoras of Athens names Endoeus, a pupil of Daedalus, as sculptor of Artemis' main cult image.[15] A drum from the base of a column from the 4th-century rebuilding, now in the British Museum Pausanias (c. 2nd century AD) reports another image and altar in the Temple, dedicated to Artemis Protothronia (Artemis \\"of the first seat\\") and a gallery of images above this altar, including an ancient figure of Nyx (the primordial goddess of Night) by the sculptor Rhoecus (6th century BC). Pliny describes images of Amazons, the legendary founders of Ephesus and Ephesian Artemis' original protégés, carved by Scopas. Literary sources describe the temple's adornment by paintings, columns gilded with gold and silver, and religious works of renowned Greek sculptors Polyclitus, Pheidias, Cresilas, and Phradmon.[15] This reconstruction survived for 600 years, and appears multiple times in early Christian accounts of Ephesus. According to the New Testament, the appearance of the first Christian missionary in Ephesus caused locals to fear for the temple's dishonor.[16] The 2nd-century Acts of John includes an apocryphal tale of the temple's destruction: the apostle John prayed publicly in the Temple of Artemis, exorcising its demons and \\"of a sudden the altar of Artemis split in many pieces... and half the temple fell down,\\" instantly converting the Ephesians, who wept, prayed or took flight.[17] Against this, a Roman edict of 162 AD acknowledges the importance of Artemesion, the annual Ephesian festival to Artemis, and officially extends it from a few holy days over March–April to a whole month, \\"one of the largest and most magnificent religious festivals in Ephesus' liturgical calendar\\".[18] In 268 AD, the Temple was destroyed or damaged in a raid by the Goths, an East Germanic tribe;[19] in the time of emperor Gallienus: \\"Respa, Veduc and Thuruar,[20] leaders of the Goths, took ship and sailed across the strait of the Hellespont to Asia. There they laid waste many populous cities and set fire to the renowned temple of Diana at Ephesus,\\" reported Jordanes in Getica.[21] It is, however, unknown to what extent the temple was damaged. Whatever the extent of the injuries to the building, it appears to have been rebuilt or repaired, as the temple is noted to have been in use for worship during the rise of Christianity, and closed as a consequence of the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.[22] However, the history of the temple between 268 and its closure by the Christian persecutions is not well known, and it is unconfirmed how big the damage of 268 was, and exactly which year it was closed by the Christians. Ammonius of Alexandria comments on the closure of the temple in his commentary of the Acts of the Apostles in the mid 5th-century, in which he gives the impression that the closure of the temple had occurred in his living memory.[22] The closure of the Temple of Artemis is assumed to have occurred sometime during the course of the early to mid 5th-century, with the year of 407 as an early date.[22] The closure of the temple was followed by the erasing of the name of Artemis from inscriptions around the city of Ephesus.[22] Final destruction [ edit ] It is unknown how long the building stood after the closure of the temple by the Christians. At least some of the stones from the temple were eventually used in construction of other buildings.[23] Some of the columns in Hagia Sophia originally belonged to the temple of Artemis,[24] and the Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai records the re-use of several statues and other decorative elements from the temple, throughout Constantinople. The main primary sources for the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus are Pliny the Elder's Natural History [25], Pomponius Mela i:17, and Plutarch's Life of Alexander [26] (referencing the burning of the Artemiseum). Rediscovery of the temple [ edit ] The site of the temple today. After six years of searching, the site of the temple was rediscovered in 1869 by an expedition led by John Turtle Wood and sponsored by the British Museum. These excavations continued until 1874.[27] A few further fragments of sculpture were found during the 1904–1906 excavations directed by David George Hogarth. The recovered sculptured fragments of the 4th-century rebuilding and a few from the earlier temple, which had been used in the rubble fill for the rebuilding, were assembled and displayed in the \\"Ephesus Room\\" of the British Museum.[28] In addition, the museum has part of possibly the oldest pot-hoard of coins in the world (600 BC) that had been buried in the foundations of the Archaic temple.[29] Today the site of the temple, which lies just outside Selçuk, is marked by a single column constructed of dissociated fragments discovered on the site. Cult and influence [ edit ] The archaic temeton beneath the later temples clearly housed some form of \\"Great Goddess\\" but nothing is known of her cult. The literary accounts that describe it as \\"Amazonian\\" refer to the later founder-myths of Greek emigres who developed the cult and temple of Artemis Ephesia. The wealth and splendor of temple and city were taken as evidence of Artemis Ephesia's power, and were the basis for her local and international prestige: despite the successive traumas of Temple destruction, each rebuilding – a gift and honor to the goddess – brought further prosperity.[30] Large numbers of people came to Ephesus in March and in the beginning of May to attend the main Artemis Procession.[31] Artemis' shrines, temples and festivals (Artemisia) could be found throughout the Greek world, but Ephesian Artemis was unique. The Ephesians considered her theirs, and resented any foreign claims to her protection. Once Persia ousted and replaced their Lydian overlord Croesus, the Ephesians played down his contribution to the Temple's restoration. On the whole, the Persians dealt fairly with Ephesus, but removed some religious artifacts from Artemis' Temple to Sardis and brought Persian priests into her Ephesian cult; this was not forgiven.[32] When Alexander conquered the Persians, his offer to finance the Temple's second rebuilding was politely but firmly refused.[33] Ephesian Artemis lent her city's diplomacy a powerful religious edge. Under Hellenic rule, and later, under Roman rule, the Ephesian Artemisia festival was increasingly promoted as a key element in the pan-Hellenic festival circuit. It was part of a definitively Greek political and cultural identity, essential to the economic life of the region, and an excellent opportunity for young, unmarried Greeks of both sexes to seek out marriage partners. Games, contests and theatrical performances were held in the goddess's name, and Pliny describes her procession as a magnificent crowd-puller; it was shown in one of Apelles' best paintings, which depicted the goddess's image carried through the streets and surrounded by maidens.[34] In the Roman Imperial era, the emperor Commodus lent his name to the festival games, and might have sponsored them.[35] Ephesian Artemis [ edit ] Diana Efesina, Villa d'Este, Tivoli, Italy Traditional many-breasted interpretation in a 16th-century fountain of From the Greek point of view Ephesian Artemis is a distinctive form of their goddess Artemis. In Greek cult and myth, Artemis is the twin of Apollo, a virgin huntress who supplanted the Titan Selene as goddess of the Moon. At Ephesus, a goddess whom the Greeks associated with Artemis was venerated in an archaic, certainly pre-Hellenic cult image[36] that was carved of wood and kept decorated with jewelry. The Lady of Ephesus, 1st century AD, Ephesus Archaeological Museum xoanon An 18th-century engraving of a Roman marble copy of a Greek replica of a lost Geometric period Robert Fleischer identified as decorations of the primitive xoanon the changeable features that since Minucius Felix and Jerome's Christian attacks on pagan popular religion had been read as many breasts or \\"eggs\\"—denoting her fertility (others interpret the objects to represent the testicles of sacrificed bulls that would have been strung on the image, with similar meaning). Most similar to Near-Eastern and Egyptian deities, and least similar to Greek ones, her body and legs are enclosed within a tapering pillar-like term, from which her feet protrude. On the coins minted at Ephesus, the apparently many-breasted goddess wears a mural crown (like a city's walls), an attribute of Cybele as a protector of cities (see polos).[36] On the coins she rests either arm on a staff formed of entwined serpents or of a stack of ouroboroi, the eternal serpent with its tail in its mouth. In some accounts, the Lady of Ephesus was attended by eunuch priests called \\"Megabyzoi\\"; this could have been a proper name or a title. The practise of ritual self-emasculation as qualification to serve a deity is usually identified with Cybele's eunuch mendicant priests, the Galli. The Megabyzoi of Ephesian Artemis were assisted by young, virgin girls (korai).[37][38] The \\"eggs\\" or \\"breasts\\" of the Lady of Ephesus, it now appears, must be the iconographic descendants of the amber gourd-shaped drops, elliptical in cross-section and drilled for hanging, that were rediscovered in the excavations of 1987–1988; they remained in situ where the ancient wooden cult figure of the Lady of Ephesus had been caught by an 8th-century flood (see History above). This form of breast-jewelry, then, had already been developed by the Geometric Period. A hypothesis offered by Gerard Seiterle, that the objects in Classical representations represented bulls' scrotal sacs[39] cannot be maintained.[40][41] A votive inscription mentioned by Florence Mary Bennett,[42] which dates probably from about the 3rd century BC, associates Ephesian Artemis with Crete: \\"To the Healer of diseases, to Apollo, Giver of Light to mortals, Eutyches has set up in votive offering [a statue of] the Cretan Lady of Ephesus, the Light-Bearer.\\" The Greek habits of syncretism assimilated all foreign gods under some form of the Olympian pantheon familiar to them—in interpretatio graeca—and it is clear that at Ephesus, the identification with Artemis that the Ionian settlers made of the \\"Lady of Ephesus\\" was slender. The Christian approach was at variance with the tolerant syncretistic approach of pagans to gods who were not theirs. A Christian inscription at Ephesus[43] suggests why so little remains at the site: Destroying the delusive image of the demon Artemis, Demeas has erected this symbol of Truth, the God that drives away idols, and the Cross of priests, deathless and victorious sign of Christ. The assertion that the Ephesians thought that their cult image had fallen from the sky, though it was a familiar origin-myth at other sites, is only known at Ephesus from Acts 19:35: What man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter? Lynn LiDonnici observes that modern scholars are likely to be more concerned with origins of the Lady of Ephesus and her iconology than her adherents were at any point in time, and are prone to creating a synthetic account of the Lady of Ephesus by drawing together documentation that ranges over more than a millennium in its origins, creating a falsified, unitary picture, as of an unchanging icon.[44] Panorama [ edit ] A 360 degree panoramic view of the site of the temple See also [ edit ] References [ edit ] Works cited [ edit ] Further reading [ edit ] ||||| Sandy Hook. Aurora. Columbine. It's appalling, but one way to achieve fame in America is through acts of infamy. What if that weren't so? Today's media might profit by studying an example from ancient Greece on how to keep evildoers from becoming instant celebrities. The precedent sprang from a heinous crime in 356 BC that occurred in Ephesus, a magnificent city in what is now Turkey. The city's crowning glory was an Ionic temple to the Ephesian version of the Greek goddess Artemis. Then 200 years old, the Artemisium was an exquisite wilderness of columns, art galleries and sculptured altars, acclaimed as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Although the temple, all 45,000 square feet of it, drew many thousands of visitors, one obscure citizen felt no civic pride. After obsessing for years over what the world owed him, this disturbed young man decided to make a name for himself in the darkest way he could devise. One sultry night, he headed to the Artemisium and set it ablaze. We might scoff at the notion of marble structures being destroyed by fire, but Greek temple interiors contained seasoned wood from main beams to floors, along with countless flammable art objects. Because temples were open and staffed night and day, they relied on firewood and olive oil for heat and light. For convenience, combustible materials were stored on site. As the wooden interior of the building and its vast wooden roof burned, the young arsonist exulted, watching the 60-foot marble columns begin to crumble when fiery temperatures rose to as high as 1,000 degrees. Firefighting technology being in its infancy, the blaze continued unchecked, claiming an unknown number of human victims as well. The perpetrator made no attempt to escape. When arrested, he boasted about his infamous act, saying he did it to make his name live forever. Local authorities promptly sentenced the young man and executed him. To keep him from profiting by his crime in the way he most ardently desired — and to discourage imitators — the Ephesians passed a law. It imposed the death penalty on anyone who ever mentioned that criminal by name again. Although the millions of people who lived nearly 2,400 years ago lacked what we would call mass media or instant long-distance communication, they certainly communicated — and faster than you would think. Despite the age-old tendency of humans to gossip, that long-ago name ban had remarkable staying power. With one tacky exception, historians and writers, both Greek and Roman, retold the story for centuries without naming the criminal at its heart. (And you won't catch me mentioning his name either.) Furthermore, the Ephesians rebuilt their glorious temple, which remained a world wonder for an additional 600 years. Marginalized men with murderous plans have been around for millenniums, but we have forgotten how to take away what they most prize, the \\"I'll show 'em\\" notoriety that enables evildoers to win immortality. We have surrendered to shabbier motives, such as selling newspapers or winning TV news ratings. Would such a ban work in today's world, given our hungry media cycles, our insistence on free speech even when it harms? Maybe not. But infamy should not be rewarded with headlines. Or personal recognition. Long-ago cultures — Egyptian, Greek and Roman — also made it a point to censure certain individuals by inflicting a similar punishment. In Latin, it was called damnatio memoriae: to castigate by erasing one's name and deeds from public memory. In our time, damning killers in such a way is surely worth a try.

Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\\" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children.

The President is the highest popularly elected official in Iran, although the President answers to the Supreme Leader of Iran, who functions as the country's head of state. Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the qualifications for presidential candidates and procedures for election, as well as the President's powers and responsibilities as \\"functions of the executive\\". These include signing treaties and other agreements with foreign countries and international organizations; administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs; and appointing ministers subject to the approval of Parliament. However, in reality the president mainly gets the blame for failures than actually making the decisions. The current long-time Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who has been ruling for nearly three decades, has been issuing decrees and making the final decisions on economy, environment, foreign policy, national planning such as population growth, and everything else in Iran. Khamenei also makes the final decisions on the amount of transparency in elections in Iran, and has fired and reinstated Presidential cabinet appointments. - Rafsanjan (also Romanized as Rafsanjn and Rafsinjn; also known as Bahrmbd) is a city in and the capital of Rafsanjan County, Kerman Province, Iran.

The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran was adopted by referendum on 2 and 3 December 1979, and went into force replacing the Constitution of 1905. It was amended on 28 July 1989. The constitution has been called a \\"hybrid\\" of \\"theocratic and democratic elements\\". While articles One and Two vest sovereignty in God, article six \\"mandates popular elections for the presidency and the Majlis, or parliament.\\" However all democratic procedures and rights are subordinate to the Guardian Council and the Supreme Leader, whose powers are spelled out in Chapter Eight (Articles 107-112). - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country. - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia.

It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman. - An Islamic republic is the name given to several states in countries ruled by Islamic laws, including the Islamic Republics of Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and Mauritania. Pakistan first adopted the title under the constitution of 1956. Mauritania adopted it on 28 November 1958. Iran adopted it after the 1979 Iranian Revolution that overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty. Afghanistan adopted it in 1992 (in 19962001 the Taliban was ruling as an Islamic emirate (monarchy)) upon Jamiat-e Islami seizing capital Kabul from the Communists. Despite the similar name the countries differ greatly in their governments and laws. - Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (or Hashemi Bahramani; 25 August 1934 8 January 2017) was an influential Iranian politician, writer and one of the founding fathers of the Islamic Republic who was the fourth President of Iran from 3 August 1989 until 3 August 1997. He was the head of the Assembly of Experts from 2007 until 2011 when he decided not to nominate himself for the post. He was also the chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council. - The Assembly of Experts (also Assembly of Experts of the Leadership) of the Islamic Republic of Iran, also translated as Council of Experts, is a deliberative body of Iran consisting of eighty eight (88) Mujtahids (Islamic theologians) that is charged with electing and removing the Supreme Leader of Iran and supervising his activities. Members of the assembly are elected from lists of candidates by direct public vote for eight-year terms. The number of members has ranged from 82 elected in 1982 to 88 elected in 2016. Current laws require the assembly to meet for at least two days every six months. The current chairman of the Fifth Assembly is Ahmad Jannati. All candidates to the Assembly of Experts, the President and the Majlis (Parliament), must be approved by the Guardian Council, while half of its members are selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran. Accordingly, the Assembly has never questioned the Supreme Leader. There have been instances when the current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly criticized members of the Assembly of Experts, resulting in their arrest and dismissal. For example, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly called then-member of the Assembly of Experts Ahmad Azari Qomi a traitor, resulting in Ahmad Azari Qomi's arrest and eventual dismissal from the Assembly of Experts. - The Expediency Discernment Council of the System (\\"Majma' Tašxis Malahat Nezâm\\") is an administrative assembly appointed by the Supreme Leader and was created upon the revision to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 6 February 1988. It was originally set up to resolve differences or conflicts between the Majlis and the Guardian Council, but \\"its true power lies more in its advisory role to the Supreme Leader.\\" According to Hooman Majd, the Leader \\"delegated some of his own authority to the council granting it supervisory powers over all branches of the government\\" following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election in 2005. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch. - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west.

We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house.

Q: Abstract: BACKGROUND A major challenge for physicians is to identify patients with acute coronary syndromes who may benefit from treatment with glycoprotein-IIb/IIIa-receptor antagonists. We investigated whether troponin concentrations can be used to stratify patients for benefit from treatment with tirofiban. METHODS We enrolled 2222 patients of the Platelet Receptor Inhibition in Ischemic Syndrome Management study with coronary artery disease and who had had chest pain in the previous 24 h. All patients received aspirin and were randomly assigned treatment with tirofiban or heparin. We took baseline measurements of troponin I and troponin T. We recorded death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent ischaemia after 48 h infusion treatment and at 7 days and 30 days. FINDINGS 629 (28.3%) patients had troponin I concentrations higher than the diagnostic threshold of 1.0 microg/L and 644 (29.0%) troponin T concentrations higher than 0.1 microg/L. 30-day event rates (death, myocardial infarction) were 13.0% for troponin-I-positive patients compared with 4.9% for troponin-I-negative patients (p<0.0001), and 13.7% compared wth 3.5% for troponin T (p<0.001). At 30 days, in troponin-I-positive patients, tirofiban had lowered the risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.25 [95% CI 0.09-0.68], p=0.004) and myocardial infarction (0.37 [0.16-0.84], p=0.01). This benefit was seen in medically managed patients (0.30 [0.10-0.84], p=0.004) and those undergoing revascularisation (0.37 [0.15-0.93] p=0.02) after 48 h infusion treatment. By contrast, no treatment effect was seen for troponin-I-negative patients. Similar benefits were seen for troponin-T-positive patients.

His primary objective was to move forces successfully into Tunisia, and intending to facilitate that objective, he gave his support to François Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa, despite Darlan's previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the French armed forces. The Allied leaders were \\"thunderstruck\\" by this from a political standpoint, though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation. Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move. Darlan was assassinated on December 24 by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle. Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies, considering it a criminal rather than a military matter. Eisenhower later appointed General Henri Giraud as High Commissioner, who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan's commander-in-chief, and who had refused to postpone the execution. Who initially served as High Commissioner of North Africa? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The initial High Commissioner of North Africa, as specified in the text, was François Darlan. Darlan was chosen by Eisenhower despite his prior high offices within Vichy France and his concurrent role as the commander-in-chief of the French armed forces.

He took his stepfather's surname and became known as Piers Stefan Pughe-Morgan. He attended the independent school Cumnor House from the ages of seven to thirteen, and then Chailey School, a comprehensive secondary school in Chailey, near Lewes, East Sussex, followed by Priory School for sixth form. Morgan studied journalism at Harlow College. In partnership with Matthew Freud, he gained ownership in May 2005, of Press Gazette, a media trade publication together with its \\"cash cow\\", the British Press Awards, in a deal worth PS1 million. This ownership was cited as one of the reasons many major newspapers boycotted the 2006 awards. Press Gazette entered administrative receivership toward the end of 2006, before being sold to a trade buyer. First News was launched by Morgan on 4 May 2006. A weekly paper aimed at seven to 14-year-olds, he claimed at its launch that the paper was to be \\"Britain's first national newspaper for children\\". Morgan was editorial director at First News, responsible for bringing in celebrity involvement. He referred to the role as \\"editorial overlord and frontman\\". Morgan was filmed falling off a Segway, breaking three ribs, in 2007. Simon Cowell and others made much of Morgan's previous comment in 2003, in a Mirror headline after former U.S. President George W. Bush fell off a Segway: \\"You'd have to be an idiot to fall off wouldn't you, Mr President\\". In 2012, following the revelation of Jimmy Savile's sexual abuse against children, Morgan claimed to have \\"never met\\" Savile in his lifetime - although it was pointed out that in a 2009 piece by Morgan in The Mail on Sunday's Night & Day magazine claiming that \\"As I left, Jimmy Savile came up to me. 'Your TV shows are BRILLIANT!. he exclaimed. ... I've always loved Jimmy Savile.\\" Later, in 2017, Morgan accused Ewan McGregor of being a \\"paedophile-loving hypocrite\\" for his past support of Roman Polanski cancelling an appearance on Good Morning Britain due to Morgan's comments opposing the Women's March on Washington. He became the editor-at-large of the Mail Online website's US operation in September 2014 and Morgan writes several columns a week.

Below is the review: Title: The Shawshank Redemption - A Timeless Tale of Hope and Friendship 2) The Shawshank Redemption is a captivating and inspiring film that serves as a prime example of the power of storytelling. Released in 1994 and directed by Frank Darabont, the movie is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King and stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in unforgettable roles. Step 1: Introduce the film's background and central theme of hope. The story is set in the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, as it follows the friendship of two inmates, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman). The central theme of hope permeates throughout the film, providing a beacon in a seemingly dark world where freedom and justice are but distant dreams. Step 2: Analyze the outstanding performances by the lead actors. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give stellar performances in their respective roles, bringing depth and believability to their characters. Robbins expertly captures the quiet resilience and intelligence of Dufresne, while Freeman's narration as Red provides the audience a soulful and heartfelt perspective on life within the prison walls. Their on-screen chemistry propels the narrative forward, creating a bond with viewers that remains long after the end credits roll. Step 3: Discuss the film's exceptional storytelling and direction. Frank Darabont masterfully adapts King's novella with a keen focus on character development and atmospheric storytelling. With striking visuals, Darabont uses the camera to illustrate the contrast between the cold, harsh confines of the prison and the liberating power of hope and friendship. The screenplay, filled with evocative dialogue and moments of profound emotion, further embellishes the film's narrative depth. Step 4: Mention the memorable score and soundtrack. The film's score, composed by Thomas Newman, contributes to the emotional impact of the story. Melodies evoke a sense of melancholy and longing that complements the tale of enduring faith and redemption. The rich soundtrack, featuring songs from the era, further immerses viewers into the world of Shawshank. Step 5: Conclude with a lasting impression of the film. The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless classic, a testament to the enduring power of hope and friendship. With its superb performances, masterful direction, and emotive storytelling, the film leaves an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of those who experience it. It is a shining example of cinema at its finest, a testament to the ability of film to uplift and inspire. In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is a must-watch movie that delivers a gripping and heartwarming experience. Its powerful story, unforgettable characters, and memorable score combine to create a film that transcends time and resonates across generations, making it a truly timeless classic."},{"instruction":"Context: The derogatory expression \\"Mad War\\" to designate this struggle of major feudal lords against central royal power was coined by Paul Emile in his Histoire des faicts, gestes et conquestes des roys de France, published in 1581. There is some dispute about the extent to which the events can be defined as a single war. It followed a long succession of conflicts between royalty and the great lords of the kingdom in the second half of the 15th century, subsequent to the formation of the League of the Public Weal. As part of these power struggles, in 1484-1485, Louis II of Orléans, supported by Francis II of Brittany and a certain number of lords, attempted to depose the regent, Anne de Beaujeu. Mostly by a mixture of diplomacy and shows of force, Anne succeeded in breaking the revolt without a major battle. On 2 November 1485, the Peace of Bourges suspended the hostilities. According to some historians, this ended the first phase of the \\"Mad War.\\" The second phase of the conflict, from June 1486 to November 1488, is sometimes called the War of Brittany. Other commentators, mainly Breton nationalists, distinguish this second phase from the first, making it into a Franco-Breton war, or even a Breton war of independence, sometimes by connecting it to the earlier Breton War of Succession. Question: How many battles did Anne de Beaujeau and Louis II of Orleans have? Answer:","output":"During the \\"Mad War\\", Anne de Beaujeu and Louis II of Orléans did not engage in any major battles. The conflict was characterized by a struggle for power between major feudal lords and the central royal power, with several minor skirmishes and confrontations. Anne de Beaujeu, serving as the regent for her brother, King Charles VIII, managed to maintain her authority and quell the rebellion led by Louis II of Orléans and supported by Francis II of Brittany, as well as other lords. Anne's strategy involved a combination of diplomatic tactics and shows of force, which proved successful in breaking the revolt without having to engage in any significant battles. The Peace of Bourges, signed on November 2, 1485, put an end to hostilities in the first phase of the \\"Mad War.\\" The second phase, from June 1486 to November 1488, has been referred to as the War of Brittany; however, even during this period, there were no notable battles between Anne de Beaujeu and Louis II of Orléans. It is essential to recognize that the \\"Mad War\\" was not a conventional war with a series of major battles but rather a series of conflicts and power struggles between the French royalty and the great lords of the kingdom. By employing deft diplomacy and demonstrations of military strength, Anne de Beaujeu managed to suppress the revolt led by Louis II of Orléans and maintain stability in the French realm during her regency."},{"instruction":"Sentence: Arlington is part of Tarrant County, Texas, where the largest city is Fort Worth.

The talented actress found herself in the crosshairs of an alleged stalker, who wreaked havoc on her life for months and became a living nightmare, resulting in severe security concerns for her and her family. Background: The Stalker Stuart Dunn, a 27-year-old man at the time, was arrested in the past for stalking Mila Kunis in 2012. His obsessive actions began with him relentlessly following the actress and constantly showing up at her events. He demonstrated no regard for her personal space or her own safety. Dunn had a restraining order placed against him and was later imprisoned for breaching that order. However, this was only the beginning of the actress's terrifying experience. Escalation: The Stalker Breaks In It appeared that the restraining order did not deter Dunn and only intensified his fixation on Kunis. In May 2012, he broke into her Los Angeles home, violating his probation terms. What could have been a dramatic face-to-face encounter was luckily averted as Mila was not at home during the intrusion. Police discovered him in the property and Dunn was charged with felony stalking and breaking-and-entering. The horror did not stop there, as just months later, in June 2015, Dunn escaped from a secure mental health facility by scaling a fence. He was on the run for four days, during which Mila Kunis and her family were forced to live under heightened security measures, not knowing when or where he might appear. Safety Measures and Emotional Stress As a result of Dunn's horrifying obsession, Mila had to ramp up security measures around her and her family to ensure their safety. The fear for her own safety and the wellbeing of her husband, Ashton Kutcher, and their two young children was a constant source of emotional stress for the actress. The actions of the stalker not only intruded on her personal life but also impeded her ability to work comfortably without the fear of an unwanted surprise at any moment. The Toll on Her Relationships Mila's relationships with friends and loved ones were also significantly affected. Due to the constant security concerns, she had to be cautious about meeting friends and had to restrict access for fear of putting them and her family at risk. Additionally, her husband took on the role of being vigilant and had to balance his duties of protecting his family while also maintaining his career, in which he himself was a high-profile Hollywood actor. Justice and Resolution After four days on the run, Dunn was recaptured by the police and taken back into custody. The judge on the case put measures in place to keep him in a secure facility and ensure Mila's safety. Since then, the actress has been able to regain some sense of control and calm in her life, continuing her successful acting career and focusing on her family. Conclusion Mila Kunis' ordeal is a harrowing reminder of the dark side of fame and fortune. As it turns out, even Hollywood stars are not immune to terrifying experiences that have detrimental effects on their personal and professional lives. Thankfully, Mila Kunis was able to overcome this horrifying experience, but it is essential to remember that stalking is a serious and pervasive issue that deserves attention and appropriate legal measures to bring justice and relief to those affected."},{"instruction":"Read the following conversation and answer the question.

The Saudi Arabian government believes they can and is backing its belief by investing 22 billion into a public transport mega-project in the capital Riyadh. Set to begin construction early next year, a new metro network will encompass over 176 km (110 miles) of train lines and 85 stations, linking the city center to universities, the airport, a newly built financial district and commercial areas. The first trains as slated to run in 2019. During construction, it will be the world's biggest public transport project, employing tens of thousands of people, developers say. According to the High Commission for the Development of Arriyadh, all carriages will be air-conditioned and divided into first, family and single class. Buses and trains take a distant second to personal cars in Riyadh and according to FCC Construction only 2% of commuters in the Saudi Arabian capital take public transport. It's no surprise because gasoline is highly subsidized -- a gallon at the petrol pumps costs around 0.50. According to Bloomberg, the world's largest oil producer ranks only second to Venezuela for the world's cheapest gasoline. According to reports, the Saudi government is weighing up increasingly the cost of fuel to give public transport a boost. Read more: Ramadan's Super Bowl effect. Chronically underdeveloped until now, the expansion of public transport in the Saudi capital will also cope with the projected boom in the local population. It has more than doubled since 1990 to 5.3 million and is set to top 8 million by 2030. \\"Riyadh today is one of the world's fastest growing cities and our citizens deserve a world-class public transport system to enhance their quality of life... it will also help to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality,\\" said Ibrahim Bin Muhammad Al Sultan President of Arriyadh Development Authority and Member of the High Commission for the Development of Arriyadh.

It may sound strange, but an egg can do wonders for your hair. The yolk nourishes your hair by adding moisture so that it doesn't look dull. The white clarifies your hair by helping to remove any buildup. The egg also has protein in it, which strengthens your hair. The result is hair that looks very shiny after just one treatment. Here's how to do it: Beat one egg in a small bowl. Wet your hair. Pour the egg over your head. Use a wide-tooth comb to comb it to the tips of your hair. Let it sit in your hair for at least 15 minutes. Shampoo your hair as normal. Rinse with cold water for maximum shine. Apple cider vinegar is quickly catching on as an all-natural hair conditioner and gloss booster. It balances your hair's pH level, clarifies your strands and leaves your hair feeling soft. Once your hair dries, it will no longer smell like vinegar. Follow these steps to make an ACV treatment: Shampoo your hair as usual, but skip the conditioner. Pour a mixture of 1 tablespoon ACV and 1 tablespoon water over your head. Comb it through to your tips. Very long hair may require 2 or 3 tablespoons. Let it sit for five minutes, then rinse your hair with cold water at the end of your shower. Avocado has natural fats that nourish your hair and add shine.

Patton leading 90,000 men of the Seventh United States Army in a landing near Gela, Scoglitti, and Licata to support Bernard Montgomery's British 8th Army landings to the north. Initially ordered to protect the British forces' flank, Patton took Palermo after Montgomery's forces were slowed by heavy resistance from troops of Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy. Patton then set his sights on Messina. He sought an amphibious assault, but it was delayed by lack of landing craft and his troops did not land in Santo Stefano until 8 August, by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of their troops to mainland Italy. Throughout the campaign, Patton's troops were heavily engaged by German and Italian forces as they pushed across the island.Patton had already developed a reputation in the U.S. Army as an effective, successful, and hard-driving commander, punishing subordinates for the slightest infractions but also rewarding them when they performed well. As a way to promote an image that inspired his troops, Patton created a larger-than-life personality. He became known for his flashy dress, highly polished helmet and boots, and no-nonsense demeanor.

In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\".

Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Could Madame White Snake live out a normal life with her mate, why or why not?\\" is \\"Yes\\"? Available options: (A). no. (B). yes.","output":"(A). No. According to the text, Madame White Snake could not live happily with her human mate despite embodying the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife. The primary reason cited in the passage for this is her dangerous sexuality, which makes her a femme fatale character. Her alluring, transgressive behavior is the source of pleasure in the narrative, rather than her eventual punishment. Thus, her dangerous nature prevents her from living a normal life with her mate."},{"instruction":"Here is a dialogue: Ron: The grades from Micro are online, I passed :D Harry: Me too, 3.5 haha Ron: 4 here ;) Harry: Your group was easier ;) Heather: I got 4.5, but both groups were quite easy :p Write a short summary!","output":"Step 1: Identify the main topic of the dialogue - The main topic is the discussion of grades from a Micro course among friends.

It is not possible to tell Based on the given premise, \\"because parents aren't parents,\\" it is not possible to definitively confirm whether the hypothesis \\"because kids are not being taught by their parents\\" is true or not without more context and information. The statement \\"parents aren't parents\\" can mean various things and might not necessarily imply that children are not being taught by their parents. For instance, the term \\"parents aren't parents\\" could refer to a scenario where adults with children have abdicated their parental responsibilities entirely, neglecting or failing to provide guidance to their offspring. In this case, the hypothesis that \\"kids are not being taught by their parents\\" would indeed be true. On the other hand, the phrase \\"parents aren't parents\\" might be indicative of a more philosophical perspective where the speaker believes that many parents are not fulfilling the traditional roles assigned to them due to societal, economic, or cultural changes. Under these circumstances, children could still receive teaching and guidance from their parents, albeit in altered or non-traditional ways, meaning the hypothesis that \\"kids are not being taught by their parents\\" might not be accurate. Moreover, even if parents aren't directly teaching their children, it's possible that other individuals or institutions are providing a supplementary or alternative form of education to these kids, such as schools, tutors, or relatives. This scenario further complicates the relationship between the initial premise and the proposed hypothesis. Ultimately, without additional clarification or background information, it is not possible to determine whether the hypothesis \\"because kids are not being taught by their parents\\" holds true when considering the ambiguous premise \\"because parents aren't parents.\\" The two statements require a more explicit connection or further elaboration to establish a conclusive link between them."},{"instruction":"What plant, a bushy herb of the mint family, has a heavy, strong scent, and has been used for centuries in perfumes? What is the answer?","output":"The plant you are looking for is Patchouli (Pogostemon cablin), a bushy herb belonging to the mint family, Lamiaceae. Indigenous to tropical regions of Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, patchouli is known for its heavy, strong, and earthy scent that has been extensively used in perfumes, incense, and essential oils for centuries. Patchouli is a perennial plant that typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet but can reach up to 3.5 feet in optimum conditions. It features erect, square-shaped stems with hairy, oval leaves, and produces small, pale pinkish-white flowers. The leaves, however, are where its distinct aromatic compounds are stored, and they are responsible for the plant's characteristic fragrance. The mesmerizing scent of patchouli is attributed to its essential oil content, which is obtained through the steam distillation of dried leaves. Patchouli oil contains various chemical compounds, such as patchoulol, pogostol, and norpatchoulenol, which contribute to its unique aroma profile. Due to its intensity, patchouli has often been considered a base note in perfumery, meaning it is one of the longer-lasting elements in a fragrance blend. Historically, patchouli has been used across cultures for several purposes beyond perfumery. In traditional Asian medicine, the plant has been employed to treat a range of ailments, including skin problems, infections, and digestive disorders. In addition, the dried leaves have long been utilized as a natural insect repellent, with the strong scent serving to deter pests from fabrics and carpets. Over the years, patchouli has gained a reputation as a symbol of bohemian culture, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s, when its scent became associated with the counterculturist movement, blends of incense, and a peaceful, free-spirited lifestyle. Today, the versatile fragrance of patchouli continues to be widely used in not only perfumes but also candles, soaps, and aromatherapy products, underscoring its enduring appeal."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end?

Context: Shortly after five, the hospital called. More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable. It was fiscal suicide. The hospital was perfectly willing to let the local experts in deadbeats handle the workload. Tonight, Ray could tell them no.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"If there is less pressure on the rocks, the effect on cutting a deeper gash will be reduced. This is because the pressure exerted by the stream or river on the rocks plays a significant role in the erosion and removal of material from the bedrock, which in turn helps in cutting a deeper gash through the soil and bedrock. Reduced pressure implies that the force of water acting on the rocks is not as strong, and consequently, the rate of erosion will decrease. To better understand how this perturbation influences the second effect mentioned, which is the deep gash cut through the soil and bedrock, we need to delve deeper into the erosion process and how it operates. Erosion refers to the gradual wearing away of soil, rocks, and other materials by the action of natural agents like water, wind, and ice. In the case of a stream or river, water is the primary erosional force responsible for cutting the gash. The stream's velocity, the amount of water and sediment carried by the stream, and the nature of the bedrock all contribute to the effectiveness of the erosion process. When there is less pressure exerted by the water on the rocks, the process of erosion slows down. This indicates that the removal of material from the bedrock will take much longer. As a result, the deepening of the gash in the soil and bedrock will be much slower compared to the situation with higher pressure exerted by the water. In summary, less pressure on the rocks will have a negative effect on cutting a deeper gash, as the reduced pressure slows down the erosion process. This perturbation ultimately influences the second effect mentioned, which is the formation of a deep gash, by causing a slower rate of erosion and consequently a longer period required for the formation of the ravine."},{"instruction":"have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted Does it follow that \\"Did you decide it was too expensive to get a professional to paint it?\\"?

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, the provided answer does not directly address the question about which RAID levels use striping. Let me provide the correct answer. Below are the RAID levels that use striping: 1. RAID 0 – Striping: In RAID 0, data is divided into blocks and written across multiple disks. This allows for increased performance, as read and write operations are performed simultaneously. 2. RAID 5 – Striping with distributed parity: RAID 5 uses striping, like RAID 0, but also includes a parity block distributed across all the disks. This enables fault tolerance and data recovery in the event of a disk failure. 3. RAID 6 – Striping with double distributed parity: RAID 6 is similar to RAID 5 but has an additional parity block, providing even greater fault tolerance. 4. RAID 10 (1+0) or RAID 01 (0+1) – Striped mirrors or mirrored stripes: RAID 10 and RAID 01 combine the features of RAID 0 (striping) and RAID 1 (mirroring) for improved performance and fault tolerance. RAID 10 stripes data across mirrored pairs of disks, while RAID 01 mirrors data that is striped across multiple disks. 5.

Article usage: The articles \\"the\\" are correctly used before the nouns \\"cat\\" and \\"tree.\\" Definite articles specify a particular object or entity and are generally appropriate in this context. 3. Noun and Adjective usage: The sentence uses the adjectives \\"curious\\" and \\"tall\\" to describe the nouns \\"cat\\" and \\"tree,\\" respectively. In English grammar, placing adjectives before nouns to modify or describe them is the standard practice. 4. Adverb usage: The adverb \\"quickly\\" is used to modify the verb \\"climbed.\\" In English, adverbs generally precede the verb they modify, making the sentence grammatically acceptable. 5. Infinitive verb usage: The infinitive verb \\"to observe\\" is used to explain the purpose of the cat's climbing action. This usage of the infinitive verb form indicating the goal or intention of action is grammatically correct in English. 6. Prepositional phrase: \\"From a higher perspective\\" is a prepositional phrase that adds detail to the sentence and further elaborates on what the cat is trying to achieve by climbing the tree.

Answer:","output":"When comparing the works of Richard Pearce and Karel Kachyňa, it becomes apparent that Karel Kachyňa was more politically motivated out of the two directors. To fully understand this, we need to delve into the backgrounds, careers, and cinematic styles of both directors. Richard Pearce, an American film director, producer, and cinematographer, was born on January 25, 1943, in San Diego, California. Pearce's career took off in the 1970s and continued well into the early 2000s. Among his notable works are the films \\"Heartland\\" (1979), \\"Country\\" (1984), and \\"A Family Thing\\" (1996). In addition to feature films, Pearce's credits consist of several television movies and documentaries, including \\"The Road Home\\" (1995) and \\"The Long Walk Home\\" (1990). His work, while occasionally touching on socially relevant issues, such as civil rights and rural life, is generally considered more focused on human emotion, relationships, and personal growth than political or ideological themes. Karel Kachyňa, on the other hand, was a Czech film director born on May 1, 1924, in Vysoké nad Jizerou, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). Kachyňa's career, spanning from the late 1940s to the early 2000s, was heavily influenced by the political landscape and history of his homeland. Living through key moments in history like the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, World War II, and the subsequent decades-long period of Communist rule, Kachyňa's films often directly addressed political and social issues within the context of the Czechoslovakia of his time. Some of Kachyňa's most notable films, like \\"The Ear\\" (1970) and \\"Ucho\\" (1970), were explicitly political, exploring themes such as state surveillance, distrust, and paranoia fostered by an oppressive political system. Due to the nature of his work, Kachyňa often faced censorship and oppression from the Communist regime. Some of his films were either banned or heavily censored by the government, which further confirms Kachyňa's strong political motivations in filmmaking. Other works by Kachyňa, such as \\"Ať žije republika\\" (1965) and \\"Krava\\" (1994), tackled historically significant events, human rights issues, and the aftermath of political and social upheaval. Throughout his career, Kachyňa became widely recognized as a filmmaker who stood up for democratic values and freedom of expression despite facing the constraints of a heavily controlled state. In conclusion, when comparing the two directors, it is apparent that Karel Kachyňa was more politically motivated in his work than Richard Pearce. Kachyňa's films tackled various social and political issues unique to his home country, often directly confronting oppressive regimes and advocating for democracy and freedom. Pearce's work, while encompassing socially relevant themes, focused more on human emotion and individual experiences. Consequently, Karel Kachyňa stands out as the more politically motivated of the two directors, using his art to shed light on the struggles and upheaval faced by his fellow citizens during turbulent times."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the below conversation.

It seems uncharacteristic for him not to keep his word, especially when he specifies a time like that. There could be several reasons for his delay – perhaps he encountered unexpected traffic, had a last-minute personal issue to deal with, or even misunderstood the timing for the meeting. I would recommend giving him a few more minutes just in case his delay was unavoidable, and then perhaps try reaching out to him to confirm if he is still on his way. It's also a good idea to check if he has tried to contact either of you to communicate any changes or updates about his plans. In the meantime, it's essential to remain calm and patient and not to jump to conclusions until you have more information. If it becomes clear that he cannot join you as initially planned, you may need to discuss rescheduling the meeting or proceeding without him, depending on the importance of his contribution and the urgency of the matter being discussed.

Love, on the other hand, increases over time from mere attraction to something deeper. Think about what you like and don't like about your crush. Seeing your reasons on paper might help you to better assess your feelings. Noting their drawbacks will toss a little cold water on your passions and let you think a little clearer about what it is that you do like. Make each side as long as you can. Don't worry about how major or trivial each pro or con is. Write down everything that comes to mind. You could include: Pros: good-looking, kind, someone I can talk to Cons: disorganized, immature at times, can be needy Analyze your pros and cons in terms of whether you're looking at reality or an idealized image of your crush. Circle or highlight which pros intensify your feelings and which cons don't affect how you feel. Evaluate whether those reasons are trivial or significant. If you can't accept the whole person—flaws and all—you're not in love. For example, you might be in love if you overlook their messiness because you're too busy appreciating their generosity or engaging conversations. On the other hand, you might not be in love if the sight of them makes feel warm and fuzzy, but you can't imagine a future with them. Pay attention to whether you share their happiness or sadness when they tell you good or bad news. For example, if you start to tear up when your crush tearfully tells you their grandmother died, you're feeling their pain. This is a good sign that you're in love. Ask yourself whether you mean it when you say, “I miss you.” Most lasting romantic love has an underlying bond that remains relatively steady over time. This doesn't mean you fret over missing them every second; in fact, that would be an unhealthy kind of attachment. But, missing your partner and wanting to bond with them is a key element of love. Imagine your life in five or ten years. Consider the impact of career changes, children, and relocations. Consider whether you're willing to face minor and life-threatening illnesses with this person. Think about taking care of them—or them taking care of you—as you grow old. If you can imagine a long-term future with this person, it's probably love. This doesn't mean you've done a complete 180 on your personality. Rather, reflect on whether you've expanded your horizons as a result of your crush. For example, maybe you never considered spending your weekend planting trees before your crush asked you to join them on a reforesting project. Now that you've done it, you feel this newfound connection with nature, and you owe it all to them. If you feel like this person has changed you for the better, it could be love. Take a mental note of how you feel the next time you and your crush do unexciting, everyday things together. For example, you normally hate grocery shopping but suddenly look forward to it because they're going to be with you. This is a sign that you could be in love. On the other hand, if you're still bored to tears and can't wait to do something fun, it's probably just infatuation. ” Notice how you feel when your crush talks to your potential rivals. Make a note of how you feel when those potential rivals flirt with your crush. You should also consider whether you suspect your crush might lose interest in you as a result of the flirtation. Periodic jealousy is actually a healthy reaction that can make you want to hang on to someone a bit tighter. In fact, you could be in love if you feel it. On the other hand, if you're suspicious and feel the urge to spy on your crush, it's not love. At least it's not healthy love. It's likely gone beyond infatuation into 'obsession'. Summary:","output":"The article helps you figure out if you are in love with your crush by considering your feelings, pros and cons, imagining a future together, how they make you feel in everyday situations, and dealing with potential rivals."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - A given name (also known as a personal name, Christian name, first name, or forename) is a part of a person's full nomenclature. It identifies a specific person, and differentiates that person from other members of a group, such as a family or clan, with whom that person shares a common surname. The term \\"given name\\" refers to the fact that the name usually is \\"bestowed\\" upon a person, normally \\"given\\" to a child by its parents at or near the time of birth. This contrasts with a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name), which is normally inherited, and shared with other members of the child's immediate family. - Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) standard and published as \\"The Unicode Standard\\", the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 128,000 characters covering 135 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). , the most recent version is \\"Unicode 9.0\\". The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium. - A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek \\"sýn\\" (\\"with\\") and \\"ónoma\\" (\\"name\\"). An example of synonyms are the words \\"begin\\", \\"start\\", \\"commence\\", \\"initiate\\", \\"fun\\", \\"pleasing\\" . Words can be synonymous when meant in certain senses, even if they are not synonymous in all of their senses. For example, if one talks about a \\"long time\\" or an \\"extended time\\", \\"long\\" and \\"extended\\" are synonymous within that context. Synonyms with exact meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. Some academics call the former type cognitive synonyms to distinguish them from the latter type, which they call near-synonyms. - A surname or family name is a name added to a given name. In many cases, a surname is a family name and many dictionaries define \\"surname\\" as a synonym of \\"family name\\". In the Western Hemisphere, it is commonly synonymous with last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's given name there. - In the German alphabet, the (traditionally lowercase-only) letter ß, called Eszett or scharfes S, in English \\"sharp S\\", is a consonant that evolved as a ligature of \\"long s and z\\" (z) and \\"long s over round s\\" (s). It is pronounced (see IPA). Since the German orthography reform of 1996, it is used only after long vowels and diphthongs while \\"ss\\" is written after short vowels. The name \\"Eszett\\" comes from the two letters S and Z as they are pronounced in German. Its Unicode encoding is U+00DF. - The long, medial, or descending s () is a form of the minuscule (lower-case) letter \\"s\\", which was formerly used where \\"s\\" occurred in the middle or at the beginning of a word (e.g. \\"infulnes\\" for \\"sinfulness\\" and \\"uccesful\\" for \\"successful\\"). The modern letterform was called the \\"terminal\\", \\"round\\", or \\"short\\" s. - The German orthography reform of 1996 (\\"\\") was a change to German spelling and punctuation that was intended to simplify German orthography and thus to make it easier to learn, without substantially changing the rules familiar to users of the language. - Strauss , Strauß or Straus is a common Germanic surname . Outside Germany and Austria Strauß is always spelled Strauss ( the letter \`\` ß '' is not used in the German - speaking part of Switzerland ) . The families using the Strauss name represent a genetically varied group of people of both Jewish and Germanic origin . The name has been used by families in the Germanic area for at least a thousand years . The overlord of Gröna for example , went by the name of Struz and used the image of an ostrich as his symbol . Examples of it could still be seen on the thousand - year - old church bell of that town . \`\` Struz '' or \`\` Strutz '' is the North - German form of the word \`\` Strauss '' , which is the modern German word for an \`\` Ostrich '' . Some of the earliest Jewish bearers of the name hailed from the Judengasse in medieval Frankfurt , where families have been known by the name of the houses they inhabited . All the houses had names and these included Haus Strauss , complete with an image of an ostrich on the façade . When , for tax purposes , Napoleon made surnames obligatory in 1808 , some more Jewish families decided to adopt the Straus ( s ) name . - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere. - A diphthong (or ; from Greek: , \\"diphthongos\\", literally \\"two sounds\\" or \\"two tones\\"), also known as a gliding vowel, is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets: that is, the tongue (and/or other parts of the speech apparatus) moves during the pronunciation of the vowel. In many dialects of English, the phrase \\"no highway cowboys\\" has five distinct diphthongs, one in every syllable. - In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are , pronounced with the lips pronounced with the front of the tongue pronounced with the back of the tongue pronounced in the throat; and , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and and , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals). Contrasting with consonants are vowels. - An orthography is a set of conventions for writing a language.

Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece.

Under her influence, schools were built and children were formally instructed in reading and Christian doctrine. Between 1770 and 1813 some 7,300 ha (18,000 acres) of land on the hills were enclosed, mainly with dry stone walls that today form a key part of the landscape.

But Abdullah called for the country to remain unified as it faces a difficult transfer of power, after Karzai's 13-year rule ends and as 50,000 US-led troops wind down their battle against Taliban insurgents. \\"We don't want partition of Afghanistan, we want to preserve national unity and the dignity of Afghanistan,\\" he said. \\"We don't want civil war. We want stability, not division.\\" Earlier, the United States issued a strong warning to Abdullah over reports that he would form a \\"parallel government\\" in defiance of the results from the run-off election - which said Ghani took 56.4 per cent of the vote to Abdullah's 43.5 percent. Any power grab would cost the country international aid, Washington said. In the eight-man first-round election on April 5, Abdullah was far ahead with 45 per cent against Ghani's 31.6 per cent. Karzai, who is constitutionally barred from a third term in office, has stayed publicly neutral in the lengthy election, but Abdullah supporters accuse him of fixing the vote in Ghani's favour. Turnout on June 14 was more than eight million out of an estimated electorate of 13.5 million, far higher than expected -- fuelling fierce arguments about fraud from both sides. Independent Election Commission head Ahmad Yusuf Nuristani announced the results of the run-off vote on Monday, admitting there had been fraud by the security forces and senior government officials. Nuristani emphasised that the results would now be subject to auditing and adjudication of complaints, before the official result is released on about July 24. \\"The preliminary result in no way means the announcement of the winner of the election,\\" Nuristani said. \\"A change in the result is possible.\\" Last-minute talks delayed the result announcement, but the two campaigns eventually failed to agree on a proposed fraud probe to clean out thousands of the most suspicious ballot boxes. Ghani, who says he won fairly, was due to speak to reporters later Tuesday. \\"The United States expects Afghan electoral institutions to conduct a full and thorough review of all reasonable allegations of irregularities,\\" US Secretary of State John Kerry said in a strong statement. \\"Any action to take power by extra-legal means will cost Afghanistan the financial and security support of the United States and the international community.\\" Abdullah said he had spoken to US President Barack Obama about the crisis, and that Kerry was due to visit Kabul on Friday. Afghanistan's international backers have lobbied hard to try to ensure a smooth election process, but the contested outcome realised their worst fears and risks setting back gains made since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. The deadlock has tipped politics into turmoil at the same time that the Taliban have underlined their strength with a major offensive in the southern province of Helmand. The insurgents, who see the election as a US plot to control Kabul, threatened to target voters and violence spiked on both polling days, but there was no major militant attack. The UN mission in Afghanistan has highlighted the risk of political tensions spilling over into tribal violence, though protests have so far been peaceful. Ghani attracts much of his support from the Pashtun tribes of the south and east, while Abdullah's loyalists are Tajiks and other northern Afghan groups - echoing the ethnic divisions of the civil war. Karzai is due to hand over power at an inauguration ceremony on August 2.

Just a day before, the Afghan Independent Election Commission released preliminary results that showed Mr. Abdullah, who led in the first round, more than a million votes behind his rival, Ashraf Ghani. American officials had urged the panel not to announce the tally before conducting a widespread audit, the special envoy to Afghanistan, James F. Dobbins, said in an interview with the Voice of America channel here. In a somber speech, Mr. Ghani said Tuesday that he would agree to a thorough audit of 7,100 polling places, which would amount to a review of more than three million ballots. He also urged calm and unity, saying that he regarded Mr. Abdullah as a respected national figure who did not want to hurt the country, but insisting that any talk of a parallel government would remain just that: only talk. “We are all responsible to the people of Afghanistan,” Mr. Ghani said. “This country is a unified nation, and it is enthusiastic about a single government, not a parallel one.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Overnight, supporters from both political camps demonstrated in the streets, each hailing its candidate as the legitimate president despite the caution of election officials that the results were not final. Several powerful allies of Mr. Abdullah have publicly called for him to form a breakaway government, incensed that the administration would release results they say have been engineered by Mr. Ghani, the election commission and President Hamid Karzai. But Mr. Abdullah stopped just short of taking that action on Tuesday. Instead, he asked supporters gathered in Kabul for more time to decide the right course of action, citing the urging of Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, who is coming to Afghanistan on Friday in response to the crisis. Photo “The people of Afghanistan have been asking us to announce our government today, and we can’t disregard this right,” Mr. Abdullah said. “I am not going to betray you — just give me time to defend justice, freedom, the rule of law and the people’s right. Give me time.” The gathering, a few thousand officials, elders and supporters, erupted in anger at his request. Several called on Mr. Abdullah to announce his own government on the spot, yelling over the longtime opposition leader even as he urged them to trust him. Before the speech, supporters in the crowded auditorium ripped a picture of Mr. Karzai from the wall and tore it into pieces, an action Mr. Abdullah later chastised them for. Lurking beneath the surface is a growing fear that long-simmering ethnic tensions could erupt into violence if the crisis is not resolved. While Mr. Abdullah is of mixed ethnicity, his core of supporters hail from the Tajik faction, a group that has long felt cut off from the top tiers of power in Afghanistan. Mr. Ghani owes much of his support to fellow Pashtuns, the country’s largest ethnic group, who have historically ruled the nation. Those long-held feelings of marginalization have helped drive the current animosity among Mr. Abdullah’s supporters. Many say they believe their leaders will never be allowed to govern Afghanistan, regardless of vote counts. Mr. Abdullah’s personal history also feeds the narrative: He withdrew from the 2009 presidential runoff after evidence of widespread fraud was uncovered. While fraud was committed on both sides, he felt he would not get a fair shot in the runoff against his opponent, Mr. Karzai, who is also a Pashtun.

Over the past several weeks, the language of his followers has intensified as each of Mr. Abdullah’s acts of brinkmanship has failed to get election officials to meet his demands. Now, it seems he may have overestimated his ability to curb the crowds he whipped up, as evidenced by the hostile response from his supporters on Tuesday. At no point did the crowd concede to his demands for more time to ponder his next move. After several speakers requested that the crowd calm down and listen, the candidate simply left the stage. Photo Mr. Abdullah’s request for more time offered a potential reprieve for Western officials, who have been trying to broker a resolution. Over the weekend, it briefly appeared as though the two presidential teams were approaching an agreement on an audit of the runoff vote, a condition that Mr. Abdullah laid down before he would agree to rejoin the process. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After working until 3 a.m. Monday, the teams had agreed to four criteria for an audit, though arguments remained over the last two. Then, the election commission decided to release the preliminary results, a red line for the Abdullah campaign, upending the talks. On Tuesday morning, Mr. Abdullah said that Mr. Obama, along with Mr. Kerry, had called to assure him that the United States would stand next to the people of Afghanistan in fighting fraud. Mr. Abdullah was also informed that Mr. Kerry would come to Afghanistan on Friday. The White House confirmed the call, saying that Mr. Obama reiterated the need for a deep review of the voting, but also told Mr. Abdullah that there was no justification for resorting to violent or extra-constitutional measures. During his speech, Mr. Abdullah used the call to justify asking his supporters to be patient. But even as he did so, at least some of his powerful allies were already issuing marching orders. During Mr. Abdullah’s speech, Atta Mohammad Noor, a former warlord and the powerful governor of Balkh Province, issued a statement on Facebook, saying, “From this moment on, we announce our own legitimate government led by Abdullah Abdullah.” The statement offered guidance for followers in the coming days: Do not confront either domestic or foreign security forces, and avoid damaging government institutions and public property. “In any of your moves, prove that you are good and obedient citizens who respect the law,” the statement said. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah has claimed victory in the country's disputed election and has accused fraud for putting him behind in the preliminary results.

In January 1262 reinforcements arrived from the Rhineland, led by Wilhelm VII, Duke of Jülich, who was obliged by Pope Alexander IV to fulfil his crusader duties in Prussia. This army broke the Siege of Königsberg but as soon as the army returned home, the Sambians resumed the siege and were reinforced by Herkus Monte and his Natangians. Herkus was later injured and the Natangians retreated, leaving the Sambians unable to stop supplies reaching the castle and the siege eventually failed. Prussians were more successful capturing castles deeper into the Prussian territory , and the Knights were left only with strongholds in Balga, Elbing, Culm, Thorn, and Königsberg. Most castles fell in 1262-1263, and Bartenstein fell in 1264. The Prussians destroyed captured forts instead of using them for their own defence, so the end of successful sieges meant that large Prussian forces did not have to stay near their home and were then free to operate in other parts of Prussia, raiding the Culmerland and Kuyavia. A recovered Herkus Monte raided Culmerland with a large force and took many prisoners in 1263. On his way back to Natangia, Herkus and his men were confronted by a contingent of their enemies. In the Battle of Löbau that ensued, Prussians killed forty knights, including the Master and the Marshal. The Prussians also received help from Lithuanians and Sudovians. In summer of 1262 Treniota and Shvarn attacked Masovia, killing Duke Siemowit I, and raided Culmerland, provoking Pogesanians to join the uprising. However, assassination of Mindaugas and subsequent dynastic fights prevented Lithuanians from further campaigns. Skalmantas, leader of Sudovians, raided Culm in 1263 and in 1265. Question: Who raided Cumberland and Kuyavia? Answer:","output":"Herkus Monte, a Prussian leader, raided Culmerland (not Cumberland) and Kuyavia with a large force in 1263. Herkus Monte was a key figure in the Great Prussian Uprising against the Teutonic Knights. After recovering from an injury, he led his troops into Culmerland, captured many prisoners, and wreaked havoc in the region."},{"instruction":"Data: name = Alimentum, eatType = restaurant, food = Italian, area = city centre, familyFriendly = no.

Here's a much more detailed version of that missing first step: The process begins with the collection of untreated or contaminated water. This water may come from a variety of sources, such as rivers, lakes, or wells, or even municipal or tap water services. This water is typically filled with a variety of pollutants, such as bacteria, viruses, harmful chemicals, heavy metals, and microplastic particles, and can vary widely in quality and the types of contaminants present. This contamination can result from a wide range of sources, such as naturally occurring minerals and elements, runoff from agricultural or industrial processes, or the byproducts of water treatment processes, such as chlorine or chloramines used to kill bacteria and other microbes. In order to start the purification process, this contaminated water is directed towards the specialized water filter. It's important that there is enough pressure behind the water to push it through the filter effectively. This pressure can be mechanically created in the case of a water filtration system connected to a pressurized water supply. Conversely, in the case of gravity-fed systems or portable filters, the water is often poured into a container above the filter and uses the force of gravity to push the water through. Before the water enters the actual filtration phase, there may be a pre-filtering phase to remove larger particulates, such as sediment, rust, or larger microorganisms, which could clog the finer pores of the main filter. This pre-filtering phase can extend the lifespan of the main filter, enhance its performance, and ensure the water is clear of large particles that would interfere with the main filtration process. This collection and introduction of contaminated water is a crucial process - if not done properly, it could lead to ineffective filtration or faster deterioration of the filter due to excessive pollutants. It sets the stage for the rest of the filtering process - the small pores in the filter can then catch the pollutants, filtering out chlorine, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals. This allows only water and beneficial mineral ions like fluoride to pass through, producing clean, safe, and healthful water on the other side. So, the entire process of water filtering starts from introducing the contaminated or untreated water to the filtration system."},{"instruction":"Use reasoning to lead to the answer of the following question: John put salt on his salad.

These words are usually the nouns, adjectives, and verbs, as they are vital for understanding the core of the sentence. Prepositions, articles, and conjunctions are typically less important, as they mainly serve to connect these more crucial elements. Here's how we can break down the sentence \\"A large bear laying up against a stone wall\\": 1. 'Bear': This is a noun and the main subject of the sentence. It tells us what the sentence is primarily about. 2. 'Large': This is an adjective describing the bear. It provides additional crucial information about the main subject (the bear), thus making it salient. 3. 'Laying': This is a verb detailing the bear's action. The sentence would dramatically change its meaning without this verb. 4. 'Stone wall': This is a compound noun and serves as the object in this sentence—it's what the bear is interacting with. It's important because it provides vital context concerning the bear's position or location. So, the most salient words in this sentence are \\"large,\\" \\"bear,\\" \\"laying,\\" and \\"stone wall\\". These words form the core of the sentence and deliver the primary information, thus making them the most salient or important."},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

After the men have left, Hayes tells Ann, \\"The worst is over\\". He says he is planning to head out and see his family. The scene shifts to San Francisco, where an unmarried couple, Drake Goodman (Modine) and Patty Palmer (Griffith), purchase an expensive 19th-century polychrome house in the exclusive Pacific Heights neighborhood. They rent one of the building's two first-floor apartments to the Watanabes, a kindly Japanese couple who have no children. Not long after, Hayes visits to view the remaining vacant unit and immediately expresses a desire to move in. Hayes drives an expensive Porsche and carries large amounts of cash on his person, but is reluctant to undergo a credit check. He convinces Drake to waive the credit check in exchange for a list of personal references and an upfront payment of the first six months' rent, to be paid by wire transfer. Before any of this money is paid, however, Hayes arrives unannounced one morning and shuts himself into the apartment. As days pass, Drake and Patty grow increasingly impatient when Hayes' wire transfer fails to materialize. From inside the apartment, sounds of loud hammering and drilling are heard at all hours of the day and night, however the door is seldom answered. When Drake finally makes an attempt to enter Hayes' apartment, he finds that the locks have been changed.

Such has been the impact of Asia's first grand slam singles champion in her homeland that tennis chiefs are seeking to bring a bit of Roland Garros to Beijing. A clay court and two giant screens have been set up in one of the city's major shopping malls for an interactive experience that will last until the tournament ends on June 10. \\"I'm very pleased that a country like China follows our prestigious tournament,\\" French Tennis Federation president Jean Gachassin said in a statement. \\"For us, it's an extraordinary opportunity to promote clay-court tennis. I'd like to heartily thank the Chinese Tennis Federation for welcoming us on their home soil for this fabulous event.\\" Courting a country with a population of 1.3 billion makes sense for any sport serious about global growth, and the exhibition has been backed by major sponsors such as Longines, Lacoste and Peugeot. Li has become a marketer's dream in the past 12 months, securing lucrative endorsement deals which have made her the second highest-paid athlete in the world behind fellow tennis star Maria Sharapova. Her hopes of being around for next weekend's women's final remained alive after she came from behind to beat young American Christina McHale on Saturday. The 30-year-old rebounded from a first-set debacle in which she made 24 unforced errors to triumph 3-6 6-2 6-1 and earn a last-16 clash with Kazakh qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova. The world No. 7 had a surprisingly tough match against an opponent 10 years her junior and 29 places lower in the rankings, one who lost in the first round in Paris last year and in 2010. \\"Tennis is best of three sets, so even if I lose the first set, I still have a chance,\\" said Li, who is the only Chinese player left in the tournament after Peng Shuai lost to Sharapova on Saturday. \\"In the first set I was just following what she was doing. I felt like she was the champion on the court. But I changed a little bit at the beginning of the second set to play my way, and I'm happy I was able to do that today.\\" Li beat Francesca Schiavone in last year's final, but the 2010 French Open champion will not feature in the second week of this tournament after suffering a 3-6 6-3 8-6 defeat by Uzbekistan-born American Varvara Lepchenko. The 63rd-ranked Lepchenko's reward for beating the Italian is a daunting clash with fourth-seeded Czech Petra Kvitova, who battled to a 6-2 4-6 6-1 win against Russia's world No. 109 Nina Bratchikova. Second-ranked Sharapova cruised into the fourth round as she crushed 28th seed Peng 6-2 6-1 to set up a clash with Czech Klara Zakopalova, who defeated Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. The 25-year-old Sharapova was a semifinalist here last year and in 2007, but the Russian may finally win the only grand slam title to elude her if she can keep up the form that has seen her drop just five games in three matches so far. However, fellow former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki must continue her agonizing wait for a first major title. The Dane, now ranked ninth, saved four match-points before losing 1-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 against Estonian 23rd seed Kaia Kanepi. Kanepi blew 5-1 leads in the last two sets, but held her nerve to earn a last-16 clash with 21-year-old Dutch player Arantxa Rus. Last year Rus beat former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters before losing in round three, and she has gone one step further after eliminating German 25th seed Julia Gorges 7-6 (7-5) 2-6 6-2 in a match that ended as darkness fell.

Your task is to generate label \\"yes\\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \\"no\\". Input: Abstract: Limited neural input results in muscle weakness in neuromuscular disease because of a reduction in the density of muscle innervation, the rate of neuromuscular junction activation or the efficiency of synaptic transmission. We developed a small-molecule fast-skeletal-troponin activator, CK-2017357, as a means to increase muscle strength by amplifying the response of muscle when neural input is otherwise diminished secondary to neuromuscular disease. Binding selectively to the fast-skeletal-troponin complex, CK-2017357 slows the rate of calcium release from troponin C and sensitizes muscle to calcium. As a consequence, the force-calcium relationship of muscle fibers shifts leftwards, as does the force-frequency relationship of a nerve-muscle pair, so that CK-2017357 increases the production of muscle force in situ at sub-maximal nerve stimulation rates. Notably, we show that sensitization of the fast-skeletal-troponin complex to calcium improves muscle force and grip strength immediately after administration of single doses of CK-2017357 in a model of the neuromuscular disease myasthenia gravis. Troponin activation may provide a new therapeutic approach to improve physical activity in diseases where neuromuscular function is compromised..

Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from \\"Scarface\\". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled \\"American Dream\\". Anybody complaining about the \\"cheesiness\\" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana. This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another. The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa. Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. \\"Scarface\\" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you).

It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000.

An employee at Danny's Cycles in Gramercy said Citi Bike is a good option for people in a city famed for its traffic jams and aggressive drivers. \\"They can try out a bike without buying one:' James Ryan said. Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny's Cycles. But for Frank's Bike Shop, a small business on Grand St., the bike-share program has been bad news. Owner Frank Arroyo said that his rental business has decreased by 90% since Citi Bike was launched last month. Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists, who have since been drawn away by Citi Bikes. However, Ben said the bike-share is good for bike sales at his shop. \\"People have used the bike-share and realized how great it is to bike in the city, then decide that they want something nicer for themselves,\\" he noted. Christian Farrell of Waterfront Bicycle Shop, on West St. said at first he was concerned about bike-share, though, he admitted, \\"I was happy to see people on bikes.\\" Farrell's early concerns were repeated by Andrew Crooks, owner of NYC Velo, at 64 Second Ave. \\"It seemed like a great idea, but one that would be difficult to put into use:' Crooks said of Citi Bike.

Those rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of boulder clay deposited during the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the Mersey Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. The bogs in the area between the River Glaze in the west, and Worsley and Eccles in the east, to the north of what was the River Irwell – now the Manchester Ship Canal – are known collectively as Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a lowland raised bog. In areas where drainage is poor, water-logging can slow down plant decomposition, producing peat, which over the years can raise the level of the bog above that of the surrounding land. The moss occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles (27.5 km2), and is about 5 miles (8 km) long, about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) across at its widest point, lying 75 feet (23 m) above sea level. Chat Moss lies mainly in Salford, but extends into Wigan. By the 1990s, an estimated 72 per cent of the bog had been reclaimed, most of it for agriculture. About 230 acres (93 ha) of degraded bog remain, with 766 acres (310 ha) of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites.

What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides guidance on the process of preparing and using a paintbrush for blending techniques in painting. It emphasizes the importance of pre-soaking the brush in water, removing excess water, and suggests suitable brush types such as flat, fan, round, or filbert brushes. The article also discusses the option of pre-wetting the canvas to counteract fast-drying paints, while noting the need to work quickly when using this approach."},{"instruction":"Campaigners set up camp at Upton, near Chester, in April 2014 to prevent testing by energy company IGas. In November, they were served with a court order compelling them to leave the site. Cheshire Police said two men had been arrested for \\"obstructing police\\" and another for \\"obstructing the highway\\". A man and woman were arrested for obstructing a high court officer, while another man was arrested for \\"failing to comply with a Section 35 notice\\", a spokeswoman said. Another man was arrested for police assault, another for aggravated trespass. She added that more than 20 dispersal notices had been issued. The BBC's Cheshire political reporter Phil McCann said about 30 protesters had been at the camp but all protesters had been evicted. Supporters had entered an adjacent field but bailiffs ushered them out and police escorted them away. Camp resident Phil Whyte, who was there since the day it was set up, said he had left of his own accord, because he was \\"cold, tired and worried about my cat\\". Bailiffs, supported by police from Cheshire and North Wales, arrived at the site at about 10:00 GMT to begin the eviction process. A woman was treated at the scene by paramedics at 12:28 GMT and declined to be taken to hospital, according to a spokesperson for the North West Ambulance Service. For the first two hours, there was a stand-off between the bailiffs, police and protesters - then we saw the first arrest as a man was carried horizontally through a field. After seven hours of action the camp was quiet by 17:00 GMT, when the last of the protesters was taken down. He was arrested, but many others left of their own free will. It's clear the campers didn't manage to resist for as long as they may have hoped, but their 20-month stay is meant to serve as a serious deterrent to any companies wanted to frack. A Cheshire Police spokeswoman said the force expected a \\"protracted\\" operation and closed Duttons Lane, which leads to the camp. She added that officers were \\"monitoring the situation and ensuring public safety\\". Since being served the eviction notice, the protesters constructed an elaborate series of fortifications, including a network of tunnels, walls and a moat to try to prevent their removal. Frack Free Dee Coalition said protesters would take \\"peaceful direct action\\" and would do \\"everything we can to defend ourselves\\". Member Anna Davies said her group's position had not changed. \\"We are resisting - we will resist,\\" she said. An IGas spokesman said the company \\"respect the right to peaceful protest, [but] these protesters are trespassing as determined by the High Court\\". The planning permission for IGas to run tests at the site runs out on 28 May. This article was about:","output":"In a place called Upton, near Chester, some people called campaigners set up a camp in 2014 to stop a company called IGas from testing the land for energy. The campaigners didn't want the company to do something called fracking, which they believe is not good for the environment. In November, the people in the camp were told by a court that they had to leave. Recently, the police came to the camp to help make sure everyone left. Some people didn't want to go and they were arrested, while others left by themselves. The police also gave out notices telling people they needed to go. By the end of the day, all the people had left the camp. Even though the camp is now empty, the campaigners hope that their long stay will make other companies think twice before they want to do fracking. The IGas company still has permission to test the land, but only until May 28th."},{"instruction":"States are justified in waging war to respond to terrorist attacks when they do so in self-defense. Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","output":"Okay, imagine you are at the playground with your friends, and someone tries to take away your toys or hurt you. You would want to protect yourself and your toys, right? And if they keep trying to hurt you, you might ask a grown-up for help to stop them. Now, think about countries as big playgrounds. A state, or a country, has many people living in it, and their job is to protect everyone in the country, like parents protect their kids. If a terrorist attack happens, it's like a bully at the playground hurting the kids. So, the country might need to wage (start) a war to protect the people and keep them safe, just like how you would try to protect yourself and your toys at the playground. Some evidence to support this claim can be: 1. History - In the past, countries have started wars after big terrorist attacks to protect their people, like how the USA started a war against terrorists in Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks. 2. International Law - The United Nations, which is like a big club of countries, says that countries have the right to protect themselves if they are attacked, just like you would defend yourself at the playground. Remember, it's always a good idea to try peaceful ways to solve problems first, like talking to the bully or even ignoring them. But sometimes countries have to wage a war to protect their people from those trying to hurt them."},{"instruction":"The South General hospital already has a walk-in centre which provides urgent care for women who have been raped or sexually assaulted.

In Sweden, 370 cases of sexual assault on men or boys were recorded last year, which highlights the need for equal access to emergency care for both men and women. Dr. Lotti Helstrom of South General hospital pointed out that the general perception is that men cannot be raped, and the topic remains \\"extremely taboo\\", even if it is more common than people think. The South General hospital already offers a 24-hour emergency service for female rape victims, facilitating access to medical professionals such as doctors, midwives, nurses, psychologists, and social workers. The expansion of these services to include male victims aims to provide equal access to much-needed emergency care for both genders. Moreover, the decision to admit men and boys in the walk-in centre has been welcomed and supported by the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU). Inger Bjorklund, a spokesperson for RFSU, said that having a clinic that focuses on men would help raise the awareness of sexual abuse experiences among men, thus contributing to a more inclusive approach to addressing such sensitive issues in society. In conclusion, the article discusses the decision made by the South General hospital in Sweden to extend their walk-in centre services to include men and boys affected by rape and sexual assault from October. This move is expected to not only provide equal access to emergency care for both genders but also contribute to raising awareness and breaking the taboo surrounding male rape victims.

Stream of thoughts:","output":"When analyzing the given sentence and the statement, we can go through the following thought process: 1. Firstly, it is essential to identify the key elements in the given sentence. The main elements are: a barricade, two women, three children, and a group of men in uniform marching down the road. 2. Next, we should attempt to understand the context. From the sentence, we can understand that the barricade serves as a barrier between the two groups: the group consisting of two women and three children, and the group of men in uniform marching down the road. 3. Once we have established this context, we can move on to examining the statement: \\"A barricade separates soldiers from their families.\\" To evaluate the truth of this statement, we need to determine whether the group of men in uniform can be considered soldiers, and if the women and children can be thought of as their families. 4. By stating that the men are in uniform and marching down the road, it is reasonable to assume that they could be soldiers, as those actions are typical of military personnel. 5. The challenging part is to determine if the two women and three children are, in fact, the families of these soldiers. The initial sentence does not provide clear evidence that confirms this relationship. 6. Based on the information provided, the statement \\"A barricade separates soldiers from their families\\" can be considered a plausible interpretation. However, it's essential to keep in mind that there is not enough information to confirm the relationship between the two groups definitively. Therefore, it's not entirely accurate to conclude that the statement is true, as we lack sufficient evidence. The statement can be considered a likely interpretation but not a confirmed fact."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are given a sentence in English.

The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal.

The law, officially called Royal Decree 687/2005, was established in Spain in 2005 as a tax incentive for foreign workers temporarily residing in Spain. It allowed them to pay taxes at a lower rate than Spanish residents, providing a significant benefit for high-income individuals such as professional footballers. David Beckham is an iconic English footballer who played as a midfielder for clubs like Manchester United, Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, and Paris Saint-Germain, as well as for the England national team. He is known for his exceptional free-kick skills, accurate crosses, and bending shots. Beckham joined the Spanish football club Real Madrid from Manchester United in 2003, and this Spanish tax law was introduced in 2005. His name became associated with the tax law since he was one of the first signatories of the deal and received significant media attention for taking advantage of it. This linked the tax law to Beckham in the public's mind and it eventually became popularly known as the \\"Beckham Law.\\" David Beckham retired from professional football in 2013.

Are Arenaria and Sciadopitys verticillata part of the same family? Answer:","output":"Arenaria and Sciadopitys verticillata are not part of the same family. In order to understand their taxonomic differences, it is essential to delve deeper into their classifications. Arenaria, commonly known as sandworts, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. This family falls under the order Caryophyllales. The Caryophyllaceae family comprises herbaceous plants characterized by opposite, simple leaves and small, usually white or pink flowers that form a cyme or solitary inflorescence. The genus Arenaria encompasses roughly 90 to 100 species and is mostly native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Some well-known species in this genus include Arenaria montana, Arenaria serpyllifolia, and Arenaria rubra. On the other hand, Sciadopitys verticillata, commonly known as the Japanese umbrella pine or kōyamaki, is the only species in the genus Sciadopitys, which belongs to the family Sciadopityaceae. This family is under the order Pinales, which is a group of gymnosperms. The Sciadopityaceae family is characterized by distinctive whorls of evergreen, needle-like foliage. The Japanese umbrella pine is endemic to Japan, where it grows in moist, cool regions at higher elevations. It has unique characteristics, such as growing bifacially flattened shoots with leaves arranged in an umbrella-like pattern, which is the reason behind its common name. As previously mentioned, Arenaria belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family within the order Caryophyllales, while Sciadopitys verticillata is in the family Sciadopityaceae under the order Pinales. These two families belong to two different orders, and the plants themselves exhibit significantly different characteristics. For example, the Caryophyllaceae family (Arenaria) consists of herbaceous, flowering plants that typically produce small flowers. These plants are mostly found in the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, the Sciadopityaceae family (Sciadopitys verticillata) has gymnosperm characteristics with evergreen foliage and is native to Japan. In summary, Arenaria and Sciadopitys verticillata are not part of the same family.

As we enter the second half of the year, our company is transitioning into the performance review process. To make this exercise fruitful for both you and the organization, I would like to share the important updates and the guidelines that we must all follow during the performance review process. The purpose of performance evaluations is to provide constructive feedback to employees, recognize achievements, address areas of improvement, and ensure alignment between individual and organizational goals. This year, we have made some changes to the previously followed process in order to make it more efficient and result-oriented. Here's an overview of the key steps in our new Performance Review Process: 1. Self-Assessment: Each employee is required to complete a self-assessment form by [Due Date]. This form will help you evaluate your own performance and achievements during the assessment period. Reflect on your strengths, areas of improvement, and contributions towards the organization's objectives. 2. Manager's Evaluation: After you have submitted your self-assessment, your manager will review your performance during the year and provide their feedback. They will consider factors such as job responsibilities, the achievement of targets, collaboration with team members, and your professional development. 3. 360-Degree Feedback: In addition to your manager's evaluation, we encourage everyone to participate in the 360-degree feedback process. This approach incorporates feedback from your colleagues, subordinates (if any), and other stakeholders, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of your performance. 4. Review Meeting: You will have a one-on-one meeting with your manager to discuss the feedback and evaluations. This meeting offers an opportunity to share additional insights, ask questions, and express any concerns you may have. 5. Goal Setting and Development Plan: Based on the feedback received during the review meeting, you and your manager will set performance objectives and discuss the professional development plans that address identified areas of improvement for the upcoming year. Please adhere to the following guidelines during the performance review process: 1. Honesty and Self-Awareness – When completing the self-assessment, be honest and self-aware of your performance and contributions. This will not only help you grow but also build a strong foundation for your professional development. 2. Confidentiality – Treat all information shared during the review process with utmost confidentiality. Refrain from discussing other employees' performance, ratings, or feedback with anyone outside the process. 3. Timeliness – Adhere to the deadlines for completing self-assessments and providing feedback. Promptness ensures the process stays on track and eliminates any unnecessary delays. 4. Constructive Criticism – When providing feedback, whether for yourself or others, remember to convey it constructively. Focus on helping colleagues recognize areas where they can improve and offer solutions or resources that can facilitate their development. 5. Open Communication – Keep an open mind, and be receptive to feedback. Be willing to discuss your viewpoint and consider alternate perspectives to ensure a productive dialogue during the review process. To assist you in navigating the new performance review process, we will be conducting a training session on [Date and Time]. We highly recommend that you attend this session to gain a comprehensive understanding of the process, the expectations, and the tools/resources available. Should you have any questions or concerns regarding the performance review process, feel free to reach out to your manager or the HR team for assistance. Thank you for your cooperation, dedication, and commitment to excellence.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Stephen F. Austin was commander of the existing unpaid volunteer Texian army, and at his urging the Consultation of 1835 convened in San Felipe de Austin on November 3 of that year. Their creation of a provisional government based on the 1824 constitution established the General Council as a legislative body with each municipality allotted one representative. Henry Smith was elected governor without any clearly defined powers of the position. Sam Houston was in attendance as the elected representative from Nacogdoches, and also served as commander of the Nacogdoches militia. Edward Burleson replaced Austin as commander of the volunteer army on December 1. On December 10, the General Council called new elections to choose delegates to determine the fate of the region. The Consultation approved the creation of the Provisional Army of Texas, a paid force of 2,500 troops. Houston was named commander-in-chief of the new army and issued a recruitment Proclamation on December 12. The volunteer army under Burleson disbanded on December 20.Harrisburg was designated the seat of a deeply divided provisional government on December 30. Most of the General Council wanted to remain part of Mexico, but with the restoration of the 1824 constitution. Governor Smith supported the opposing faction who advocated for complete independence. Smith dissolved the General Council on January 10, 1836, but it was unclear if he had the power to do that. He was impeached on January 11. The power struggle effectively shut down the government.The Convention of 1836 met at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1.

Question: In the movie, why do Barbra and Johnny Blair drive to Pennsylvania? Movie title: Night of the Living Dead Movie plot: Johnny (Bill Moseley) and Barbara (Patricia Tallman) are visiting their mother's grave in a cemetery out in the middle of nowhere. During their visit, Barbara sees a man sobbing and mummering \\"I'm sorry,\\" when out of nowhere, Barbara is attacked by a zombie. Her brother comes to defend her, but is killed. Barbara runs for help and finds a seemingly abandoned farmhouse. Then, Ben (Tony Todd) shows up to the house with a crow bar, saying there are these creatures everywhere. The two proceed to clear the house of zombies and begin barricading the doors and windows.However, they discover that they aren't alone in the house. Married couple Harry and Helen Cooper (Tom Towles and McKee Anderson), their daughter Sarah (Heather Mazur) , and teenage couple Tom Landry and Judy Rose Larson (William Butler and Katie Finneran) are all survivors who had been hiding in the cellar. What follows are the attempts by the survivors to defend the house under siege from the undead. The group is left divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a \\"death trap\\" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that they should all leave the house on foot while they still can after she notices that the zombies are very slow and that they can just \\"walk right past them\\". An argument between Ben and Harry leaves the Coopers in the basement tending to their daughter, who was bitten by a zombie and is near death, and the remaining members of the group upstairs to continue their work reinforcing the doors and windows.

This visit is most likely driven by a sense of responsibility and to pay respects to their deceased mother. Family gatherings and visiting grave sites of loved ones is a common tradition in many cultures, and it provides an opportunity for the living to honor the memory of those who have passed away. It also serves as a bonding experience for the family members who make the visit together. The plot of the movie revolves around the unexpected zombie attack that occurs while Johnny and Barbara are at the cemetery. This sets the stage for a relentless, life-or-death battle against the zombies, as they are joined by other survivors who have been hiding in the farmhouse. As the group of survivors grapples with the best strategy to stay alive and defend themselves against the undead, the importance of their visit to the cemetery fades into the background, becoming secondary to their new purpose: survival. However, it's worth mentioning that the visit to the cemetery acts as a catalyst for the events that unfold throughout the film. If Johnny and Barbara hadn't gone to visit their mother's grave, they wouldn't have stumbled upon the zombie outbreak, and the movie's narrative would have been entirely different. To determine whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal, it's essential to take into consideration various factors, such as the budget required for making the movie, the intended audience, the potential box office revenue, and the current popularity of the horror and zombie genres. Additionally, it's essential to analyze the film's script quality, the director's vision, the caliber of the actors, and the overall production value. Given the summary provided, \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" appears to have a suspenseful and engaging plot that could resonate well with horror and zombie movie enthusiasts. The characters' conflicting survival strategies could lead to exciting action scenes and compelling interpersonal drama. However, it's important to assess the film proposal holistically to make an informed decision regarding its investment potential."},{"instruction":"What is the penultimate purpose of life? What purpose do you find in life? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The questions \\"What is the penultimate purpose of life?\\" and \\"What purpose do you find in life?\\" do not exactly have the same meaning, though both relate to the broader topic of life's purpose. The first question asks for the second most crucial or important purpose of life, given the interpretation of \\"penultimate\\" as \\"second to the last.\\" This question assumes that life has an overarching set of purposes or goals, and it is asking for the second most significant in that list. However, this question can be challenging to answer as it is a philosophical inquiry and heavily depends on one's cultural, religious, and personal beliefs. Additionally, assuming that life has a fixed set of ordered purposes is also a controversial matter. From a biological perspective, the fundamental purpose might be survival and reproduction, whereas from a humanistic perspective, it could involve finding personal meaning, happiness, connection, and contribution to society. Philosophically, some propose that life has no inherent purpose, and it is up to each individual to create their own. Therefore, identifying a singular 'penultimate' purpose can be complex and different for everyone. On the other hand, the second question \\"What purpose do you find in life?\\" is more personally focused. It asks for an individual's interpretation of what gives their life meaning or purpose. This could be anything from raising a family and achieving personal success to contributing to one's community, learning, experiencing joy, or seeking truth and wisdom. As with the first question, the answer would largely depend on individual values, beliefs, and experiences. In essence, while both questions revolve around the central idea of life's purpose, the first one posits an ordered list of universal life purposes and asks about the second highest on that hypothetical list. The second question bypasses universal assumptions and asks for individual interpretation, what gives life purpose to the person answering the question. So, their meanings, while related, are different in their scope - one is general/universal, and the other is personal."},{"instruction":"Q: Which of the following two sentences does not make sense?

As life in Paris returned to normal, in June 1871, Bizet's appointment as chorus-master at The Opéra was seemingly confirmed by its director, Émile Perrin. Bizet was due to begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused to take up the position as a protest against what he thought was the director's unjustified closing of Ernest Reyer's opera Erostrate after only two performances. Bizet resumed work on Clarissa Harlowe and Grisélidis, but plans for the latter to be staged at the Opéra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive. Bizet's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled Jeux d'enfants, and a one-act opera, Djamileh, which opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music. It closed after 11 performances, not to be heard again until 1938. On 10 July Geneviève gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, Jacques. Bizet's next major assignment came from Carvalho, who was now managing Paris' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne. When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and Massenet, Bizet fashioned a four-movement suite from the music, which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception. In the winter of 1872–73, Bizet supervised preparations for a revival of the still-absent Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at the Opéra-Comique. Relations between the two had been cool for some years, but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor's request for help, writing: \\"You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you\\".In June 1872, Bizet informed Galabert: \\"I have just been ordered to compose three acts for the Opéra-Comique. [Henri] Meilhac and [Ludovic]...

Out of these 60 eggs, 3/4 of them hatched. To calculate the number of eggs that hatched, multiply the total number of eggs by the fraction of eggs that hatched: 60 eggs * (3/4) = 45 eggs hatched. These 45 hatched eggs now represent new doves. To find the total number of doves Giselle has, we add the initial number of doves (20) to the new number of hatched eggs (45): 20 doves + 45 hatched eggs (doves) = 65 doves.

What are some examples of it? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options: 1). no 2). yes","output":"The Matching Principle is an essential concept in accounting that guides the recognition of revenues and expenses for financial reporting purposes. It is based on the accrual accounting method, and it states that expenses should be reported in the same accounting period as the revenues those expenses helped generate. The principle helps ensure that the financial statements provide a more accurate and consistent representation of a company's financial performance during a specific period. By matching expenses with corresponding revenues, the matching principle helps maintain the integrity and comparability of financial statements. There are several examples of the matching principle in practice. Some of the most common include: 1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): When a business sells a product, the cost related to producing or acquiring that product must be recorded in the same accounting period as the revenue from the sale. For example, if a company sells a car for 50,000 and the cost to manufacture that car was 40,000, the company recognizes revenue of 50,000 and COGS of 40,000 in the same period, resulting in a gross profit of 10,000. 2. Depreciation and Amortization: Companies typically purchase fixed assets like buildings, machinery, and equipment for use in their operations over a long period. To spread the cost of those assets over their useful life, businesses use depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is used for tangible assets (e.g., buildings, machinery), while amortization is for intangible assets (e.g., patents, copyrights). By allocating a portion of the asset's cost to each period, the matching principle ensures that the expense is recognized in correlation with the revenue generated from the use of that asset. 3. Prepaid Expenses: Some expenses are paid in advance, such as insurance premiums, rent, or subscriptions. These expenses are initially recorded as assets and then gradually expensed over the usage period. For instance, suppose a company pays a 12,000 annual insurance premium in advance. In that case, it will recognize a 1,000 expense each month for 12 months, matching the expense recognition with the passage of time and the benefit received from the insurance coverage. 4. Salaries and Wages: Employees' salaries and wages are expenses that need to be matched with the period in which they were earned. For example, if employees are paid bi-weekly, a company must allocate half of the monthly salary expense to each of the two payment periods. This ensures that the expense matches the period during which labor was provided to generate revenue. 5. Deferred Revenues: When a business receives payment in advance for products or services, it records the payment as a liability called deferred revenue or unearned revenue. As the product is delivered or the service is provided over time, the business recognizes the revenue, matching it to the expense incurred in delivering the service or product, like labor and materials consumed. Regarding your second question, the two sentences are essentially asking the same thing. Both are inquiring about the meaning of the matching principle and requesting examples of its application. Thus, the answer to your question would be option 2: yes, both sentences are essentially the same."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The movie begins in 1942 with some German troops relaxing in Italy.

เวลาประมาณ 09.00 น. ที่จุฬาลงกรณ์มหาวิทยาลัย สถาบันวิจัยสังคมจุฬาฯ จัดเวทีเสวนาหัวข้อ “โรงไฟฟ้าถ่านหินกับผลกระทบต่อระบบเกษตรอินทรีย์” กรณี โครงการโรงไฟฟ้าพลังความร้อน 600 เมกะวัตต์ ฉะเชิงเทรา มีนักวิชาการอิสระและภาคประชาสังคมเข้าร่วมสรุปผลว่า โรงไฟฟ้าถ่านหินเขาหินซ้อนส่งผลกระทบต่อเกษตรอินทรีย์ ประชาชนในพื้นที่ร่วมคัดค้านโครงการฯ อย่างเข้มแข็ง ล่าสุดกลุ่มทุนยื่นรายงานผลกระทบสุขภาพและสิ่งแวดล้อม (EHIA) ต่อคณะกรรมการเชี่ยวชาญ (คชก.) รอบที่ 4 ขณะที่ขบวนการเกษตรอินทรีย์ จ.ฉะเชิงเทรา นัดรวมตัวกว่า 100 คนเพื่อรอรับฟังผลวันพรุ่งนี้ (16 มี.ค.60) แต่สํานักนโยบายและแผนทรัพยากรธรรมชาติและสิ่งแวดล้อม (สผ.) แจ้งเลื่อนพิจารณาเป็นวันที่ 23 มี.ค.60 โดยที่ขบวนการเกษตรอินทรีย์ ยังยืนยันขอปกป้องแหล่งอาหารและน้ำที่มีความอุดมสมบูรณ์

ผู้ประสานงานเครือข่ายเกษตรกรรมทางเลือก จ.ฉะเชิงเทรา กล่าวว่า โครงการโรงไฟฟ้าถ่านหินเขาหินซ้อน ชาวบ้าน จ.ฉะเชิงเทราร่วมต่อสู้กันตั้งแต่ปี 2550 เนื่องจากเราพัฒนาการเกษตรและสร้างความเข้มแข็ง ศึกษาผลกระทบการทำเกษตรอินทรีย์ ทั้งที่กระบวนการเข้าถึงข้อมูลนั้นยากมาก กลุ่มทุนได้อ้างกฎหมายเอกชนเพื่อไม่ให้ชาวบ้านรับรู้ข้อมูล และชาวบ้านยังถูกการเมืองท้องถิ่นกีดกัน โชคดีที่มีรัฐธรรมนูญ ปี 50 ในมาตราที่เกี่ยวข้อง เราจึงยื่นหนังสือต่อคณะกรรมการสิทธิมนุษยชนแห่งชาติเพื่อปกป้องพื้นที่ความมั่นคงทางอาหาร ที่เราจะยอมไม่ได้ นันทวรรณ กล่าวถึงโครงการโรงไฟฟ้าพลังความร้อน 600 เมกะวัตต์ ฉะเชิงเทรา เพิ่มเติมว่า โครงการนี้จะส่งผลกระทบต่อพืชผักเกษตรอินทรีย์ เนื่องจากมีโรงไฟฟ้าชีวมวลขนาดย่อยในพื้นที่ที่ใช้ถ่านหิน จากบริษัทในเครือเดียวกัน ได้ส่งผลกระทบต่อสวนมะม่วงจนต้องโค่นทิ้ง เราจึงปฏิเสธไม่ได้ว่าหากมีโรงไฟฟ้าถ่านหินเขาหินซ้อนที่ขนาดใหญ่ขึ้นกว่าเดิม จะทำให้สูญเสียผลผลิตทางอาหารและน้ำจำนวนมาก ซึ่งในรายงาน EHIA ไม่มีการพูดถึงผลกระทบต่อระบบนิเวศ ทั้งที่พื้นที่ฉะเชิงเทราเป็นแหล่งที่มีระบบนิเวศขนาดใหญ่ และเป็นหน่ออ่อนของภาคการเกษตรอินทรีย์ระดับต้นๆ มองนโยบายประเทศไม่ไปในทิศทางเดียวกัน วิฑูรย์ เรืองเลิศปัญญากุล ผู้อำนวยการมูลนิธิสายใจแผ่นดิน กล่าวถึง ประเด็นความปลอดภัยต่างๆ จากโรงไฟฟ้าถ่านหินเขาหินซ้อนไว้ว่า ส่งผลกระทบต่อเกษตรอินทรีย์ เกิดสารปนเปื้อน โลหะหนัก ปรอทต่อพืชผลทางการเกษตร ด้านพัฒนาการสมองในเด็กแรกเกิด เสนอให้ศึกษาผลกระทบอย่างชัดเจน เนื่องจากรายงาน EHIA ไม่ได้คาดการณ์ความเสี่ยงไว้ และไม่มีคำถามด้านความปลอดภัย ที่สำคัญคือเทคโนโลยีที่ใช้ในโครงการนั้นสะอาดจริงหรือไม่ ได้ติดเครื่องดักจับปรอทจริงหรือเปล่า หากมองภาพปัจจุบันยังไม่ค่อยดีไหร่ในเรื่องการผ่านหรือไม่ผ่านมาตรฐาน และการบริโภคหรือการเลือกซื้อ ไม่ซื้อ เนื่องจากมีสารปนเปื้อนในผลผลิตการเกษตร ส่วนข้อสุดท้ายนั้น เป็นเรื่องปกติที่นโยบายของประเทศไม่ไปในทิศทางเดียวกัน เช่น รัฐบาลประกาศสนับสนุนเกษตรอินทรีย์และปุ๋ยเคมีไปพร้อมกัน ชี้พื้นที่เสี่ยงขาดแคลนน้ำดิบ กัญจน์ ทัตติยกุล เครือข่ายลุ่มน้ำบางปะกง กล่าวว่า ลุ่มน้ำคลองท่าลาดเป็นพื้นที่ที่มีความหลากหลายทางชีวภาพสูงมาก แต่ในรายงาน EIA ไม่เคยบอกไว้ว่ามีปัญหาการใช้น้ำอย่างไรบ้าง โรงงานอุตสาหกรรมที่มีรายงาน EIA ไม่เคยทำบัญชีรายรับรายจ่ายการเข้าออกของน้ำ อีกทั้งปัญหาน้ำเค็มที่ทำให้ภาคการเกษตรต้องงดทำนา สถานการณ์ที่ชุมชนขาดแคลนน้ำในพื้นที่แม่น้ำบางประกงและแม่น้ำปราจีนบุรี จนสำนักประชาสัมพันธ์จังหวัดประกาศงดใช้น้ำ รวมทั้งใน อ.พนมสารคาม จ.ฉะเชิงเทรา จ.ชลบุรี เป็นพื้นที่เสี่ยงการขาดแคลนน้ำดิบที่ผลิตน้ำประปา การทำไร่ทำสวนยังต้องอาศัยน้ำจืดจากแม่น้ำบางประกง แต่น้ำแห้งประมาณ 80 กม. จากทะเล หมากตายเพราะภาวะภัยแล้ง กัญจน์ กล่าวต่อว่า พื้นที่การจ่ายน้ำของการไฟฟ้าส่วนภูมิภาค( กฟภ.) ในฝั่งตะวันตกจากแม่น้ำบางประกง การใช้น้ำจากท่าลาด หลายชุมชนไม่ได้รับน้ำประปาจาก กฟภ. ในปี 2560 น้ำอาจจะลดลงอีก 50 % และไม่มีใครพูดแทนระบบนิเวศของแม่น้ำบางประกง ชาวบ้านขาดแคลนน้ำจากคลองท่าลาดอาจจะล่มสลาย และการใช้ประโยชน์ของที่ดินทำพื้นที่เกษตรผสมผสาน สวนผลไม้ในพื้นที่ยังต้องอาศัยน้ำจืดจากแม่น้ำบางประกงเช่นกัน ชาวบ้านต้องปรับตัวโดยการสูบน้ำมาเพาะเลี้ยงสัตว์น้ำแทน ส่วนการปลูกข้าวในลุ่มน้ำบางประกง ซึ่งเป็นต้นกำเนิดของข้าวหอมมะลิ สวนผสมผสานจำเป็นต้องใช้ความสมบูรณ์ของระบบนิเวศ พื้นที่เพาะเลี้ยงสัตว์น้ำจะมีการขยาย กุ้ง ปลา อีกด้วย ทั้งนี้กลุ่มทุนเขายึดแม่น้ำเพราะต้องใช้ สรุปว่า สิ่งที่เราเห็นคือโครงการไม่เคยศึกษาความอุดมสมบูรณ์ของน้ำ เราจึงไม่ยอมให้โครงการขนาดใหญ่มาใช้น้ำ ทั้งที่ก็มีวิกฤติอยู่แล้ว แนะพื้นที่บางประกงควรฟื้นฟูทางอาหาร วิฑูรย์ เลี่ยนจำรูญ ผู้อำนวยการมูลนิธิชีววิถี กล่าวว่า โครงการโรงไฟฟ้าพลังความร้อน 600 เมกะวัตต์ ฉะเชิงเทรา ขนาดใกล้เคียงกับกระบี่ที่ต่อต้านกันไม่น้อย เป็นโครงการใหญ่ ประมาณ 1 ใน 4 ของแม่เมาะ ขบวนการเกษตรอินทรีย์ที่ฉะเชิงเทราเป็นพื้นที่ใหญ่ที่สุดของภาคกลาง ผลิตพืชผักสำคัญป้อนเมืองหลวงอันดับหนึ่ง ใช้พื้นที่ ทำเกษตรอินทรีย์ 18,000 ไร่ รับใช้ประชากรกว่า 60,000 คน ในปีนี้เกษตรกร 500 ราย มีอัตราการขยายตัวของเกษตรอินทรีย์ ปัจจุบันรัฐบาลพูดถึงความไม่ปลอดภัยทางอาหาร และยินดีรับฝังความเห็นของประชาชน มีนโยบายให้โรงพยาบาล 18 แห่งนำร่องรับซื้อพืชผัก ดังนั้นโครงการนี้ที่ทำให้เกิดผลกระทบต่อเกษตรอินทรีย์นั้นมีความขัดแย้งกับนโยบายของรัฐเอง วิฑูรย์ กล่าวชื่นชมเครือข่ายการเกษตรทางเลือกในพื้นที่ฉะเชิงเทรา ว่า ร่วมต่อสู้และคัดค้านการสร้างโรงไฟฟ้าถ่านหินเขาหินซ้อนมาเป็น 10 ปี ตอนนี้ไม่มีเหตุผลที่ คชก. จะอนุญาตให้โครงการนี้ดำเนินงาน ปัญหาใหญ่คืออำนาจของคณะกรรมการชุดนั้นที่ประชุมห้องเล็ก สำหรับพื้นที่ทำการศึกษาต้องเสนอให้ประชาชนรับทราบ หากมีการอนุญาตให้รายงาน EHIA ผ่านก็จะไม่ชอบธรรม แล้วจะไว้ใจอย่างไร จำเป็นต้องท้วงติงในความรับผิดชอบของกลุ่มทุนนี้ต่อไป ส่วนยุทธศาสตร์สำคัญของการพัฒนาประเทศ คือ อาหาร ซึ่งเห็นว่า พื้นที่บางประกงควรฟื้นฟูทางอาหาร เรื่องนี้เป็นของทุกคนเพื่อสนับสนุนให้อยู่รอด ยกงานวิจัยชี้สารปรอทส่งผลต่อห่วงโซ่อาหาร พัฒนาการสมอง ศุภกิจ นันทวรการ ผู้จัดการฝ่ายนโยบายสาธารณะ มูลนิธินโยบายสุขภาวะ ได้กล่าวถึงโรงไฟฟ้าถ่านหินเขาหินซ้อนที่มีผลกระทบต่อความมั่นคงอาหาร สุขภาพและสิ่งแวดล้อม โดยมีงานวิจัยจากมหาวิทยาลัยฮาร์วาร์ดที่สหรัฐอเมริกาแล้วว่า สารปรอทส่งผลต่อระบบห่วงโซ่อาหาร พัฒนาการและสมอง นี่คือความมั่นคงของสุขภาพและพัฒนาการของเด็ก สำหรับความมั่นคงทางพลังงานไฟฟ้า โดยภาพรวมระดับประเทศนั้นเหลือเฟือ กำลังผลิตไฟฟ้าสำรองล้นเกิน เรามีไฟฟ้าสำรองเหลือเฟือไปถึง ปี 2572 ภาระโรงไฟฟ้าล้นเกิน ลองยกเลิกโรงไฟฟ้าถ่านหินเขาหินซ้อนที่ฉะเชิงเทรา เทพาที่สงขลา กระบี่ แม่เมาะที่ลำปาง กำลังผลิตไฟฟ้าสำรองก็ยังเท่ากับค่ามาตรฐานอยู่ดี สรุปคือ เรามีโรงไฟฟ้าสำรองล้นเกินแต่ก็ยังพยายามสร้างเพิ่ม เรามีพลังงานหมุนเวียนทางเลือกอยู่แล้วอาจจะต้องรับผิดชอบมากขึ้น แต่ไม่เป็นภาระต่อสิ่งแวดล้อมและสุขภาพให้คนในพื้นที่แน่นอน นันทวรรณ ผู้ประสานงานเครือข่ายเกษตรกรรมทางเลือก จ.ฉะเชิงเทรา กล่าวถึงที่ไปที่มาว่า เราต่อสู้กันมาตั้งแต่ปี 2550 การที่โครงการโรงไฟฟ้าถ่านหินเขาหินซ้อนขนาด 600 เมกะวัตต์ จ.ฉะเชิงเทรา ของบริษัท เนชั่นแนล เพาเวอร์ ซัพพลาย จำกัด (มหาชน) ในเครือดับเบิ้ลได้ผ่านการคัดเลือก ชาวบ้านได้คัดค้านโครงการทุกวิถีทาง และตั้งแต่ปี 2555 บริษัทฯ ได้ยื่นรายงาน EHIA ให้คณะกรรมการผู้ชำนาญการ (คชก.) พิจารณามาแล้วทั้งหมด 3 รอบ ชาวบ้านเองก็ได้นำเสนอข้อมูลอีกด้านจากรายงานการประเมินผลกระทบทางสุขภาพโดยชุมชน ทำให้รายงาน EHIA ทั้ง 3 รอบไม่ผ่านความเห็นชอบจาก คชก. แต่ล่าสุด บริษัทฯ ได้ยื่น EHIA อีกครั้ง เป็นรอบที่ 4 และจะมีการพิจารณาในวันที่ 23 มี.ค. 2560 นี้ที่สํานักนโยบายและแผนทรัพยากรธรรมชาติและสิ่งแวดล้อม (สผ.) โดยชาวบ้านในพื้นที่จ.ฉะเชิงเทราได้นัดรวมรับฟังผลในวันเดียวกัน สผ. ขอเลื่อนกระทันหัน นันทวรรณ ผู้ประสานงานเครือข่ายเกษตรกรรมทางเลือก จ.ฉะเชิงเทรา ให้สัมภาษณ์กับผู้สื่อข่าวเพิ่มเติมว่า จากเดิมที่ คชก. แจ้งไว้จะมีการพิจารณา EHIA ของกลุ่มทุนที่ยื่นเป็นรอบที่ 4 ในวันที่ 16 มี.ค. 60 เวลา 13.30 น. ทาง สผ. ขอเลื่อนกระทันหัน เนื่องจากคณะกรรมการได้ประชุมหารือกรณีที่ชาวบ้านยื่นหนังสือขอรับฟังผลพิจารณาร่วมด้วยประมาณ 100 คน แต่ช่วงบ่ายขากลับจากงานเสวนาที่จุฬาฯ เมื่อวันที่ 14 มี.ค. 60 ที่ผ่านมา ตนได้รับการติดต่อจาก สผ.

Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government. Question: \\"Which Chinese dynasty is associated with careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs?\\" Answer: \\"Shang\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, the answer \\"Shang\\" is correct based on the paragraph. It is mentioned that during the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements.

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Step 2: find Governor, County_name of the results of step 1","output":"To accomplish the task in a single SQL statement, you can use the JOIN statement to join the election table with the county and party tables on their respective primary keys.

The phrase explicitly conveys the difficulty experienced by the tweeter due to excessive heat, which is preventing them from getting a good night's sleep. Such a situation can often lead to physical and mental exhaustion, as well as general irritability. The use of the word \\"too\\" emphasizes the extent to which the heat is bothering the person, intensifying their feelings of discomfort. The sentiment could also be considered as a complaint or a plea for relief from the unpleasant conditions. It is possible that other individuals encountering this tweet might resonate with the same sentiment, as extreme temperatures can have a widespread effect on people's ability to find comfort and sleep well. It is worth noting, however, that this tweet does not provide any solutions or suggestions on how to address the issue, nor does it elaborate on how the person is coping. In some cases, sharing such feelings on social media could be a way for the tweeter to seek validation or empathy from others who might be in similar circumstances. As a result, the tweet might serve to bond users who are collectively experiencing discomfort, even though the overall sentiment is negative. In conclusion, the sentiment of the tweet \\"It is too hot to sleep\\" is predominantly negative and conveys discomfort or frustration.

The couple submitted a joint application for their car and house. However, the","output":"bank representative explained that there were several factors affecting their eligibility, including their credit scores, financial stability, and the correlation between the loan amount and the market value of the assets they were seeking financing for. For a start, the couple's individual credit scores played a significant role in determining their eligibility for the joint loan. It was important for both partners to have a strong credit history as it showcased their reliability in making repayments on time. Unfortunately, one of the applicants had a low credit score, primarily due to missed payments from a previous loan and overutilization of credit cards. This factor negatively impacted the couple's overall creditworthiness, which in turn, affected their joint loan application. Secondly, the bank also assessed the couple's financial stability by analyzing their debt-to-income ratio. This is a comparison between the total monthly debt and the total gross monthly income of both applicants. The purpose of scrutinizing this ratio is to ensure that the borrowers have a stable source of income to support both the new and existing debt repayments. In the case of the couple, their debt-to-income ratio was higher than the recommended threshold of 43%, which indirectly raised concerns about their ability to manage future financial obligations effectively. Therefore, the bank deemed their joint application as risky. Another important aspect that influenced the approval of the car and house loan was the correlation between the loan amount requested and the market value of the assets they were planning to acquire. The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is a financial term that lenders use to express the ratio of the loan amount to the fair market value or purchase price of the assets. In this scenario, the couple requested a loan amount that significantly exceeded the pre-established LTV ratio, which the bank had in place as a risk control measure. This indicated that the couple wanted to finance an amount that exceeded the value of the car and the house, raising red flags for the lender. As a conclusion, the couple submitted a joint application for their car and house with high hopes. However, the bank representative considered various factors like credit scores, financial stability with respect to debt-to-income ratio, and the correlation between the loan amount and the market value of the assets they were seeking financing for, before making the final decision. Unfortunately, their weak financial profile and other risk factors contributed to the complications they faced in getting the loan approval, leading them to explore alternative avenues to secure the necessary financing."},{"instruction":"By. Emma Innes. Life expectancies across the are increasing, with Iceland and Japan boasting the oldest citizens. Worldwide, a girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73 and a boy can expect to live to 68, according to a new report from the World Health Organisation. This is six years longer than the average global life expectancy for a child born in 1990. Across the globe, life expectancies are increasing with the highest male life expectancy being in Iceland - 81 - and the highest female life expectancy being in Japan - 87. At the top end of the scale, Japanese women have the highest female life expectancy in the world at 87, and Iceland has the highest male life expectancy – 81. The next highest female life expectancies were in Spain (85), Switzerland (85), Singapore (85) and Italy (also 85). After Iceland, the highest male life expectancies were found in Switzerland (80), Australia (80), Israel (80), and Singapore (also 80). In the UK, life expectancy for a boy born in 2012 is 79 and for a girl it is 83. In the U.S. a boy born in 2012 can expect to live to 76 and a girl can expect to reach 81. If all high-income countries are taken together, the average male life expectancy is now 76. This is 16 years more than for a boy born in a low-income country, where life expectancy is now 60. Globally, the leading causes of lost years of life due to premature death are heart disease, lower respiratory infections - such as pneumonia - and strokes. Worldwide, a girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73 and a boy can expect to live to 68 but life expectancies in low-income countries remain much lower than those in high-income countries. For a girl born in 2012 in a high-income country, life expectancy is 82. For a girl born in a low-income country, the figure is just 63. ‘In high-income countries, much of the gain in life expectancy is due to success in tackling non-communicable diseases [i.e. chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes],’ said Dr Ties Boerma, Director of the Department of Health Statistics and Information Systems at WHO. ‘Fewer men and women are dying before they get to their 60th birthday from heart disease and stroke. ‘Richer countries have become better at monitoring and managing high blood pressure for example.’ Declining tobacco use is also a key factor in helping people live longer in several countries. However, the ‘World Health Statistics 2014’ report shows that the greatest progress was made in low-income countries where average life expectancy increased by nine years between 1990 and 2012. In many low-income countries female life expectancy is still held back by high rates of death during childbirth. And the greatest increases in life expectancy were in Liberia (from 42 years in 1990 to 62 years in 2012), Ethiopia (from 45 to 64 years), the Maldives (58 to 77 years), Cambodia (54 to 72 years), Timor-Leste (50 to 66 years) and Rwanda (48 to 65 years). ‘An important reason why global life expectancy has improved so much is that fewer children are dying before their fifth birthday,’ says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. ‘But there is still a major rich-poor divide - people in high-income countries continue to have a much better chance of living longer than people in low-income countries.’ The figures also revealed that across the world women live longer than men. In high-income countries they live for an average of six years longer, and in low-income countries they live for an average of three years longer. At the bottom end of the scale, life expectancy for both men and women is still less than 55 years in nine sub-Saharan African countries – Angola, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Mozambique, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. One of the reasons that life expectancies have increased in low-income countries is that infant mortality rates fell significantly between 1990 and 2012. The WHO figures also revealed that the top three causes of years of life lost due to premature death are coronary heart disease, lower respiratory infections – such as pneumonia – and strokes. However, globally, the greatest causes of death vary. In 22 African countries 70 per cent or more of the years of life lost due to premature death are caused by infectious diseases. In contrast, in 47 mostly high-income countries, non-communicable diseases and injuries cause more than 90 per cent of years lost. These are diseases that cannot be passed between people, such as cancer and heart disease. More than 100 countries are transitioning rapidly towards a greater proportion of deaths from non-communicable diseases and injuries. Most deaths in children under the age of five occur as a result of premature birth. The second highest cause of infant mortality is pneumonia. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article highlights the increasing global life expectancies, with special mention of Iceland and Japan as countries having the highest life expectancies among men (81 years) and women (87 years), respectively. The World Health Organisation report states that a girl born in 2012 can expect to live up to 73 years while a boy can anticipate living up to 68 years. The report also mentions the remarkable progress in low-income countries, where the average life expectancy increased by nine years between 1990 and 2012, despite a persisting divide between rich and poor nations. Other significant points include the leading causes of lost years of life due to premature death, namely heart disease, lower respiratory infections, and strokes. Additionally, the article reveals that across the world, women live longer than men, with six years longer in high-income countries and three years longer in low-income countries.

This is a disease that can be passed down from generation to generation. His mother Got cancer at one point but it has been treated and has been eliminated. and a hint : Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal Academician in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, who had been educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses (\\"Odysseus\\" in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, \\"My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS\\". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from Alexander Pope's translation, \\"Their song is death, and makes destruction please. / Unblest the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the curs'd shore, and listen to the lay ... In verdant meads they sport, and wide around / Lie human bones that whiten all the ground. / The ground polluted floats with human gore / And human carnage taints the dreadful shore.\\" contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens?, what is it ?

To provide a detailed response: The dispute between Boeing Co. and Airbus over subsidies has been a long-standing issue in the aviation industry. Both companies are major players in the market and are direct competitors in terms of aircraft manufacturing and sales. They have been engaged in a series of legal battles since the early 2000s, particularly regarding government subsidies provided to Airbus. On Thursday, the CEO of Boeing, Dave Calhoun, insisted that he is not seeking to instigate a trans-Atlantic conflict between the United States and the European Union (EU) over this ongoing dispute but remains firm that state aid for the European aerospace giant's new programs should be halted. According to Calhoun, the subsidies provided to Airbus create an unfair advantage and hinder fair competition between the two companies, therefore affecting the global market. The issue of subsidies primarily revolves around the argument that government aid provided to Airbus, particularly in the form of low-interest loans, has allowed the company to develop and manufacture new aircraft models at a lower cost than would be possible under purely market-driven conditions. Consequently, Boeing considers these subsidies to be an illegal form of trade protection and contrary to international trade rules. In contrast, Airbus claims that the financial aid they receive is entirely legal, allowing them to invest in the research, development, and innovation needed to be competitive in the aircraft manufacturing market. Additionally, Airbus has countered Boeing's allegations by stating that the American company also benefits from favorable tax policies, subsidies, and military contracts from the United States government, which ultimately offsets their claims of unfair competition. The dispute between these aerospace giants is indeed a complex issue involving multiple international trade agreements and regulations. Over the past few decades, there have been several rulings by the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the matter. In 2019, the WTO found the EU guilty of violating international trade laws by providing subsidies to Airbus. A year later, the WTO authorized the US to impose tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of European goods, including aircraft, as a retaliatory measure. Similarly, the EU was also granted permission by the WTO in 2020 to impose tariffs on American goods, including Boeing aircraft, in response to subsidies provided to Boeing by the US government. Despite the ongoing legal battles and tariff impositions, the CEO of Boeing, Dave Calhoun, expressed his intent to avoid further escalation of the conflict and seek a resolution to the longstanding subsidies dispute. It remains to be seen if both aerospace giants, along with their respective governments, can find common ground and establish a competitive environment that abides by international trade rules and fosters innovation in the aviation industry. Preventing such disputes from escalating into full-blown trade wars is crucial for maintaining healthy economic relationships between the US and the EU, as well as for fostering growth within the global aviation market."},{"instruction":"What is a shorter version of this: president bush and trio of influential republican senators appeared headed for a showdown thursday as they suspended talks on legislation outlining how to try suspected terrorists .

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis presented here involves an increase in magma explosions. To analyze the potential effects of this perturbation on the digestion process, we must first understand the relationship between the two systems - the Earth's geological activity and the human body's digestive system. It is essential to note that these two systems are fundamentally different and operate independently. The digestive process, as mentioned, involves multiple stages, including the chemical breakdown of food by saliva, the mechanical breakdown by teeth and tongue, the transport of food through the esophagus and stomach, and finally, the digestive action within the intestines. Magma explosions, on the other hand, are geological events occurring within the Earth's crust, involving the release of molten rock and other volcanic materials. At a first glance, it may appear that there is no direct connection between these two systems. However, the perturbation hypothesis requires us to consider potential indirect effects that may exist. For instance, an increase in magma explosions could lead to various environmental changes, which could, in turn, affect human digestion. Here are some possible indirect effects: 1. Changes in food availability: An increase in magma explosions could result in large-scale volcanic eruptions. These eruptions can release ash and toxic gases into the atmosphere, which can negatively affect the growth of plants and survival of animals in affected areas. This may result in changes in food availability, requiring humans to adapt their diet, potentially affecting digestion depending on the types of food consumed. 2. Changes in air quality: The ash and toxic gases from magma explosions may also decrease air quality in certain regions. Exposure to airborne pollutants could lead to respiratory issues that could potentially affect the ease of swallowing, indirectly impacting the first stage of digestion that occurs in the oral cavity. 3. Psychological stress: An increase in magma explosions may result in increased fear and anxiety among people living in affected areas due to the perceived threat of volcanic activity. Psychological stress is known to affect various physiological processes, including digestion. Stress can cause alterations in digestive function, leading to issues such as indigestion, heartburn, or changes in bowel habits. 4. Disruption of digestive routine: In case of large-scale magma explosions causing evacuations or drastic lifestyle changes, people might be forced to alter their eating habits. Such changes could include consuming unfamiliar foods or eating at irregular intervals, potentially affecting the efficiency of digestion. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does not suggest a direct effect of increased magma explosions on the digestion process. However, it is essential to consider the possible indirect effects through environmental and lifestyle changes that may result from an increase in volcanic activity. These indirect effects could contribute to alterations in digestive function or efficiency, although the specific outcomes would likely vary from individual to individual, depending on several factors like location, sensitivity, and adaptability."},{"instruction":"Question: - Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli - Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries - The oxygen goes into the bloodstream - Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up - You breathe it out through your lungs - What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process of respiration, which involves the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the human body, begins with inhalation or breathing in. When we breathe in, air enters our body through the nose or the mouth. The primary function of the nose during this process is to filter, warm, and humidify the incoming air, making it more suitable for the delicate tissues of the lungs. As air enters the body, it travels through the nasal cavity where tiny hairs called cilia and a layer of mucus help to trap dust, pollen, and other small particles, keeping them from entering the lungs. The nasal cavity is also lined with blood vessels that work to warm and humidify the air, adjusting it to the body's temperature and preventing the lungs from drying out. From the nasal cavity, the air then moves through the pharynx, which is a common passageway for both air and food. The pharynx connects the nasal cavity with the larynx, which contains the vocal cords and is also known as the \\"voice box.\\" As air continues to travel through the respiratory system, it passes over the epiglottis, a flap of cartilage that prevents food and liquids from entering the windpipe (trachea) during swallowing. Next, the air enters the trachea, a tube made up of rings of cartilage that helps keep the airway open. The trachea then branches into two smaller tubes called the bronchi, which then further divide into smaller bronchial tubes, known as bronchioles. These bronchioles spread throughout the lungs, forming a complex network of air passages. At the end of these bronchioles, there are tiny air sacs called alveoli, where the actual gas exchange takes place. Once the inhaled air reaches the alveoli, the oxygen concentration in the air is higher than in the blood flowing through the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. This difference in concentration allows the oxygen molecules to pass through the thin walls of the alveoli and into the bloodstream, where they bind with hemoglobin in red blood cells. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide, a waste product produced by cells during the process of cellular respiration, diffuses out of the bloodstream and into the alveoli. This is because the concentration of carbon dioxide is lower in the alveoli than in the blood, allowing it to move across the alveolar-capillary membrane and mix with the air inside the alveoli. Finally, the process comes full circle as we exhale, removing the carbon dioxide-rich air from our lungs and replacing it with fresh, oxygen-rich air during our next breath. This continuous cycle of inhalation and exhalation allows our bodies to maintain the necessary balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide, ensuring that our cells receive the oxygen needed for various metabolic processes while simultaneously expelling the waste product, carbon dioxide."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given a text which is the body of the document.

Possible answers: *None of the above choices .; *The boss ca n't get his cell phone fixed .; *The boss ca n't stop the narrator from fighting .; *The boss ca n't find anyone .;","output":"The source of management's anger in this situation stems from the fact that the boss cannot find anyone at the office and nobody is answering the phone. This lack of responsiveness and seemingly absent staff is likely causing the boss to wonder what is happening at the workplace, potentially suspecting that the employees are not fulfilling their duties or are engaged in unprofessional behavior. This can lead to a significant disruption in the smooth functioning of the office, as well as result in a loss of productivity and efficiency. The boss's anger is aggravated by the fact that he had to resort to calling a coworker on her cellphone, which might not be the standard means of communication within the office context. This indicates to the boss that the situation at the office is far from what is expected, contributing to his frustration. The options provided may not encapsulate the exact reason for the boss's anger, but the closest one would be \\"The boss can't find anyone.\\" While this is not entirely accurate, as the boss did manage to reach a coworker eventually, it does touch upon the core issue of the boss's frustration, which is their inability to locate the employees or get a response when calling the office.

Frustration was a daily part of Robert's life and not Lawrences, since","output":"Robert was a detail-oriented, perfectionist project manager at a prestigious architectural firm, while Lawrence was a carefree, go-with-the-flow artist who had built a name for himself in the world of abstract art. The two had been friends since their college days and happened to share an apartment in the creative district of the city. Robert's frustrations often sprang from the demands of his profession; the tight deadlines, the need for precision, and his unwavering commitment to his job. He would wake up each morning, prepared for the challenges ahead, filled with a volatile combination of excitement and dread. By contrast, Lawrence's days were filled with the freedom to express himself, the liberty to experiment, and the option to take time off without the fear of repercussions. One evening, while sharing a bottle of wine, Robert opened up about his anxieties and the incessant discontent he felt each time he couldn't meet his impeccably high standards. Lawrence listened patiently, waiting for Robert to finish, and said, \\"Life is a canvas, Robert, and you have the power to paint it with the colors of happiness, vibrancy, and peace. It's okay to take a step back and appreciate what you've created.\\" But Robert found it difficult to embrace this philosophy. He believed that success required unwavering commitment, and that letting go, even for a moment, could jeopardize his career. Unable to compromise on his beliefs, Robert allowed the frustration to fester. One day, while presenting his designs to a high-profile client, Robert cracked under the immense pressure. His hands shook and his voice wavered. He struggled to explain the intricate details of the project, and ultimately, lost the account. On the way out, the client, almost in pity, suggested that Robert should take a break and recharge before resuming his work. Crushed and heartbroken, he returned home and informed Lawrence about the incident. The artist could see the toll it had taken on his friend and decided to intervene. He knew that Robert had talent, determination, and the passion for creating incredible designs; but he was allowing stress and frustration to govern his entire existence. Over the next few weeks, Lawrence convinced Robert to undertake a transformative journey. He insisted that Robert optimize his environment at home to create a space for relaxation and creativity, as well as meditation and reflection. They explored various forms of exercise, including yoga and tai chi, to help Robert manage his stress and find a sense of balance. Lawrence also introduced him to the world of abstract art, letting his friend see the beauty in imperfection and the importance of artistic expression. Robert started dedicating time to understanding the emotional aspect of design, broadening his artistic horizons. As weeks turned into months, Robert's demeanor slowly shifted. The once-frustrated man began to find serenity in the small moments of life. He discovered that taking breaks, observing his thoughts, and combating negative self-talk could help him cope with stress more effectively. Lawrence continued to be a supportive influence in Robert's life, patiently guiding him and celebrating his transitions. Ultimately, Robert found his true passion in a more unconventional branch of architecture, fusing together the world of emotions, art, and design. Both their careers soared as their lives found equilibrium. The once-turbulent waters of their existence began to calm, the storms of frustration receding. They discovered and embraced that life is a never-ending, intricate dance between the structured world of work and the unstructured world of expression and self-growth. Robert's transformation became a testament to the fact that embracing vulnerability and seeking balance can set one free from the confines of frustration, paving the way for peace, tranquility, and personal fulfillment."},{"instruction":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","output":"🌟Embrace the day's brilliance, friends! 🌞 With each loving action, kind word, and uplifting smile, we create a ripple effect of positivity.

The Vietnam War came to an end on April 30, 1975, marked by the fall of Saigon, South Vietnam's capital, to North Vietnamese forces. This conflict followed the First Indochina War and was fought between North Vietnam, supported by its communist allies, and the government of South Vietnam, supported by the United States and other anti-communist countries. The conclusive event was preceded by a series of key events that led to the conclusion of the war. 1. The Paris Peace Accords (January 27, 1973): The United States, South Vietnam, North Vietnam, and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam reached a ceasefire agreement to stop hostilities in Vietnam. U.S. military involvement gradually decreased, and eventually, all U.S. troops were withdrawn in March 1973. This left the South Vietnamese Army to defend itself without the direct support of the U.S. military. 2. The Easter Offensive (1972): North Vietnam launched a major offensive against South Vietnam in 1972. Despite initial setbacks, the South Vietnamese army, with U.S. air support, managed to halt the North's invasion. However, the offensive weakened the South Vietnamese Army's capabilities and depleted its resources. 3. Fall of Da Nang (March 1975): The capture of the strategic city of Da Nang by the North Vietnamese Army struck a major blow to South Vietnam's ability to resist, as it prompted a series of military setbacks that eventually led to the fall of Saigon. 4. Fall of Saigon (April 30, 1975): North Vietnamese forces captured the South Vietnamese capital, Saigon, which marked the end of the Vietnam War. The President of South Vietnam, Duong Van Minh, announced an unconditional surrender to the North Vietnamese forces. Saigon was later renamed Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the communist leader. The fall of Saigon marked the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule, which remains in place to this day.

(6). permineralization. (7). Air. (8). that material's properties. Answer:","output":"(5). Mutagenic chemicals Given the two facts provided, the answer to the question – \\"what may change the structure of a nucleotide?\\" – is mutagenic chemicals. To properly understand how mutagenic chemicals can change the structure of nucleotides, let’s first explore what nucleotides and mutations are and then discuss the role of mutagenic chemicals in this process. A nucleotide is the basic building block of nucleic acids, which make up the genetic material in living organisms – DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). These molecules are composed of three components: a sugar (deoxyribose in DNA or ribose in RNA), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. There are four different nitrogenous bases in DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). In RNA, uracil (U) replaces thymine. The specific sequence of these bases in DNA and RNA forms the genetic code that dictates cell functions and the characteristics of the organism. Now let’s explore mutations. A mutation is an alteration in the sequence of nucleotides that occurs spontaneously or as a result of exposure to certain environmental factors (such as mutagenic chemicals). Mutations can be of two types: 1. Chromosomal mutations: These affect the structure of the chromosome itself, changing the arrangement and organization of genes within the chromosomes. Examples include deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. 2. Point mutations: These involve a change in a single nucleotide. Examples include substitutions, insertions, and deletions of individual bases. Mutagenic chemicals (Fact 2) are substances that increase the rate of genetic mutations by altering the structure and functionality of nucleotides present in the DNA and RNA molecules. These chemicals can interact with the genetic material either directly or indirectly, causing changes in the nitrogenous bases and the DNA or RNA backbone. The mechanisms by which mutagenic chemicals cause these changes include: 1. Chemical modification of the bases: Mutagenic chemicals can form covalent bonds with the nitrogenous bases, resulting in altered structure and function. For example, alkylating agents can add an alkyl group to the nitrogenous bases, altering the pairing properties and leading to mistakes during DNA replication. 2. Base damage: Some mutagenic chemicals can cause oxidative damage to the nitrogenous bases, for example, through oxidation reactions (Choice 1). These reactions can lead to the formation of unstable and reactive molecules called free radicals, which can, in turn, damage the DNA base pairs. 3. Intercalation: Mutagenic chemicals can insert themselves between adjacent base pairs, causing distortions in DNA or RNA structure. This can lead to problems in processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and translation, potentially causing frameshift mutations. 4. Crosslinking: Certain mutagenic chemicals can form covalent bonds between adjacent bases on the same or opposite DNA strands, leading to the formation of crosslinks that impede replication and transcription processes. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question – \\"what may change the structure of a nucleotide?\\" – is mutagenic chemicals (Choice 5). These chemicals play a significant role in inducing genetic mutations by either altering the structure of entire chromosomes or changing single nucleotides within the DNA and RNA molecules."},{"instruction":"Question: Title: Self indulgence made real Review: This recording is pretty hideous.

But last week, the 35-year-old undocumented Ecuadorean immigrant found himself detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the US Army base. Now he faces deportation, the New York Times reports. CBS News and a writer for the Forward note the arrest of Villavicencio, who's married to 38-year-old US citizen Sandra Chica and has two young daughters, first started making the rounds in Spanish-language media after Chica says her husband showed up at Fort Hamilton on Friday, food order in hand, and showed his IDNYC card, one often held by immigrants. Staff demanded other ID and then ran a background check, which revealed an open deportation order on Villavicencio from 2010. In a call from immigration detention, Villavicencio tells the New York Post a staff sergeant he'd delivered to before tried to intervene on his behalf, but ICE was called and Villavicencio was taken away. An ICE rep tells the Times Villavicencio has no criminal record; Chica says her husband applied for a green card in February. \\"It's cruel that they're going to separate my daughters from him,\\" she tells the Post. \\"He's supporting the family and now I'm going to be by myself with them.\\" Rep. Dan Donovan says that \\"liberal activists are attacking ICE agents and military personnel for following the law in detaining an immigrant reportedly here illegally.\\" But City Councilman Justin Brannan, who appeared at a Wednesday presser, per NPR, asked: \\"Are we any safer today because they took a pizza delivery guy off the street?\\" A GoFundMe for the family has so far raised more than 13,000.","output":"Title: Pizza Delivery Man Faces Deportation After Army Base Arrest Once upon a time, there was a man named Pablo Villavicencio. He was from Ecuador and lived in the United States, but he didn't have the right papers to live there. He worked as a pizza delivery man, and one day, his job took him to a place called Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn. Pablo had delivered pizzas to this place many times before, but this time, things were different. When he showed an ID card called IDNYC, which helps people who don't have other IDs, the people at Fort Hamilton wanted him to show another ID. When they looked up his information, they found out he was told to leave the United States back in 2010 but didn't. Because of this, the people from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, came and took Pablo away. Now, Pablo might be sent back to Ecuador. His wife, Sandra Chica, who has the right to live in the United States, along with his two young daughters, are really sad. They don't want him to go away because he supports their family. Pablo told a newspaper called the New York Post that a man at Fort Hamilton tried to help him, but ICE still took him. A lot of people are talking about what happened to Pablo. Some think it's okay because the rules are the rules. Other people, like a man named Justin Brannan, who works for the city, don't feel safer knowing that a pizza delivery man was taken off the streets. To help Pablo's family, some kind-hearted people have raised more than 13,000 on a website called GoFundMe. This story shows how important it is for people to follow the rules, but also how tough it can be for families separated because of them."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"\\"La vida es como una caja de bombones, nunca sabes qué te va a tocar.\\" This sentence is in Spanish and translates to \\"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get,\\" which is a famous line from the movie Forrest Gump.

Question: What will Others want to do next? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: go home and relax B: finish quickly C: be Skylar The answer is:","output":"A: go home and relax The context suggests that Skylar has been waiting upon hand and foot for the people to finish working. This implies that they have been exerting effort and putting in long hours to complete their work. Therefore, it is most likely that once they finish working, they would want to go home and relax to recover from their hard work and effort. Option B - \\"finish quickly\\" - does not answer the question of what others would want to do next, as it only expresses the idea that they would want to speed up their work. This option does not give any information about their subsequent actions. Option C - \\"be Skylar\\" - is not a proper answer, as it does not relate to any possible actions that others may take after finishing their work.

Options: - bathtub - washing area - hotel - shower stall - department store Let's think step by step:","output":"1. Bathtub: A single shower curtain is commonly used in a bathroom with a bathtub. It prevents water from splashing onto the floor and other surfaces when someone is taking a shower. So, this could be a potential location. 2. Washing area: A washing area usually refers to a place where people wash clothes or dishes, rather than taking showers. So, it's unlikely that a single shower curtain would be used here. 3. Hotel: While hotels have bathrooms where shower curtains can be found, this option is a bit too vague to target the specific location within a hotel (e.g., hotel room or bathroom). Therefore, a hotel may not be the most precise answer. 4. Shower stall: A shower stall is a dedicated space for taking a shower, and it often uses a single shower curtain to contain water. This is a typical place to find a shower curtain. 5. Department store: You can surely buy shower curtains at a department store, but it's not a place where the curtain is being used, rather it's being sold.
