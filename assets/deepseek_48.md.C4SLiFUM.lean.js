Movie plot title: Looper Movie plot: In 2044, the United States has suffered economic collapse, causing severe social decay and growth in organized crime. In addition, a strange mutation has occurred in 10% of the population, giving them minor telekinetic powers, manifested by their ability to float small objects. They are referred to as TKs. Thirty years into the future in 2074, time travel is invented, but is immediately outlawed. However, because by that point tracking technology has rendered it nearly impossible to dispose of bodies secretly, crime bosses turn to time travel to send their targets to the past (the movie's present) to be killed by \\"loopers\\": hired guns paid in silver to kill whoever is sent to them. The victims have bags over their heads, and silver bars strapped to their backs. This comes at a price: The severe sanctions on time travel mean that crime bosses eventually need to end a looper's contract, and also eliminate any traces of their working relationship, so they send his older version back to be killed by his younger self, referred to as \\"closing the loop\\", which each looper must do himself. They're paid in gold for this, to live the rest of their lives in comfort.Joseph \\"Joe\\" Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), 25, works for a mafia company in Kansas City as a looper. Joe's boss, Abe (Jeff Daniels), was sent back in time to manage the loopers and also owns a club where Joe frequents and spends time with Suzie (Piper Perabo), a showgirl. Abe also controls the \\"Gat Men,\\" his muscle, led by Kid Blue (Noah Segan). Gat men are so named for their magnum revolvers, which have greater range and accuracy than a looper's 'blunderbuss' shotgun; a weapon designed strictly for close quarters.While at the club one evening, another looper announces that he has just closed his loop. The big payoff in gold is reason to party.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this July 28, 2016, file photo, a screen magnification feature of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is demonstrated, in New York. Aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step of warning airline... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing \\"recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung\\" about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Australian airline companies were among the first to take measures. Qantas has asked passengers not to switch the Note 7 devices on and not to charge them during flights, its spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones said. Media reports said other Australian airlines took a similar step, including Jetstar Airways and Virgin Australia. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users' eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to \\"thermal runaway\\" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ___ Kristen Gelineau in Sydney contributed to this report. ___ Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy.

This is not some crazy future concept -- this is a real vehicle, fully electric, and on sale now. Prices for the Twizy start at PS6,690, with battery hire from PS45 a month. But is it a car? Technically no, it' s classified under UK law as something closer to a moped . A two-seater (the passenger sits behind the driver), the Twizy runs on electric power only, and is designed to cover all those little trips we do. And as 87 percent of Europe's drivers do less than 37 miles a day -- 50 per cent less than 12--there's really no need to be burning gas for that sort of journey. The Twizy is arguably the most unusual vehicle in this country. Other cars have been beautifully designed, others have been small, but no car has turned motoring on its head in quite the same way. The Twizy's batteries have a range of 62 miles, and it plugs into a standard socket like any other electrical equipment, going from flat to full power in three and a half hours. There are no full doors on the vehicle, so think of it like a covered moped with four wheels, but no noise and no need for a helmet. There's also a lower-powered type being designed, the Twizy 45, for which you don' t need a license. Seeing the Twizy in the flesh, you' re surprised by how striking it looks. Sit in it and everything feels right --just car enough to be easy, but different enough to be exciting. With the battery underneath you, the vehicle is suckered to the road, and the electric power means it accelerates with real energy up to about 50 mph. You don't feel you need any more. In the UK, the weather alone may make it a good buy, but the lack of easy access to outdoor sockets is the biggest challenge.

Like a border conflict between neighboring countries ,the parent-teen war is about boundaries: Where is the line between what I control and what you do? Both sides want peace ,but neither feels it has any power to stop the conflict . In part ,this is because neither is willing to admit .any responsibility for starting it . From the parents' point of view, the only cause of their fight is their adolescents' complete unreasonableness. And of course . . Both feel trapped In this article. I'll describe three no-win situations that commonly arise between teens and parents and then suggest some ways out of the trap. The first no-win situation is quarrels over unimportant things . Examples include the color of the teen's hair, the cleanliness of the bedroom ,the preferred style of clothing , the child's failure to eat a good breakfast before school ,or his tendency to sleep until noon on the weekends .Second ,blaming.The goal of a blaming battle is to make the other admit that his bad attitude is the reason why everything goes wrong .

This statement is incorrect from a factual viewpoint because the importation of slaves was made illegal by the U.S in 1808, not in 1792. So while the structure and concept of the sentence would make a good answer to the question \\"What was made illegal in 1792?\\" the specific historical event mentioned in the sentence is incorrect.

These days, kids are first divided by age, then by previous achievement, and often by the type of performance (e.g. the top 8-year-old recreational tap dancer in the country, or the best 11-year-old with a chess rating below 1,500 who played fast chess at a national tournament). Smaller categories create more opportunities for prizes — what I call “the carving up of honor.” I discovered the carving up of honor while researching my new book, Playing to Win, which describes 95 families with elementary-school-age children involved in competitive chess, dance and soccer. Dance competitions carve up honor the most, as every entrant receives a formal designation of “silver,” “gold” or “diamond” before being ranked. (If you watch TLC’s Toddlers & Tiaras, you know many child beauty pageants actually award each and every contestant a “title,” resulting in nonsensical awards, like the Ultimate Grand Supreme or the 4-12 Mini Beauty Supreme.) One child still gets the biggest trophy, but every child gets some tangible sign of their participation, even if it is seemingly trivial, like the best character routine among 11-year-olds who dance in a trio. Two historical trends, and two contemporary trends, have led to this. First, the desire to dampen overt competition in school classrooms was part of the self-esteem movement that started in the 1960s, according to historian Peter Stearns in his book Anxious Parents, and it focused on building up children’s confidence and talents without being negative or comparing them to others. But the self-esteem movement did not really reach activities outside of the classroom, like sports, and private organizations rushed to fill the competitive void created by schools. With the decline of competition in the classroom, parents wanted more competitive opportunities for their children and were willing to pay for it — part of why we have such an extensive pay-to-play system in afterschool activities today. (MORE: Viewpoint: School Has Become Too Hostile to Boys) Second, American culture in general has increasingly embraced prizes and awards. The winner-take-all prize frenzy that characterizes American culture started in the early 20th century, captured by the development of organized American sporting culture. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) was established in 1910, the same time when a variety of professional sports leagues grew, like the NFL. Less popular sports also developed their organized, competitive infrastructures around this time; for example, the first synchronized swimming competition in the U.S. took place in 1939. In the second half of the 20th century, the emphasis on competition, and rankings in general, intensified. The 1970s was the most intense period of prize creation, including the addition of even more prizes to fields such as film and literature. Music competitions, including the introduction of the American Music Awards, saw similar growth in this time period. And even offbeat activities, like competitive eating, developed their own competitions in the 1970s. Since that decade, prizes have become increasingly fashionable, along with children’s competitive activities. What’s more, from the moment a child is brought into this world, he or she is labeled with a number. At birth this is the Apgar score, a score from zero to 10 that a doctor uses to evaluate the health of a newborn child. Throughout early childhood, every child is given a percentile associated with size. As a child enters school the identifiable number becomes a standardized test score, either an OLSAT (for entry into kindergarten) or an SAT score (for entry into college). That this is now happening in afterschool activities is a sign of the unrelenting quantifying and ranking in contemporary American childhood. (MORE: Your First-Grader Is Going to Be a High School Dropout) Various actors in children’s chess, dance and soccer numerically rank children as part of the process of determining winners. These rankings are public, and children and adults involved with each activity are intensely aware of where they and their friends and rivals fall within various hierarchies. Of the three activities, chess is the most precise when it comes to ranking, turning performance into a numeric measure and then published ranks. Every three months, the United States Chess Federation publishes lists of the top-100 8-year-olds, 9-year-olds and so on. Many chess kids refer to themselves by their chess rating, for example, “I’m 850.” Soccer also uses a form of public ranking, assigning children to A and B teams and then sorting them into flights within leagues based on their performance. Youth-soccer aficionados also rank teams full of elementary-school-age kids on the Internet. Students, their families and teachers continuously monitor these rankings. Within the local studios and clubs there is an annual process for selecting competitors (if you watch Lifetime’s Dance Moms, this is like the weekly “pyramid” showing dancers how they stack up relative to their teammates). The carving up of honor can help soften the blow of a low ranking, but it doesn’t hide the fact that there are micro and macro hierarchies in all competitive children’s activities — and in most American kids’ lives on a daily basis. While awards may help people set goals and practice their activity diligently, awards are also a savvy business practice — part of a more general commercialization of childhood. Awards help ensure that clients return year after year. Keeping kids, parents, teachers and coaches happy with lots of recognition keeps the money flowing to the organizers of the competitions. Trophies may keep kids coming back, and their parents paying, but psychological research finds that giving kids rewards for doing an activity (even something as simple as a paper certificate) means lower levels of intrinsic motivation. High levels of intrinsic motivation is precisely what we want to foster among kids to help them attain long-term success and take pride in a well-earned achievement. But the carving up of honor and the trophy culture that accompanies it has clearly gone too far: carving up honor probably doesn’t improve children’s performance or motivation — but it may mean a bigger payday for those who run childhood tournaments. So parents need to be cautious when pursuing titles for their young kids, and make sure the honor created is for their kids, and not for reflected glory for anyone else in their children’s lives.

He was named for Saul Steinberg, an artist. His mother, Ola J. Hudson (nee Oliver; 1946-2009), was an African-American costume designer, whose clients included David Bowie, and his father, Anthony Hudson, is an English artist who created album covers for musicians such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell., Of his mixed background, Slash later remarked, \\"As a musician, I've always been amused that I'm both British and black; particularly because so many American musicians seem to aspire to be British while so many British musicians, in the 'Sixties in particular, went to such great pains to be black.\\" In 2002, Slash reunited with Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum for a Randy Castillo tribute concert. Realizing that they still had the chemistry of their days in Guns N' Roses, they decided to form a new band together. Former Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin was initially involved, but left after the others decided to find a lead singer. Dave Kushner, who had previously played with McKagan in Loaded, then joined the band on rhythm guitar. For many months, the four searched for a lead singer by listening to offered demo tapes, a monotonous process documented by VH1. Eventually, former Stone Temple Pilots vocalist Scott Weiland joined the band. In 2003, Velvet Revolver played several concerts during the summer and released their first single, \\"Set Me Free\\". In June 2004, they released their debut album, Contraband, which debuted at No. 1 on the U.S. chart and sold two million copies, re-establishing Slash as a mainstream performer. A year-and-a-half-long tour followed in support of the album. In July 2007, Velvet Revolver released their second album, Libertad, and embarked on a second tour. During a show in March 2008, Weiland announced to the audience that it would be the band's final tour; he was fired from the band in April 2008, Slash insisted \\"chemical issues\\" led to the split. The following month Weiland rejoined Stone Temple Pilots. Despite Weiland's departure, Velvet Revolver did not officially disband. In early 2010, Velvet Revolver began writing new songs and auditioning new singers. By January 2011, the band had recorded nine demos, and was reportedly due to make a decision on their singer. However, the following April, Slash stated that they had been unable to find a suitable singer and that Velvet Revolver would remain on hiatus for the next few years while its members focus on other projects.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose it is hot outside happens, how will it affect more water evaporates. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of increased temperature (it being hot outside) can have both direct and indirect effects on the process you described. Here's how it affects the different stages of the process: 1. Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky: If it's hot outside, this can contribute to more rapid evaporation, meaning more water enters the atmosphere, leading to more available water vapor in the air. This rise in temperature can potentially increase the humidity, which in turn can affect cloud formation. 2. Water droplets are in clouds: When it's hot outside, the atmosphere's capacity to hold water vapor increases, so more water vapor can be present in the air before condensation occurs. This can potentially delay the formation of water droplets in clouds and might lead to cloud formation at higher altitudes where the air is cooler. 3. The air gets cold: As air rises in the atmosphere, it cools down even if it's hot at the ground level. In high-altitude clouds, cold air can still cause water vapor to condense into droplets or ice crystals. However, if the outside temperature is higher, the altitude where the air gets cold enough for this process to happen may be higher as well. 4. Water droplets turn into ice crystals: As the air continues to cool, water droplets can turn into ice crystals. With higher temperatures, these transformations might happen at even higher altitudes, or the composition of clouds may shift towards a greater percentage of water droplets compared to ice crystals (since a higher temperature could prevent some of the droplets from freezing). 5. Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes: This stage may not be significantly affected by higher temperatures outside, as long as there are ice crystals present in the clouds. However, if there are fewer ice crystals due to the warmer conditions, the overall number of snowflakes formed could be reduced. In summary, the perturbation of increased temperature, or it being hot outside, can have direct and indirect effects on the process. Higher temperatures can promote more rapid evaporation and increase the humidity, potentially affecting cloud formation and composition. This might lead to fewer ice crystals and snowflakes being formed, and clouds forming at higher altitudes."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text: \`\` but it just would n't be fair to the others , you know what i 'm sayin ' ?

In this process, the following steps occur: 1. Rain falls on wood: This is the starting point where the wood is exposed to rain. 2. The rain seeps into the wood surface: Rainwater penetrates the surface of the wood, making it porous. 3. It permeates the wood: Rainwater infiltrates deeper into the structure of the wood, affecting its interior. 4. When rain evaporates it leaves the wood: After the rain stops, the water left in the wood begins to evaporate. 5. It takes the finish of the wood with it: As the water evaporates, it also takes away the wood's finish or protective coating (e.g., paint, sealant, stain). 6.

The Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), in addition to a large output of church music and madrigals, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida...

Although the reviewer acknowledges the low price point of the 12 iron, the various details provided indicate that the iron's performance and quality are far from satisfactory. Firstly, the review points out that the steam setting is ineffective, as it \\"aggressively pours water onto your clothes.” This shows that the iron might not only fail to smoothen garments, but could also damage delicate fabrics by soaking them in water. The steam setting, which is supposed to be a beneficial feature, appears to contribute to a negative experience with the product. Secondly, the metal plate is described as being \\"rough-edged and grabs fabrics,\\" which could lead to damage, tears, or snags on clothing items being ironed. This further highlights the iron's poor build quality, a quality that is undesirable in a product designed to handle fabrics of various kinds. Thirdly, the reviewer states that the metal surface is \\"grippy and ensures that you only get more wrinkles in than you get out.\\" This point is particularly damning for the iron, as its primary purpose is to remove wrinkles and offer a polished appearance to clothes. If the product is adding more wrinkles to the clothing rather than removing them, it demonstrates a serious deficiency in the iron's functionality. The reviewer's final statement, \\"But, hey! It's only 12! Think of how much you save,\\" seems to underscore the product's low quality by blatantly acknowledging the low price as its major selling point. It suggests that buyers should not expect much in terms of performance or build quality, as they are sacrificing those aspects for the sake of saving money.

Options: - rest area - bus depot - theatre - bus stop - church Please answer and provide answer explanation.","output":"The best option for finding seating while waiting to take public transit in a major city would be at a bus stop. Bus stops are specifically designed as places for passengers to wait for buses, and they often include seating areas for commuters' comfort. These seating areas may consist of benches or chairs, providing a place for travelers to sit and rest while they wait for their bus to arrive. Not all bus stops may have seating, but larger stops or transport hubs often provide some seating arrangements. Other options provided have their primary purposes and are not directly associated with public transit: - Rest area: Generally found along highways, these locations often have parking, restrooms, and seating areas. However, rest areas are not typically intended for public transit usage. - Bus depot: A bus depot is where buses are stored, maintained, and refueled when they are not in service. While it may have seating areas for transit workers, it is not designed as a waiting area for passengers. - Theatre: A theatre is primarily meant for hosting performing arts and cinematic presentations. While theatres often have seating, they are not related to public transit services, and it may be inappropriate to use their seating for this purpose. - Church: Churches serve as places of worship and, while they may have seating inside, they are not associated with public transit and should not be used for waiting for public transportation."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Understand the meaning of the word: Astounds means to amaze or surprise someone greatly. 2. Analyze the context: Since the word is presented without any context, it is important to consider general connotations that could be derived from its meaning. 3.

Article: What if handheld tools know what needs to be done and were even able to guide and help inexperienced users to complete jobs that require skill? Researchers at the University of Bristol have developed and started studying a novel concept in robotics--intelligent handheld robots. Historically, handheld tools have been straight, unintelligent instruments that are _ of the context they operate in, are fully directed by the user, and therefore, lack any understanding about the task they are performing. Dr. Walterio Mayol-Cuevas and PhD student, Austin Gregg-Smith, from the University's Department of Computer Science, have been working in the design of the robot as well as in understanding how best to be with a tool that \\"knows and acts\\". Compared to other tools such as power tools that have a motor and perhaps some basic sensors , the handheld robots developed at Bristol are designed to have more degrees of freedom to allow greater independence from the instructions of the user, and importantly, understand the steps being carried out. This allows for a new level of co-operation between user and tool, such as the user providing directions and the tool performing the detailed task. Handheld robots, aim to share physical similarity with users but are neither fully independent as is a humanoid robot nor are part of the user's body. The aim with handheld robots is to develop the intuitiveness of using traditional handheld tools while adding planted intelligence and action to allow for new abilities. Dr. Mayol-Cuevas, Reader in Robotics Computer Vision and Mobile Systems, said, \\"There are three basic levels of autonomy we are considering: no autonomy, semi-autonomous when the robot advises the user but does not act, and fully autonomous when the robot advises and acts even by correcting or refusing to perform incorrect user actions.\\" Question: What can we learn from the passage? - The handheld robots can never disobey the user's order. - The autonomy is the only thing that the scientists are considering. - There will be more intelligence and independence in the handheld robots. - The aim of the handheld robots is to correct and refuse the user's directions.","output":"What we can learn from the passage is that there will be more intelligence and independence in the handheld robots."},{"instruction":"Come up with a question and stream of consciousness reasoning that would justify this answer: 5250","output":"Question: How much money do I need to raise in order to provide 35 students with scholarships of 150 each?

I want to help as many students as possible, but I am not sure of their exact financial needs. I know many students could really benefit from a scholarship of about 150, though. Since there are about 35 low-income students in my community, I wonder how much I need to raise in total to provide each student with a 150 scholarship. To find that out, I can just multiply the number of students (35) by the amount I want to give each student (150). So, 35 students multiplied by 150 dollars per student equals 5250 dollars.

A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a 16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.\\" Question: This passage is mainly about _ . - different kinds of tipping in different countries - the relationship between tipping and custom - the origin and present meaning of tipping - most American people hate tipping Answer:","output":"the origin and present meaning of tipping"},{"instruction":"Question: Although the younger of the two leagues by 25 years (and sometimes called the Junior Circuit), which league has won 62 of the 106 World Series games played since 1903?

Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 17:41 EST, 9 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 17:41 EST, 9 May 2013. Los Angeles Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant has scored a victory in an ongoing legal battle with his own mother, who planned to auction off more than a million dollars’ worth of his sports memorabilia. This week, a judge issued a temporary restraining order against Goldin Auctions barring the auction house from selling Bryant's basketball jerseys, jackets, high school championship rings, trophies and other collectibles pending a full hearing. The New Jersey-based auction business has filed a complaint claiming that Bryant's mother, Pamela Bryant, put up for sale a large collection of sports memorabilia, which she had received as a gift from her millionaire son. The items numbering in the hundreds were expected to fetch around 1.5million. Family feud: Lakers star Kobe Bryant has accused his mother, Pamela (pictured) of selling his valuable collection of memorabilia, and even stealing some of the items from his home. He said, she said: Kobe Bryant (left) insisted that his mother (right) was never given consent to take his collectibles and sell them, but Pamela Bryant claims her son had given her permission to auction them off. Earlier this year, Mrs Bryant joined forces with the Berlin, New Jersey-based Goldin Auctions to sell the sports mementos from her son's high school days and early NBA career. In return, Pamela Bryant received a 450,000 advance, which she in turn used to buy a house in Nevada. However, the 34-year-old athlete, who is currently recovering from a season-ending injury to his Achilles’ tendon, filed his own complaint against the auction house insisting that he had never given his mother permission to sell his memorabilia. Mr Bryant went on to stay in his court filing that his mother stole some of his personal items from his house, TMZ reported. 'I never told my mother that she could have my personal property, let alone consign it for public auction,' Bryant wrote. According to the complaint filed Wednesday in US District Court in Camden, New Jersey, the Lakers shooting guard claimed that Mrs Bryant admitted to him recently that she was never given consent to sell his possessions. 'I confronted her about her false. statement that I had given my memorabilia to her,' Bryant wrote in the filing cited by ESPN. 'I said. to her, \\"Mom, you know I never told you that you could have the. memorabilia.\\" 'Her response. was, \\"Yes, but you never said you wanted it, either.\\" Of course, this is. untrue, since my wife and I requested that she return my memorabilia. several years earlier.' Last. week, Kobe Bryant's lawyers demanded that Goldin Auctions scrap the. scheduled June sale. In response, the auction house sued the athlete for. the right to go ahead with the sale of The Kobe Bryant Collection. Mr. Bryant has emphasized that he was only suing the auctioneers and not. his mother, but both he and his wife, Vanessa, had testified in writing. that Pamela Bryant took the memorabilia and put it on the auction block. without their permission, and then refused to return the prized. possessions. Bryant said in. a sworn statement that the items at the center of the dispute go back. to his teenage years have 'tremendous sentimental value,' adding that he. was planning to hand down his 'well-deserved memorabilia’ to his. children, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. Bryant said his mother can claim ownership of only two items, NBA Championship rings that he had custom-made for his parents. For sale: An advertisement for an auction of items belonging to Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant is seen just before the basketball star ordered the auction house to stop. Deal: A lawsuit by the New Jersey auction house claims that Kobe Bryant's mother Pamela Bryant, seen beside his father Joe Bryant, already struck a deal with them for the items' sale. Vanessa. Bryant also weighed in on the mother-son spat, stating that when. confronted about the items, her mother-in-law agreed to return theme,. but said that she had moved all the jerseys and championship mementos to. a storage facility. Attorneys for both sides in the legal dispute will present their arguments in the case May 20 in Camden. The disagreement is a high-value,. high-profile version of a question many families face: Can Mom get rid. of the stuff a grown child left at home? In this case, the 900 mementos happen to be worth upward of 1.5 million. Among. the first 100 or so items Pamela Bryant intends to sell: the NBA star's. jerseys, practice gear and sweatsuits from Lower Merion High School;. varsity letters; a trophy for being the outstanding player at the 1995. Adidas ABCD basketball camp; and a signed basketball from the 2000 NBA. championship game. And. then there are rings, for the 1996 Pennsylvania high school. championship, a pair that the Lakers made for Bryant's parents for the. 2000 NBA championship and one from the 1998 NBA All-Star game. According. to court filings, Pamela Bryant struck a deal in January with Goldin. Auctions in Berlin, N.J., which earlier this year sold a rare Honus. Wagner baseball card for a record 2.1 million. In its court filings, Goldin says. Pamela Bryant told the auction house that she asked her son five years. ago what he wanted to do with the items that were in her home. 'Kobe Bryant indicated to Pamela. Bryant that the items belonged to her and that he had no interest in. them,' the auction house's attorneys wrote. So she put them in a. 1,500-per-month New Jersey storage unit. Gifted: A Los Angeles Lakers championship ring given by Kobe to his father Joe Bryant is seen among the items the auction house hopes to sell. Fair game: Two Lower Merion High School basketball jerseys worn by Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant are seen for sale though Bryant contends that his mother doesn't have the right to sell the collectibles. Price tag: The 900 items belonging to Bryant, seen with his wife Vanessa at a cancer research benefit on Thursday, could bring in upward of 1.5 million. The challenge came last Tuesday when Goldin sent a news release announcing the auction. By day's end, Kobe Bryant's lawyer had sent a cease-and-desist letter telling the auction house to call off the sale and return the items to him. Kenneth Goldin, owner of the auction house, says he can't cancel the auction because he's already advanced 450,000 to Bryant's mother and put money into advertising the auction. Kobe Bryant's lawyer Mark Campbell said in a statement, 'Mr. Bryant's personal property has ended up in the possession of someone who does not lawfully own it. We look forward to resolving this legal matter through the legal system.' Bryant has had a sometimes icy relationship with his mother and father, Joe 'Jellybean' Bryant, a former pro basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers who is now coaching in Thailand.","output":"Basketball player Kobe Bryant had a disagreement with his mom, Pamela Bryant, because she wanted to sell some of his sports things that are worth a lot of money.

Anita, inspired by her dalmatian, designs a coat made with spotted fur. Cruella is intrigued by the idea of making garments out of actual dalmatians and finds it amusing that it would seem as if she was wearing Anita's dog. Anita soon discovers that Perdita is pregnant, and is then informed that she is too, much to her shock. Some time later, Cruella visits their home, and expresses contempt upon meeting Roger. Her initial disgust at them having a baby turns to excitement when she finds out Perdita is expecting too.

Answer choices: - Something to move - to stay alive - solid, liquid, gas - increased body strength - To keep their body heat. - a gas in the air - potential energy - chemicals A:","output":"Animals use saturated fatty acids to become potential energy, which ultimately serves various purposes within their bodies. By generating potential energy through the metabolism of saturated fatty acids, animals accomplish the following: 1. Something to move: Potential energy from saturated fatty acids is converted into kinetic energy, which is essential for muscle contractions and overall movement in animals. This energy powers essential activities such as hunting, escaping predators, and reproduction. 2. To stay alive: Potential energy is crucial for maintaining vital functions within an animal's body. This includes cellular maintenance, immune responses, and wound healing. The energy derived from fatty acids ensures that these processes can occur efficiently. 3. Solid, liquid, gas: Although not directly related to the states of matter (solid, liquid, and gas), the potential energy from fatty acids plays a role in maintaining various structural components within an animal's body. For example, the stored energy can be utilized to maintain cellular integrity and regulate temperature. 4. Increased body strength: The energy gained from saturated fatty acids helps in muscle development and strength. This enables animals to adapt more effectively to their environments and perform various tasks necessary for survival and reproduction. 5. To keep their body heat: Many animals, especially mammals, use the energy generated from fatty acids to help maintain their body temperature. This is known as thermogenesis, which is a valuable evolutionary adaptation in cold environments. 6. A gas in the air: While the energy from saturated fatty acids does not directly produce gas in the air, it can facilitate the production of various gaseous substances within an animal's body, such as carbon dioxide. These gases are then expelled via respiration. 7. Potential energy: As mentioned earlier, saturated fatty acids serve as a source of potential energy for animals. This stored energy can be accessed when needed, such as during periods of fasting, hibernation, or other strenuous activities. 8. Chemicals: Breaking down saturated fatty acids into potential energy involves a series of biochemical reactions and transformations. This process generates chemicals necessary for various bodily functions, such as digestive enzymes and hormones. In summary, animals use saturated fatty acids to become potential energy, which subsequently aids in a multitude of biological processes. These include movement, life-sustaining functions, the maintenance of body structure and temperature, increased strength, and facilitating biochemical reactions."},{"instruction":"Are these paraphrases?

The only major fight scene in \\"Beat Street\\" was when graffiti artist Ramon (which in the movie was abbreviated as \\"Ramo\\") is chased by a rival gang member on the New York City subway tracks.....fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail. Well, although that chase scene ended tragically, it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang gunshot. Most of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hip-hop culture, and rap music. A lot of rap music appeared in the flick, because hip-hop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life. Even the theme song of the movie, which closed the curtain to the flick, was not just an homage to hip-hop culture--it also was an homage to the death of Ramon. By the way, during the dance scene called 'Tango, Tango', I guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E. making a cameo appearance. Select from: a). negative; b). positive;","output":"This review falls into a b). positive category. The user specifically mentioned liking the break-dance scenes and tricks in \\"Beat Street\\". They appreciated the representation of gang violence as less extreme than other movies. They also mentioned that rap music was used as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life, which they saw as a positive contribution to the movie. Additionally, they identified an actress in a cameo appearance, which likely contributed to their overall enjoyment of the film. Therefore, despite some criticisms (e.g., the comparison of the film to \\"Flashdance\\" and the tragic ending), the overall tone of the review is positive because it is largely composed of praise for various aspects of the film."},{"instruction":"Give some stream of consciousness and then the answer. Established in 1891, as a result of the Populist movement, the People's Party reached its peak in the 1892 presidential election, when its ticket, composed of James B. Weaver and James G. Field, won 8.5 % of the popular vote and carried five states (Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada and North Dakota), and the 1894 House of Representatives elections, when it took over 10 % of the vote. Built on a coalition of poor, white cotton farmers in the South (especially North Carolina, Alabama and Texas) and hard-pressed wheat farmers in the Plains states (especially Kansas and Nebraska), the Populists represented a radical crusading form of agrarianism and hostility to elites, cities, banks, railroads, and gold. Answer this question: who did the peoples party nominate for president in 1892?","output":"The People's Party nominated James B. Weaver as their presidential candidate in the 1892 election, with James G. Field as his running mate."},{"instruction":"Answer this question: what is the response to as salamu alaykum??","output":"The response to \\"As-salamu alaykum\\" is \\"Wa alaykum as-salam\\" or \\"Wa alaykum as-salam wa rahmatullah\\" or \\"Wa alaykum as-salam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.\\" When greeted with \\"As-salamu alaykum,\\" which means \\"Peace be upon you\\" in Arabic, it is an Islamic etiquette and an act of worship to reply with a slightly better or at least an equal response. Let's break down the responses: 1. \\"Wa alaykum as-salam\\" (وَعَلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَامُ): This response translates to \\"And peace be upon you too.\\" Here, \\"wa\\" (وَ) means \\"and,\\" \\"alaykum\\" (عَلَيْكُمُ) means \\"upon you,\\" and \\"as-salam\\" (ٱلسَّلَامُ) means \\"peace.\\" This response is the simplest and most basic form, which you may use when someone greets you with \\"As-salamu alaykum.\\" 2. \\"Wa alaykum as-salam wa rahmatullah\\" (وَعَلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَامُ وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ): This response means \\"And peace be upon you, and Allah's mercy.\\" It is an enhanced response that includes invoking Allah's mercy upon the person who greeted you. \\"Rahmatullah\\" (رَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ) is a combination of the words \\"rahmah\\" (رَحْمَةُ) which means \\"mercy\\" and \\"Allah\\" (ٱللَّٰهِ), referring to the name of God in Islam. 3. \\"Wa alaykum as-salam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh\\" (وَعَلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَامُ وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ): This is the most complete and rewarding response, meaning \\"And peace be upon you, and Allah's mercy, and His blessings.\\" In this phrase, \\"barakatuh\\" (وَبَرَكَاتُهُ) means \\"and His blessings.\\" This comprehensive reply not only acknowledges the person's greeting but adds additional blessings, which is highly recommended in Islamic teachings. It is important to note that responding to the greeting of \\"As-salamu alaykum\\" is not only a cultural practice but also a religious obligation in Islam. According to the Quran (4:86), when someone greets you with a peace greeting, you should respond with a better greeting or at least an equal one to promote peace and harmonious relationships among people."},{"instruction":"Can we conclude from \\"A group of people is setting up plastic poles in the middle of a city.\\" that \\"It is a rainy day.\\"?

Given the context: How would Sydney feel afterwards? Choices: a. like she dominated; b. a supportive friend; c. she had no care; The answer is:","output":"b. a supportive friend Given the context, it is clear that Sydney made a decision for Kai because Kai was unable to decide about the couch. In this situation, Sydney likely feels like a supportive friend because she stepped in to help Kai make a choice when they were struggling to do so on their own. This kind of action demonstrates caring and empathy for a friend, as Sydney was aware of Kai's indecision and took it upon herself to ease that burden. It is important to consider the dynamics of their friendship and how Sydney might view her own actions to fully understand why she feels like a supportive friend. If Sydney and Kai have a close friendship based on trust and understanding, it is natural that Sydney would want to assist her friend when they were having difficulties making a decision. Sydney's intention was likely to ease Kai's stress or anxiety related to the couch decision, reflecting a desire to be supportive and helpful. In contrast, if Sydney felt like she dominated (choice a), it would imply that her primary motivation for making the decision was to exert control over Kai or the situation. This does not appear to be the case, as she stepped in only when Kai wouldn't decide, suggesting a genuine intention to help. Similarly, if Sydney had no care (choice c), she likely would not have taken the time to help Kai make a decision about the couch. In conclusion, Sydney's actions indicate that she feels like a supportive friend after making up Kai's mind about the couch. Her willingness to help Kai in their time of need strengthens their friendship and shows that she truly cares about Kai's well-being."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: yeah yeah i like both but since i'm in an apartment i just i don't think an apartment is big enough for a dog dogs to me dogs need a yard even little dogs they just need a yard Here is a hypothesis: I'm in an apartment so it wouldn't be good to get a dog.

A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada. - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries.

Its adherents worship him in much the same way as Jesus in his Second Advent, or as God the Son. Members of the Rastafari way of life are known as Rastafari, Rastas, or simply Ras. Rastafari are also known by their official church titles, such as Elder or High Priest. The way of life is sometimes referred to as \\"Rastafarianism\\", but this term is considered offensive by most Rastafari, who, being critical of \\"isms\\" or \\"ians\\" (which they see as a typical part of \\"Babylon\\" culture), dislike being labelled as an \\"ism\\" or \\"ian\\" themselves. Rastafari has always been conceived as a way of life for and by people of African descent. - Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles.

The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD.

The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - The Greater Antilles is a grouping of the larger islands in the Caribbean Sea: Cuba, Hispaniola (containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands. The Greater Antilles constitute over 90% of the land mass of the entire West Indies, as well as over 90% of its population, with the balance made of the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, which is a chain of islands to the east (running north-south and encompassing the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean) and south (running east-west off the northern coast of South America). - I Wayne, Rastafarian stage name for Cliffroy Taylor (born 1980 in Portmore, Jamaica), is a roots reggae singer. He is known for his hit singles \\"Living In Love\\" and \\"Can't Satisfy Her\\" from his debut album, \\"Lava Ground\\". - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. - Roots reggae is a subgenre of reggae that deals with the everyday lives and aspirations of the artists concerned, including the spiritual side of Rastafari and the honoring of God, called Jah by Rastafari. It also is identified with the life of the ghetto sufferer, and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include spirituality and religion, poverty, black pride, social issues, resistance to government and racial oppression, and repatriation to Africa. - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums. - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos.

Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.

C. Slap the padding and pumps her foot - This sounds like someone is trying to help, but might not know the best way to make her feel better. D.

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. The Malegese Ocean is primarily connected to one river. This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash. Who is causing less marine pollution? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is clear that Luke is causing less marine pollution in comparison to Hilda. There are a few factors contributing to this distinction. Firstly, the Dundrin Ocean, which is connected to Luke's farm, is primarily linked with rivers located in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. This suggests that there is likely less human intervention and pollution in these rivers feeding into the Dundrin Ocean. On the other hand, the Malegese Ocean, which is primarily connected to the river near Hilda's farm, has a direct source of potentially hazardous chemicals and particles from the agricultural activities taking place on Hilda's farm. Secondly, Hilda was taught from a young age to dispose of excess fertilizer into the nearby river. As a result, she unknowingly contributes to the introduction of harmful chemicals and particles into the Malegese Ocean. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals, such as fertilizers from agricultural activities, can lead to hypoxia and create dead zones in marine environments, negatively impacting marine life and ecosystems. This practice greatly contributes to marine pollution. In contrast, Luke has implemented more environmentally-friendly practices on his farm, as he does not dispose of any garbage or waste into the ocean or nearby rivers. Instead, he opts to store excess fertilizer for future use or properly disposes of it. By carefully managing his waste products, he significantly reduces his contribution to marine pollution in the surrounding waterways and the Dundrin Ocean. In conclusion, Luke's conscious efforts to minimize his environmental impact and the natural state of the rivers connected to the Dundrin Ocean make him the individual causing less marine pollution between the two."},{"instruction":"sales of wine, total (1000 litres) Please write the text above using proper case.","output":"Sales of Wine, Total (1000 Litres) The phrase \\"Sales of Wine, Total (1000 Litres)\\" is an expression that signifies the total volume of wine sold, measured in thousands of litres. To better understand this concept, we can analyze it in more detail by breaking it down into its various components. 1. Sales: The term \\"sales\\" refers to the act of selling goods or services. In this context, it specifically pertains to the selling of wine, which is an alcoholic beverage produced by fermenting grapes or other fruits. 2. Wine: Wine is a popular and diverse beverage that has been consumed for centuries across the globe. It is produced in a wide variety of styles and flavors by different winemakers from diverse regions, each with their unique signature on the final product. Some well-known wine categories include red, white, rosé, and sparkling. 3. Total: The term \\"total\\" implies that the figure given for wine sales takes into account all types of wine, across all market segments, channels, and geographies. This encompasses domestic and international sales, retail and online transactions, and both on- and off-premise sales (such as bars, restaurants, hotels, and liquor stores). 4. 1000 Litres: In the phrase \\"Sales of Wine, Total (1000 Litres)\\", the numbers provided are an indication of the quantity of wine sold, specifically in increments of one thousand litres. This unit of measurement is used for the sake of simplicity and convenience, as sales figures could be quite large and denoting them in individual litres would be cumbersome. So, the expression \\"Sales of Wine, Total (1000 Litres)\\" denotes the cumulative amount of all types of wine sold across various sales channels and geographical markets, measured in multiples of a thousand litres. This information can be invaluable for winemakers, distributors, retailers, and market analysts since it provides an overview of the overall performance of the wine industry, including consumer preferences, market trends, and growth potential. Analyzing such sales data can lead to better-informed decisions for businesses in the wine sector, ultimately resulting in their enhanced success and profitability."},{"instruction":"Question: How much is the offer to settle out of court?

Blundering his way through the preliminaries, listening to his own enthusiastic expert witness, and visiting the paralyzed woman, Deborah Ann Kaye (Susan Benenson) in a vegetative state in the aftercare home, Frank suddenly realizes that perhaps the case should go to court: to punish the guilty, to get a decent settlement for his clients, and to restore his standing as a lawyer. To the astonishment of Mickey, Frank refuses a 210,000 settlement offer from the Arch Dioceses, and the hospital to settle the case.In his enthusiasm over his expert witness and his new found sense of purpose, Frank enters the bar where he usually hangs out and offers to buy everyone a drink. He notices a young woman, sitting at the end of the bar where he usually hangs out but she turns down his offer. The next night, after preparing for the case with Mickey, they see her at the bar again, and Frank decides that he is going to get laid. Laura Fischer (Rampling) does agree to have dinner with him and ends up at Frank's apartment for the night.

The battle occurred between the United States and Japan from February 19 to March 26, 1945, on the small island of Iwo Jima in the Japanese Volcano Islands. On February 23, 1945, five U.S. Marines and one U.S. Navy corpsman, part of the 5th Marine Division, raised the American flag on Mount Suribachi, the highest point on Iwo Jima. This historical event was captured in the famous photograph taken by Associated Press (AP) photographer Joe Rosenthal called “Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima.” The photograph later served as the basis for the Marine Corps War Memorial near Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington, D.C. There were actually two flag-raisings that took place on Mount Suribachi. The first flag was raised in the morning, and this flag was later replaced by a larger flag in the afternoon, which was captured in Rosenthal's iconic photograph. The first flag-raising included the following American servicemen: 1. Lieutenant Harold Schrier 2. Sergeant Ernest Thomas 3. Corporal Charles Lindberg 4. Private First Class James Michels 5. Private First Class Raymond Jacobs (radio operator) The second flag-raising, which is the more famous and widely recognized of the two, included the following servicemen: 1. Sergeant Michael Strank, USMC - He was a squad leader of the group, but was later killed in action. 2. Corporal Harlon H. Block, USMC - He was initially misidentified as another serviceman. Block was also killed in action. 3. Private First Class Franklin R. Sousley, USMC - He too lost his life in the battle. 4. Private First Class Harold H. Schultz, USMC - His identity as one of the flag raisers became public knowledge only in 2016 after historical reexamination. 5. Private First Class Ira H. Hayes, USMC - He was one of the servicemen who survived the battle and was instrumental in correcting Block's misidentification. 6. Pharmacist's Mate Second Class John H. Bradley, USN - As a Navy Corpsman, he was initially identified as a participant in the first flag-raising, but was later confirmed to be part of the second flag-raising event. The raising of the American flag on Iwo Jima is an enduring symbol of courage, teamwork, and triumph in the face of adversity. The men who raised the flag are remembered as heroes, and their actions inspire admiration, respect, and gratitude for their sacrifices during World War II."},{"instruction":"What type of details about ross cameron can be gathered from the following bio?

What is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this \\"exposure\\" of Khouri is made with Khouri's full participation. For the initial portion of the film, Khouri presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in Amman, the story of the book. She sounds completely believable, convincing. Then her story is taken apart, exposed, by eminently believable and convincing people, such as women's rights activists in Jordan, investigative reporters there and in Australia, where Khouri lived for a while. Khouri comes back and denies the accusations, taking a successful lie-detector test in the process. There comes another segment of devastating exposures - not to be specified here because that would lessen the shock value... and then Khouri comes back and faces the accusations (not all, but the essential ones in the matter of the book).

Here's why: The key hint in the question that dictates the kind of information being sought is \\"In what city.\\" The nature of this phrase indicates a geographical answer, i.e., a location. The question seeks to identify the city that hosts or contains the referenced entity (St. Mark's Square). Location-based questions often ask \\"where\\", in which country, city, place etc., telling us that the answer sought is a geographical area or point. St. Mark's Square is a known public square of Venice, Italy, hence recognizing it as a location makes sense. Let's look at the other options: I. Description - The question is not prompting for a detailed explanation or characterization of St. Mark's Square, or of any other thing or concept. II. Entity - While St. Mark's Square could be considered an entity (a thing with distinct and independent existence), the question is not about the square itself but where it is located. III.

In September 1940, as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange.

Second question: What is the difference between IT and CS? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, let me address each question separately. Question 1: Which is the best between a BSc in Computer Science and a BSc in IT? The answer to this question depends on your personal interests, goals, and the specific curriculum offered by a particular institution. However, I can provide a general comparison between both degrees. A Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Computer Science (CS) typically emphasizes the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, software development, computer architecture, and more. This degree provides a strong foundation in theoretical concepts as well as practical skills required to build, analyze, and optimize computer systems and software. Graduates with a computer science degree generally have a strong foundation in mathematics and problem-solving skills, which enables them to pursue various computer-related career paths such as software engineering, data analysis, artificial intelligence research, and more. On the other hand, a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Information Technology (IT) is generally focused on implementing and managing existing computer systems, networks, and software solutions. This degree prepares students for careers related to the management of information systems, network administration, technical support, and more. IT courses may cover topics such as systems analysis, database management, project management, and IT planning. While there might be some overlap with Computer Science in terms of software development, Information Technology degree programs are more focused on the practical application and management of technology in various industries. To determine which is best for you, consider your interests and career aspirations. If you enjoy solving complex problems with algorithms, are mathematically inclined, and are interested in designing and developing software, a BSc in Computer Science might be more suitable for you. Conversely, if you are more interested in applying technology solutions to support organizational goals and provide technical support to users, a BSc in IT would be a better fit. Question 2: What is the difference between IT and CS? While these fields share some similarities, they are distinctly different in their focus and applications. Here's a summary of the differences between the two: - Information Technology (IT) involves the practical application of computer systems, software, and networks for the management and support of business processes. IT professionals are responsible for implementing, maintaining, and updating computer systems, providing technical support, and managing information security. - Computer Science (CS), on the other hand, is the study of theoretical foundations of information and computation, as well as the development and application of computer systems and software. CS professionals are concerned with designing algorithms, implementing programming languages, and developing software solutions. In simpler terms, IT is more focused on how technology can be used and managed in organizations, while CS deals with the underlying principles and technologies for designing and building computer systems and software. Are these two questions asking the same thing? These two questions are related but not the same. The main difference between them is the context: 1. The first question is comparing two specific degree programs (BSc in Computer Science and BSc in IT) and seeking to determine which one is \\"better\\" or more suitable for an individual's interests and career goals. 2. The second question asks about the general differences between the fields of IT (Information Technology) and CS (Computer Science) as a whole, without any specific reference to degree programs. Overall, both questions help to illustrate the distinction between the study and practice of Computer Science and Information Technology, but they emphasize different aspects of that difference."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: School of Business and Social Sciences at the Aarhus University CITY Aarhus; School of Business and Social Sciences at the Aarhus University COUNTRY Denmark; School of Business and Social Sciences at the Aarhus University AFFILIATION European University Association; School of Business and Social Sciences at the Aarhus University ESTABLISHED 1928.

Step 4: Discuss the analysis of the confiscated materials The data evaluation and sorting process is being carried out by a special task force, which has expertise in counter-terrorism and intelligence analysis. They will carefully sift through the materials, which include documents, computers, and electronic devices, to extract any relevant information that could lead to the identification of ongoing terrorist plots or potential threats to the United States. Step 5: Explain the importance of this intelligence The confiscated materials and their analysis could play a crucial role in the ongoing fight against terrorism, as they could lead to actionable intelligence that helps disrupt and prevent future attacks. It may also offer a better understanding of al Qaeda's organizational structure, operational capabilities, and its key operatives, providing a clearer picture of the threat the group poses. Step 6: Discuss the challenges of assessing the intelligence The official acknowledged that it will take time to fully assess the value of the intelligence retrieved from the bin Laden compound since there is an immense amount of data to go through. Moreover, deciphering the contents might prove difficult if the materials are encrypted or if the information is coded to avoid detection. Step 7: Highlight the progress made so far Despite the challenges, the initial review of the materials has already provided valuable information, showing that bin Laden was actively involved in al Qaeda's strategic planning. This gives hope that further analysis will result in actionable intelligence and a better understanding of the terrorist organization. In conclusion, the analysis of the confiscated materials from Osama bin Laden's compound will likely shed more light on al Qaeda's plans and operations. As the special task force continues to evaluate and examine these materials, the U.S. and its allies hope to find intelligence that will help prevent future terrorist attacks and destabilize al Qaeda's operations."},{"instruction":"Massimilla Doni - Massimilla Doni is a short story by Honoré de Balzac.

The ingredients mentioned in the premise include ground almonds, orange-blossom honey, egg white, and sugar. However, the type of sugar used in the production of turren is not specified in the premise - whether it is white sugar or brown sugar. The hypothesis states, \\"Turren uses brown sugar rather than white sugar.\\" To evaluate the validity of this hypothesis, we must first understand the context in which this hypothesis was proposed. Assuming that this hypothesis was proposed as an alteration to the traditional recipe or it is up for consideration against the information provided in the premise, let's examine the factors. Turren, with its Moorish origin, has been around for a considerable time. This means that the recipe has been passed down through generations, and variations in its ingredients may have evolved over time. In the original premise, the term \\"sugar\\" is mentioned without any specification. The ambiguity of the term \\"sugar\\" doesn't necessarily disprove the hypothesis, as it leaves room for the possibility that brown sugar could be used in the recipe. Sugar, whether white or brown, is primarily composed of sucrose. While the nutritional content and flavor profile may vary, both white sugar and brown sugar can be used as sweeteners in recipes. However, they could affect the final color, texture, and flavor of the product differently. Brown sugar has molasses, which imparts a richer flavor and a slightly moist, dense texture to the sweets. White sugar, on the other hand, has a neutral flavor that doesn't alter or overpower other ingredients' taste, and it tends to provide a lighter texture. One could argue that using either white sugar or brown sugar might not significantly deviate from the traditional turren recipe due to their similar core composition. In this context, the hypothesis remains plausible. While the hypothesis cannot be directly confirmed based on the information provided in the premise, it is also not disproven. To reach a more definitive conclusion, we would require more information about the traditional recipe for turren, especially regarding the type of sugar used. In this scenario, only further research into the historical and original recipes of turren and the prevalent practices in the town itself can provide a better understanding of whether the hypothesis is accurate or not."},{"instruction":"Yes / no, is the following a verifiable fact? \\"The Oakland Raiders relocated cities and are now called the Las Vegas Raiders.\\" Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"Yes, the statement is a verifiable fact.

Which property could be measured with a balance?","output":"When preparing a layer cake with oil, water, and frosting, various properties can be measured throughout the process, but a balance would primarily be used to measure mass or weight of the ingredients or end product. In this case, we can consider the following properties that could be measured with a balance: 1. Mass of the individual ingredients: Before mixing the ingredients, Jennifer and Mark might have used a balance to ensure the correct amount of each ingredient was used in the recipe. This includes the oil, water, flour, sugar, eggs, baking powder, and any other ingredients that were necessary. 2. Mass of the cake batter: After combining the wet and dry ingredients, Jennifer and Mark could have measured the mass of the cake batter to ensure it was evenly divided into the proper baking pans for the layer cake. 3. Mass of each cake layer: When the cake was removed from the oven, each layer could be individually weighed to ensure consistency in mass, which would help create a symmetrical and visually appealing final product. By weighing each layer, Jennifer and Mark could make adjustments if necessary, such as trimming off excess cake or adding extra frosting to balance the layers. 4. Mass of the frosting: Before applying the frosting to the cake, Jennifer and Mark could have used a balance to measure the mass of the frosting, ensuring they had enough to cover the entire cake and potentially making adjustments to the recipe as needed. 5. Total mass of the finished layer cake: Once the frosting was applied to the cake layers and the final product was assembled, Jennifer and Mark could weigh the entire layer cake to determine its total mass. This information could be useful for serving purposes, especially if there are dietary restrictions or portion control concerns among the guests. In conclusion, a balance could be used to measure several properties related to the preparation and assembly of a layer cake, with mass and weight being the primary focus. This information would help Jennifer and Mark ensure they are using the correct amounts of ingredients, creating a visually appealing and evenly balanced cake, and addressing any concerns related to serving size and portion control."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: We gather a great deal of incidental knowledge from pets.If we look after them properly we learn what they like and dislike.

Problem:The wind is over 17 meters per second (38 miles per hour) and it is raining. Solution:","output":"In this task, we are asked to translate an English sentence into Bengali. The sentence given is: \\"The wind is over 17 meters per second (38 miles per hour) and it is raining.\\" Before translating the sentence, let's break it down: 1. The main subject is the wind. 2. There are two conditions described: the wind's speed and the fact that it's raining. Now, let's follow these steps to translate the sentence into Bengali: 1. Convert the English sentence into Bengali words: - The wind = বাতাস (batas) - is over = বেশি (beshi) - 17 meters per second = ১৭ মিটার প্রতি সেকেন্ড (17 mitar proti sekend) - 38 miles per hour = ৩৮ মাইল প্রতি ঘন্টা (38 mail proti ghonta) - and = এবং (ebong) - it is raining = এটা বৃষ্টি হচ্ছে (eta brishti hocche) 2. Rearrange the Bengali words according to the sentence structure in Bengali: \\"বাতাস ১৭ মিটার প্রতি সেকেন্ড (৩৮ মাইল প্রতি ঘন্টা) বেশি এবং এটা বৃষ্টি হচ্ছে।\\" So, the translation into Bengali for the given English sentence is: \\"বাতাস ১৭ মিটার প্রতি সেকেন্ড (৩৮ মাইল প্রতি ঘন্টা) বেশি এবং এটা বৃষ্টি হচ্ছে।\\""},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms.

He was the de facto leader of post-war Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomulka was initially very popular for his reforms; his seeking a \\"Polish way to socialism\\"; and giving rise to the period known as \\"Gomulka's thaw\\". In the fall of 1943, the PPR leadership began discussing the creation of a Polish quasi-parliamentary, communist-led body, to be named the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa, KRN). After the Battle of Kursk the expectation was of a Soviet victory and liberation of Poland and the PPR wanted to be ready to assume power. Gomulka came up with the idea of a national council and imposed his point of view on the rest of the leadership. The PPR intended to obtain consent from the Cominterm leader and their Soviet contact Georgi Dimitrov. However, in November the Gestapo arrested Finder and Malgorzata Fornalska, who possessed the secret codes for communication with Moscow and the Soviet response remained unknown. In the absence of Finder, on 23 November Gomulka was elected general secretary (chief) of the PPR and Bierut joined the three-person inner leadership. The founding meeting of the State National Council took place in the late evening of 31 December 1943. The new body's chairman Bierut was becoming Gomulka's main rival. In mid-January 1944 Dimitrov was finally informed of the KRN's existence, which surprised both him and the Polish communist leaders in Moscow, increasingly led by Jakub Berman, who had other, competing ideas concerning the establishment of a Polish communist ruling party and government. Gomulka felt that the Polish communists in occupied Poland had a better understanding of Polish realities than their brethren in Moscow and that the State National Council should determine the shape of the future executive government of Poland. Nevertheless, to gain a Soviet approval and to clear any misunderstandings a KRN delegation left Warsaw in mid-March heading for Moscow, where it arrived two months later. By that time Stalin concluded that the existence of the KRN was a positive development and the Poles arriving from Warsaw were received and greeted by him and other Soviet dignitaries. The Union of Polish Patriots and the Central Bureau of Polish Communists in Moscow were now under pressure to recognize the primacy of the PPR, the KRN and Wladyslaw Gomulka, which they ultimately did only in mid-July. On 20 July, the Soviet forces under Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky forced their way across the Bug River and on that same day the combined meeting of Polish communists from the Moscow and Warsaw factions finalized the arrangements regarding the establishment (on 21 July) of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), a temporary government headed by Edward Osobka-Morawski, a socialist allied with the communists. Gomulka and other PPR leaders left Warsaw and headed for the Soviet-controlled territory, arriving in Lublin on 1 August, the day the Warsaw Uprising erupted in the Polish capital. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Wladyslaw Gomulka was an important Polish communist politician who led post-war Poland until 1948, and again from 1956 to 1970.

In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: \\"He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all.

Once the site attachment is made they show high site-fidelity, visiting the same wintering sites year after year. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What do young birds form attachments to?","output":"Young birds form attachments to potential breeding sites and favorite wintering sites during their initial dispersal. This process is essential for the survival and continuation of bird species, which rely on return visits to these areas to breed, feed, and endure harsh seasons. The attachment formed by young birds can be a result of several factors, including the availability of food and resources, suitable habitat, safety from predators, and climatic conditions that favor their growth and development. During the initial dispersal phase, young birds explore new territories and environments, assessing the factors that make a site suitable for breeding or wintering. In many bird species, this first dispersal occurs when the young are still dependent on their parents for food and protection. As they grow and become more independent, they start to develop an attachment to the specific sites where they find favorable conditions for survival. Site fidelity, or the tendency to return to specific sites, is a crucial aspect of these attachments. High site fidelity ensures that birds make the most of the resources and facilities available at their chosen breeding and wintering sites. They learn to navigate and adapt to these environments, benefiting from their familiarity with the surroundings when hunting for food or avoiding predators. This behavior also promotes the breeding success of bird populations, as individuals that return to the same sites are more likely to find a mate and reproduce. Additionally, the attachment formed by young birds to their preferred sites carries an evolutionary advantage, as it enables the sharing and accumulation of valuable information about these locations. Older, more experienced birds that return to the same sites can pass on essential knowledge to younger generations about food sources, shelter, and other survival strategies. This learning process is critical for the continuation of the species and maintaining a stable bird population. In summary, young birds form attachments to potential breeding sites and favorite wintering sites during their initial dispersal. These attachments are influenced by various factors such as food availability, suitable habitat, safety, and favorable climatic conditions that support their growth and development. High site fidelity is a vital aspect of these attachments, ensuring survival, breeding success, and knowledge transfer among bird populations, thereby promoting the continuation of bird species."},{"instruction":"Sentence: Bhajji come from the Karnataka region, and contain gram flour.

Only one came back to me consistently with problems. From Minnesota to Melbourne, three testers wrote to me that their very first attempt at making Tuscan gnudi (ricotta and spinach balls that, rather than be encased in pasta like for ravioli, are simply dusted in flour) resulted in a pot of simmering water with “dissolved” gnudi. It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi’s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared – O dove’erano andati? “Where did they go?” In the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors — was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use “proper” ricotta? Aha. “Proper” ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind — to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this. In that case, it would have probably been better to make your own, or choose another recipe. When does the author suggest to used the right type of ricotta? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. Any time - it'll have better structure B. not enough information C. Only when needed - the ricotta in the tub is just as good D. There is no right type of ricotta Answer:","output":"A. Any time - it'll have better structure The author suggests that using the right type of ricotta, which in this context is \\"proper\\" ricotta that was only made a day or so earlier and is leftover from the cheese-making process, is crucial for making Tuscan gnudi. This type of ricotta, described as standing on its own in a deli counter and is cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it, is recommended because it has a better structure. The author implies this is important any time a recipe calls for ricotta cheese, not just for making Tuscan gnudi, as the proper ricotta doesn't dissolve like the supermarket tub kind does when cooked. The author warns against using the supermarket tub kind, which is often grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, lacks structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives, leading to disappointing results in cooking.

To ensure the safety of the child, the woman might have decided to take the baby with her. 3. Custody disputes: In some cases, the parents might have been involved in a legal battle over custody rights for their child. The woman could have felt that she had a stronger claim to the child's custody and decided to take matters into her own hands by taking the baby away from the man, intending to fight for custody in court. 4. Lack of emotional support: It could be possible that the woman felt that the man was not providing her or the baby with adequate emotional support to navigate the challenges that come with parenthood. Frustrated, she may have chosen to take the child and leave to seek a better support system elsewhere. 5. Mental health struggles: Mental health struggles, such as postpartum depression or other emotional issues, could have triggered the woman to act upon impulse and make the decision to leave with the baby. In such cases, the woman's decision-making may have been compromised due to her emotional state. 6. Other personal reasons: There might have been other personal reasons that we cannot discern from the given context. These could include discovering hidden secrets about the man, a change in life goals, or a desire to be closer to her family. The woman may have decided that leaving with the child was the best course of action under the circumstances. In conclusion, while we do not have enough information to deduce the exact reason behind the woman's decision to take the baby and leave, the possibilities mentioned above are some plausible explanations based on the context provided."},{"instruction":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

Options: (A) x > y (B) y^2 > x^2 (C) x^3 > y^2 (D) –x < y (E) x < –y Now, let's think a bit. Some random thoughts:","output":"Let's analyze each option: (A) x > y: This cannot be true since x is negative and y is positive. (B) y^2 > x^2: Since x is negative and y is positive, |x| < |y| implies that y is farther from 0 than x. Squaring both sides doesn't change this relationship, so y^2 > x^2 must be true. (C) x^3 > y^2: We cannot guarantee this because x is negative and will remain negative when cubed, while y^2 will always be positive. There are situations where x^3 could be greater (e.g. x = -0.5, y = 1), but it's not guaranteed. (D) –x < y: Since x is negative, -x would be positive (with the same absolute value). We know |x|<|y|, therefore –x should be less than y because y is positive. (E) x < –y: Since y is positive, -y would be negative. Since x is also negative, we cannot guarantee this relationship; it will depend on the specific values of x and y.

Here is another sentence: Our choice of concrete will have a tremendous impact on the building's mechanical performance. Does the term impact mean the same thing in both these sentences?","output":"Yes, the term 'impact' does mean the same thing in both sentences, though it is used in diverse contexts. The term 'impact' is derived from the Latin word 'impactus', which means 'to press closely, fix in, to bump' but in the modern English language, it has been adapted to various contexts and fields, even in metaphorical senses to imply a 'strong effect.' In both sentences you provided, 'impact' refers to a significant effect or influence that one entity or event has on another. However, the two instances use 'impact' in slightly different scenarios—one in a personal/psychological context and the other in a physical/engineering context. In the first sentence, \\"His friend's opinion had an impact on his decision,\\" the term 'impact' is used to describe a psychological or emotional influence. It suggests that the individual's decision was significantly influenced or affected by his friend's opinion. This influence can be either positive or negative, and may take many forms—his friend's advice might have warned him of potential pitfalls, offered a fresh perspective, reinforced his pre-existing thoughts, or even swayed him to think differently about an issue. In the second sentence, \\"Our choice of concrete will have a tremendous impact on the building's mechanical performance,\\" the term 'impact' is used in a more concrete, physical sense, related to the field of engineering or construction. In this context, 'impact' refers to the significant effect that the choice of concrete will have on how well the building performs mechanically. Depending on the type of concrete chosen, it may enhance the building's durability, load-bearing strength, resistance against weather, and other important factors related to the mechanical performance. In both cases, 'impact' signifies a strong effect or influence—in the first it refers to personal decision-making influenced by a friend’s opinion, and in the second it points to the building's performance affected by the choice of a certain type of concrete. But the overall idea of a strong effect remains consistent in both instances."},{"instruction":"A cat is a carnivore which means they don't do what?

In this list of options, the one that aligns with cats being carnivores is \\"eat vegetables.\\" Cats may consume vegetation occasionally, but their main diet consists of meat and animal-based protein sources.

PUBLISHED:. 06:53 EST, 20 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 20:58 EST, 20 June 2013. The geiger counter wristwatch worn by Sean Connery in the James Bond film Thunderball is to go under the hammer after it was bought for £25 at a car boot sale. The whereabouts of the Breitling Top Time watch had been a mystery for years until it turned up at the sale. The. prop - one of the many gadgets used by 007 during his 50 years. on-screen - helped Bond locate stolen atomic weapons during underwater scenes in the 1965 film. Scroll down for video. James Bond's Breitling Top Time watch, seen in Thunderball, was bought for £25 at a car boot sale following years of mystery as to its whereabouts. Now the watch is to be sold by. Christie's in London with an estimated price of up to £60,000. The. Top Time model by the Swiss firm was the first watch that audiences saw being adapted by Q's team of boffins in the series. It was one of a. number of items given to Bond by Q - played by Desmond Llewelyn - when. he headed over to Nassau in the Bahamas to give him extra equipment. One of the hands of. the watch shows the strength of radioactivity, to help him track down two Nato atomic bombs stolen by SPECTRE. The. basic watch was originally made by Breitling in 1962, then adapted by. the James Bond art department. It was the only one produced for the. movie. It is thought that the watch was passed on by someone who worked at Pinewood Studios, where most of the film was made. The watch helped Sean Connery's Bond to track down two Nato bombs stolen by SPECTRE in 1965's Thunderball. Christie's, which will sell the watch in a Pop Culture sale on June 26, had little further detail. about the bargain hunter who found the watch, or where it was found. A spokesman said: 'This is a great opportunity for collectors to acquire a unique piece of James Bond memorabilia.' Bond's watches became an essential part of his armoury - as well as money-spinning merchandise for the franchise. Thunderball was the only time a Breitling made an appearance in the films, while Hamilton and TAG Haeur made one-off appearances in Live and Let Die and The Living Daylights respectively. But the classic Bond watch was decided in Ian Fleming's novels - the Rolex. In 1962's Dr No, producer Cubby Broccoli had to lend Sean Connery his own Rolex as the company would not loan one for the production. Pierce Brosnan's Bond, left, adopted the Omega Seamaster in the 1990s while the classic Rolex Submariner helped Roger Moore dodge death and unzip dresses in Live and Let Die. The Rolex Submariner became synonymous with Bond, appearing on his wrist in Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun, returning for one final outing in 1989's Licence to Kill. Bond's watches were far more than accessories, with the timepieces adapted into gadgets by Q-Branch. In Live and Let Die, Roger Moore used his Rolex to unzip the dress of agent Miss Caruso with the line: 'Sheer magnetism, darling', while it also doubled as a buzz-saw to help his escape death-by-sharks. The Breitling in Thunderball helped him track down atomic bombs, while the production team opted for Seiko digital watches in the 1970s and 80s. In The Spy Who Loved Me, Bond received ticker tape messages out of his watch, while in Moonraker his Seiko had built-in explosives and a detonator. Other Seikos included GPS tracking devices and a TV screen for 007 to take video calls. Bond's timepiece became a sleek Omega Seamaster in the 1990s, thought to be more modern than the Rolex. It first appeared in GoldenEye on Pierce Brosnan's wrist and is still worn by Daniel Craig, who became an ambassador for the brand. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. A Geiger counter wristwatch worn by Sean Connery as James Bond in the film Thunderball was purchased for £25 at a car boot sale after its whereabouts were unknown for years. 2. The Breitling Top Time watch was a significant prop in the 1965 film, helping Bond locate stolen atomic weapons during underwater scenes. 3.

Lake forest had trees that were in a symbiotic relationship with a large variety of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi were less prevalent in Brook forest. Which forest had fewer AM fungi which reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae? Hint: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. Answer:","output":"Brook forest had fewer AM fungi which reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that wherever possible I use organic bodycare products, and that I simply adore the organic brand Botanicals. A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

The first quarter was dominated by the Vikings, as they reached the redzone three times and intercepted Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III. However, the Redskins defense was able to stiffen in the redzone, holding the Vikings to three Blair Walsh field goals of 20, 27, and 27 yards, to give the Vikings a 9-0 advantage after one quarter. In the second, Washington finally was able to sustain a drive. The Redskins drive stalled at the Vikings' 33-yard line, however, and new Redskins kicker Kai Forbath got his first NFL opportunity, having replaced Billy Cundiff, who was cut earlier in the week, and delivered a 50-yard boot to trim the deficit to 9-3. After a Vikings three-and-out, Washington was able to run an 11-play drive that gave it its first advantage of the game, as Alfred Morris scored on a 1-yard run and gave Washington a 10-9 lead. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder was sacked, fumbled, and the fumble was subsequently recovered by Lorenzo Alexander of Washington, setting the Redskins up at the Vikings 6. Robert Griffin III then found fullback Darrel Young for a 6-yard touchdown pass, extending the Redskins advantage to 17-9. In the third, Washington continued imposing its will, as they drove down the field again, this time culminating in a Robert Griffin III touchdown run, his fifth rushing touchdown of the year, setting a Washington Redskins record for rushing touchdowns by a Redskins QB and extending the Washington advantage to 24-9. The Vikings would not back down, though, and Blair Walsh connected again, this time from 37 yards, his fourth field goal on the day, to cut into the lead, and make it 24-12. In the fourth, the Vikings possessed the ball, but Ponder threw an interception straight into the waiting arms of Redskins free safety Madieu Williams, who returned it 24 yards to put the game nearly on ice, at 31-12 Washington. The Vikings, however, proved resilient. On their ensuing drive, the Vikings found the endzone for the first time on the day, with Ponder finding wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a 9-yard score. Ponder subsequently found Kyle Rudolph on a successful two-point conversion attempt, and the Redskins lead was cut to 31-20. After Washington could not extend its advantage, Minnesota got the ball back. Once again, Minnesota scored, this time Ponder found Rudolph to cut the lead to 31-26. This time, however, the two-point conversion came up short, meaning Minnesota would again need to score a touchdown to complete its rally. However, Washington's rookie QB would see to it that no comeback would be complete on his team on this day, as Griffin, on 3rd-and-6 from his own 24, found a seam on a designed quarterback draw, and raced down the sideline for a 76-yard touchdown run, the longest such rush TD by a QB since Kordell Stewart scrambled for an 80-yard score against the Carolina Panthers in the 1996 season. With the score now 38-26 Redskins, the Vikings tried to rally again, and were able to reach the Redskins' goal line. However, with less than a half minute remaining, DeAngelo Hall intercepted Christian Ponder, to officially preserve the 38-26 win. With the win, Washington improved to 3-3, snapped an 8-game home losing streak, and will have an opportunity to take first place in the NFC East with a victory over the defending Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants next week.

Options: (A) 60 miles (B) 80 miles (C) 90 miles (D) 120 miles (E) 400 miles","output":"First, we need to determine the time each train has been traveling. It's currently 5 o'clock, and they started at 2 o'clock, so they have traveled for 3 hours. Now, we determine the distance traveled by each train during these 3 hours. The faster train travels at 130 miles per hour, so: 130 mph * 3 hours = 390 miles The slower train travels at 100 miles per hour, so: 100 mph * 3 hours = 300 miles At the beginning, the faster train was 30 miles behind the slower train. We now find the new distance between the two trains by first adding the initial distance behind and then subtracting the distance traveled by the slower train from the distance traveled by the faster train: 30 miles (initial distance behind) + 390 miles (faster train) - 300 miles (slower train) = 120 miles.

The text is about 'RFA Surf Pioneer (A365)', a Surf-class freighting tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. The task's goal is to provide an incorrect answer to the question asked about the topic of the document in the form of a category from the list provided. The list contains 14 categories: 1)Company, 2)Educational Institution, 3)Artist, 4)Athlete, 5)Office holder, 6)Mean of transportation, 7)Building, 8)Natural place, 9)Village, 10)Animal, 11)Plant, 12)Album, 13)Film, 14)Written work. The choice of the incorrect answer should align with one of these categories. The question is: \\"What is the classified topic name\\"? The correct answer would likely fall into category no. 6 (Mean of transportation) since 'RFA Surf Pioneer (A365)' is a freighting tanker (a form of transportation). Solution: As per the task's requirement, the correct classification is not to be given. That means we need to provide an incorrect classification that still fits into one of the listed categories. Let's choose 'Artist'. Hence, the incorrect answer could be: \\"Incorrect Answer: Artist\\". With this answer, we followed the guidelines to provide an incorrect answer falling in one of the listed categories. It is incorrect because 'RFA Surf Pioneer (A365)' is not an artist."},{"instruction":"Question: The seats were designed to accommodate cumbersome clothing, where were they seats located? Choices: - bowling alley - space shuttle - auditorium - rest area - beach The rationale to choose \\"space shuttle\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"space shuttle. The rationale to choose \\"space shuttle\\" as the answer is that: 1. Relevance to the context: Taking into account the given choices and the fact that the seats were designed to accommodate cumbersome clothing, the space shuttle is the most appropriate context where such a design feature would be necessary. 2. Special clothing requirements: In a space shuttle, astronauts need to wear bulky space suits that provide them protection from the unforgiving environment of outer space. These suits have life support systems, essential for survival, and multiple layers for thermal and radiation protection. As a result, the suits are large and cumbersome. 3. Confinement within the shuttle: Space shuttles are compact in design, considering the limitations imposed by the technical and logistical challenges of spaceflight. To maximize crew comfort and functionality, seats need to be specifically designed to accommodate the bulkiness of the space suits worn by astronauts. 4. Safety and mission requirements: The design of the seats in a space shuttle needs to offer extensive safety measures due to the conditions astronauts face during their travel – such as high acceleration, weightlessness, and the dynamic forces encountered during re-entry to Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, having seats that can securely support astronauts wearing their bulky space suits is integral to the success of a space mission and the safety of its crew members. 5. Comparing and eliminating other choices: a. Bowling alley: Although bowling shoes might be a bit uncomfortable for some people, the clothing requirements for bowling are not cumbersome, thus rendering the need for specialized seating unnecessary. b. Auditorium: While people might wear formal clothing to certain events held at an auditorium, these clothes are not particularly bulky or unwieldy, so there is no need for specially designed seats in this case. c. Rest area: Casual and relaxed clothing is typically worn at rest areas, and there would be no vital reason for seats to be adapted to suit this type of attire. d. Beach: Beachwear is typically light, minimal, and comfortable, so there is no essential need for beach seating to accommodate bulky clothing. In conclusion, given the specific requirement of accommodating cumbersome clothing and considering the listed choices, the correct answer is \\"space shuttle.\\" This is due to the pertinent need for astronauts to wear bulky, protective space suits, as well as the safety and mission requirements during space travel. The other options do not present any compelling necessity for specialized seating designed for bulky attire."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a paragraph, and your job is to generate comma-separated entities present in the given paragraph.

Since the suicide of her husband Jonathon, who worked as a novelist, she is suffering from sleep disorder. A few days later, she talks to Dr Cooper, whose student she was, about the sleepwalking and a recurring nightmare, in which she is attacked by an unknown man. Cooper sends her to a therapy in a sleep laboratory. During a walk on a cemetery, Sarah talks about it with her room mate Dawn, who shows a personal interest in her professor Owen. Then an attractive man gets out of a black car and Sarah imagines him being a single. At the evening in the sleep laboratory, Dr. Koslov explains to her that her neuronal activity will be observed during the night. He also introduces her to Dr. Scott White, the director of the lab. It is the man whom Sarah has seen at the cemetery. He tells her, that a student was buried and he was there with a colleague. Sarah confides to him that she loved her husband, but not his work as a novelist. The next morning she wakes up in a different room after a silent, dreamless night. White takes her case. He reports about irregularities in the theta waves and asks her to spend some more nights in the lab. Sarah recognizes that something is wrong. In the lecture hall she questions the statement of her teacher, who thinks that love stories are just a dopamine kick or a bipolar disorder. But she is even more irritated when he addresses her as Miss Wells and a student repeats this name. Also Dawn, her driver's license, her diary and a dedication in her husband's book affirm this surname. Sarah is rejected by Cooper's assistant.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"You can sleep in a bed.\\" - Sentence B: \\"You can sleep in a bedpan.\\" Hmmm, let me think. I want to lay out the solution in details.","output":"The sentence that is not logical is: - Sentence B: \\"You can sleep in a bedpan.\\" Here is the detailed explanation: - Sentence A: \\"You can sleep in a bed.\\" - This sentence is logical because a bed is designed for sleeping, providing a comfortable surface and support for resting. Throughout history, beds have been created for the purpose of sleep, and they come in various sizes and designs to suit the needs of different individuals. - Sentence B: \\"You can sleep in a bedpan.\\" - This sentence is not logical because a bedpan is primarily designed for use in healthcare settings as a shallow, flat-bottomed container for patients who are unable to get out of bed to use the restroom. Bedpans are typically made of metal, glass, or plastic materials and are designed to collect human waste, such as urine or feces. They are not created for, nor intended to provide, a comfortable or supportive surface for sleeping. Therefore, it is illogical to suggest that one can sleep in a bedpan. Based on this information, it is clear that Sentence B is not logical, while Sentence A is logical."},{"instruction":"You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews.

He is best remembered for his four classic horror films: Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Whale also directed films in other genres, including what is considered the definitive film version of the musical Show Boat (1936). He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, but many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity. Context: After the armistice he returned to Birmingham and tried to find work as a cartoonist. He sold two cartoons to the Bystander in 1919 but was unable to secure a permanent position. Later that year he embarked on a professional stage career. Under the tutelage of actor-manager Nigel Playfair, he worked as an actor, set designer and builder, \\"stage director\\" (akin to a stage manager) and director. In 1922, while with Playfair, he met Doris Zinkeisen. They were considered a couple for some two years, despite Whale's living as an openly gay man. They were reportedly engaged in 1924, but by 1925 the engagement was off. In 1928 Whale was offered the opportunity to direct two private performances of R.C. Sherriff's then-unknown play Journey's End for the Incorporated Stage Society, a theatre society that mounted private Sunday performances of plays. Set over a four-day period in March 1918 in the trenches at Saint-Quentin, France, Journey's End gives a glimpse into the experiences of the officers of a British infantry company in World War I. The key conflict is between Capt. Stanhope, the company commander, and Lt. Raleigh, the brother of Stanhope's fiancee. Whale offered the part of Stanhope to the then barely known Laurence Olivier. Olivier initially declined the role, but after meeting the playwright agreed to take it on. Maurice Evans was cast as Raleigh. The play was well received and transferred to the Savoy Theatre in London's West End, opening on 21 January 1929. A young Colin Clive was now in the lead role, Olivier having accepted an offer to take the lead in a production of Beau Geste. The play was a tremendous success, with critics uniform and effusive in their praise and with audiences sometimes sitting in stunned silence following its conclusion only to burst into thunderous ovations. As Whale biographer James Curtis wrote, the play \\"managed to coalesce, at the right time and in the right manner, the impressions of a whole generation of men who were in the war and who had found it impossible, through words or deeds, to adequately express to their friends and families what the trenches had been like\\". After three weeks at the Savoy, Journey's End transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for the next two years. With the success of Journey's End at home, Broadway producer Gilbert Miller acquired the rights to mount a New York production with an all-British cast headed by Colin Keith-Johnston as Stanhope and Derek Williams as Raleigh. Whale also directed this version, which premiered at Henry Miller's Theatre on 22 March 1929. The play ran for over a year and cemented its reputation as the greatest play about World War I. Question: did he have any other plays that were worth naming. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, James Whale did have other plays that were worth naming. Apart from the monumental success of Journey's End, he also worked on a number of other notable plays during his career as theater director before transitioning to film direction. Not all of these productions achieved the same level of fame and success as Journey's End, but they were significant milestones in Whale's career and helped shape his later accomplishments as a film director. Some of these notable plays include: 1. \\"Pots o' Money\\" (1925): Whale directed this British farce by Arthur Macrae, which helped him gain more experience and recognition in the field of theater direction. 2. \\"The Marquise\\" (1927-1928): A comedy by Noël Coward, Whale directed this play before he was assigned to Journey's End. It was a significant moment in his career, as working with a notable playwright like Coward added to his reputation and expanded his network in the theater industry. 3. \\"The Insect Play\\" (1929): After the success of Journey's End, Whale directed this satirical play written by Josef and Karel Čapek. It was an allegorical work that focused on the human condition, which undoubtedly influenced Whale's later works, especially his horror films. 4. \\"Waterloo Bridge\\" (1930): Written by Robert E. Sherwood, this play featured a doomed romance set during World War I. Whale's direction of the piece demonstrated his ability to handle dramas with emotional depth. 5. \\"The Signal Tower\\" (1930): Another play directed by Whale, this melodrama written by Paul Dickey and Mann Page showcased Whale's inclination towards suspenseful stories, which foreshadowed his eventual move to horror films. Whale's theater career not only provided him with the experience of directing different genres but also shaped his artistic vision and skills. His experience as a theater director, particularly with these notable plays, equipped him with the expertise required to excel in the film industry. As a result, he was able to create iconic horror movies, as well as films in other genres, leaving an indelible mark on the world of cinema."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

After obtaining a geiger counter and weapons from the armory, Caesar travels with MacDonald and orangutan Virgil (Paul Williams) to the Forbidden City and sneaks in to find the archives. However, there are mutants (radiation-scarred humans) still living there under the command of Governor Kolp (Severn Darden). Caesar and his party view the recordings of Cornelius and Zira and learn about the future of the world, but barely have time to study the tapes before they have to escape being captured. Caesar assembles a meeting to report his discoveries at the Forbidden City. Aldo objects when some humans show up and he leads the gorillas away. A team of scouts sent by Governor Kolp return and tell him about the Ape City. Kolp considers this covert trip by Caesar an act of espionage. His assistant MÃ©ndez (Paul Stevens) believes they did nothing wrong and should be left alone, but Governor Kolp stubbornly declares war on Ape City, mustering the mutant humans to destroy the ape society. Aldo is furious that Caesar wants to co-exist peacefully with humans and plots a coup d'Ã©tat in order to become the Ape leader himself. Cornelius overhears...

They persuade a reluctant Allan Quartermain (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) to give them a lift to the coast in his wagon. Along the way, they encounter another wagon carrying two men in bad shape. Umbopa (Paul Robeson) recovers, but Silvestra (Arthur Goullet) dies after boasting to Quartermain that he has found the way to the fabled mines of Solomon. Patsy finds the dead man's map. He sneaks off during the night, unwilling to risk his daughter's life. Kathy is unable to persuade Quatermain to follow him. Instead, they rendezvous with Quartermain's new clients, Sir Henry Curtis (John Loder) and retired navy Commander Good (Roland Young), out for a bit of big game hunting. Kathy steals Quartermain's wagon to go after her father. When they catch up with her, she refuses to go back with them, so they and Umbopa accompany her across the desert and over the mountains, as shown on the map.

The Steelers forced a punt on the Ravens' first drive before the Steelers offense produced a 16-play, 84-yard drive which took up 10 minutes and 23 seconds of game time and led to a 30-yard Chris Boswell field goal, making the score 3-0. This would remain the score until Boswell added a 49-yard field goal in the second quarter, making the score 6-0. The Steelers finally reached the end zone on their next drive, as Le'Veon Bell scored from the 1-yard line to put the Steelers up 13-0. The Steelers scored again on their final offensive drive of the half as Ben Roethlisberger connected with JuJu Smith-Schuster for an 11-yard touchdown pass (and the Steelers failed their 2-point conversion attempt), putting the Steelers up 19-0 going into halftime. The Ravens' Justin Tucker missed a 62-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter. The Steelers received the ball to begin the second half, and Roethlisberger was intercepted by Eric Weddle, who was credited with the turnover after a coach's challenge by John Harbaugh. The play had initially been ruled a catch by Antonio Brown, but after review, the officials determined that Brown had never established possession of the ball, and because it had never touched the ground, the Ravens took over on the Steelers' 18-yard line. Baltimore capitalized by adding a Tucker 42-yard field goal, making the score 19-3 in favor of the Steelers. On the Steelers' next drive, Boswell missed a 44-yard field goal, and after taking over on downs, the Ravens took only three plays to score on a 16-yard touchdown from Joe Flacco to Mike Wallace. The Ravens attempted a 2-point conversion, but Terrance West (though initially ruled as successfully scoring) was stopped at the 1-yard line by the Steelers defense, making the score 19-9. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers defense intercepted Flacco twice, with the second interception leading to another 1-yard touchdown run by Bell, making the final score 26-9. The Steelers moved into sole possession of first place in the AFC North with the victory while the team improved to 3-1. The team would win their 6th straight game against a divisional opponent. The victory marked the first time that the Steelers defeated the Ravens in Baltimore since 2012. It would also be Roethlisberger's first win in Baltimore since 2010. Pittsburgh also scored the most points in Baltimore of any Steelers team since 2002.

Nelson remained reserved while Nick cried at the funeral because","output":"he felt the need to stay strong for his brother, even though he was struggling with his own grief. As the ceremony neared its end, Nelson couldn't help but reminisce about their lives with their late father, the numerous memories flooding his mind. Step 1: Show Nelson's strong exterior during the funeral Justification: By keeping control over his emotions, Nelson is able to support his brother during this difficult time. Step 2: Reveal Nelson's internal emotions Justification: By showing Nelson's internal struggle with grief, it adds depth to his character, making him more relatable and human. As the last few words were spoken, Nelson gently placed a reassuring hand on Nick's shoulder and led him towards the reception, where they would share memories with friends, family, and loved ones. Nelson understood that his brother was sensitive, and he wanted to provide comfort to Nick during this devastating time. Step 3: Strengthen brotherly bond Justification: By portraying Nelson as a caring brother, we can emphasize the importance of family support in times of crisis. At the reception, they were approached by their father's friends and colleagues, each expressing their condolences and sharing stories about their father. Nelson was grateful for the kind words, but every conversation seemed to weigh heavily on his heart, making it harder and harder to maintain his stoic composure. Step 4: Demonstrate the pressure Nelson experiences Justification: To highlight Nelson's challenge in staying strong for his brother, we can show how the weight of their father's loss affects him throughout the reception. As the crowd began to thin and the evening progressed, Nelson guided Nick to a quiet corner, allowing them both a moment of respite. He knew, though, that they wouldn't be able to keep their grief at bay forever. \\"You know, dad always admired your strength,\\" Nick said softly, wiping his tears away. \\"He'd be so proud of how you've held everything together today.\\" Step 5: Give Nick an opportunity to acknowledge and appreciate Nelson's resilience Justification: Including a heartfelt moment between the brothers adds emotional depth to the story and shows that both of them understand the importance of their bond. Nelson, unable to hold back his own tears any longer, embraced Nick tightly. The floodgates of pent-up emotions finally released. Together, the two brothers cried, as they mourned the loss of their father, feeling the void he had left in their lives. Step 6: Allow Nelson to finally let his guard down and show his vulnerability Justification: This moment creates a sense of closure, as Nelson will now be able to properly grieve and heal with his brother's support. As the brothers held onto each other, they realized that although their father was no longer with them, they still had each other to rely on. They understood that the road ahead would be difficult, but they were determined to navigate it together, just as their father would have wanted. Step 7: Conclude the story by showcasing the brothers' determination to move forward Justification: Ending on a hopeful note highlights the importance of family, love, and support in times of sorrow, and sets the stage for future growth and resilience."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The Browns and Chiefs traded field goals in the first quarter, and then Josh Cribbs returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown, setting an NFL record with his 7th kickoff return for a touchdown. After another Phil Dawson field goal in the second, the Chiefs scored three straight touchdowns to take a 24-13 lead.

You also need to be on time, which really means arriving early. You can be better prepared, relaxed, organized and ready to state your case when you are not rushing around. If one of the parties doesn't show up, the other party may win by default. Ensure that you get your fair chance by being present at the hearing. If you cannot attend court on the day of your hearing, you can file for a postponement (or continuance). You need to file this claim no fewer than 10 days before the hearing, pay a fee, and have sufficient reason for requesting the extension. If English is not your first language and you think you might encounter difficulty presenting your case, you can bring an interpreter with you. This person should be someone who is a friend or relative but not someone who is directly involved in the case. This is not a witness and is only there to help you communicate to the judge about your case. If you don't have someone you can bring, you can ask the court clerk to give you a referral to interpreters. These individuals typically charge a fee for their work. If you cannot afford to pay an interpreter, you can ask the court clerk to provide you with an interpreter for free. Treat this hearing as you would an important job interview (or even a funeral), and wear conservative business attire. Wearing a suit is not necessary but it reflects well on you if you appear to take the proceedings seriously. Be respectful of the judge, and don't argue with the judge. First impressions are important, and presenting yourself as a respectful and dignified person can go along way to helping you win your case. This is especially true if your opponent is disorganized, appears sloppy, or behaves rudely. Remain calm and collected throughout the proceeding. Bring copies of each document you've filed, along with every piece of evidence you plan to produce. Keep everything organized so you can find what you need quickly when you need it without delaying proceedings while you shuffle through papers. If the defendant says something that is untrue or that you don't agree with, don't automatically shout out in your own defense. You will be given the opportunity for rebuttal. Just make a note of what was said and address the untrue statement when it is your turn. Waiting for your turn will make you appear more professional and respectful, and the judge will appreciate it. Never speak to the opposing party. Direct all of your statements to the judge. Present your case in a calm, thorough, and straight-forward manner. Be sure to tell your side of the story with facts and back up your statements with the evidence you have gathered. Provide lots of details and be ready to present your evidence when asked. Avoid overblown or exaggerated statements or extensive appeals to emotion. The judge will make a decision based on the facts and legalities of the case, not emotion. Include statements by your witnesses (either written or in-person) to further support your case. Let the court know if you have witnesses at the very beginning of the proceeding. Come prepared with the story of what happened, and tell it in a clear and relatable way. You'll be more likely to win if you present yourself and your situation as understandable. You want to bring the evidence to prove that you're in the right, and bring the demeanor and attitude so that the judge is willing to empathize with you. Be prepared to tell the judge the exact events that led to your loss. Speak about each specific piece of evidence for your case and attach specific dollar amounts. Avoid making a vague argument or just insisting that you have been wronged. The other person will tell their side of the story, and chances are, they are arguing just as hard as you are, particularly if a decent amount of money or someone's reputation is involved. If you listen and take notes while they are speaking, you will begin to identify holes in their story or missteps that will further strengthen your own case. After the person has finished speaking, you will be given a chance to speak again and address their claims. After the judge has heard both sides of the story, he or she will make a ruling on your case. Listen to the ruling and do not interrupt or show any signs of objection or approval during or after the judge's ruling. Just listen and respect the judge's ruling. Summary:","output":"To prepare for a court hearing, you should be organized, arrive early, and dress nicely. Bring all your important documents and evidence with you, and stay calm and respectful during the hearing. It's important to listen carefully to the other side and take notes, but don't argue with them or the judge. Instead, focus on telling your side of the story clearly and with details, and provide any witnesses or evidence that supports your case. Remember to be respectful and patient, and always speak to the judge instead of the other party. Once the judge makes a decision, listen carefully and don't show any strong reactions."},{"instruction":"Q:July is a month of fun-filled activities for kids and teens as long as you know where to find them.

In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things. Some of these mentions refer to the same person, place, or thing. Your job is to write questions that evaluate one's understanding of such references. Good questions are expected to link pronouns (she, her, him, his, their, etc.) or other mentions to people, places, or things to which they may refer. Do not ask questions that can be answered correctly without understanding the paragraph or having multiple answers. Avoid questions that do not link phrases referring to the same entity. For each of your questions, the answer should be one or more phrases in the paragraph, and it should be unambiguous. Passage: The Romney Literary Society, which built Literary Hall between 1869 and 1870, was organized by nine prominent men in Romney on January 30, 1819. With its establishment in 1819, the Romney Literary Society became the first literary organization of its kind in the present-day state of West Virginia, and one of the first in the United States. On February 4, 1819, the constitution of the society was adopted, which provided that the organization should be known as the \\"Polemic Society of Romney\\". The society founded its library in 1819 with the acquisition of two books, and by 1861 the society's humble library had grown to contain approximately 3,000 volumes, consisting of books on literature, science, history and art. The Romney Literary Society commenced a movement to establish an institution for \\"the higher education of the youth of the community\\". As a result of this initiative, the teaching of the classics was introduced into the curriculum of Romney Academy in 1820, thus making the institution the first school of higher education in the Eastern Panhandle. In 1846, the society constructed a new building to house the Romney Classical Institute and its library, both of which fell under the society's supervision.The Romney Literary Society and the Romney Classical Institute both flourished and continued to grow in importance and influence until the onset of the Civil War in 1861. During the war, many members fought for the Confederate States Army forces and were killed during the conflict. The contents of the society's library were plundered by Union Army forces, and many of its 3,000 volumes were either scattered or destroyed. Following the war's end, only 400 of those volumes could be recovered, with just 200 remaining on the library's shelves.The Romney Literary Society reorganized on May 15, 1869. Following the reorganization, the society built Literary Hall between 1869 and 1870 while also undertaking an initiative to bring the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind to its old Romney Classical Institute campus. The construction of Literary Hall was part of the society's effort to revive the organization and reassemble its original library. The society set about recovering original volumes and purchasing new ones, and the library reopened with 700 volumes. For a period of ten years between 1870 and 1880, much of Romney's intellectual life centered on Literary Hall. As older members died, interest in the society began to dwindle. The society's meetings were held less frequently, and its last recorded meeting was held on February 15, 1886. Output:","output":"1.

He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference. Trump also received more good news this week when his choice for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, finally won Senate confirmation. There were, however, some significant setbacks as well, including the withdrawal of Ronny Jackson as the next head of the Department of Veterans Affairs and intense congressional...

Her departure devastated Ray Davies, and it inspired him to write the song \\"Rosy Won't You Please Come Home\\", included on the 1966 album Face to Face. The lead character in the album, the fictional Arthur Morgan—modelled after Anning—is a carpet layer whose family's plight in the opportunity-poor setting of post-war England is depicted. Writer Julian Mitchell detailed the story line and characters in depth, explaining in the liner notes for the album's LP release: Arthur Morgan ... lives in a London suburb in a house called Shangri-La, with a garden and a car and a wife called Rose and a son called Derek who's married to Liz, and they have these two very nice kids, Terry and Marilyn. Derek and Liz and Terry and Marilyn are emigrating to Australia. Arthur did have another son, called Eddie. He was named after Arthur's brother, who was killed in the battle of the Somme. Arthur's Eddie was killed, too—in Korea. Davies would later comment in his autobiography, X-Ray, that Anning later \\"told me that he ... knew it [Arthur] had been partly inspired by him ... [it] reminded him of home ... I told Arthur that I felt guilty for using him as a subject for a song, but he shrugged off my apology, saying that he was flattered.\\" With an underlying theme of nostalgia, the songs describe the England that Arthur once knew (\\"Victoria\\", \\"Young and Innocent Days\\"), the promise of life in Australia for one of his sons (\\"Australia\\"), the emptiness of his superficially comfortable life in his home (\\"Shangri-La\\"), the resolve of the British people during the Second World War (\\"Mr. Churchill Says\\"), the privations that marked the austerity period after the war (\\"She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina\\"), and the death of his brother in World War I (\\"Yes Sir, No Sir\\", \\"Some Mother's Son\\"). contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose departure inspired the song, \\"Rosy Won't You Please Come Back?, what is it ?

Question: What gear ratio would be used in parts of the world using 60 Hz?

This motor ran at 3600 rpm, such that a 46:1 gear ratio would produce 78.26 rpm. In parts of the world that used 50 Hz current, the standard was 77.92 rpm (3,000 rpm with a 77:2 ratio), which was also the speed at which a strobe disc with 77 lines would \\"stand still\\" in 50 Hz light (92 lines for 60 Hz).

Title: Tobruk Movie plot: In September 1942, Rommel's Africa Korps is only 90 miles (144Â km) from the Suez Canal, but running dangerously low on fuel. The British approve a plan to destroy German fuel bunkers at Tobruk in an attempt to cripple Rommel's attack. The author of the plan, Canadian born Major Donald Craig (Rock Hudson) had been captured by Vichy French forces. As his expertise is considered essential to the success of the raid, Craig is rescued by Captain Kurt Bergman (George Peppard) of the Special Identification Group (SIG) and some of his men, German Jews serving with the British. They then join up with commandos of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG), under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Harker (Nigel Green), at Kufra in south-eastern Libya. Colonel Harker explains they have eight days to get to Tobruk and destroy the fuel depot and German field guns protecting the harbour, before a scheduled amphibious landing and a bombing raid on the city by the RAF. They are to drive there through enemy territory posing as POWs escorted by the SIG pretending to be guards. Once they reach Tobruk they would then link up with a full Naval and RAF assault on the city and their primary objective, Rommel's underground fuel bunkers. Craig is highly skeptical of the operation, claiming that \\"Staff has a genius for sitting on its brains and coming up with perfect hindsight\\", stating that when he originally submitted the plan they could have blown up the fuel bunkers with only a handful of men before questioning how they were supposed to get through well established German defences now. While warning Craig not to let personal differences of opinion interfere with the operation, Colonel Harker also reveals that he was the genius with perfect hindsight who convinced Staff to approve Craig's original plan which would now be \\"maximum effort, land, sea and air\\".

Some of these species are cryptoendoliths as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanized cells make them resistant to UV light. Those features can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as Cryomyces minteri. Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.

Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. A:","output":"Based on the provided information, the researcher who learned more about bromine gases would be Dan, who studied Antarctica. This is evident from the hint given that explains the detrimental effects of air pollution on the ozone layer, with the major culprits being chlorine and bromine gases. As these harmful gases are predominantly responsible for the ozone hole formation over Antarctica, it stands to reason that Dan's research in this region would naturally have led to a deeper understanding of bromine gases and their role in ozone destruction. The presence of the ozone hole over Antarctica means that this region is experiencing the most significant loss of good ozone, which is primarily being destroyed by chlorine and bromine gases. These gases are released through the use of aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products that emit such pollutants. Consequently, while studying the Antarctic air quality, Dan would have inevitably focused on the critical factors leading to ozone depletion in the area and, therefore, would have delved into the topic of bromine gas emissions and their contribution to environmental degradation. The devastating effects of ozone loss include an increase in skin cancers and eye cataracts in humans, as well as disturbances in the nitrogen cycle and the death of plankton that disrupt ocean food webs. Though the rate of ozone loss has slowed due to stricter regulations on the emission of pollutants, the ozone layer is still at risk. In comparison, Colt, who focused on the North Pole, may not have encountered the same high concentration of bromine gases and their impacts on the ozone layer as Dan did while researching Antarctica. While studying the air quality over the North Pole, Colt may have come across other environmental and air quality factors prevalent in that region, but his research might not have exposed him to the same extent of bromine gas-related information as Dan. In conclusion, Dan, who studied air quality over Antarctica, would have learned more about bromine gases due to the prevalent ozone hole and the significant role that these gases play in the destruction of the ozone layer in that region."},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve -5*p + 11*p = -3*p + 72 for p.

The police also accused Smith of physical assault and using offensive language. Race relations had been growing more tense over the year as Newark Mayor Hugh Addonizio announced a series of decisions that had angered the African-American community. Some of the residents who were living across the street from where the arrest took place walked out of their homes to watch the incident. Smith was badly beaten. As the police hauled him to the Fourth Precinct station, word spread within the community about what was happening. African-American taxi drivers sent out reports through their radios. A crowd slowly gathered to monitor and protest Smith's treatment. Word quickly spread about the arrest and what was taking place inside the station.Julian Zelizer: On July 12, 1967, riots erupted in Newark, New Jersey, after an African-American man was pulled over and beaten by two white policemenThe fiftieth anniversary of the riots is a reminder that we still face some of the same issues of racism in policing and criminal justice, writes Zelizer Question:There have been reforms to policing, public attitudes about race have changed, and the growth of _-American representation has changed the political dynamics surrounding these issues.

This tab should be raised at a 20º angle above the base of the fixture. If it is not, turn off the power and use needle nosed-pliers to pull this tab gently to the correct position. When inserting a light bulb, you should line up the threads on the socket, then turn slowly clockwise. As soon as you feel a slight resistance, stop. If you turn the light on and it flickers, turn it off again and turn only another quarter-turn clockwise. Warning: Always make sure the lamp is unplugged or the switch is in the off position before changing a light bulb. Only do this when you are absolutely sure the power to the fixture has been turned off. Remove the light bulb from the socket if there is one present. Wearing gloves made from rubber or other non-conductive material, take a clean, dry rag or towel and rub it along the inside threads of the metal socket. You may also wipe the outside threads of the bulb base before insertion. The cloth wipes off rust or other corrosion that has built up on the socket, reducing the chance of both burned out bulbs and a bulb jamming in the socket. Use a Scotchbrite pad or bronze wire brush if the corrosion won't come off onto a cloth. If there is too much corrosion to wipe off with a cloth, you may need to wipe them with a specialized lubricant. Only use an electrical contact cleaner or contact spray for this purpose. There are several commercially available products called \\"bulb and socket lube\\" that can be applied to the socket or the base of a new bulb prior to installation. The product appears similar to Vaseline and greatly reduces the incidence of \\"sticking\\". Using any other substance as a lubricant carries the risk of burning out your bulb, blocking the electrical current, or jamming it in the socket. If your light bulbs only last a few weeks or months, they may be receiving too much power. Too much vibration or heat can also wear out a light bulb quickly. A long-life bulb with a slightly higher voltage than recommended for your fixtures should last longer. In the United States, most home outlets are 120 volts. Use a \\"long life\\" bulb that can handle 130 volts. In the European Union and most other European countries, the standard varies between 220 and 240 volts.

Trigonometry: Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals primarily with the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles, specifically right triangles. It involves the study of ratios of angles to sides, and by extension, the properties and applications of functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent. Studying trigonometry will help John understand triangles and their various properties, measurements, and relationships. 2.

John may take several classes in mathematics during his education, but only a specific branch or topic will address his difficulty with triangles. 3. Algebra: Algebra is another branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of symbols, rules, and operations involving numbers and variables. Although it does involve solving equations, it's more concerned with the manipulation and application of variables and constants than the study of shapes and geometric properties, such as triangles. Based on the analysis of the given possible answers, \\"trigonometry\\" is the most appropriate and accurate choice.

Answer the above question based on the context below: As Greeneville ascended to periscope depth, Waddle checked the sonar displays and the fire control station monitors, but reported later that he heard and saw nothing to suggest that the previously detected vessels in the area were now any closer to the submarine's position than had been reported before the submarine began the high speed maneuvers. Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens. Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room. At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14. Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course. Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface). At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction. Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators. Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J.

Translate this to English?","output":"Madam President, concerning our joint fight against terrorism, as a lawyer specializing in criminal law and human rights, I would like to make a suggestion. The above sentence is translated from Romanian to English. The speaker seems to address a leader (presumably a president), references the mutual endeavor against terrorism, and positions himself or herself as an informed figure in this context, given the stated expertise as a lawyer specialized in criminal law and human rights. They express their intention of proposing a presumably related idea or course of action, which reinforces the importance of specialized knowledge in nuanced contexts like this one, where legal and humanitarian dimensions are deeply interconnected. Moreover, the introduction shows a contrast between the speaker and the addressee; while they share a common goal (fighting against terrorism), their skills and expertise diverge. The fact that the speaker is a lawyer and specializes in criminal law and human rights adds credibility to his or her speech and suggests that their forthcoming proposal will consider the legal aspects and implications connected to human rights protection. Finally, the introductory phrase suggests that the conversation taking place occurs in a formal and probably institutional context, given the reference to \\"Madam President.\\" Such contexts often require specialized knowledge and emphasize the need for well-informed suggestions and decisions. The respect shown in addressing the leader further reinforces this formal atmosphere and gives the dialogue its respectful and serious undertones.

However, it is reasonable to assume that the hypothesis might be true, given the context provided. The premise suggests that the person is carrying a large number of bags with heavy loads. Naturally, when bags are filled with a lot of items, especially heavy ones, there could be some strain on the material of the bags, which may cause them to bulge at the bottom.

Step 1: Remember the main characters of the novel. The protagonist of \\"The Host\\" is Melanie Stryder, a human who is implanted with an alien called Wanderer, also known as Wanda. Both share Melanie's body, and as the story progresses, they develop relationships with other characters. Step 2: Identify the characters involved in Melanie's romantic relationships. Melanie was in love with Jared Howe, a human resistance fighter, before her body was taken over by the alien Wanderer. As Wanda inhabits Melanie's body, she also begins to develop feelings for Jared because of remnants of Melanie's thoughts and feelings. Step 3: Recognize how Melanie's relationships evolve in the book. As Wanda and Melanie form their own bond and alliance against the aliens, Wanda falls in love with another resistance fighter named Ian O'Shea. It becomes clear that Wanda's feelings for Jared are connected to her bond with Melanie, while her feelings for Ian are uniquely her own. Step 4: Derive the conclusion based on the relationships. In the end, Wanda is transferred into another body, freeing Melanie. After that, Melanie continues her journey with Jared as her love interest.

Comedian Bob Mills last night said BBC producers had ‘overstepped the mark’ for asking him on a live radio programme how lesbian presenter Clare Balding could be ‘turned around’. He blamed the production team for specifically giving him the ‘galling question’ in which he responded that women could be ‘cured’ of homosexuality. Dozens of listeners have complained to the Corporation about the comments accusing producers of promoting homophobic bullying. The BBC issued a second apology yesterday admitting it had ‘got it wrong’ before taking down the offending material from its internet iPlayer service. The media regulator Ofcom said it will now assess complaints before investigating whether the programme breached ‘generally accepted standards’. The offensive comments were made during Radio 5Live’s quiz show Fighting Talk, broadcast half an hour before the 9pm watershed on Saturday. Host Colin Murray asked contestants, during a section called ‘Defend the Indefensible’, to argue: ‘Give me 20 minutes with her and I’m pretty sure I could turn around Clare Balding’. Mr Mills then stated that the former jockey and racing presenter was a ‘horse woman’ who ‘appreciates power between her thighs’. He added: ‘And we all know, there is no woman that can’t be cured’. His response was met by loud groans from the large audience that was watching the show at the Liverpool Echo Arena as part of the station’s Big Day Out event. Mr Mills yesterday said he ‘regretted’ the comments and felt under pressure to answer the question in 20 seconds in front of a crowd of thousands.

THE BBC is under fire for refusing to buy a retiring sports commentator a £36 bottle of bubbly because of a ban on the drink. After facing a storm over the amount it was spending on champagne – £100,000 between 2007 and 2011 – the corporation stopped buying it and imposed a ban in 2012. But this week the broadcaster was accused of taking the cutback too far when bosses refused to fund a bottle bought for staff member Brian Arrundale, who had commentated on Hartlepool United matches for BBC Tees for 33 years. ‘I think they have overstepped the mark and maybe this will stop it happening in the future. 'I don’t know why Clare Balding was chosen for the question but she had been on the show and knows the team.’ During a later episode of the same show broadcast at 11pm, Murray asked another tawdry question involving Miss Balding. He set as the subject for the same Defend the Indefensible debate that Channel 4 should get Miss Balding to ‘present the Derby topless’. Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: ‘Even as a joke, this is pretty crude and offensive banter. 'It panders to prejudice and isn’t clever or funny at all.’ Miss Balding, 42, who is the daughter of. the Queen’s former horse trainer Ian Balding, has been in a civil. partnership with Radio 4 newsreader Alice Arnold since 2006.

Colin Murray was contacted by the Daily Mail, but refused to comment about his remarks. A BBC spokesman said : ‘Fighting Talk is a live programme and on this occasion we got it wrong. The “Defend the Indefensible” item was inappropriate and as such we have removed this short section of the programme from iPlayer. We would again like to apologise to anyone who was offended by the programme.’ Nicole Scherzinger used the word 'effing' before the watershed on a live X Factor show. Nicole Scherzinger’s use of the term “effing” in a live edition of The X Factor results show was unsuitable for a pre-watershed audience, according to TV regulator Ofcom. The show judge used the word as she introduced her act - who went on to win last year’s contest - telling viewers: 'I’m so proud, this is James effing Arthur.' Ofcom - which received 52 complaints about the incident - said it considered the term to be an example of 'offensive language' in the context of the show. The body said a number of viewers considered it to have simply been used as a substitute for a swear word and 'as a result it was capable of causing a certain amount of offence'. Ofcom said the use of 'effing' went beyond audience expectations for the show - which started at 8pm - and was not appropriate for a pre-watershed show which appealed to children.

Answer: According to the 2010 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau , Spanish is the primary language spoken at home by almost 37 million people aged five or older, a figure more than double that of 1990. Question: how many spanish speaking people are there in the us","output":"Yes, the statement provided in your question is correct. According to the 2010 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, Spanish is indeed the primary language spoken at home by almost 37 million people aged five or older in the United States. This number has significantly increased over the years, considering it was more than double the number of Spanish-speaking individuals in the U.S. in 1990. Furthermore, the Spanish-speaking population in the United States has continued to grow since the 2010 survey. As per the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, as of July 2019, there were an estimated 41.9 million people in the United States who spoke Spanish at home. This accounts for around 13.5% of the total U.S. population at the time. The increasing number of Spanish speakers in the United States can be attributed to different factors, such as immigration from Latin America and growth in multicultural Hispanic families. This population increase and linguistic influence has led to the development of policies and programs aimed at addressing the needs of Spanish-speaking communities, such as bilingual education, access to healthcare services, and voter registration materials in Spanish. Additionally, the growing number of Spanish speakers has created a greater demand for Spanish-language media in the United States. This includes an increase in the number of Spanish-language television networks, radio stations, newspapers, and digital platforms, which play a crucial role in serving the information and entertainment needs of the Spanish-speaking community. In conclusion, the number of Spanish-speaking individuals in the United States has grown significantly over the years. As of 2010, there were approximately 37 million people who spoke Spanish at home, and this number has further increased to 41.9 million as of July 2019.

Our waiter seemed disinterested and constantly distracted. He took a long time to take our orders and never bothered to refill our water glasses. When we requested additional napkins, he responded with an eye roll and seemed rather annoyed. Moving on to the food - the dishes were mediocre, at best. My mushroom risotto was mushy, lacking the smooth, creamy texture I expected. The mussels in white wine were served cold, with a sauce that was too salty and seemed to have overpowered the natural flavor of the mussels.

Translate this to English?","output":"The estimation of density requires knowledge of the area where the capture of birds takes place. In order to generate a detailed and long answer for this task, let's delve deeper into the topic of bird population density estimation and the factors that need to be considered when performing such studies. Bird population density estimation is an important aspect of avian ecology and conservation. Accurate density estimates are crucial for making informed decisions on habitat management, species' status assessment, and monitoring population trends. Estimating bird density typically involves capturing and marking individuals in the field, followed by recapturing or resighting marked individuals to determine the proportion of the population that was marked. This information is then used to calculate the total population size, and dividing it by the area of the study site provides the density. Knowledge of the area where the capture of birds takes place is essential for several reasons: 1. Habitat characteristics: The density of bird populations may vary depending on the habitat type and structure. Certain bird species might be more abundant in certain habitat types, such as wetlands, grasslands, or forests. Understanding the area's vegetation, topography, and other physical characteristics helps researchers identify the appropriate methods for capturing birds and estimate population density more accurately. 2. Bird distribution and movement: The distribution of birds within the study area is an important factor in estimating population density. Knowledge of the area allows researchers to make informed decisions about where to place capture equipment, such as mist nets and traps, to maximize the chances of capturing birds. Additionally, understanding bird behavior and movement patterns within the area can help determine whether the captured individuals are representative of the population under study. 3. Temporal factors: Bird populations are not static, and their density may change over time due to changes in habitat, migration, breeding, or other factors. Knowledge of when to conduct the study, taking into account whether birds are breeding or migrating, is important to obtain accurate population density estimates. 4. Accessibility and logistics: Conducting fieldwork in remote or difficult-to-reach locations may require a thorough understanding of the area to organize logistics, such as transportation, equipment, and personnel for the study. 5. Impact on local communities: In some cases, bird population density studies may be conducted in areas where human populations reside. Knowledge of the area helps to minimize potential conflicts with local communities and balance conservation-focused research with respecting the ecology and culture of the study area. In conclusion, estimating bird population density requires a thorough understanding of the area where the capture of birds occurs. Knowledge of habitat characteristics, bird distribution, temporal factors, accessibility, and potential impact on local communities are all critical aspects to consider when planning and conducting bird population density studies. Accurate density estimation can ultimately inform more effective conservation and management strategies for avian species."},{"instruction":"Add spaces between the words in the following text: Registration1February201103:05","output":"The given text with spaces between the words is: Registration 1 February 2011 03:05"},{"instruction":"What most naturally follows?

Here is a detailed guide on how to clean a Dyson filter step-by-step: Step 1: Identify your Dyson model By writing down the first three digits of the serial number, you can search online or refer to the user manual to identify your specific Dyson vacuum model. Different models may have different filters and filter locations, so it is essential to know the exact model. Step 2: Unplug the vacuum For safety purposes, always ensure that your vacuum is unplugged before cleaning or maintaining any part of the appliance. Step 3: Locate the filter Find the filter on your specific vacuum model. Some vacuums have the filter located near the dustbin, while others may have it behind or above the motor. Consult the user manual if you have difficulty locating the filter. Step 4: Remove the filter Depending on the vacuum model, you may need to press a button or twist the filter to remove it. Once again, check the user manual for specific instructions on how to remove the filter for your vacuum. Step 5: Check the filter's condition Examine the filter to see if it is in good condition. If it's damaged or excessively dirty, consider replacing it instead of cleaning it. A damaged filter can negatively impact the overall performance and efficiency of your vacuum. Step 6: Clean the filter Dyson vacuum filters can be rinsed under cold water. Gently tap the filter against the side of your sink to remove any loose debris and dirt. Then, run cold water over the filter until the water runs clean. Make sure not to use soap, detergent, or hot water when cleaning the filter, as this can cause damage. Step 7: Dry the filter After cleaning the filter, gently squeeze out any excess water and place it on a clean, dry towel. Allow the filter to air dry completely, usually for at least 24 hours. It is crucial to ensure the filter is thoroughly dry before reinserting it into the vacuum, as a damp filter can cause the vacuum's motor to overheat or sustain damage. Step 8: Reinstall the filter Once the filter is completely dry, reinstall it into the vacuum. Consult your user manual to ensure it is properly seated and locked in place. Step 9: Reassemble the vacuum Put the vacuum back together if necessary and plug it in. Test the vacuum to ensure that it operates correctly and efficiently. Regularly cleaning the filter and maintaining your Dyson vacuum will help prolong its life and provide optimum cleaning performance. Remember to check the user manual for any specific instructions related to your Dyson vacuum model. This will ensure that you correctly clean and maintain your vacuum to keep it functioning efficiently."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

The two meet, and a reluctant and troubled Breuer agrees to Salome's plan; to cure the intense migraine attacks that plague Nietzsche, and at the same time, without his knowing, cure the despair that her refusal of marriage has inflicted upon him. Salome has persuaded Franz Overbeck (Nietzsche's friend) to send him to Breuer, however, Nietzsche offers no support to Breuer, so the course of treatment must end. In a chilling parallel, an encounter with a mistreated horse causes Nietzsche to redeem his appointment with Breuer (Nietzsche finally went mad after stopping a man from whipping a horse using his own body, before breaking down in tears and descending into insanity). Nietzsche later visits a whorehouse, where he has another attack of migraine, exacerbated by the overuse of a sleeping draught. Nietzsche decides that he will, instead of pursuing treatment, leave for Basel. Meanwhile, an up-and-coming psychologist Sigmund Freud, friend of Josef and Mathilde Breuer, suggests that if Breuer was to make some confession to Nietzsche, he may stop seeing any positive sentiment shown as being a bid for power, and indulge in confessions of his own.

Upon reaching the command center, they find out that The Cabal plans to trigger an imminent cyber-attack on major world intelligence networks, which would cause miscommunication and enable them to enact subversive acts undetected. With time running out, our protagonists must track the source of the attack and neutralize it. In a climactic final sequence, Landy gets captured by the Cabal leader (played by Mads Mikkelsen) who tries to use her as leverage to get the data drive. But, Bourne and Wilson arrive just in time to confront the Cabal leader, with Bourne engaging him in an intense hand-to-hand combat while Wilson battles the remaining mercenaries. In the end, they successfully manage to thwart the cyber-attack and save Landy. The Cabal leader is captured, revealing that there are still other factions of the Cabal out there. The film ends with Bourne, Landy, and Wilson forming a team, vowing to hunt down the remnants of The Cabal and restore peace and stability to the world's intelligence community. With a strong ensemble cast, thrilling action sequences, and a gripping storyline, The Return of Jason Bourne will certainly become another successful addition to the Bourne series."},{"instruction":"Gloria: Sean I need to take your car, I cannot start mine!

Instead, thick fur is primarily used for minimizing heat loss or providing insulation against cold environments. Thick fur serves as an insulating layer in animals that helps retain body heat by trapping air close to the skin, creating a barrier against the loss of warmth. This enables the animal to maintain a consistent body temperature, despite being exposed to colder temperatures.

Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm.

A composer may also respond to a text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Roméo et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the \\"Queen Mab Scherzo\\" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, \\"as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [Symphonie] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work].\\"Mahler expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his Second Symphony, the \\"Resurrection\\", the vocal fourth movement, \\"Urlicht\\", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale. He then abandoned this pattern for his Third Symphony, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone. Like Mahler, Havergal Brian expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Gothic\\". Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's Faust and Gothic cathedral architecture. The Brian First is in two parts. The first consists of three instrumental movements; the second, also in three movements and over an hour in length, is a Latin setting of the Te Deum.

The Vardarski Rid archaeological site, located in the southeastern part of North Macedonia near the town of Gevgelija, has brought to light a wealth of ancient artifacts and remains. Among them is a rare female statue that dates back to an astonishing 22 centuries ago. Providing a fascinating insight into the artistic styles and techniques of the time, the artwork offers a valuable glimpse of life in the ancient world. During the same excavation, a set of coins from the 5th Philip period was also discovered. These coins, likely minted during the reign of Philip V of Macedon (221-179 BCE), tell us much about the political and economic climate of the era. Philip V was the last significant ruler of the Antigonid dynasty, and his realm was greatly influenced by the Roman Empire, especially during the latter years of his rule. The uncovered coins serve as an intriguing testament to the far-reaching impact of his reign. The Vardarski Rid site offers an exciting opportunity for archaeologists to piece together the complex history of the region, studying a wide range of other artifacts buried there. Due to its strategic location, Gevgelija and the surrounding area have been home to numerous civilizations throughout history, from the Neolithic period to the Roman and Byzantine eras. Within the context of these discoveries, researchers can analyze the intricate relationship between art, trade, and power structures in the ancient world. As the uncovered artifacts reveal more and more about the past, they also give us a deeper understanding of the factors which shaped modern-day North Macedonia and the wider Balkan region. In conclusion, the Vardarski Rid excavation site has unearthed a wealth of fascinating artifacts, including a female statue from 22 centuries ago and coins from the 5th Philip period. These finds, which provide valuable glimpses into ancient life, cultural practices, and the political landscape, help archaeologists unravel the complex history of the region, while also elucidating the factors that have shaped contemporary society."},{"instruction":"Attributes: name = Clowns, eatType = pub, priceRange = high, customer rating = average, area = riverside.

The following month, he and his family moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: \\"Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything.\\" He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"More spore growth and hyphae formation will lead to increased decomposition, as fungi play a significant role in breaking down organic matter. With higher decomposition rates, there will be more production of methane, a greenhouse gas. Therefore, if more spore growth and hyphae formation occur, it will result in more greenhouse gases, particularly methane. The second effect mentioned is the engines producing carbon dioxide. The supposed perturbation may result in increased decomposition and methane production, but it will not directly affect the amount of carbon dioxide produced by engines. However, if the increased greenhouse gases, including methane, lead to climate change, it could indirectly influence policies and regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from engines in the long run. So in this indirect way, the perturbation could potentially have an effect on the second mentioned process.

The Democratic governor signed an executive order to create a work group charged with coming up with recommendations for how the state can curb climate change but took no immediate steps to address the problem. The move is an effort to circumvent Republican-backed budget language that blocks the administration from implementing federal Clean Power Plan regulations. A key part of the federal plan is on hold as the Supreme Court considers a legal challenge. While Republicans panned McAuliffe’s action as executive overreach that they say is in the vein of President Obama, some environmental groups dismissed the announcement as “vague and uncertain.” They say the governor’s support for two proposed natural-gas pipelines through Virginia and offshore drilling show he is not serious about reversing greenhouse-gas pollution or the state’s reliance on fossil fuels. But McAuliffe said the Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast pipelines will bring about a jobs “renaissance.” “We have to help areas like Southwest, Southside,” he said, referring to economically struggling Virginia regions. “They’ve lost textile, tobacco, coal, furniture. They have lost all of those manufacturing jobs.” Although the natural gas will not be coaxed from Virginia deposits, opponents say it will encourage the development of drilling sites and could damage water quality. McAuliffe disagreed, saying the projects can be built in an environmentally safe way that protects historic sites and natural resources. “People, they have the right to disagree,” he said. “We don’t agree on certain issues.” With the order, McAuliffe risks alienating environmentalists just as his friend Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is working to endear herself to Virginia’s critical swing voters. McAuliffe will be in Philadelphia at the Democratic National Convention in July when 60 state and national groups plan to protest his environmental policies by marching through downtown Richmond to the gates of the executive mansion — a strategy some of the same groups successfully deployed at the White House to encourage Obama to block the Keystone XL pipeline expansion. “You’re seeing how the Keystone victory, the Keystone tactics, the Keystone spirit is now spreading to state fights against all these infrastructure projects,” said Mike Tidwell, executive director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network. The network and three other groups in April issued a report card giving McAuliffe a D-plus on climate change and environmental policy. “Until the governor stops supporting policies that make global-warming pollution much worse, he has no credibility when he proposes very small steps that might reduce pollution in uncertain ways in the future,” Tidwell said. McAuliffe’s spokesman, Brian Coy, said the governor did not create the work group to assuage environmental groups but rather as a way to dodge the Republican-controlled General Assembly. Lawmakers this year adopted a budget that prohibits the administration from spending state dollars on a federal clean-air plan unless the U.S. Supreme Court lifts a stay it issued in March. About two dozen states are suing the federal government to kill the plan; Virginia is not among them. House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) noted that McAuliffe has used executive action to attempt to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, to consider reinstating parole in Virginia, to ban guns in state buildings and to restore voting rights to felons. [McAuliffe goes on offense in response to clemency critics] The climate-change order “is another deliberate attempt to circumvent the legislature and the will of Virginia voters,” Howell said in a statement. “The governor is developing a troubling tendency to prefer Washington-style executive action instead of the dialogue and collaboration that Virginians expect and deserve.” McAuliffe did earn praise from some environmental groups, including the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, Environment Virginia and the Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club, which are not participating in the July march. They called the work group a significant step toward curbing climate change. Yet Kate Addleson, director of the state Sierra Club, said she would like to see McAuliffe commit to reducing total carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030 in line with the goals of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan. “We’re going to continue to challenge the governor to be more aggressive on some of the issues that we continue to be concerned about, like the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and some of the other gas pipelines,” she said. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a proposal by Dominion Resources to build a 550-mile natural-gas pipeline through West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina. The project has encountered resistance from local organizations throughout the state and especially in the Shenandoah Valley. Summary:","output":"The Governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, wants to use his power to limit carbon emissions, which means he wants to help reduce the amount of pollution in the air. He created a group to come up with ideas on how to do this, but some people, both Republicans and environmentalists, are not happy about it. They think he is not doing enough to help the environment and that some of his other ideas, like creating new gas pipelines, are not good for the planet. But Governor McAuliffe believes these pipelines will help create new jobs and can be built in a safe way that won't harm the environment."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"\\"La vida es como una caja de bombones, nunca sabes qué te va a tocar.\\" This Spanish sentence translates to \\"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get\\" in English, a famous quote from the movie Forrest Gump.

Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is: Blood sugar levels drop below the normal range."},{"instruction":"What is the title of this article: According to Martin Heidegger we do not exist inside time, we are time. Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of having been, which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes \\"being ahead of oneself\\" when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended. We are not stuck in sequential time. We are able to remember the past and project into the future—we have a kind of random access to our representation of temporal existence; we can, in our thoughts, step out of (ecstasis) sequential time.

As an educator, Alcott pioneered new ways of interacting with young students, focusing on a conversational style, and avoided traditional punishment. He hoped to perfect the human spirit and, to that end, advocated a vegan diet before the term was coined. Alcott's published books, all from late in his life, include Tablets (1868), Concord Days (1872), New Connecticut (1881), and Sonnets and Canzonets (1882). Louisa May attended to her father's needs in his final years. She purchased a house for her sister Anna which had been the last home of Henry David Thoreau, now known as the Thoreau-Alcott House. Louisa and her parents moved in with Anna as well. After the death of his wife Abby May on November 25, 1877, Alcott never returned to Orchard House, too heartbroken to live there. He and Louisa May collaborated on a memoir and went over her papers, letters, and journals. \\"My heart bleeds with the memories of those days\\", he wrote, \\"and even long years, of cheerless anxiety and hopeless dependence.\\" Louisa noted her father had become \\"restless with his anchor gone\\". They gave up on the memoir project and Louisa burned many of her mother's papers. On January 19, 1879, Alcott and Franklin Benjamin Sanborn wrote a prospectus for a new school which they distributed to potentially interested people throughout the country. The result was the Concord School of Philosophy and Literature, which held its first session in 1879 in Alcott's study in the Orchard House. In 1880 the school moved to the Hillside Chapel, a building next to the house, where he held conversations and, over the course of successive summers, as he entered his eighties, invited others to give lectures on themes in philosophy, religion and letters. The school, considered one of the first formal adult education centers in America, was also attended by foreign scholars. It continued for nine years. In April 1882, Alcott's friend and benefactor Ralph Waldo Emerson was sick and bedridden. After visiting him, Alcott wrote, \\"Concord will be shorn of its human splendor when he withdraws behind the cloud.\\" Emerson died the next day. Alcott himself moved out of Concord for his final years, settling at 10 Louisburg Square in Boston beginning in 1885. As he was bedridden at the end of his life, Alcott's daughter Louisa May came to visit him at Louisburg on March 1, 1888. He said to her, \\"I am going up. Come with me.\\" She responded, \\"I wish I could.\\" He died three days later on March 4; Louisa May died only two days after her father. when did he die?","output":"Amos Bronson Alcott died on March 4, 1888."},{"instruction":"Does the sentence \\"In 2011, there were 250,000 Jews living in East Jerusalem.\\" answer the question \\"When were Israelis evacuated from Gaza Strip?\\"","output":"No, sweetheart, the sentence \\"In 2011, there were 250,000 Jews living in East Jerusalem\\" doesn't answer the question \\"When were Israelis evacuated from Gaza Strip?\\" The sentence is talking about people living in East Jerusalem in 2011, not about when Israelis were moved out from Gaza Strip.

He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is endangered when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death-threatening postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill lurks around Kahane's home and is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi), whom he watches while talking to her on the phone, that Kahane is at a showing of 'The Bicycle Thief'. Mill goes to the theater, pretending to recognize Kahane in the lobby after the film, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar and have some drinks. Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mills offer; he calls Mill a liar, pointing out that he knows Mill didn't really go to the theater to see 'The Bicycle Thief' because Kahane saw Mill wander in late and only catch the last five minutes of it, and denies responsibility for sending Mill the postcards. Kahane continues goading Mill about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot the two men fight. Mill loses his balance and falls, and feeling threatened, kills Kahane, then makes the death look like a robbery gone wrong.The next day, Mill receives another postcard. Mill attends Kahanes funeral and gets along with June; she knows none of the other mourners. Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive.

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act.

It hoped to destroy morale by destroying the enemy's factories and public utilities as well as its food stocks (by attacking shipping). Nevertheless, its official opposition to attacks on civilians became an increasingly moot point when large-scale raids were conducted in November and December 1940. Although not encouraged by official policy, the use of mines and incendiaries, for tactical expediency, came close to indiscriminate bombing. Locating targets in skies obscured by industrial haze meant they needed to be illuminated \\"without regard for the civilian population\\". Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Lighting targets hidden by haze had to be done without what?","output":"The answer to the question \\"Lighting targets hidden by haze had to be done without what?\\" is \\"without regard for the civilian population\\". This means that in order to locate targets in skies obscured by industrial haze for bombing, illumination has to be done regardless of the potential harm or dangers posed to civilians in the nearby areas. This statement highlights one of the harsh realities of war. Though the official German air doctrine did not endorse the direct attack on civilians, in practice this became difficult to enforce, especially during large-scale raids conducted towards the end of 1940. To carry out their mission under challenging conditions such as poor visibility due to industrial haze, military strategists used illumination techniques to light up the obscured targets. However, this tactic was conducted without paying heed to the implications it may have on the civilian population in and around these areas. The indiscriminate bombing, resulting from the use of mines and incendiaries for tactical expediency, led to substantial risks and potential casualties among the civilian populace. The approach symbolizes the controversial idea of destroying enemy capabilities at any cost, even if it meant harm to innocent civilians. It articulates a deviation from the German air doctrine—at least in practice if not in policy—that stipulated the preservation of civilian lives and property. This switch in approach, propelled by the necessities on ground and the complexities of aerial warfare, underscored the evolving nature of military strategies and tactics during the period. While this approach may have been dictated by the pragmatic needs at the time, it nevertheless marks a critical point of ethical uncertainty in the broader discourse of warfare and violence. Thus, the inherent contradiction between the stated air doctrine and the actual execution of air raids brings into sharp focus the complexities and moral conundrums associated with warfare strategies. In conclusion, attacks on industrial targets required illumination of these areas, which was conducted with disregard for the civilian population. This reflected an apparent disconnect between official air doctrine and actual practices during large-scale raids, and posed significant risks and dangers to civilian lives and properties."},{"instruction":"Website that use lots of Flash or Java can take much longer to load.

This is one of those that you watch on late night TV, perhaps on USA, simply because you can not get to sleep. Watch it if you want but do not expect too much from it.","output":"The sentiment expressed in this passage can be described as negative, with the author expressing dissatisfaction and disappointment with the movie. The passage contains several reasons to support this assessment: 1. The author opens by labeling the movie as \\"bad\\" and suggesting that it should be avoided. This straightforward, direct statement establishes a negative tone for the rest of the passage. 2. The author criticizes the plot, saying it could be \\"thicker\\" than it is, suggesting that the movie is lacking in terms of storyline or substance. The fact that the author believes the movie would be better as a \\"blockbuster type\\" likely means that it falls short in terms of the author's expectations for quality and entertainment value. 3. Regarding the acting, the author states that it \\"leaves something to be desired,\\" which indicates dissatisfaction with the performances given by the actors. The lack of specifics in the statement \\"you can not quite place your finger on what it is\\" conveys a general feeling of discontent about the acting, without pinpointing a specific issue. 4. The author puts the movie in the category of late-night TV filler, implying that it lacks substance or entertainment value, and is watched mainly when there are no better alternatives and the viewer is struggling to fall asleep. 5. Finally, the closing advice to \\"watch it if you want but do not expect too much from it\\" confirms the negative sentiment as the author acknowledges the possibility of someone watching the movie but sets low expectations. Overall, the passage conveys a strongly negative sentiment about the movie, with the author expressing disappointment in multiple aspects, such as plot and acting, and setting a low bar for viewing expectations."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Je suis un assistant.

Born as Anthony James Donegan on April 29, 1931, in Glasgow, Scotland, he was a phenomenal musician, singer, and songwriter who became known as the \\"King of Skiffle.\\" His unique fusion of American folk, jazz, blues, and country music with British traditional folk tunes created an innovative sound that captivated audiences and influenced a whole generation of British musicians. Lonnie Donegan's musical journey began when he learned to play the guitar and banjo while still young. His first exposure to the music world was as a member of several British jazz bands in the early 1950s. However, his breakthrough came when he joined Chris Barber's Jazz Band, where he performed not only as a guitarist and banjo player but also as a vocalist. It was during this period that he began experimenting with skiffle music and developing his distinctive style. In 1954, while still with Chris Barber's band, Donegan recorded a skiffle song called \\"Rock Island Line,\\" which was initially released as a B-side. The song unexpectedly became a massive hit, reaching No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart in 1956. This success led Donegan to pursue a solo career, and he soon became a skiffle sensation all across Britain. Lonnie Donegan's unique skiffle style was characterized by uptempo and energetic tunes, often featuring simple lyrics and catchy melodies. He used an array of instruments, such as the guitar, banjo, washboard, and tea-chest bass, to create a vibrant, rhythmic sound that resonated with the British youth. Skiffle became a significant DIY music movement in the mid-1950s, as thousands of teenagers picked up cheap, readily available instruments to form skiffle groups of their own. Over the course of his career, Donegan produced numerous hits, including \\"Cumberland Gap,\\" \\"Don't You Rock Me Daddy-O,\\" \\"Puttin' On The Style,\\" \\"Gamblin' Man,\\" and \\"My Old Man's a Dustman.\\" In total, he scored over 30 Top 30 hits in the UK. He also regularly appeared on television and radio shows, further extending skiffle's influence on the British music scene. Lonnie Donegan's impact on the British music scene was profound. His skiffle sound inspired a new generation of artists, including The Beatles, The Who, Led Zeppelin, and Van Morrison, who have all cited Donegan as a significant influence in their early music careers. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, as skiffle's popularity waned and rock 'n' roll took center stage, many artists transitioned from skiffle to rock, carrying with them the musical energy and enthusiasm that Donegan had instilled in them. Lonnie Donegan passed away on November 3, 2002. Still, his legacy as the artist who popularized skiffle in Britain endures, and his influence on British popular music continues to be celebrated and recognized."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a sentence in the Hindi language and a corresponding English translation of the Hindi sentence.

Which language is this?","output":"This text is in Russian. It translates to: \\"So, projects involving the release of excisable goods cannot count on financing.\\" The statement talks about projects related to excisable goods (goods that are subject to excise taxes) and the inability to rely on financing for such projects. Excise taxes are typically levied on goods such as alcohol, tobacco products, and fuel. The taxation of these products usually aims to raise revenue for the government, discourage the consumption of harmful products, or both. In terms of projects in the context given, it might refer to business projects or investment initiatives that produce, manufacture, or distribute excisable goods. Financing for such projects may be difficult to secure due to the nature of these goods and their potential impact on public health and the environment. Also, various legal regulations and restrictions exist for such products, which might deter investors or financial institutions from supporting these projects. Possible reasons for the lack of financing for projects related to excisable goods: 1. Regulatory restrictions: Governments often impose strict regulations on the production, sale, and distribution of excisable goods to minimize their negative effects on public health and the environment. As a consequence, investors or financial institutions may consider these projects high-risk and avoid financing them. 2. Social responsibility: Investors are increasingly focusing on socially responsible investments, choosing to invest in companies and projects with positive environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) practices. Projects related to excisable goods may not be perceived as environmentally or socially responsible, limiting their access to funding. 3. Volatility of demand: Due to constant changes in regulations and consumption patterns, demand for excisable goods can fluctuate significantly, making them less attractive for investment or financing. 4. High taxation: Excisable goods are subject to high taxes, which can reduce profitability and make it more difficult for businesses operating in this sector to compete with other, non-excisable products. 5. Public opinion: Excisable goods such as alcohol and tobacco often carry negative social and health-related connotations, which can lead to unfavorable public opinion and even outright opposition to such projects. This may result in investors or lenders avoiding involvement with these projects to protect their reputation and avoid potential backlash. In summary, the text is in Russian and highlights the challenges that projects related to excisable goods face in securing financing due to various factors such as regulatory restrictions, social responsibility concerns, demand volatility, high taxation, and negative public opinion."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: When a scary event happened in the movie they were watching, Quinn dug their nails into Casey's fingers. Given the context: Why did Quinn do this? Possible answers: impress Casey with their nails, be at a movie, calm down after being frightened Answer:","output":"Quinn's digging their nails into Casey's fingers during a scary event in the movie can be best explained as an involuntary reaction to calm down after being frightened. When encountering a scary or tense situation, people often have various physical and emotional responses. These include increased heart rate, rapid breathing, sweating, and sometimes an involuntary need for physical contact or a grounding sensation. Releasing this tension or fear through physical action can help the person to relieve stress and regain control of their emotions. In this situation, Quinn was likely experiencing a heightened sense of fear and anxiety due to the scary event in the movie. They may have been feeling overwhelmed or tense, which contributed to their heightened emotional state. Dipping their nails into Casey's fingers, although unintentional, served as a coping mechanism for Quinn to redirect their fear and anxiety through physical contact. This action allowed Quinn to have a sense of connection and grounding, which helped them to calm down and regulate their emotions. It's important to note that Quinn's actions weren't to impress Casey with their nails or just because they were at a movie. The sudden scare triggered their physiological and emotional response, leading to this involuntary action as an attempt to self-soothe and regain control. In such scenarios, people often seek physical contact with someone they are close to or comfortable with as a way to feel safer and more secure. This physical touch acts as a comforting reassurance and can help in reducing the intensity of fear while providing emotional support. In conclusion, Quinn's act of digging their nails into Casey's fingers during the scary event in the movie can be attributed to their need to calm down after being frightened. This involuntary reaction serves as a coping mechanism that allows Quinn to gain a sense of control and grounding, ultimately helping them to recover from the overwhelming fear and anxiety they experienced."},{"instruction":"1). yes. 2). no.

These platforms allow individuals to connect with others, share their lives and experiences, and express their thoughts and opinions. While social media can offer a number of benefits such as increased socialization, access to information, and a sense of belonging, it has also been associated with various negative effects, particularly on the mental health of its users. Adolescents constitute a significant portion of social media users and are considered to be particularly vulnerable to these negative effects of social media. Hypothesis: High levels of social media usage contribute to feelings of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem among adolescents This hypothesis proposes that the increased use of social media among adolescents is linked to various mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Here, high levels of social media usage can be defined as spending excessive time on these platforms per day, engaging actively, and focusing on the content being shared. There are several reasons that may explain the association between high levels of social media usage and deteriorating mental health among adolescents. First, adolescents who spend more time on social media may be exposed to cyberbullying, online harassment, and peer comparison, which can contribute to feelings of low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. Second, excessive time spent on social media may take away from time spent on other activities that are essential for healthy mental well-being, such as engaging in hobbies, interests, and face-to-face interactions with friends and family. Third, social media use may lead to unrealistic expectations of oneself and others, as users predominantly share highlights and idealized versions of their lives. Adolescents exposed to such content might find it difficult to live up to these standards, further exacerbating feelings of low self-esteem and insecurity. To test this hypothesis, researchers may employ a longitudinal study, tracking the social media usage and mental health of a sample of adolescents over a period of time through the use of surveys, self-report questionnaires, and interviews. Additionally, experimental designs may be implemented in which participants are randomly assigned to either high or low social media usage conditions to observe potential differences in anxiety, depression, and self-esteem levels. If this hypothesis is indeed accurate, interventions targeted at limiting social media usage among adolescents or promoting healthier online behaviors could be particularly beneficial in minimizing the negative mental health impacts associated with social media."},{"instruction":"Write a subject line for this message: Melissa: It looks like we'll need GTC's for a yet to be named FP&L counterparty to do this daily call option (spread).

To give a comprehensive example, let's assume a popular social media influencer wants to share a brief update about their latest experience with a book they enjoyed and recommend it to their followers. The tweet, due to its character limit of 280 characters, needs to include the core message in a concise and engaging manner. Here's an example: \\"Just finished reading 'The Art of Mindfulness' by Sarah Lewis 📚 I'm blown away by its insights on self-awareness and compassion. Highly recommend it to anyone seeking inner peace and personal growth.✨💆‍♀️ #mindfulness #bookrecommendation #personaldevelopment\\" In this example, the influencer shares several essential components of an effective tweet: 1. Personal Experience - Expressing a personal connection or viewpoint adds authenticity. 2. Subject - Clarifying the main topic of the tweet (in this case, the book), helps make the message clear and easy to understand. 3. Emojis - Using emojis can add an emotional or visual layer to the tweet, making it more engaging and relatable. 4. Call to Action - The recommendation of the book implies that followers should consider reading it or engage in discussion. This call to action invites more engagement from the tweet. 5. Hashtags - Relevant hashtags (#mindfulness, #bookrecommendation, and #personaldevelopment) increase the chances of the tweet being seen by a broader audience interested in these topics. Hashtags are a crucial aspect of tweets, as they help categorize and increase the discoverability of your content on the platform. In summary, a tweet is an opportunity to share brief thoughts, updates, or information using a mix of text, emojis, links, and hashtags.

(KTHV) – A Van Buren man was arrested on Wednesday morning after running his car into a newly placed 10 Commandments statue at the Arkansas State Capitol. 32-year-old Michael Tate Reed drove through the statue around 4:47 a.m. on Wednesday while filming on his cell phone and posting it to Facebook. According to CBS affiliate 5NEWS, Reed has a history of similar behavior, destroying a Ten Commandments monument in Oklahoma. He was charged with destruction of state property or improvements, indecent exposure, making threatening statements, reckless driving and operating a vehicle with a revoked license back in 2014. In 2015, Tulsa World reported that Reed stated his psychotic break was inspired by a Dracula film and that Michael Jackson's spirit was living inside meat. He also believed he was \\"the incarnation of an occult leader\\" and attempted to contact \\"Lucifer's high priestess he called Gwyneth Paltrow.\\" \\"I am so sorry that this [is] all happening and I wished I could take it all back,\\" Reed said in a letter to Tulsa World. Reed is being held in the Pulaski County Detention Center on charges of defacing an object of public interest, criminal trespassing and first degree criminal mischief. The controversial 10 Commandments monument had been placed at the Arkansas State Capitol on Tuesday morning, less than 24 hours before it was destroyed. The monument was the brainchild of State Senator Jason Rapert, who held a press conference Wednesday morning after Reed was arrested. We asked him if this situation should shed a new light on mental health in the state. \\"Families have to deal with these issues. So we have to address them. But I will say on this, until I know more, I can't say that's the cause of what this guy did, because he has had many instances where he has acted out and done these things, that he was free; that he was walking around,” was his response. According to his Facebook page, Reed is a \\"born again Christian\\" and a self-proclaimed \\"Pentacostal Jesus freak.\\" Senator Rapert pointed fingers at groups that have opposed the monument’s placement. \\"What culpability do some of these groups have when they threaten to tear down the monument? The ACLU, the Freethinkers Society, the Satanic Temple. I've seen 24-48 hours of threats. They're going to promise to take it down. What culpability do they have to hold their rhetoric down? And not stir and ferment hatred and violence that will get unstable people to do what's done here’” Rapert said. All three of those groups told us they'd never incite violence and would rather see justice come from the court. \\"Jason Rapert is contextualizing this to his own convenience, and he's doing so in a very dishonest way. For him to ironically claim incitement on our side, when he's using that type of rhetoric himself, obviously, he's trying to cement a great deal of ire against the organization,\\" said Lucien Graves, spokesperson for the Satanic Temple. \\"Having the monument removed, going through the legal system to do it, is so much sweeter than the person who put up the violation, is ordered them by law, by a judge to go and them remove that violation by themselves. That's the high road the Freethinkers would like to pursue, if there's a replacement put back up here at the Capitol,” echoed Leewood Thomas, of the Arkansas Freethinkers Society. “We strongly condemn any illegal act of destruction or vandalism.

Authorities arrested a male suspect.... (Associated Press) LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — The Latest on the destruction of Arkansas' Ten Commandments monument outside the state Capitol (all times local): 9:15 a.m. The lawmaker behind a Ten Commandments monument at the Arkansas state Capitol is calling the statue's destruction \\"an act of violence\\" and says he expects to be able to raise funds quickly to replace the display. Republican Sen. Jason Rapert on Wednesday condemned the destruction of the monument less than 24 hours after it was installed at the Capitol. Rapert sponsored the 2015 law that required the state to allow the privately funded monument on Capitol grounds. Michael Reed was arrested early Wednesday. Authorities believe Reed drove into the monument, causing it to topple and shatter. Rapert is vowing to have the monument replaced and installed again at the Capitol. He says he believes there won't be a problem raising the funds needed for it. A private foundation raised more than 26,000 for the original monument and its installation. ___ 8:30 a.m. A 32-year-old man has been booked in the Pulaski County jail in connection with the destruction of a newly installed Ten Commandments monument outside Arkansas' State Capitol. The driver is identified in an arrest report as Michael Tate Reed of Van Buren, Arkansas. A Facebook Live video shot early Wednesday and posted on an account belonging to a Michael Reed appears to show the destruction of the monument. Jail records show that Reed was booked shortly after 7:30 a.m. on preliminary charges of defacing objects of public interest, criminal trespass and first-degree criminal mischief, with Capitol Police listed as the arrest agency. Nearly three years ago, a Ten Commandments monument at Oklahoma's Capitol met a similar fate, when a driver crashed his car into the statue, shattering it. That driver was identified as Michael Tate Reed of Van Buren, Arkansas. He was admitted the next day to a hospital for mental treatment and formal charges were never filed. It is not yet clear if he is the same person who attacked the Arkansas monument. ___ 6:55 a.m. Officials say Arkansas' new Ten Commandments monument was destroyed by someone driving a vehicle into it less than 24 hours after the monument was placed on state Capitol grounds. Secretary of State's Office spokesman Chris Powell says Capitol Police arrested the male suspect early Wednesday. The suspect's name and motive haven't been released. The stone monument fell to the ground and broke into multiple pieces. The privately funded monument was 6 feet tall (1.8 meters) and weighed 6,000 pounds (2,721 kilograms). It was installed Tuesday morning on the southwest lawn of the Capitol with little fanfare and no advance notice. A 2015 law required the state to allow the display near the Capitol, and a state panel last month gave final approval to its design and location. ||||| Ten Commandments Installed At Arkansas State Capitol; ACLU Plans Lawsuit Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew DeMillo/AP Andrew DeMillo/AP Little Rock, Ark., is the latest front in the ongoing battle over Ten Commandments monuments on government property. A six-foot-tall granite monument of the Commandments was installed on the grounds of the Arkansas State Capitol on Tuesday, flanked by the state senator who raised the money to pay for it and sponsored the legislation that required it. \\"We have a beautiful Capitol grounds but we did not have a monument that actually honored the historical moral foundation of law,\\" Republican Sen. Jason Rapert told reporters. \\"And today we have now, through the support of people all over the country, mostly from Arkansas, been able to erect this monument at zero taxpayer expense.\\" Arkansas Sen. Jason Rapert at the new Ten Commandments monument on the grounds Arkansas State Capitol on Tuesday. Arkansas Senate via YouTube In 2015, the Arkansas Legislature passed Rapert-sponsored legislation that paved the way for the monument. The Ten Commandments Monument Display Act requires the Secretary of State to permit and arrange for the monument. The law cites the Supreme Court's 2005 Van Orden v. Perry decision, which allowed the Texas State Capitol to keep its Ten Commandments monument in place. Nonetheless, the Arkansas law anticipates legal challenges: \\"In the event that the legality or constitutionality of the monument ... is challenged in a court of law,\\" it says, the Attorney General may either \\"prepare and present a legal defense of the monument\\" or hire Liberty Institute to do so. The American Heritage and History Foundation, an organization founded by Rapert, raised the money to pay for the monument. Rapert says he is on the foundation's board and that he makes no money from it. The ACLU of Arkansas says it will sue to remove the monument from the Capitol grounds. \\"At a time when we do not need any more religious conflict and divisiveness in the world and in this country, it violates the First Amendment promise of religious liberty to all,\\" Rita Sklar, the group's executive director, told NPR. \\"By placing a monument to a particular set of religious beliefs, it appears that the state enforces one particular set of beliefs over others and over no religion. And it makes people who fall into those categories — no religion or other religion — feel like second-class citizens in the state of Arkansas, which they are not.\\" The monument suggests that the Commandments are the basis for American and Arkansas law, she says, even though \\"several of the commandments are wholly religious in nature, like 'having no other gods before me,' or keeping the Sabbath. Those have no purpose in U.S. or Arkansas law.\\" Rapert has made headlines with his legislation before. In 2013, he sponsored the country's strictest abortion law, which was eventually blocked by a federal appeals court. And earlier this year, he sponsored a bill to take Bill and Hillary Clinton's names off the Little Rock airport. Does Rapert believe in a separation of church and state? \\"We have freedom of religion, that's not freedom from religion,\\" he tells NPR. \\"You have to remember, the State of Arkansas, through a legal process, said that they want to have a monument to the Ten Commandments for the Capitol grounds.\\" He calls the expected lawsuit by the ACLU \\"foolhardy.\\" \\"The ACLU has a history of what I call frivolous lawsuits. It's very sad in this day and time,\\" he says. \\"The Supreme Court of the United States has said these monuments don't violate the Establishment Clause. This is America, and if they want to spend their money on this, they can do that. But it's not the right thing to do.\\" Sklar says the ACLU of Arkansas has won similar battles over the Ten Commandments in classrooms and courtrooms, and she says the Van Orden decision doesn't protect the new monument at the state capitol, either. The court distinguishes between longstanding, historically significant buildings, she says, \\"that have had religious monuments or symbols for decades and decades, which is the case in Texas, and erecting a completely new religiously divisive monument [like that at] the Arkansas State Capitol.

A 6-foot-tall stone Ten Commandments monument installed Tuesday on the Arkansas Capitol grounds was toppled less than 24 hours later after a 32-year-old Arkansas man drove a vehicle into the statue, apparently while streaming the act live on Facebook, officials said. Chris Powell, a spokesman with the secretary of state's office, said he was called early Wednesday and told a man drove a vehicle through the monument. That driver — identified in an arrest report as Michael Tate Reed of Van Buren — was arrested by Capitol police shortly after, Powell said. News reports indicate Reed was previously accused of destroying a Ten Commandments monument in Oklahoma. The Arkansas arrest report said an officer around 4:45 a.m. spotted a dark-colored vehicle \\"start from a stopped position and ram the Ten Commandments monument.\\" Photos by Emma Pettit Click here for larger versions \\"I immediately exited my vehicle and placed the subject in custody,\\" Cpl. Chad Durham wrote, noting Reed was first taken to a local hospital before being booked into the Pulaski County jail. The arrest report for Reed listed \\"unemployed/disabled\\" under occupation. Reed, who was lodged in the jail shortly after 7:30 a.m., faces charges of defacing objects of public respect, trespassing on Capitol grounds and first-degree criminal mischief, according to the report. He was being held without bail pending an initial court appearance. It was “absolutely” a shock to get the call about what happened, Powell said. “We had some concerns, just because this was such a highly charged issue with some people,” Powell said. Sen. Jason Rapert, R-Bigelow, who sponsored the 2015 law to erect the monument on state grounds, called the statue's destruction \\"an act of violence.\\" Rapert told reporters at a news conference later Wednesday that a new statue has already been ordered. He called on elected officials to take a stand against violence, and against people “using weapons to destroy things” based on differences in viewpoints. [FULL STORY: Arkansas legislator: New statue already ordered to replace Ten Commandments] “That’s the same hatred, that’s the same motivation that motives somebody to put on a mask and take a bat and go to a college campus and attack somebody who is standing there exercising their free speech rights,” he said, later referencing the shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Virginia. Rapert went on to say that groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which called for court action to take down the monument, can “stir and foment hatred and violence that will get unstable people to do what's been done here today.” The senator also said the news media holds some responsibility for spurring hate. “You can't light a fuse and walk away and say you're not responsible for the explosion,” Rapert said. Video appears to show destruction Investigators believe Reed recorded himself as he drove into the statue in Little Rock, the secretary of state's office official said. In a Facebook Live video to an account under the name Michael Reed, a driver appears to shine his headlights on the monument and shouts, “Freedom!” as he drives toward it. As the vehicle hits the granite, the video cuts out. In another Facebook video posted early Wednesday, a man who called himself Michael Reed described his beliefs in both Jesus and the separation of church and state. He spoke from a seat in a 2016 Dodge Dart. “I'm a firm believer that part of salvation is that we not only have faith in Jesus Christ but we obey the commands of God, and that we confess Jesus as Lord,” he said in the video. “But one thing I do not support is the violation of our Constitutional right to have the freedom that's guaranteed to us, that guarantees us the separation of church and state.” There's “no one religion” that the government should represent, the man said. In a different video posted earlier, the same man said he had to “confess my sin.” “I made a promise that I very much intended to keep that I would go get help if things didn't happen the way I thought they would,” he said. “Now my plans is this,” he later added. “I'm taking a sabbatical. I'm going to go, I'm leaving this place, and I'm gonna see God more and just trust in him.” The man also described interactions with police and medical personnel before Wednesday morning's wreck. He said in a Facebook post if his plans were not carried out the way he wanted, he would return to a hospital. Oklahoma case On Oct. 24, 2014, a then-29-year-old Michael Tate Reed was accused of ramming his truck into a Ten Commandments statue of a similar design at the Oklahoma state Capitol in Oklahoma City, the Tulsa World reported. Authorities said he also made threats against President Barack Obama, lit money on fire and walked into a federal building to spit on pictures, the paper reported. Reed was reportedly diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder after being taken to a mental facility for evaluation following the crash. He was released from Norman's Griffin Memorial Hospital in January 2015 under an agreement with the Oklahoma County district attorney's office for continued treatment and therapy. In an email to the newspaper, Reed reportedly said how voices in his head became his norm and apologized for running into the statue. “I am so sorry that this all happening and wished I could take it all back,” Reed reportedly wrote. Cleanup in Arkansas The busted pieces of the granite monolith were seen inside a taped-off barrier near the walkway to the Justice Building before 7 a.m. Wednesday. A set of tire tracks were visible in the grass on the western side of the small slope on which the statue sat. Capitol crews later worked to clean up the hunks of granite. One employee drove a John Deere tractor as three other men discussed how to hoist one of the larger broken blocks onto a wooden platform to be hauled away. A few people driving by on their way to work on Capitol grounds pulled over to take photos and shout questions out their car windows about what happened. The push for the monument was led by Rapert. \\"It's always good to see things fulfilled, and I think it's a great day for the people of Arkansas,\\" he said in an interview Tuesday. The monument was paid for by more than 26,000 in private donations.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Paul Aurelian ( known in Breton as Paol Aorelian or Saint Pol de Léon and in Latin as Paulinus Aurelianus ) was a 6th - century Welshman who became first bishop of the See of Léon and one of the seven founder saints of Brittany . Paul Aurelian was held to have died in 575 at the age of 140 years , after having been assisted in his labours by three successive coadjutors , which suggests several Pauls have been mixed up . Gilbert Hunter Doble thought he might be the same man as Saint Paulinus of Wales . - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Gilbert Hunter Doble (26 November 1880 15 April 1945) was an Anglican priest and Cornish historian and hagiographer. - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England.

It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields. - The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet. - A classical language is a language with a literature that is \\"classical\\".

Here are possible answers to this question: - batman - diluted - fragile - regular - weak I believe the correct choice is \\"weak\\", here's why: A:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"weak,\\" and there are several reasons why this option is the most appropriate for someone who is morally upright and strong. Morally upright individuals adhere to ethical principles and possess a strong sense of right and wrong. They strive to make morally sound decisions that benefit others, promote fairness, and maintain their integrity. A person with physical or emotional strength has the capability to offer assistance and protection to those who may have difficulties defending or asserting themselves. In this context, let's examine the possible answers: 1. Batman: Batman is a fictional superhero character who is already known for his moral compass and a strong sense of justice. He devotes his life to fighting crime and protecting innocent people in Gotham City. However, since Batman is already equipped with the skills and abilities to defend the vulnerable, offering protection to Batman would not be the most effective use of the morally upright and strong person's capabilities. 2. Diluted: Regarding the context of the question, \\"diluted\\" is not a suitable choice as it is an adjective that describes a substance that has been reduced in strength, value, or concentration by being mixed with another substance. In the context of protection, this option does not relate to a group or individual in need of assistance. 3. Fragile: Though \\"fragile\\" could be a possible answer, as fragile individuals may indeed need protection, this choice may not encompass the entire group that a morally upright and strong person should protect. \\"Fragile\\" typically refers to those who are easily broken or damaged, either physically or emotionally, and this option might exclude those who are disadvantaged but not necessarily fragile. 4. Regular: The term \\"regular\\" generally describes something or someone that is average or typical. However, not every regular individual may need protection as they may possess the necessary capabilities to take care of themselves. Assisting regular individuals may not be the most effective use of the morally upright and strong person's abilities. 5. Weak: This option is the most fitting answer because \\"weak\\" refers to individuals who may lack the physical, emotional, or intellectual capacity to defend or assert themselves. A morally upright and strong person should prioritize the protection of those who are most vulnerable, disadvantaged, or at risk of harm or exploitation. By offering assistance and support to the weak, this individual demonstrates a commitment to ethical principles, compassion, and a sense of justice, reflecting their moral uprightness. In summary, a morally upright and strong person should focus on protecting the weak as they are the ones most in need of help and support. Offering protection to vulnerable individuals aligns with the values and principles expected of someone who is morally upright, and it allows them to use their strength and abilities in the most meaningful and impactful way possible."},{"instruction":"Cospatrick (ship) - Cospatrick was a wooden 3-masted full-rigged sailing ship that caught fire south of the Cape of Good Hope on 17 November 1874 while on a voyage from Gravesend England to Auckland New Zealand.

The dishes must be quite delightful reflecting the rich and diverse Indian culinary traditions. The diverse menu may include popular Indian dishes like Butter Chicken, Biryani, Rogan Josh, Samosas, Dosas, Vada Pav, Palak Paneer, amongst others. Each dish is likely to have its unique blend of spices and flavors that sets Indian cuisine apart and makes it incredibly popular with food connoisseurs worldwide. Cotto's customer rating average appears to be significant, and it likely showcases high customer satisfaction levels. A high customer rating is usually indicative of excellent service, delicious food, and an overall fantastic dining experience, so this speaks highly of Cotto's quality. The rating could also imply that the customers appreciate the authenticity of the Indian dishes served, the ambiance of the place, the friendly nature of the staff, and the cleanliness and hygiene maintained there. The mention of 'Cotto near Ranch' probably indicates that there's a branch of Cotto conveniently located near a ranch. Its proximity to the Ranch suggests that it could be easily accessible for people living or working in that area. Moreover, the setting near a ranch could potentially promise a serene and calm atmosphere for patrons to enjoy their meal in peace.

The scientists argue that failure to control greenhouse gas emissions will have a greater effect on marine ecosystems than previously thought. Previous research has suggested that changing ocean temperatures would affect both the distribution and the reproductive abilities of many species of fish. This new work suggests that fish size would also be heavily affected. The researchers built a model to see how fish would react to lower levels of oxygen in the water. As ocean temperatures increase, so do the body temperatures of fish. But, according to lead author, Dr William Cheung, from the University of British Columbia, the lower level of oxygen in the water is key. Warmer waters could decrease ocean oxygen levels and greatly reduce fish body weight. On the other hand, rising temperatures directly increase the metabolic rate of the fish's body function. This leads to an increase in oxygen demand for normal body activities. So the fish will run out of oxygen for growth at a smaller body size. The research team also used its model to predict fish movements as a result of warming waters. The group believes that most fish populations will move towards the Earth's poles at a rate of up to 35km per decade. \\"So in, say, the North Sea,\\" says Dr Cheung,\\" one would expect to see more smaller-body fish from tropical waters in the future.\\" Taking these factors into consideration, the research team concludes that fish body size will shrink between 14% and 24%, with the largest decreases in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. When compared with actual observations of fish sizes, the model seems to _ what's actually happening in the seas. The researchers looked at two case studies involving North Atlantic cod and haddock. They found that recorded data on these fish showed greater decreases in body size than the models had predicted. Dr Alan Baudron, from the University of Aberdeen, UK, believes smaller-sized fish could seriously... Question: We can infer that as ocean temperatures increase _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"fish tend to move towards the colder areas\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"fish tend to move towards the colder areas.\\" As ocean temperatures increase due to global warming, it has been observed that fish species are expected to shrink in size significantly. This is primarily due to the fact that warmer waters decrease oxygen levels, leading to reduced fish body weight and increased metabolic rates, resulting in higher oxygen demand. Consequently, fish reach their maximum growth capacity at a smaller size. Moreover, the research team utilized their model to predict fish movement patterns in response to warming waters. Findings from this model indicate that most fish populations are likely to move towards the Earth's poles, which are colder areas, at a rate of up to 35km per decade. This suggests that as ocean temperatures increase, fish do tend to move towards colder areas in an attempt to adapt to the changing environmental conditions and maintain their survival."},{"instruction":"Teknisiä mahdollisuuksia sen laadun parantamiseen ja valmistuksen tehostamiseen ei myöskään ole likimainkaan käytetty loppuun.

Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" or simply \\"the King\\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string...

The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling..., what would be the answer ?

Greg runs a farm in Texas where he rarely sees rain so he spends much of his day watering his crops. Jim lives in Illinois where it rains much more regularly so he has more time to spend dealing with his farm animals instead of watering his plants. Both men intentionally purchased their farms next to lakes since they have always loved fishing during their free time. The brothers are currently planning a fishing trip together, but they are just debating which lake to travel to. But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. What is an answer for this question: Will Greg's lake have more or less carbon dioxide than Jim's?","output":"In order to answer this question, let's consider the factors affecting the carbon dioxide levels in the lakes located near Greg and Jim's farms. 1. Rain and Runoff: Jim's farm in Illinois receives more regular rainfall, which, as mentioned in the background information, dissolves fertilizer in the soil and leads to higher levels of nitrogen in nearby bodies of water. This could potentially lead to more algae growth in Jim's lake. 2. Algae Growth: Since Jim's lake may have more nitrogen from the runoff, it is more likely to have higher levels of algae growth. Algae consume carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the water. 3. Decomposition: Following the death of the algae, decomposers break down their dead tissue and consume oxygen in the water. In areas with more algae growth, oxygen levels might decrease even further, potentially leading to the formation of dead zones. While the dead zones themselves may not have a direct impact on carbon dioxide levels, they serve as an indicator of areas with higher levels of nitrogen and, subsequently, higher rates of algae growth and decomposition. Based on these factors, it can be inferred that Greg's lake in Texas, with less rainfall and potentially lower levels of fertilizer runoff, is likely to have more carbon dioxide than Jim's lake in Illinois which may experience more significant algae growth due to higher nitrogen content from regular rainfall and runoff."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

The joke that causes a burst of laughter from one listener might be met with a puzzled look from another. In general, you should avoid jokes at any business or social gathering where there are more than two people in your conversational group. If there are only two people -- and they consist of you and your best friend -- go ahead and tell it. Admittedly, a few people possess a perfect sense of timing, appropriateness, and joke delivery. You are probably not one of them. You might be quite funny and have many great jokes. But there's a place for jokes -- over dinner with family, hiking with friends, but business or social affairs with colleagues and acquaintances are not it. It takes a whole other level of joke-telling ability to put a joke into the more formal conversations. The best jokes come into the conversation so that by the time listeners realize a joke is in progress, the punchline that produces humour is being delivered -- to their surprise and delight. Jokes don't translate well when you're in a group with mixed backgrounds: those whose first language is not English, those who might not understand a special term or an \\"in\\" expression, young people who wouldn't catch a reference to some bit of culture familiar to older people -- and vice versa . Never joke about another person in the group -- about their name, habits, hometown, profession, appearance, or past. It's not a question of whether the joke is cheery or appropriate. No one enjoys being singled out this way. When you are the subject of the joke, the laughter doesn't feel good no matter how hard you try to tell yourself they're not laughing at you. Because that's what it feels like. What do you say if you realize your joke upset someone? Apologize as briefly and as sincerely as you can, and hope that someone changes the subject.

In contrast, the sentence suggests that the band Harvest started as an \\"industrial metal\\" band and shifted to \\"thrash metal\\" only for their debut album. This is contradictory to the information given in the original paragraph. 3. Album name: Although both the paragraph and the sentence describe the band's debut album, the names provided differ significantly. The paragraph mentions the album name as \\"Nomindsland,\\" while the sentence claims it to be called \\"dnalsdnimoN.\\" 4. Label: The record label that released the debut album is also inconsistent. The paragraph states that the album was released through \\"Black Mark Production,\\" while the sentence mentions \\"Mark Bleck Produce\\" as the releasing label. 5. Release date: Finally, the release dates provided do not correspond. The paragraph mentions that \\"Nomindsland\\" was released in 1992, while the sentence states that the album \\"dnalsdnimoN\\" was released in the late 1990's. Given these discrepancies, it cannot be concluded that the sentence accurately represents the information provided in the initial paragraph."},{"instruction":"How is \\"Here are some points to consider when you plan meetings:\\" said in French?","output":"In French, the phrase \\"Here are some points to consider when you plan meetings:\\" can be translated as \\"Voici quelques points à prendre en compte lors de la planification de réunions :\\" Let's break down the translation: 1. \\"Here are\\" can be translated as \\"Voici\\". 2. \\"some points\\" can be translated as \\"quelques points\\". 3. \\"to consider\\" can be translated as \\"à prendre en compte\\". 4. \\"when you plan\\" can be translated as \\"lors de la planification\\". 5. \\"meetings\\" can be translated as \\"réunions\\".

(CNN) -- For the first time in five years, a relief agency dedicated to refugees airlifted emergency aid into the Somali capital of Mogadishu on Monday, according to a spokesman. The flight left from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Monday morning with 31 metric tons (more than 34 U.S. tons) of emergency supplies and arrived in Mogadishu early Monday afternoon, said Andy Needham from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The aid flight comes just days after Islamic insurgents fled Mogadishu after a heated battle with government and African Union forces.

Together, Miller, Kuras and the actresses make Personal Velocity into an intricate, intimate and intelligent journey. 2. Personal Velocity seems tailor-made for art-house audiences. It still cradles that short-story essence...but takes it to a place that stretches just beyond the page. 3. ...works like a short story, or even poetry, in that it shifts our emotional center of gravity through a finely calibrated vernacular of gesture and language. 4. Comes across like an audio book to which photos have been rather unnecessarily added. 5. Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please, and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses, nor their characters, deserve. 6. The acting is uniformly good by the three women stars, Kyra Sedgwick, Parker Posey, and Fairuza Balk. 7. The whole comes across more like a Lifetime special than an insightful examination of the women's lives. 8. The whole film has this sneaky feel to it %u2013 as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product. 9.

Emmet Walsh as various images of the Texas landscape are shown. The film then shifts to a conversation between Abby (Frances McDormand) and Ray (John Getz) in a car as it drives through a heavy downpour at night. They seem to be discussing Abby's bad marriage and Ray indicates that he's driving her to Houston. But instead of driving Abby to Houston, Ray drives to a motel and they have sex. We later find out that Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya), who owns a Texas bar, has suspected Abby's affair with Ray, one of his bartenders, so he hires private detective Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) to take photos of them. When Visser reports back to Marty, he teases him about being cuckolded. The morning after their tryst, Marty makes a silent phone call to Ray and Abby. The following day Ray goes to the bar to collect his earnings, two weeks worth of work, but instead confronts Marty and quits his job. Marty threatens Ray's life and advises him not to trust Abby, that she will one day tell him she \\"hasn't done anything funny\\" and he won't believe her. Marty then hires Visser to kill the couple. Visser suggests he take a fishing trip to Corpus Christi to establish an alibi. He then breaks into Ray's home, steals Abby's gun, and photographs the sleeping couple through the bedroom window. Visser presents an edited photo of their fake corpses to Marty, who dumps four dead fish on his desk. Marty goes to the bathroom to vomit, then opens the safe to give Visser his 10,000 fee. Visser then shoots Marty with Abby's gun in a double cross, leaving her gun at the scene as evidence that she killed Marty. But he accidentally leaves his cigarette lighter and does not realize that Marty has stolen one of the incriminating photographs and locked it in the safe.

And I was wondering How would Jordan feel as a result?","output":"Jordan would likely feel a mix of emotions as a result of being called up to the stage by Sasha. Some possible feelings could include: 1. Nervousness or anxiety: Being called up to the stage and put on the spot, especially in front of an audience, can be nerve-wracking for many people. Jordan might feel his heart racing and palms sweating as he anticipates what comes next. 2. Excitement: Being singled out and acknowledged by Sasha could be very exciting for Jordan, especially if he admires or respects Sasha. This moment could be one he had dreamed of or hoped for, and now it is becoming a reality. 3. Curiosity: Depending on the context, Jordan might be curious about why Sasha called him up to the stage. Is it for an award? To discuss a topic? To participate in an activity? This sense of curiosity will likely grow the closer he gets to the stage. 4. Gratitude: If Jordan perceives this as a positive experience, he could feel grateful for the opportunity to be in the spotlight or to engage with Sasha in a more direct way. 5. Fear: In some cases, fear might be part of Jordan's emotional response. He could worry about making a mistake, saying the wrong thing, or embarrassing himself in front of Sasha and the audience.

Article:","output":"Title: Debbie Harry's Voice Stands Out in a World of Synth-Rock Hey kids, you know sometimes your mom tells you not to throw too much stuff at the wall and make a mess? Well, in the world of music, some artists like to mix different sounds and styles to create exciting new songs. But, just like throwing stuff at a wall, this way of making music can sometimes become a bit too messy. There's a type of music called synth-rock, which is really interesting because it uses special electronic keyboards that can make all kinds of sounds, like a robot singing or outer space noises. But, when musicians add too many of these sounds, it can feel theatrically heavy-handed. Theatrically heavy-handed means that it can sound a bit like a very dramatic play, with lots of things happening at the same time, which might be confusing for our ears. Thankfully, we have talented singers like Debbie Harry, who has a very special gift: her voice is sharply sculpted, which means she can sing really well and clearly. Even when there's a lot of other stuff happening in the music, her voice shines like a beautiful gemstone. So, even in a world of synth-rock where things might feel like too much sometimes, it's really nice to hear the beautiful voice of Debbie Harry. Her voice's outstanding quality reminds us that sometimes, simple and clear is better than messy and confusing.

Sometimes they can even add to the scene. But this one was bad, really bad. Agent is busy hunting for baddies. Finishes questioning one naughty person who climbs in his Ford F150 and speeds off. So far, so good - it is the sort of vehicle a country-living billionaire bad-guy would drive. The agent then pulls out her phone and… Move to close up of phone screen showing Ford app already loaded (and screen unlocked!). Agent slowly moves finger to app. Does something. Pause as app does fancy graphics. Cut to car interior. Shot of dash, showing Ford logo on steering wheel. It’s bright blue - are they not normally grey or more subtle? Pause for a second… Zoom in on dash. Dash light up. Car starts. Show pretty dash lights for a second or so. Cut to agent Agent walks to car, gets in drives off. Lingering shot of rear of car. It was just so clumsy. Massive halt to the flow of the scene to show it. In most films you never see anyone starting cars, putting on seatbelts or similar unless this is part of the plot because it’s unnecessary and not interesting to watch. I sort of expected the remote start function to have some sort of relevance later… but no, it was totally ignored. Added to that: There was no password or security on her phone - and this is an agent investigating super secret stuff. If you don’t show her unlocking the phone, why show her lovingly prodding the app? They are as relevant. She unlocked and started the car while she was 20–30 paces away, on the grounds of a suspect ranch. Someone could easily have jumped in the car. Not very security conscious. Question: Why did the dash light up and the pretty dash lights showed for a second or so? Options: A. because there was no password B. because the agent walked to the car C. because the car started D. not enough information === The correct answer is The answer is:","output":"C. because the car started. The reason the dash light up and the pretty dash lights showed for a second or so is because the car started. In the scene described, the agent used the Ford app on her phone to remotely start the vehicle. This action, in turn, initiated the dashboard lights and other vehicle systems, preparing the car for the agent to drive it. The display of colorful dash lights is a common feature in modern vehicles upon starting up, and it is an indicator that the car is functioning properly and is ready for use. The other options presented in the question do not directly relate to the dash lighting up: A. The absence of a password on the agent's phone does raise concerns about security and the authenticity of the scene. However, this fact is irrelevant to the dash lights coming on when the car starts. B. The agent walking towards the car does not specifically cause the dash lights to turn on. It might show her intention to use the vehicle, but the act of the car starting is the primary cause for the lights to illuminate. D. There is sufficient information provided to conclude that the car starting is the reason for the dash lights turning on in this situation. The detailed description of the scene allows the reader to understand the relationship between the agent using the Ford app and the car's lights activating. It is essential to remember that product placements could sometimes disrupt the natural flow of a scene, but they serve a purpose in financing and promoting both the product and the movie or TV show. In this case, the Ford app and the Ford F150 were showcased through the agent's interactions, but it might have come across as clumsy or forced to the viewer."},{"instruction":"Short movie review: he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time .

The average person spends 4 days in jail before trial and then spends half of a 2-week sentence. How many combined weeks of jail time are there? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Let's break this problem down step by step. 1. Number of arrests per city: Since there are 10 arrests per day in each city and the protests last 30 days, we can calculate the total number of arrests in one city: 10 arrests per day * 30 days = 300 arrests in one city 2. Arrests across all cities: There are 21 cities involved, so we can find the total number of arrests across all cities: 300 arrests per city * 21 cities = 6300 total arrests 3. Jail time before trial: Each person spends 4 days in jail before trial. So, we can find the combined days in jail before the trial for all arrested people: 6300 total arrests * 4 days in jail = 25200 days in jail before trial 4. After-trial jail time: The average person spends half of a 2-week (14-day) sentence, which means 7 days in jail after the trial. So, we calculate the combined days in jail after trial for all arrested people: 6300 total arrests * 7 days in jail = 44,100 days in jail after trial 5. Total combined jail time: To find the total combined jail time, we sum up the days before and after the trial: 25200 days (before trial) + 44100 days (after trial) = 69,300 days 6. Convert days to weeks: To convert the total jail time into weeks, we divide the total number of days by 7 (days per week): 69300 days / 7 days per week = 9900 weeks So, there are a total of 9,900 combined weeks of jail time in this situation."},{"instruction":"See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: i've got a big Oldsmobile that i pull it with when i Sentence 2: I pull my big Oldsmobile with it.

They are working in the sand. Hypothesis: \\"Two men are working on a beach.\\" This hypothesis states that: 1. There are two men. 2. They are working on a beach. Now let's compare the information: 1. Both statements mention two men, so this part is consistent. 2. The premise specifically mentions that the men appear to be construction workers. The hypothesis does not mention this, but, it is not contradictory to it, so we can overlook this part. 3. The key difference here is the location. The premise states that the men are working \\"in the sand,\\" while the hypothesis states they are working \\"on a beach.\\" While it is true that beaches often have sand, working in sand does not automatically mean they are working on a beach. There could be other locations with sand, such as a construction site with piles of sand, or a sandbox in a playground. So, the hypothesis cannot be entirely confirmed based on the given premise.

However, as of the 2020/2021 season, they're not in the top-tier professional football league in Spain (La Liga Santander or Primera Division), but compete in lower divisions due to recent relegations. Still, they're one of the most historically significant teams hailing from a city on the Spain's west coast. Deportivo La Coruña is based in the city of A Coruña in Galicia, an autonomous community in northwestern Spain. The city is situated along the Atlantic coastline. Established in 1906, Deportivo La Coruña has a rich football history. They are recognized for their passionate fans and the unique football culture in Galicia. Deportivo La Coruña's home games take place at the Estadio Riazor, which is one of the iconic sea-side stadiums in Spain. It's known for its riveting atmosphere, especially during local derbies. The proximity of their stadium to the Atlantic Ocean is a physical manifestation of their location on the country's west coast. In their prime, Deportivo was a football powerhouse and frequently competed in the top tier of Spanish football. They broke the usual dominance of Real Madrid and Barcelona on Spanish football when they won their first and only La Liga title during the 1999-2000 season. They also won the Copa del Rey twice in 1995 and 2002 and were runners-up in the UEFA Champions League during the 2003-2004 season. Prominent football figures such as Roy Makaay, Bebeto, and Djalminha, among others, have graced the field wearing Deportivo's blue and white stripes. Since the late 2000s, the club has frequently switched between La Liga and Segunda Division, dealing with numerous financial issues. Despite these setbacks, Deportivo remains a symbol of football on the west coast of Spain and continues to influence the local culture of A Coruña. A fervent desire to see them return to their previous successes runs high among their loyal fan base and the local community. Thus, even though currently not in La Liga's top tier, the football team that represents a city on the west coast of Spain is Deportivo La Coruña."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: when is rose bowl game in 2012 I found the following answer on Google: The Rose Bowl stadium capacity is listed at approximately 91,000.

As a frequent customer of numerous local establishments, I must stress that my experience at Tasty Town Restaurant has been nothing short of abysmal. With great reluctance, I award this establishment a mere one-star rating, and I cannot dissuade potential customers vehemently enough from choosing to dine here. From the outset, the ambiance of the restaurant was off-putting, setting the stage for an unfortunate experience. The lighting was so dim that finding our way to the table was challenging, and the earsplitting music made it impossible to have meaningful conversation. Furthermore, the disorderly arrangement of the furniture and poorly-executed theme seemed to be a reflection of Tasty Town's poor management. Moving on to the service, the staff showed little regard for demonstrating anything resembling attentiveness or professionalism. We waited nearly 30 minutes to be greeted and offered water, and during this time, our server was noticeably absent from her duties. When she finally appeared to take our orders, she seemed disinterested, impatient, and unapologetic for her tardiness. As the evening progressed, our disappointment with Tasty Town only intensified. The food, which was disproportionately expensive considering the lackluster quality, took an inordinate amount of time to be delivered to our table. When the dishes did arrive, they were of an embarrassingly low standard. The presentation was sloppy, and the food portions were comically inadequate. To elaborate, my entrée of shrimp scampi was unpalatably bland, with a meager 5-count of shrimp swimming in a pool of what appeared to be undrained, thawing liquid. The side of garlic bread, which was soggy and overcooked, did little to improve my meal. My partner ordered the filet mignon, and upon receiving a painfully thin, overcooked piece of meat, was left wondering whether the chef had ever laid eyes on a proper cut of filet prior to this evening. Regrettably, even the dessert course did not salvage our experience. Our shared slice of chocolate cake was dry, crumbly, and tasted as if it had been prepared days in advance. Additionally, the garnish - seemingly an afterthought - appeared hastily tossed onto the plate, doing nothing to enhance or redeem the presentation. Besides these disappointing aspects, the restaurant's overall cleanliness left much to be desired. The restroom facilities were in dire need of maintenance, and the table surfaces were sticky, indicating a lack of diligence by the cleaning staff. In conclusion, Tasty Town Restaurant has proven itself a catastrophic failure. From the deplorable ambiance and appalling service to the substandard food and lack of cleanliness, the establishment misses every mark. I urge potential patrons to consider the vast array of superior dining options available, rather than subjecting themselves to the calamity of an evening at Tasty Town. I shall, without hesitation, never return to this woeful establishment."},{"instruction":"Lionel Andres Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic Marche region of Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \\"Leo\\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matias, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. As Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition. In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying Jose Altafini's record from the 1962-63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Muller to be top scorer in four campaigns. Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of Cesar Rodriguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada. Despite Messi's individual form, Barcelona's four-year cycle of success under Guardiola - one of the greatest eras in the club's history - drew to an end. Although Barcelona won the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao on 25 May, its 14th title of that period, the team had lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Chelsea, with Messi sending a crucial second-leg penalty kick against the crossbar. In Barca's last home league match on 5 May, against Espanyol, Messi scored all four goals before approaching the bench to embrace Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager. He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, an all-time La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed Gerd Muller's 67 goals in the 1972-73 Bundesliga season, making him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football. Under manager Tito Vilanova, who had first coached him aged 14 at La Masia, Messi helped the club achieve its best-ever start to a La Liga season during the second half of 2012, amassing 55 points by the competition's midway point, a record in Spanish football. A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi break two longstanding records: he surpassed Cesar Rodriguez's record of 190 league goals, becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and Gerd Muller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year, overtaking his 85 goals scored in 1972 for Bayern Munich and Germany. Messi sent Muller a number 10 Barcelona shirt, signed \\"with respect and admiration\\", after breaking his 40-year record. At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina. Although FIFA did not acknowledge the achievement, citing verifiability issues, he received the Guinness World Records title for most goals scored in a calendar year. As the odds-on favourite, Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times. who was their coach?","output":"The coach mentioned in the provided text is Tito Vilanova, who coached Lionel Messi at La Masia when Messi was 14 years old and later became the manager of FC Barcelona."},{"instruction":"Virgil Virgil is traditionally ranked as one of Rome's greatest poets.

When he was leaving, Sam said, \\"Please don't tell Jason about it.\\" \\"Well...Well...OK,\\" Mr Lee replied. Months later when Jason's wounds healed , Sam was still very sick. He couldn't see or walk. He could do nothing but stay in his wheelchair all day long. At first, Jason stayed with him for a few days. But days later, Jason thought it boring to spend time with a disabled man like Sam. So he went to see Sam less and less. He made new friends. From then on, he didn't go to visit Sam any more. Sam didn't have any family or friends except Jason. He felt very sad. Things went from bad to worse. Sam died a year later. When Jason came, Mr Lee gave him a letter from Sam. In the letter Sam said, \\"Dear Jason, I am disabled. But I want you to be a healthy man. So I gave my eyes to you so that you can enjoy life as a healthy man. Now you have new friends. I'm glad to see that you are as healthy and happy as usual. I'm glad you live a happy life. You are always my best friend... Sam\\". When he finished reading the letter, Mr Lee said, \\"I have promised that I will keep this a secret until Sam is gone. Now you know it.\\" Jason stood there like a stone. Tears ran down his face.

Unknown to the world, Raphael is a retired archangel who has been living among humans for centuries. A chain of seemingly supernatural incidents forces Raphael to confront his past and protect the town from descending into chaos. Act 1: We are introduced to Serenity Hollow, a small, peaceful, and idyllic town where people live in harmony. The town is filled with various interesting characters, including the protagonist, a mysterious man named Raphael, who runs a local antique store and is beloved by the community. However, peace in the town is disturbed by a series of inexplicable events - sudden deaths, unnatural disasters, and demonic possessions. Just as these events intensify, a beautiful but enigmatic woman named Lilith crosses paths with Raphael, revealing that she is an agent of Satan sent to create havoc in the town. Act 2: Raphael, now revealed to be a powerful and renegade archangel who retired from heaven's service centuries ago, realizes that these incidents are not random but actually part of a much greater scheme carried out by Satan. He learns that Satan seeks to regain control over Earth with a sacred artifact buried beneath Serenity Hollow, intending to use it as a direct weapon against humanity and angels alike. As Raphael and Lilith's relationship deepens, Lilith starts to question her allegiance to Satan, torn between her loyalty to the underworld and her newfound love for Raphael. Simultaneously, we see the town's people band together, unknowingly tapping into their hidden potential and powers to protect their town from demonic forces orchestrated by Satan. Act 3: In the climactic third act, Raphael recruits Lilith to help save Serenity Hollow, and the two join forces with the town's people to locate and destroy the artifact before Satan can wield its power. Through a series of intense battles against demons and other supernatural enemies, they manage to disrupt the dark ritual surrounding the artifact. The final confrontation takes place in a hidden underground cavern where the artifact is located, just as Satan is about to unleash its power. During the epic battle, Raphael and Lilith ultimately undermine Satan's plan, and with the strength of their combined supernatural abilities, they manage to defeat him. In the final moments, we see Satan screaming in defeat, his plans shattered and powers diminished, before he is dragged back to the underworld. Serenity Hollow returns to peace and is forever changed by the knowledge that angels and demons walk among them. Epilogue: Having saved Serenity Hollow and defeated Satan, Raphael and Lilith make the tough decision to leave the town behind, seeking redemption for their past and exploring the world together. Their love echoes through eternity and serves as a reminder that even the darkest of foes can be defeated with the power of love and hope."},{"instruction":"Build a movie plot around this: What caused Brent's life and career to take a turn for the worse? he gets into a serious car accident in which his right eye is gouged out A:","output":"Title: Shattered Vision Genre: Drama/Thriller Plot Outline: Brent Stevens, a charismatic and ambitious young architect, is on the brink of ultimate success as he prepares for the most significant project of his career.

Despite the increasing dangers of working in the region, despite the many journalists who have been kidnapped or are still missing, and despite dreading this news, it has taken us all by surprise and we are deeply, deeply shocked. Freelance journalists, photographers and video journalists have always played a vital role in newsgathering, and their contribution today is more important than ever. They make a crucial contribution to the free flow of information that is an essential part of a democratic society and fully deserve our support and protection. Our Trust works with freelancers on a daily basis -- helping them, helping their families, and sometimes working with them to help other freelancers. And James was one of these. We worked with him, helping him financially as he and his colleagues searched for missing colleagues in Syria. We stayed in touch. James' kidnap and death is yet another tragic reminder of the very real dangers facing journalists today. Over the past two years, around 70 journalists have been killed covering the conflict in Syria, and a further 20 journalists currently remain missing, including freelancer Austin Tice. The Committee to Protect Journalists say that the last two years have been the most dangerous for journalists on record, with 174 confirmed deaths since 2012. Not only this, but threats, intimidation, assaults and kidnappings are becoming every day challenges for journalists working around the world. Reuters columnist David Rohde writes: \\"Syria today is the scene of the single largest wave of kidnappings in modern journalism, more than in Iraq during the 2000s or Lebanon during the 1980s.\\" These are terrible facts. So, what of the freelancers? Who negotiates for them? Who sends in security consultants to try and get them out? Who helps their families? Freelance journalists like James often work alone without the resources and support of large news organizations behind them -- they are always the most vulnerable to these dangers. The Rory Peck Trust has been supporting and assisting freelancers for almost two decades, and we've never seen a demand for our assistance like this before. It's not just freelancers travelling to conflict zones who are at risk. The majority of newsgatherers killed each year are journalists working in their own countries. Freelance photographers, fixers and camera operators covering and reporting on conflicts that are affecting their own communities are often the most vulnerable. They're unable to leave areas when it becomes too dangerous, or when their reporting is exposed, and are frequently threatened, attacked and accused of being traitors for working with international news organizations. Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors. So, how to protect freelancers? How to help them work securely? Our organization gives financial and other practical support to freelancers in trouble. We offer online resources on safety & security for those reporting from dangerous environments, and run a Training Fund that provides bursaries for freelancers to enable them to undergo hostile environments training before travelling to a conflict zone. This training can teach freelancers how to assess risk and spot danger, handle a crisis, support others and give vital first aid. The right training can save lives. Although our focus is specifically on freelancers, we are only one of the many organizations that exist to support journalists worldwide. Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders and IFJ all have security guides that can help freelancers be more prepared in situations of crisis. The International News Safety Institute offers up-to-date information about the security situation on the ground for journalists, and RISC offers vital first-aid training. There's no question that conflict journalism has always been a dangerous occupation -- and how very wrong that is! So when we talk about protection, when we talk about security, we are talking about every sector of the news industry, whether news employers, staff or freelancers. In this brutal new world, everyone must be prepared to take responsibility -- for themselves and for others. James Foley was a freelancer in the truest and most honorable sense -- a talented journalist and an exceptional human being. Our thoughts are with his family at this tragic time, and with the families of all other journalists currently being held in Syria. Highlights:","output":"1. James Foley, a freelance journalist, was sadly killed by bad people in Syria after they kept him for 21 months. 2.

UPDATED:. 20:26 EST, 25 January 2014. A spokeswoman for a Texas hospital says it won't say on Saturday whether it plans to appeal a judge's order to take a pregnant brain-dead woman off of life support. J.R. Labbe says John Peter Smith Hospital won't announce a decision Saturday but she didn't say when it might. A judge gave the Fort Worth hospital until Monday at 5 p.m. to comply with his ruling to remove Marlise Munoz from life support, which her husband Erick Munoz says she would have wanted. This is a photo of Munoz with her first baby. She was pregnant with her second when she collapsed. She was 14 weeks pregnant when her husband found her unconscious Nov. 26, possibly due to a blood clot. The hospital says it has a legal duty to protect the fetus and is considering an appeal. John Peter Smith Hospital spokeswoman J.R. Labbe said 'discussions are ongoing' as administrators weigh the order issued a day earlier by Judge R. H. Wallace Jr. The hospital is owned by Tarrant County and is being represented in the contentious case by the DA's office. The judge's ruling could give Erick Munoz a long-awaited chance to bury his wife and move forward to care for their son and his relatives. It would also mean the fetus would never be born. Both the hospital and the family agree that Marlise Munoz meets the criteria to be considered brain-dead - which means she is dead both medically and under Texas law - and that the fetus could not be born alive this early in pregnancy. But while the hospital says it's obligated to protect the fetus, Munoz contends his wife would not have wanted to be kept in this condition. And his attorneys have said medical records show the fetus is 'distinctly abnormal.' The case has raised questions about end-of-life care and whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus. It also has gripped attention on both sides of the abortion debate, with anti-abortion groups arguing Munoz's fetus deserves a chance to be born. Several anti-abortion advocates attended Friday's hearing. Erik Munoz says his wife wouldn't have wanted to keep living in her condition. Hospital officials have said they were bound by the Texas Advance Directives Act, which prohibits withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from a pregnant patient. But in his brief ruling, Wallace said that 'Mrs. Munoz is dead,' meaning that the hospital was misapplying the law. The ruling did not mention the fetus. The hospital has not pronounced her dead and has continued to treat her over the objections of both Erick Munoz and her parents, who sat together in court Friday. Larry Thompson, a state's attorney representing the public hospital, told the judge Friday that the hospital recognized the Munoz family's pain and rights, but said it had a greater legal responsibility to protect the fetus. 'There is a life involved, and the life is the unborn child,' Thompson said. As Wallace gave his ruling, Erick Munoz embraced his wife's parents and one of his attorneys. Munoz declined to comment as he left court Friday. But he told The Associated Press earlier this month, in a phone interview sitting in the hospital room, that he and his wife were both paramedics who knew they didn't want to stay on life support this way. The Couple is pictured here with their first son Matteo. The fetus Munoz is currently carrying has been deemed 'abnormal' Munoz described in a signed affidavit filed Thursday what it was like to see her now: her glassy, 'soulless' eyes; and the smell of her perfume replaced by what he knows to be the smell of death. He said he's tried to hold her hand but can't. 'Her limbs have become so stiff and rigid due to her deteriorating condition that now, when I move her hands, her bones crack, and her legs are nothing more than dead weight,' Munoz said. Jessica Hall Janicek and Heather King, Erick Munoz's attorneys, accused the hospital of conducting a 'science experiment' and warned of the dangerous precedent her case could set, raising the specter of special ICUs for brain-dead women carrying babies. 'There is an infant, and a dead person serving as a dysfunctional incubator,' King told the judge. King and Janicek did not say what they would do next, pending a potential appeal by the hospital, and they didn't respond to phone messages left for them Saturday. Erick Munoz filed suit against John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas to force the hospital to remove the life support keeping his pregnant brain dead wife alive. The hospital said in a statement that it 'appreciates the potential impact of the consequences of the order on all parties involved\\" and was deciding whether to appeal. The hospital argued in a court filing Thursday that there was little evidence of what state lawmakers and courts thought of this issue, but recent laws passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature to restrict abortion made it clear that they wanted to preserve a fetus' rights. The Advance Directives Act 'must convey legislative intent to protect the unborn child, 'the hospital said in its filing. 'Otherwise the Legislature would have simply allowed a pregnant patient to decide to let her life, and the life of her unborn child, end.' Not much is known about fetal survival when mothers suffer brain death during pregnancy. German doctors who searched for such cases found 30 of them in nearly 30 years, according to an article published in the journal BMC Medicine in 2010. Those mothers were further along in pregnancy - 22 weeks on average - when brain death occurred than in the Texas case. Birth results were available for 19 cases. In 12, a viable child was born. Follow-up results were available for six, all of whom developed normally. Afton Brown was among a few showing support for Erick Munoz and his family outside the Tim Curry Criminal Justice Center in Fort Worth, Texas on Friday, Jan. 24, 2014.

His work is influential on most modern Jewish militant and far right-wing political groups. Kahane spent years reaching out to Jews through published works, weekly articles, speeches, and debates on college campuses and in synagogues throughout the United States, and appearances on various televised programs and radio shows. Martin David Kahane was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1932 to an Orthodox Jewish family. His father, Yechezkel (Charles) Kahane, the author of the \\"Torah Yesharah\\", studied at Polish and Czech yeshivas, was involved in the Revisionist Zionist movement, and was a close friend of Ze'ev Jabotinsky. As a teenager, Kahane became an ardent admirer of Ze'ev Jabotinsky and Peter Bergson, who were frequent guests in his parents' home, and he joined the Betar (Brit Trumpeldor) youth wing of Revisionist Zionism. He was active in protests against Ernest Bevin, the British Foreign Secretary who maintained restrictions on the immigration of Jews (even Nazi death camp survivors) to Palestine after the end of the Second World War. In 1947, Kahane was arrested for throwing eggs and tomatoes at Bevin, as the latter disembarked at Pier 84 on a visit to New York. A photo of the arrest appeared in the New York Daily News. In 1954, he became the mazkir (director) of Greater New York City's sixteen Bnei Akiva chapters. Kahane's formal education included elementary school at the Yeshiva of Flatbush, and he attended high school at both Abraham Lincoln H.S. and the Brooklyn Talmudical Academy. Kahane received his rabbinical ordination from the Mir Yeshiva in Brooklyn, where he was especially admired by the head, Rabbi Abraham Kalmanowitz, and he began going by his Hebrew name, Meir. He was fully conversant in the Tanakh (Jewish Bible), the Talmud, the Midrash, and Jewish law.

Active since 1948, in seventy years of his artistic career Jodorowsky has experienced it in almost all creative forms: writer (in his five facets: novelist, storyteller, poet, playwright and essayist), film director and producer, actor of cinema and theatre, playwright, theatre director, screenwriter, film editor, comics writer, musician, soundtrack composer, philosopher, puppeteer, mime, psychologist and psychoanalyst, draughtsman, painter, eventually sculptor and spiritual guru. Best known for his avant-garde films, he has been \\"venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts\\" for his work which \\"is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation\\". Born to Jewish-Ukrainian parents in Chile, Jodorowsky experienced an unhappy and alienated childhood, and so immersed himself in reading and writing poetry. In 2000, Jodorowsky won the Jack Smith Lifetime Achievement Award from the Chicago Underground Film Festival (CUFF). Jodorowsky attended the festival and his films were shown, including El Topo and The Holy Mountain, which at the time had grey legal status. According to festival director Bryan Wendorf, it was an open question of whether CUFF would be allowed to show both films, or whether the police would show up and shut the festival down. Until 2007, Fando y Lis and Santa Sangre were the only Jodorowsky works available on DVD. Neither El Topo nor The Holy Mountain were available on videocassette or DVD in the United States or the United Kingdom, due to ownership disputes with distributor Allen Klein. After settlement of the dispute in 2004, however, plans to re-release Jodorowsky's films were announced by ABKCO Films. On 19 January 2007, the website, announced that on 1 May 2007, Anchor Bay released a box set including El Topo, The Holy Mountain, and Fando y Lis. A limited edition of the set includes both the El Topo and The Holy Mountain soundtracks. And, in early February 2007, Tartan Video announced its 14 May 2007, release date for the UK PAL DVD editions of El Topo, The Holy Mountain, and the six-disc box set which, alongside the aforementioned feature films, includes the two soundtrack CDs, as well as separate DVD editions of Jodorowsky's 1968 debut feature Fando y Lis (with his 1957 short La cravate a.k.a. Les tetes interverties, included as an extra) and the 1994 feature-length documentary La constellation Jodorowsky. Notably, Fando y Lis and La cravate were digitally restored extensively and remastered in London during late 2006, thus providing the perfect complement to the quality restoration work undertaken on El Topo and The Holy Mountain in the States by Abkco, and ensuring that the presentation of Fando y Lis is a significant improvement over the 2001 Fantoma DVD edition. Prior to the availability of these legitimate releases, only inferior quality, optically censored, bootleg copies of both El Topo and The Holy Mountain have been circulated on the Internet and on DVD. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Jodorowsky attempted to make a sequel to El Topo, called at different times The Sons of El Topo and Abel Cain, but could not find investors for the project. In an interview with Premiere Magazine, Jodorowsky said he intended his next project to be a gangster film called King Shot. In an interview with The Guardian newspaper in November 2009, however, Jodorowsky revealed that he was unable to find the funds to make King Shot, and instead would be entering preparations on Sons of El Topo, for which he claimed to have signed a contract with \\"some Russian producers\\". In 2010, the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City staged the first American cinema retrospective of Alejandro Jodorowsky entitled Blood into Gold: The Cinematic Alchemy of Alejandro Jodorowsky. Jodorowsky would attend the retrospective and hold a master class on art as a way of transformation. This retrospective would inspire the museum MOMA PS1 to present the exhibition Alejandro Jodorowsky: The Holy Mountain in 2011. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did this mean","output":"Alejandro Jodorowsky Prullansky is a talented man from Chile who also has French nationality. He was born on February 17, 1929, and he has done many artistic things in his life, like making movies, writing stories and poems, acting, directing plays, making music, and even drawing and painting. His movies are special and can sometimes surprise people with strange pictures and ideas about religion and other things. His parents were originally from Ukraine, and he had a difficult childhood, so he spent a lot of time reading and writing. In 2000, Alejandro Jodorowsky was given a special award at the Chicago Underground Film Festival (CUFF) for all the great work he did throughout his life. Some of his movies were shown there, even though there were some legal problems about them at that time. Later in 2007, more of his movies were released on DVDs, which made it easier for people to watch them at home. During the years, Alejandro Jodorowsky also tried to make a new movie that would be a sequel to an older movie called \\"El Topo,\\" but he couldn't find enough money for it. He also wanted to make a different movie about gangsters, but he couldn't find enough money for that one either. However, in 2009 he said he was going to make the sequel to \\"El Topo\\" with the help of some producers from Russia. In 2010 and 2011, museums in New York City celebrated his amazing work through exhibitions and movie screenings. To sum it up, Alejandro Jodorowsky is a very talented man who makes special movies and has done many different artistic things in his life. Even though sometimes he faced challenges, his work is still getting celebrated and admired by people around the world."},{"instruction":"In February 1916 the Germans attacked French defensive positions at the Battle of Verdun, lasting until December 1916. The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 to 975,000 casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice. The Battle of the Somme was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916. The opening day of the offensive was the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army some 420,000 casualties. The French suffered another estimated 200,000 casualties and the Germans an estimated 500,000. Gun fire wasn't the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides.

Movie plot title: Picnic at Hanging Rock Movie plot: At Appleyard College, a girls' private school, near the town of Woodend, Victoria, Australia, the students are dressing on the morning of St. Valentine's Day, 1900. Miranda (Anne-Louise Lambert), Irma (Karen Robson), Marion (Jane Vallis), Rosamund (Ingrid Mason), waifish Sara (Margaret Nelson), and outsider Edith (Christine Schuler) read poetry and Valentine's Day cards. The group prepares for a picnic to a local geological formation known as Hanging Rock, accompanied by the mathematics mistress Miss Greta McCraw (Vivean Gray) and the young and beautiful Mlle. de Poitiers (Helen Morse). On the authority of the stern headmistress Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts), jittery teacher Miss Lumley (Kirsty Child) advises Sara that she is not allowed to attend. Driven by buggy operator Ben Hussey (Martin Vaughan), the party pass through and arrive at the Rock by mid-afternoon. After a meal, Mr. Hussey notes his watch has stopped at the stroke of twelve, as has the watch of Miss McCraw. With permission from Mlle. de Poitiers, Miranda, Marion and Irma decide to explore Hanging Rock and take measurements, with Edith allowed to follow. The group is observed several minutes later by a young Englishman, Michael Fitzhubert (Dominic Guard), who is lunching at the Rock with his uncle Colonel Fitzhubert (Peter Collingwood), aunt Mrs. Fitzhubert (Olga Dickie), and valet Albert (John Jarratt). At the top of Hanging Rock, the group lies on the ground, apparently dazed by the sun. Miss McCraw, still at the base of the Rock, stares up. Miranda, Marion, and Irma awake and move, as if in a dream, into a recess in the rock face. Edith screams and flees down the Rock. The distraught and hysterical party eventually returns to the College, where Mlle. de Poitiers explains to Mrs. Appleyard that Miss McCraw has been left behind.

Miss McCraw was the mathematics mistress at Appleyard College who accompanied the girls during their picnic at the local geological formation known as Hanging Rock. During the exploration, Miranda, Marion, Irma, and Edith venture further into the rock formation, while Miss McCraw remains at the base of the rock. Miss McCraw's disappearance occurs simultaneously with the disappearances of Miranda, Irma, and Marion. A search party is launched to find the missing individuals, and it is during this search that Miss McCraw's body is discovered at the base of Hanging Rock. The movie's plot leaves many questions unanswered, creating a sense of mystery and intrigue surrounding the events that transpired at Hanging Rock.

The Greencards are an American progressive bluegrass band that formed in 2003 in Austin, Texas, and relocated in 2005 to Nashville, Tennessee. The band was founded by Englishman Eamon McLoughlin and Australians Kym Warner and Carol Young. The musicians originally performed in local Austin bars, and soon found increasing acclaim. They have released one independent album, Movin' On, in 2003, and two albums, Weather and Water and Viridian, on the Dualtone record label. Their fourth album, Fascination, was released on Sugar Hill in 2009. Their fifth album, The Brick Album (2011), was self-produced with the direct support of their fans. Pre-production donors were recognized with their names inscribed on the \\"bricks\\" that make up the cover art. Their debut album, Movin' On, was the recipient of local Texas awards and charted on Americana radio stations. Country Music Television named their follow-up Weather and Water as one of the ten best bluegrass albums of 2005, and The Greencards were invited to tour with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson in the same year. Viridian would go on to take the number one position on Billboard magazine's Bluegrass Music Chart, making the Greencards the first international band to do so. Viridian was a critically praised album, and was nominated for Best Country Album by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The track \\"Mucky the Duck\\" from Viridian was nominated as the Best Country Instrumental Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards.

With the increasing prevalence of vaping and e-cigarette usage among adolescents, this mission is now more critical than ever, as it seeks to protect the health and well-being of future generations. A Troubling Trend: The Rise of Teen Tobacco Use While significant progress has been made in reducing overall rates of tobacco consumption, this hard-won success is now under threat due to the rapid increase in teen smoking and vaping. Studies show that more than one in four American high school students are using e-cigarettes, a statistic that demonstrates the importance of immediate intervention to combat this alarming trend. The Clinton and State Officials' Plan of Attack To address the growing menace of teen tobacco consumption, Clinton and state officials are proposing the implementation of stricter measures to prevent access and exposure to these harmful substances. Some of the key steps outlined in this proposed plan are as follows: 1. Increasing the legal purchasing age for tobacco products: By raising the minimum age requirement for purchasing tobacco products to 21, state officials and Clinton believe that this will significantly reduce the availability of these products to minors. This move is expected to help curb the negative influence of peer pressure on underage smokers, as older friends will no longer be able to legally purchase cigarettes for their underage companions. 2. Enhanced enforcement of existing laws: There will be a renewed commitment to ensuring that retailers who sell tobacco products fully comply with existing laws and regulations. This includes stricter penalties for those found in violation of these laws. Additionally, there will be increased funding for law enforcement agencies to help with the surveillance and prosecution of illegal activities related to tobacco sales. 3. Expanded education initiatives: State officials and Clinton recognize that education and awareness are critical components in the fight against teen smoking. Educational campaigns targeted at minors will be ramped up to underscore the health risks associated with smoking, as well as effective strategies for quitting and avoiding tobacco products altogether. 4. Regulation of e-cigarette sales and advertisements: With e-cigarettes being a significant contributor to the rise in teen tobacco use, there will be a push for the implementation of stricter regulations on the sale and marketing of these products. This includes restricting the appeal of e-cigarettes to minors via marketing and advertising, as well as requiring retailers to obtain licenses for the sale of these nicotine delivery devices. Conclusion The collaboration between former President Clinton and state officials signals a new chapter in the battle against teen smoking. By implementing comprehensive, evidence-based strategies aimed at protecting the health of future generations, there is a renewed hope that the tide can be turned in the fight against teen tobacco use. However, this will require continued dedication and vigilance on behalf of parents, educators, and legislators alike to make a meaningful and lasting difference."},{"instruction":"Question: Accidents involving cars affect who?

Options: - aquarium - creek - pet store - playground - pond The answer is \\"aquarium\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"aquarium\\" because this option is the most fitting location for a goldfish and a colorful pebble to be found together. An aquarium is a transparent container typically constructed of glass or acrylic, which houses aquatic animals and plants. Goldfish, as common pet fish, are often kept inside aquariums filled with water and decorated with colorful pebbles, rocks, and other ornaments that provide both aesthetic appeal and enrichment for the fish. Here is a brief explanation of the other options: - Creek: While a creek, a small stream or a minor tributary of a river, could potentially have goldfish and colorful pebbles naturally occurring in the environment, it is less likely for the pebble to fall on a goldfish in the creek as they are constantly shifting and are not enclosed spaces like aquariums. - Pet store: It's possible to find a goldfish and colorful pebbles together in a pet store; however, goldfish are usually in a tank or aquarium setting within the store. So, while the pet store itself is not the specific location where the pebble would fall on the goldfish, the aquarium inside the pet store would be the accurate answer. - Playground: A playground is an outdoor area designated for children to play and typically contains recreational equipment like swings, slides, and jungle gyms. This setting is not relevant to goldfish or colorful pebbles, so it is not the appropriate answer. - Pond: Although a pond, a natural or man-made body of water, might have goldfish, it is less likely to contain colorful pebbles that are often associated with aquariums or decorative garden features. Unlike aquariums, ponds do not generally have a curated selection of pebbles and ornaments, making it less probable for a colorful pebble to fall on a goldfish in this environment. In conclusion, based on the context provided in the question, \\"aquarium\\" is the best answer as it is the most suitable location for a goldfish and a colorful pebble to be together, with the pebble falling on the goldfish."},{"instruction":"Marlene Brookes is a shirt-presser, a quiet, conscientious woman who has looked after Bay Street #39;s demanding clients for more than eight years.

Let's break it down: (a). Getting cash: To start a business, Jesse would indeed need to have capital. That money may come from their savings, loans, or from investors. This capital will be utilized in acquiring a physical space for their business (if applicable), purchasing necessary equipment or initial inventory, meeting legal expenses, and paying for the licenses and permits. (b). Advertise the business to get customers: Prior to opening the business, Jesse must have a solid marketing and advertising plan. This can be an online ad campaign, billboards, TV or radio ads, and even word-of-mouth marketing. They will need to understand their customer base and the best mediums to use in reaching them effectively. (c). Earn a promotion at their job: This is not a direct prerequisite to opening a business but it might help in two ways. One, if Jesse was able to earn a promotion, then it tells about their dedication, skills, leadership and this gives them self-confidence to run a business. Two, a promotion often comes with an increase in income, which Jesse could save and use as initial capital for the business. Apart from the mentioned points, there are other things Jesse would need to do: (d). Develop a Business Plan: This is typically the first step after deciding to start a business. It outlines the business goals and strategies for achieving them. (e). Register the Business: Jesse also needs to register their business with local or state authorities and get necessary permits and licenses. (f).

Crepe myrtles are ornamental trees or shrubs with long-lasting flowers that bloom in various colors, including white, pink, red, and purple, in the summer and autumn months. They are also known for their attractive peeling bark. These plants are often used as focal points in gardens and landscapes due to their natural beauty and the visual impact they create when in full bloom. The original statement emphasizes the need for consistent and dedicated attention, similar to nurturing a crepe myrtle tree, the growth of which requires proper care and timely maintenance. Crepe myrtles flourish when they are pruned, fertilized, watered, and exposed to an adequate amount of sunlight. Monitoring their growth and overall health is essential to ensuring they remain beautiful and vibrant. By likening the task at hand to watching crepe myrtle trees, the speaker is suggesting that there is a need for vigilance, sensitivity, and attention to detail. Just like with crepe myrtles, it is crucial to stay aware of any changes, potential problems, or developments related to the situation, and to take appropriate action to address these concerns. In the context of the speaker's metaphor, this means that the same attentiveness and care provided to the crepe myrtle tree should be translated to the task or situation at hand. In conclusion, the phrase \\"You are required to keep a steady eye like you would the crepe myrtle\\" is a colorful and poetic way to convey the importance of dedication, vigilance, and attentiveness in approaching a particular task or undertaking. This comparison stresses that one must give the same level of care and scrutiny to the situation as one would to the growth and wellbeing of a beautiful crepe myrtle tree. By doing so, the subject of attention is more likely to flourish and yield positive outcomes, just like the vibrant blooms of the crepe myrtle tree."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am testing my students' logic.

(A) more heat (B) less heat A:","output":"The answer your students should choose for this logic test is (B) less heat. The scenario describes Jerry and Ruby rubbing their hands together quickly, with Ruby being able to rub hers even faster. Ferry had no gloves on (bare skin), while Ruby was wearing slippery gloves. When we rub our hands together, we generate heat through friction. In this case, Ferry's bare skin rubbing against each other would create more friction than Ruby's slippery gloves. Since friction plays a significant role in heat generation, Ferry would create less heat than Ruby due to the reduced friction caused by the slippery gloves."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: The direction of the force of gravity is in a straight line between two objects. It is always attractive. Q: The direction of the force of gravity is in what direction? Choices: - staggered line - curved line - fragmented line - straight line A: A:","output":"The direction of the force of gravity is in a straight line between two objects. This means that gravity acts in a way that pulls objects directly towards one another along a straight path. Using the given choices for comparison: - Staggered line: Describes a path with a series of abrupt shifts or changes in direction. This does not suit the description of gravitational force, as its pull is continuous and in a single direction. - Curved line: Refers to a path that follows an arc or a curve from one point to another. This also does not match the description of gravitational force, because the force is directly between two objects, hence it cannot be curved. - Fragmented line: Implies a path consisting of separate, disconnected sections with possible gaps in between. This concept is incompatible with the continuous and uninterrupted nature of the force of gravity. Therefore, the appropriate answer, as stated in the provided paragraph, is a straight line. The direction of the force of gravity acts in a straight line between two objects, ensuring that each object is drawn directly towards one another without any curves or deviations in its path. This phenomenon is always attractive, seeking to bring the two objects closer together as the force acts between them."},{"instruction":"Stream of consciousness rationale: First, we need to determine how many feet Ian runs in a week. We begin this by multiplying the number of laps by the number of feet per lap, performing 5 * 100 = 500 feet per day. Since there are 5 days in the period being measured, this means Ian runs 500 * 5 = 2500 feet jogged. Since it takes 25 feet of jogging to burn a calorie, this means Ian burns 2500 / 25 = 100 calories burned jogging throughout the week. The question and answer pair are described below.","output":"Question: How many calories does Ian burn if he runs 5 laps of 100 feet each day for 5 days in a week, and he burns 1 calorie for every 25 feet jogged? Answer: Ian burns 100 calories in a week. Rationale: 1. Calculate the total number of feet Ian runs per day: 5 laps * 100 feet per lap = 500 feet per day. 2. Calculate the total number of feet Ian runs in a week (5 days): 500 feet per day * 5 days = 2,500 feet. 3.

Hope this helps but feel free to call or write with any questions or comments: A: The CFTC regulates futures contracts and certain kinds of option contracts. SP: What's a futures contract? A: It is a contract for the sale of a certain kind of commodity through a regulated exchange. SP: How is the contract different than a non-futures contract? A: Ahem, just for your information, we call the non-futures contracts forward or over the counter contracts. The big difference is that the forward contract does not must go to delivery while futures contracts do not. SP: I though the futures contracts went to delivery. I remember getting all messed up on the gas side with delivery of NYMEX futures gas at the Henry Hub, and what about those stories of a guys getting a load of soy beans dumped in their front yards? A: Well, er, yes they do sometimes go to delivery, but they are not really supposed to relatively few of them go to delivery. They are supposed to more frequently (actually the vast majority of the time) net out as financial transactions. It's that option of settling financially that distinguishes the futures contract. SP: Well lets get to the point, why are physical buy sells so bad? A: That's easy. Because they look like futures contracts. They are not intended to go to delivery. And if you are trading in futures contracts you are supposed to be doing it on a CFTC regulated exchange. SP: So what you are saying is that if we deliberately net out our physical deals and never intend to even try to schedule delivery under them we are trading in futures contracts and could be subject to regulation by the CFTC? A: You've got it. But it's even worse than that - federal law says that a futures contract which is not traded on a regulated exchange is illegal: not only could the CFTC come after you but your counterparties could use that law against you to get out of performing. So you can think of each contract like that as having written a free option. SP: Well how much physicality do we have to have to make it a forward contract? A: What do you mean? SP: Well, if we settled physically one day a month but financially the other 29 days, would we have a futures contract? A: Oh for Christ's sake I've had it.

The title, \\"Bait and switch!\\", immediately establishes a negative perception, suggesting that the seller intentionally misled the customer by promising one product but delivering another. The reviewer's experience, as described in the review, further accentuates the negative impression of the product. By stating that they received an older, generic, and outdated cable instead of the advertised StarTech ESATA3, the reviewer indicates their dissatisfaction with the product they received. This information is crucial because it demonstrates that the customer didn't receive a high-quality, state-of-the-art product as anticipated, but instead a subpar and dated item.

The hallmark symptom of AMD is a progressively developing blurred area near the very center of your vision, either in one eye or both. With time, the blurry central area can grow larger or you may develop dark spots that completely block out any images. On the other hand, peripheral vision is not affected by AMD. Objects in your central vision may not appear to be as bright as they used to be — colors can get dull. AMD affects only the central part of your vision because that's where the macula is located. The macula is in the center of the retina and needed for sharp vision of objects that are straight ahead. Another common symptom of AMD is strange visual distortions — objects may appear distorted in shape, or straight lines may look wavy, crooked or bent. When these symptoms develop, people may think they're hallucinating. Although other eye diseases cause blurriness, only macular disease (including AMD, cystoid macular edema, diabetic macular edema, and others) creates these types of visual distortions. Visual distortions associated with advanced stages of AMD make it difficult to drive, read and recognize faces. AMD often affects both eyes at the same time, but if only one is affected, it's difficult to notice visual changes because your good eye compensates for the affected eye. Another common symptom of progressive AMD is an increased difficulty adapting to low-light situations, such as dimly lit rooms, offices or restaurants. You might also feel the need for brighter light when reading books or doing work close to your face. If you find yourself or your partner turning on lights much more frequently than before, then it could be a sign of AMD. Correlated to seeing things more dimly is perceiving a decreased intensity or brightness of colors. The world tends to take on a darker and drabber look with AMD. AMD doesn't affect peripheral (side) vision, so it doesn't cause complete blindness — although people with advanced symptoms are often labelled as legally blind and not allowed to drive a car or operate heavy machinery. The cause of AMD is not clearly understood, but a number of risk factors have been noticed, such as: hereditary (genetic) link, advanced age, female gender, cigarette smoking, obesity, cardiovascular disease and Caucasian race (skin color). Most people with AMD have at least a couple if not most of these risk factors. In terms of age, AMD is most common in people older than 65 years. Smoking tobacco and being overweight, particularly if you're obese, puts you at much higher risk of AMD. These factors also increase your risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, which negatively affect the blood vessels of the eye.","output":"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye condition that primarily affects individuals aged 65 and older. It is characterized by a gradual deterioration of the central part of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for sharp vision of straight-ahead objects. The onset of AMD is usually slow and painless, making it challenging to detect in the early stages. The primary symptom of AMD is the development of a blurred area in the central field of vision, which may affect one or both eyes. Over time, this blurry area may expand or be accompanied by dark spots, obscuring the clarity of images. However, peripheral vision remains unaffected. As a result, objects in the central field of vision may become less bright, with colors appearing duller than before. AMD patients may also experience visual distortions, such as warped shapes or wavy lines, which can be mistaken for hallucinations. These distortions are exclusive to macular diseases like AMD, cystoid macular edema, and diabetic macular edema. Advanced stages of AMD can make everyday tasks like driving, reading, and recognizing faces difficult. Although AMD typically affects both eyes simultaneously, it may only affect one eye, with the unaffected eye compensating and masking the symptoms. Another symptom of progressive AMD is trouble adjusting to low-light situations or requiring brighter light for close-up tasks like reading. If an individual or their partner begins turning on lights more frequently, it could be a sign of AMD. AMD may also cause decreased color intensity or brightness, giving the world a darker and drabber appearance. While AMD doesn't affect peripheral vision and thus doesn't lead to complete blindness, people with advanced symptoms may be considered legally blind and restricted from activities such as driving or operating heavy machinery. The exact cause of AMD remains unclear, but several risk factors have been identified. These include genetic predisposition, advanced age, female gender, smoking, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and Caucasian race. AMD is most commonly found in people over 65 years old, while smoking and obesity significantly increase the risk of developing the condition. These factors also contribute to other health issues such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease, negatively impacting the blood vessels in the eye."},{"instruction":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

Glutathione, often referred to as the \\"master antioxidant,\\" is a naturally occurring tripeptide that consists of three amino acids: cysteine, glycine, and glutamine. It is found within the cells of our body and is an essential component in many biological processes. As an antioxidant, glutathione neutralizes free radicals, which are harmful molecules that can damage our body's cells and contribute to the development of various diseases and aging-related issues. Free radicals are a byproduct of normal body processes such as metabolism, but they can also be generated through exposure to pollution, radiation, stress, and other external factors. By combating free radicals, glutathione helps protect our cells from damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress. With increased glutathione levels, you may notice several improvements in your overall health and well-being: 1. Enhanced energy levels: Glutathione plays a crucial role in energy production within cells by supporting the function of the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell. Higher levels of glutathione may lead to more energy and improved physical endurance. 2. Improved immune system: Glutathione supports the immune system by neutralizing harmful substances, promoting the growth of healthy immune cells, and reducing inflammation. This can lead to fewer illnesses, faster recovery from infections, and overall better health. 3. Detoxification: Glutathione is essential for the liver and kidneys in detoxifying harmful substances. By supporting the elimination of toxins from the body, glutathione contributes to a healthier internal environment. 4. Better skin health: Since glutathione has anti-inflammatory and free-radical scavenging properties, it may help slow down the aging process and improve the appearance of the skin. This includes reduced fine lines and wrinkles, improved skin elasticity, and a brighter complexion. 5. Cognitive function and mood: Glutathione has been shown to improve cognitive function and reduce the symptoms of neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Additionally, it may contribute to better mental health by reducing oxidative stress in the brain and supporting optimal brain function. Boosting glutathione levels can be achieved through a combination of lifestyle changes, dietary intake of glutathione-rich foods, and supplementation. Incorporating a healthy diet with foods high in antioxidants like cruciferous vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds can help support your body's glutathione production. Exercise, proper sleep, and stress management are also crucial for maintaining optimal glutathione levels. It is important, however, to consult with a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet or supplementation regimen to ensure that they are safe and suited to your individual needs."},{"instruction":"pick from the following.

Only six current players made the playoffs with Washington and only two have won a postseason game for the franchise. The team was just 11-21 during coach Mike Shanahan's first two seasons. The 2011 Heisman Trophy winner landed in Washington in a trade that sent three first-round picks and a second-round selection to St. Louis. Shanahan named him the starter before the veterans reported in May, and the old-timers seem pleased to have the 22-year-old Griffin at the helm. \\"There's definitely a different feeling about this team,\\" said 37-year-old linebacker London Fletcher, who won a Super Bowl and two NFC titles with the Rams. \\"We know it's going to be a process. We're not going to expect (Robert) to be a top-five quarterback (right away). \\"He has a lot of notoriety and deservedly so because of what he accomplished at Baylor. He doesn't carry himself like I'm a Heisman winner, they traded all these picks for me, I'm better than you guys. So it's easy for guys to gravitate towards him for his demeanor.\\" Two-time Pro Bowl tight end Chris Cooley couldn't be more impressed with Griffin, who invited his pass-catchers to spend a couple of days with him in Waco, Texas, during the six weeks between the end of spring workouts and the start of camp. \\"No one treats him like a rookie,\\" Cooley said. \\"You can't. He's the starter for us. You have to treat him like a starting quarterback. There's nothing that he does that says, 'We should haze you.' He's been a real professional since the day he walked through the door. \\"I'm amazed every day by the way he handles it, his ability to run this offense. He's done a fantastic job. I can't imagine being suited more for the position he's in.\\" Running back Tim Hightower, part of a Super Bowl team in Arizona with quarterback Kurt Warner four years ago, likes what he sees from Griffin. But he doesn't want the rookie to feel compelled to try to singlehandedly turn around the Redskins. \\"He has a lot of expectations on him,\\" Hightower said. \\"As teammates, it's our responsibility to rise to the occasion, help his transition, take some of that focus, some of that pressure off him. \\"We're going to go as he goes.\\" Griffin, who competed in the hurdles in 2008 Olympic trials, can certainly go on the field. As a senior at Baylor, Griffin led the Bears to an Alamo Bowl victory while passing for 4,293 yards and 37 touchdowns and running for 699 yards and 10 scores. Fletcher compared Griffin to Philadelphia's dual threat quarterback Michael Vick. He said the rookie's speed will \\"shock\\" opposing defense especially when combined with his \\"rocket\\" arm. \\"He can make every throw, use his legs to extend a play,\\" Redskins three-time Pro Bowl cornerback DeAngelo Hall said. \\"You feel like, 'We got him,' and the play's still going on. He brings that dynamic to the game, and we hate that as defensive players. \\"I guess it all starts at quarterback. That's what everybody always says. We finally got one that we feel like can hold his own against some of these other guys in the league. We got a chance to compete.\\" Notes: Starting right tackle Jammal Brown was absent from the morning walkthrough that preceded Thursday afternoon's first practice. . The Redskins cut rookie guard Nevin McCaskill (Hampton) and signed fullback Dorson Boyce, who was in camp with Seattle in 2011. They also re-signed rookie cornerback Chase Minniefield (knee) and placed him on the reserve/injured list. Summary:","output":"Rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III has generated excitement among veteran players at the opening of the Redskins camp.

Mexican officials said a clandestine... (Associated Press) Guerrero State Prosecutor Inaky Blanco did not say Saturday night how many bodies were in the burial pits uncovered on a hillside on Iguala's outskirts, and he declined to speculate about whether the dead were the missing students. \\"It would be irresponsible\\" to jump to conclusions before tests to identify the bodies, Blanco said. Officials said the federal Attorney General's Office and the National Human Rights Commission had sent teams of experts to aid state authorities in identifying the remains. Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre said the victims had been \\"savagely slaughtered.\\" About 100 soldiers, marines and federal and state police cordoned off the area where the grave site was found in the poor Pueblo Viejo district of Iguala, which is about 120 miles (200 kilometers) south of Mexico City. Blanco said eight more people had been arrested in the case, adding to the 22 Iguala city police officers detained after a police confrontation with student protesters last weekend set off a series of violent incidents in the city. The prosecutor has said state investigators had obtained videos showing that local police arrested an undetermined number of students after the initial clash and took them away. He said some of the eight newly arrested people were members of an organized crime gang, adding that some of them had given key clues leading to the discovery of the mass grave. Blanco said his investigators had found that \\"elements of the municipal police are part of organized crime.\\" He also said his office was searching for Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and had alerted officials across Mexico to be on the lookout for him. The governor said had charged earlier in the week that organized crime had infiltrated the city government. Jesus Lopez, the father of one of the missing students, told The Associated Press that a delegation of family and school representatives would come to Iguala on Sunday to get information from authorities. \\"We cannot say anything. We are very nervous, but until they inform us, there is nothing,\\" said Lopez, whose 19-year-old son, Giovani, hasn't been seen since the violence last weekend. State prosecutors have said the first bloodshed occurred when city police shot at buses that had been hijacked by protesting students from a teachers college, killing three youths and wounding 25. A few hours later, unidentified masked gunmen shot at two taxis and a bus carrying a soccer team on the main highway, killing two people on the bus and one in a taxi. Violence is frequent in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory. The Aytozinapa Normal school attended by the missing students, like many other schools in Mexico's \\"rural teachers college\\" system, is known for militant and radical protests that often involve hijacking buses and delivery trucks. In December 2011, two students from Aytozinapa died in a clash with police on the highway that leads to the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. Students had allegedly hijacked buses and blocked the road to press demands for more funding and assured jobs after graduation. Two state police officers were charged in the shootings. During that confrontation, students apparently set fire to pumps at a gas station on the highway when federal and state police moved in to quell the protest, and a gas station employee later died of burns suffered in the attack. ___ Associated Press writers Mark Stevenson and Maria Verza in Mexico City contributed to this report. ||||| IGUALA Mexico (Reuters) - Authorities have found mass graves with the charred remains of up to 20 people in the restive southern Mexican state of Guerrero, at a time when police are scouring the area for nearly four dozen missing students after a rash of violence. The remains were found on a hillside on the outskirts of the town of Iguala in six graves, which were still fresh, a local official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The identities of the dead were not immediately clear, two officials added. Guerrero Attorney General Inaky Blanco told reporters in Iguala on Saturday that the remains would be sent to Mexico’s forensic service to determine whether or not the corpses were those of the missing students. He declined to say how many graves or corpses had been found. “In the next few hours we will determine the cause of death and the number of bodies,” a spokesman for the state attorney general’s office said. Iguala is about 120 miles (193 km) south of Mexico City in the increasingly violent state of Guerrero, the site of clashes involving students, police and armed men last week. At least six people were killed in a spate of incidents. Guerrero Governor Angel Aguirre said earlier this week that photos showed police had taken some of the students away. Several hundred students protested on Saturday night in front of Aguirre’s residence in the state capital of Chilpancingo, expressing anger that some of their classmates may be among the bodies found in the graves. A car was overturned and several petrol bombs were hurled at the residence perimeter, where security outposts were lightly damaged. An police official said on Saturday that there was video footage of eight to 10 students being put into police trucks earlier in the week. Twenty-two police officers were arrested in Guerrero on Sunday, accused of killing two students during the clashes last week. Aguirre said on Saturday that a total of 30 individuals have now been detained in connection with the incidents. Slideshow (5 Images) Local government officials criticized the police for showing an excessive use of force with the students in Guerrero, where gangs have evolved from a fragmented drug cartel and are fighting turf wars. Thirteen of an original group of 57 missing people re-emerged this week. Some had hidden, others had gone home. Dozens are still unaccounted for. Many mass graves have been found across Mexico in recent years and months, the legacy of drug gang violence that has killed around 100,000 people since 2007. |||||Summary:","output":"In October 2014, authorities discovered a mass grave on the outskirts of Iguala, Mexico, after investigating the role of municipal police in clashes in the city a week before.

The term \\"tauromachy\\" comes from the Greek words \\"tauros\\" (bull) and \\"mache\\" (battle or fight). This controversial sport, which has its roots in ancient rituals and traditions, comprises multiple stages and involves a group of skilled human participants, known as a cuadrilla, alongside a specially bred fighting bull. Bullfighting has a rich history, with evidence indicating that its origins date back to the Minoan civilization around 2000 BC. Nevertheless, the modern form of the sport emerged in Spain during the 18th and 19th centuries, heavily influenced by the local culture and traditions. Bullfighting now serves as an iconic representation of Spanish and Hispanic identity, with significant cultural and economic impact. Typically, a traditional Spanish bullfight is divided into three distinct stages or \\"tercios\\": 1. Tercio de Varas (Lances Third): In this stage, the bull initially enters the arena and is assessed by the matador, who performs a series of maneuvers with a large cape to gauge the animal's temperament, strength, and agility. When the matador has determined the bull's patterns and movements, two mounted picadors armed with long lances enter the ring to weaken the bull by pricking its neck and shoulder muscles, which subsequently hampers the animal's ability to lift its head high. 2. Tercio de Banderillas (Flags Third): In the second stage, three banderilleros take center stage, each armed with a pair of colorfully adorned, barbed darts called banderillas. The objective during this phase is to continue weakening the bull while displaying swiftness and grace by skillfully planting the banderillas into the animal's shoulders. 3. Tercio de Muerte (Death Third): The final stage sees the matador re-enter the arena with a small red cape (muleta) and a sword (estoque) in hand. During this phase, the matador aims to draw the bull as close as possible to demonstrate his grace and courage while simultaneously tiring the animal. Ultimately, the matador will attempt to deliver a swift, lethal blow by thrusting the sword between the bull's shoulder blades – a display of skill, precision, and timing, ultimately leading to the animal's death. While Spanish-style bullfighting is the most recognized form, the sport also manifests in other variants, such as the Portuguese bullfighting style – where the matador does not kill the bull within the arena – and recortes or corrida de recortadores, where gymnastic participants attempt to dodge charging bulls without any weapons or capes. Bullfighting has long sparked intense ethical debates due to its treatment of animals and concerns regarding animal welfare. Consequently, the sport has been banned or restricted in various regions globally. Despite these controversies, bullfighting continues to maintain a fervent fanbase and a deep, enduring connection with the cultures where it remains an entrenched tradition."},{"instruction":"Before they begin their journey, they make a detour to Las Vegas.

And I was wondering Why did Robin do this? Answer:","output":"Robin let loose a scream at the cinema while watching the film called Halloween due to a combination of several factors, which can be attributed to the film's contents, human psychology, and environmental aspects. To provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind this action, I will discuss these factors in detail. 1. Film Content: Halloween, directed by John Carpenter, is a classic horror film that revolves around the character Michael Myers – a masked serial killer. The movie is known for its suspenseful atmosphere, chilling soundtrack, and jump scares, which are all essential elements of the horror genre. These factors contribute to creating a mood of anticipation and tension, which can cause an individual, like Robin, to scream as a natural response to experiencing fear or shock. 2. Human Psychology: The human brain processes various emotional responses, including fear. When we watch a horror film, our brain enters a state of heightened awareness, and we become more sensitive to our surroundings. Due to this heightened state, we are more likely to experience a fight-or-flight response when presented with a sudden or scary event, such as a jump scare in the film. This response can manifest in several ways, including screaming, as was the case with Robin. 3. Empathy and Emotional Immersion: As humans, we tend to empathize with the characters on screen and share their emotional experiences. When we watch a horror film, we often put ourselves in the shoes of the characters being stalked or tormented by the antagonist. This emotional immersion can intensify our fear and amplify our reactions to the film's events. In Robin's case, empathizing with the characters and their perilous situations may have heightened their emotional response, leading to the scream. 4. Social Influence: The reactions of people around us can significantly impact our emotional responses. In a cinema setting, where multiple people are experiencing the same film collectively, it is not uncommon for fear and tension to escalate as a group dynamic. If other audience members screamed or reacted strongly to a scene, Robin might have been influenced by their responses, enhancing their own feelings of fear or shock and causing them to scream as well. 5. Environmental Factors: A cinema offers an immersive environment optimized for engaging with a film. The large screen, powerful sound system, and dark surroundings heighten the intensity of the movie-watching experience. This sensory immersion can amplify the fear and anxiety induced by a horror film like Halloween, causing a stronger emotional response from the viewer, such as screaming. In conclusion, Robin's scream during the screening of Halloween can be attributed to the film's suspenseful and frightening content, their psychological response to fear, empathizing with the characters, social influences from others in the cinema, and the immersive environment of a movie theater. These factors combined to elicit an intense emotional reaction leading to Robin's scream."},{"instruction":"This is a question with answer options.

When you uninstall a program, CNB_0286.DLL may be mistakenly deleted. DLL, or Dynamic Link Library, files are a crucial part of the Windows operating system, as they provide essential functionality for many applications. As such, it is important to be cautious when uninstalling programs, as removing the wrong file can lead to a variety of problems for your computer. When a program is installed, it may require its own specific DLL files to function properly. In some cases, these files are shared between multiple programs, allowing them to all access the same library of functions. This can be beneficial in terms of efficiency and streamlining, but it can also lead to complications when uninstalling programs. During the uninstallation process, some programs may inadvertently remove a shared DLL file—such as CNB_0286.DLL—which can cause other applications to malfunction or generate error messages. This occurs because the DLL file that was removed is no longer accessible to the programs that rely on it for essential functions. To prevent this issue, it is vital to follow the recommended uninstallation procedure for each program, which can typically be found within the software's documentation or via online support materials. Additionally, you can utilize a dedicated uninstaller program, which can ensure that shared DLL files are not mistakenly deleted. If you've already experienced this problem, and a shared DLL file has been removed in error, you may be able to find a copy of the missing file online. Many websites are dedicated to providing access to DLL files for download. Simply locate the file you need, download it, and place it in the appropriate folder on your computer—typically, this will be in the \\"System32\\" folder for 32-bit applications or the \\"SysWOW64\\" folder for 64-bit applications. Alternatively, it may be necessary to reinstall the program that originally contained the DLL file. This can help to ensure that the file is placed back into the correct location, allowing other programs to access it once again. Remember, however, to be cautious when uninstalling programs in the future to prevent such issues from occurring again."},{"instruction":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Antioch, California, areaTotal, 75.324 (square kilometres).

The location and mechanism of the earthquake are consistent with slip on the primary plate boundary interface, or megathrust, between the Nazca and South America plates. At the latitude of the earthquake, the Nazca plate subducts eastward beneath the South America plate at a rate of 65 mm/yr. Subduction along the Peru-Chile Trench to the west of Chile has led to uplift of the Andes mountain range and has produced some of the largest earthquakes in the world, including the 2010 M 8.8 Maule earthquake in central Chile, and the largest earthquake on record, the 1960 M 9.5 earthquake in southern Chile. The April 1 earthquake occurred in a region of historic seismic quiescence – termed the northern Chile or Iquique seismic gap. Geodetic modeling indicates that the subducting and overriding plates are partially to fully-locked, implying that large earthquake are possible along the plate boundary megathrust. Historical records indicate a M 8.8 earthquake occurred within the Iquique gap in 1877, which was preceded immediately to the north by an M 8.8 earthquake in 1868. A recent increase in seismicity rates has occurred in the vicinity of the April 1 earthquake. An M6.7 earthquake with similar faulting mechanism occurred on March 16, 2014 and was followed by 60+ earthquake of M4+, and 26 earthquakes of M5+. The March 16 earthquake was also followed by three M6.2 events on March 17, March 22, and March 23. The spatial distribution of seismicity following the March 16 event migrated spatially to the north through time, starting near 20oS and moving to ~19.5oS. The initial location of the April 1 earthquake places the event near the northern end of this seismic sequence. Other recent large plate boundary ruptures bound the possible rupture area of the April 1 event, including the 2001 M 8.4 Peru earthquake adjacent to the south coast of Peru to the north, and the 2007 M 7.7 Tocopilla, Chile and 1995 M 8.1 Antofagasta, Chile earthquakes to the south. Other nearby events along the plate boundary interface include an M 7.4 in 1967 as well as an M 7.7 in 2005 in the deeper portion of the subduction zone beneath onland Chile. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. A magnitude 8.2 earthquake occurred on April 1, 2014, in northern Chile near the Chilean coast as a result of thrust faulting at shallow depths.

Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club., can you guess it ?

Some animals respond to fear in ways you might not expect.The first example is that the fear of being eaten can scare some frogs right out of their eggs. Warkentin made the surprising discovery while studying red--eyed tree frogs in Costa Rica. In this species,female frogs attach jellylike clumps of their eggs to the undersides of leaves.The leaves hang on branches that dangle over ponds.After they hatch from the eggs,the tadpoles then fall into the water,where they eventually grow into adult frogs. Tree frog eggs usually grow for 6 days before hatching.If they sense that a hungry snake is about to attack,however,they can hatch up to 2 days ahead of schedule. As the snakes are unable to swim,by falling into the water early,the tadpoles can escape. If hatching early helps protect red--eyed tree frogs from snakes,you might wonder why their eggs don't always hatch sooner.It turns out that hatching early brings its own danger.Once tadpoles land in the water,hungry fish and other animals like to eat them too.Staying in their eggs for a full 6 days,then,allows frog embryos to grow big and strong.This extra growth improves their chances of surviving in the water.

The Justice Department has yet to make any official announcement, but sources close to the department have said such a prosecution would be unlikely, in part because of the extraordinarily high legal standard federal prosecutors would need to meet. Wilson was cleared in November by a state grand jury in the August 9 death of Michael Brown, a shooting that touched off protests in the streets and became part of a national conversation about race relations and police departments that patrol minority neighborhoods. Scroll down for video. Darren Wilson isn't expected to face civil rights charges over the fatal shooting of Michael Brown last August after an F.B.I. investigation found no evidence to support charges. Attorney General Eric Holder visited Ferguson in the days after the shooting to calm tensions and meet with Brown's family and law enforcement. Wilson, who shot Brown after a scuffle in the middle of the street, told the grand jury that reviewed the case that he feared for his life when Brown hit him and reached for his gun. Some witnesses have said Brown had his hands up when Wilson shot him. To mount a federal prosecution, the Justice Department would need to show that Wilson willfully deprived Brown of his civil rights. That standard, which means prosecutors must prove that an officer knowingly used more force than the law allowed, is challenging for the government to meet. Multiple high-profile police-involved deaths, including the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo in New York City, have not resulted in federal charges. Attorney General Eric Holder visited Ferguson in the days after the shooting to calm tensions and meet with Brown's family and law enforcement.

A separate, broader Justice Department-led investigation into the practices of the Ferguson police department remains open. That investigation, which will examine potential racial bias among officers, has the potential to have more sweeping consequences than any individual criminal prosecutions, experts say. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Justice Department lawyers were preparing a memo recommending against prosecuting Wilson, but that the memo was not yet complete and that Attorney General Eric Holder — who is expected to leave his position within weeks — had not yet made a decision. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Brown's family, said in a statement that the family would not address speculation from anonymous officials and was waiting for an official Justice Department announcement. Wilson was cleared in November by a state grand jury in the August 9 death of Michael Brown, a shooting that touched off protests in the streets. Neil Bruntrager, an attorney for Wilson, said Wilson's lawyers had received no communications from the Justice Department and would not comment until there was a final determination. 'We don't believe he has done anything that would merit any kind of a prosecution or any kind of civil rights claims and we are just awaiting the outcome like everybody else,' Bruntrager said in a telephone interview.

But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

Economic impact: A Grexit could lead to a potential domino effect, putting other vulnerable countries like Spain, Italy, and Portugal at risk. If Greece left the eurozone and defaulted on its debt, it could threaten the stability of the euro, making it harder for these countries to borrow money and access capital markets. 2. EU political stability: A Grexit would highlight the vulnerability of the EU and may lead to other countries leaving the bloc or reconsidering their membership. Spain has a vested interest in the EU's stability, as it has benefitted significantly from its EU membership. 3. Precedent: A Greek exit could set a dangerous precedent, suggesting that a country can leave the eurozone in times of financial difficulties, rather than implementing the necessary reforms and adhering to the eurozone guidelines. This could potentially encourage other struggling countries to consider an exit, further destabilizing the European project. In conclusion, Spain's position on Greece and its eurozone membership has generally been supportive of Greece remaining within the eurozone. Spain understands the potential negative economic and political consequences that a Grexit would have on the EU and would rather see Greece make the necessary reforms to address its financial crisis, whilst remaining a member of the eurozone."},{"instruction":"Why do traditional gender roles exist? How were gender roles determined in the first place? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Available choices: (i) no. (ii) yes.","output":"Traditional gender roles exist due to a combination of biological, social, and cultural factors that have evolved over thousands of years. There are several reasons for the development and persistence of these roles, which include evolutionary biology, division of labor, social constructs, and historical practices. 1. Evolutionary biology: One reason for the existence of traditional gender roles is evolutionary biology. Males and females in various species, including humans, have evolved different physical traits and abilities that influence their roles in society. For example, males tend to be larger and have greater physical strength, making them more effective in tasks requiring physical power and endurance. Females, on the other hand, are better equipped for childbirth and caring for young offspring due to their reproductive systems and biologically driven nurturing instincts. 2. Division of labor: As human societies developed, the division of labor became more and more essential for survival and progress. Roles and responsibilities were apportioned based on physical abilities, skills, and resources. Men were generally better suited for hunting, fishing, and protecting the group from external threats, while women were responsible for gathering food, caring for children, and managing the household. This division of labor ensured greater specialization and efficiency in performing necessary tasks, and it subsequently reinforced traditional gender roles. 3. Social constructs: Traditional gender roles are also shaped by sociocultural factors and norms that perpetuate particular expectations and behaviors. Throughout history, societies have created specific roles for men and women, which often reflect prevailing belief systems, values, and religious practices. In many cultures, men are seen as the providers and protectors, while women are typically responsible for nurturing and maintaining the family unit. Over time, these social constructs become ingrained in the collective consciousness and continue to be passed down through generations, further cementing traditional gender roles. 4. Historical practices: Many societies have longstanding practices and customs that uphold traditional gender roles. For example, property inheritance and lineage were often traced through the male bloodline, granting men greater economic power and influence. Women, on the other hand, were often denied education, the right to work (outside the home), own property, or participate in political processes, which further reinforced their subordinate status and traditional roles. To answer the second question, traditional gender roles were determined by a combination of factors, including evolutionary biology, societal needs for the division of labor, sociocultural constructs, and longstanding historical practices. These factors have continuously interacted to establish the roles and expectations associated with each gender. Regarding the multi-choice problem, I would say that these questions are connected but not the same: (ii) yes. While both questions explore the origin and existence of traditional gender roles, the first question seeks to understand why they exist, and the second question asks how they were determined. The answers to both questions are interrelated, but they address different aspects of the broader issue of gender roles in societies."},{"instruction":"Translate to Russian: 94 DEPUTIES WERE ELECTED IN UZBEKISTAN; 134 AMENDMENDS IN TAX CODE WERE MADE; GAZPROM AND UZBEKISTAN SIGNED GAS SUPPLYING AGREEMENT; INTERNATIONAL RATING OF ÓQISHLOQ QURILISH BANKÔ; STOCK MARKET REVIEW.","output":"В Узбекистане были избраны 94 депутатов; были внесены 134 поправки в налоговый кодекс; Газпром и Узбекистан подписали соглашение о поставке газа; международный рейтинг Укшлок Курилиш банка; обзор фондового рынка."},{"instruction":"New York City's most important economic sector lies in its role as the headquarters for the U.S.financial industry, metonymously known as Wall Street.

He was originally born as Ma He in a Muslim family, later adopted the conferred surname Zheng from Emperor Yongle. Zheng commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa from 1405 to 1433. His larger ships stretched 120 meters or more in length. Context: In the decades after the last voyage, Imperial officials minimized the importance of Zheng He and his expeditions throughout the many regnal and dynastic histories they compiled. The information in the Yongle and Xuande Emperors' official annals was incomplete and even erroneous; other official publications omitted them completely. Although some have seen this as a conspiracy seeking to eliminate memories of the voyages, it is likely that the records were dispersed throughout several departments and the expeditions - unauthorized by (and in fact, counter to) the injunctions of the dynastic founder - presented a kind of embarrassment to the dynasty. State-sponsored Ming naval efforts declined dramatically after Zheng's voyages. Starting in the early 15th century, China experienced increasing pressure from the surviving Yuan Mongols from the north. The relocation of the capital north to Beijing exacerbated this threat dramatically. At considerable expense, China launched annual military expeditions from Beijing to weaken the Mongolians. The expenditures necessary for these land campaigns directly competed with the funds necessary to continue naval expeditions. Further, in 1449, Mongolian cavalry ambushed a land expedition personally led by the Zhengtong Emperor at Tumu Fortress, less than a day's march from the walls of the capital. The Mongolians wiped out the Chinese army and captured the emperor. This battle had two salient effects. First, it demonstrated the clear threat posed by the northern nomads. Second, the Mongols caused a political crisis in China when they released the emperor after his half-brother had already ascended and declared the new Jingtai era. Not until 1457 and the restoration of the former emperor did political stability return. Upon his return to power, China abandoned the strategy of annual land expeditions and instead embarked upon a massive and expensive expansion of the Great Wall of China. In this environment, funding for naval expeditions simply did not happen. However, missions from Southeast Asia continued to arrive for decades. Depending on local conditions, they could reach such frequency that the court found it necessary to restrict them: the History of Ming records imperial edicts forbidding Java, Champa, and Siam from sending their envoys more often than once every three years. Question: was there a war Answer:","output":"No, there was not a specific war related to Zheng He's voyages. However, there were conflicts and military pressures faced by China during and after Zheng He's expeditions, particularly from the surviving Yuan Mongols in the north. This led to a shift in focus and resources from naval expeditions to strengthening land defenses, such as the Great Wall of China. Although Zheng He's voyages involved diplomacy and trade, the expeditions did not lead to or center around a war."},{"instruction":"Student: Given the sentence \\"A tropical fisherman throws an orange net into a river.\\" is it true that \\"A fisherman is fishing.\\"?.

For kids,happiness has a magical quality.Their delight at winning a race or getting a new bike is unreserved . In the teenage years the concept of happiness changes.Suddenly it's conditional on such things as excitement,love and popularity.I can still recall the excitement of being invited to dance with the most attractive boy at the school party. In adulthood the things that bring deep joy-love,marriage,birth-also bring responsibility and the risk of loss.For adults,happiness is complicated . My definition of happiness is \\"the capacity for enjoyment\\".The more we can enjoy what we have,the happier we are.It's easy to overlook the pleasure we get from the company of friends,the freedom to live where we please,and even good health. I experienced my little moments of pleasure yesterday.First I was overjoyed when I shut the last lunchbox and had the house to myself.Then I spent an uninterrupted morning writing,which I love.When the kids and my husband came home,I enjoyed their noise after the quiet of the day. Psychologists tell us that to be happy we need a mix of enjoyable leisure time and satisfying work.I don't think that my grandmother,who raised 14 children,had much of either.She did have a network of close friends and family,and maybe this is what satisfied her. We,however,with so many choices and such pressure to succeed in every area,have turned happiness into one more thing we've got to have.We're so selfconscious about our \\"right\\" to it that it's making us miserable.So we chase it and equal it with wealth and success,without noticing that the people who have those things aren't necessarily happier. Happiness isn't about what happens to us-it's about how we see what happens to us.It's the skillful way of finding a positive for every negative.It's not wishing for what we don't have,but enjoying what we do possess.

A) consider pressure something blocking their way B) stress their right to happiness too much C) are at a loss to make correct choices D) are more likely to be happy A:","output":"B) stress their right to happiness too much According to the passage, people who equate happiness with wealth and success are so focused on their \\"right\\" to happiness that it's making them miserable.

Instead, happiness is more about the individual's perspective, and finding positivity and enjoyment in what they already possess, rather than longing for what they do not have."},{"instruction":"Q: Does the following sentence make sense? \\"Crack cocaine comes from the white floour we use for cooking.\\" Options: - yes - no Chain-of-thought:","output":"- no"},{"instruction":"pick from the following. A. thank everyone; B. ignore everyone; C. get the house furnished; Q: Bailey was poor and didn't have anywhere to live. Bailey happily accepted the house they were given. Given the context: What will Bailey want to do afterwards? A:","output":"Given the context, Bailey would most likely want to express their gratitude and then work on furnishing the house to make it a comfortable and livable space. First, Bailey would want to thank everyone who contributed to providing them with a new home. This may include friends, family, community members, or charitable organizations involved in the process. Bailey could choose to do this through personalized messages, phone calls or even small tokens of appreciation, if possible. By expressing gratitude, Bailey would not only acknowledge the kindness and generosity of the individuals involved but also strengthen their relationships and encourage a sense of community. Once Bailey has expressed their thanks, they would want to focus on getting the house furnished to make it feel more like their own personal space. Although being poor might make it difficult for Bailey to purchase new furniture, there are several ways that they can achieve this goal. 1. Start with the essentials: Bailey should prioritize the most necessary pieces of furniture, such as a bed, chairs, and a table. These can often be found at garage sales, thrift stores, or even for free on websites like Craigslist or Freecycle. 2. Upcycle and repurpose: Bailey could get creative and repurpose found items, such as using wooden pallets to make a bed frame, turning crates into shelves or storage units, or refinishing old furniture to give it a new lease on life. 3. Reach out for help: Bailey can ask for help from friends, family, or community members who may have spare furniture they no longer need or who are willing to donate their time and skills to help. There might also be local organizations or charities that can provide Bailey with furniture or other household items. 4. Housewarming party: Bailey could host a housewarming party where guests are encouraged to bring small, useful gifts or furniture pieces to help furnish the house. This will not only allow Bailey to gather essential items but also strengthen relationships with the people who helped them get the house in the first place. 5. Set up a fund: If Bailey is unable to obtain furniture through these methods, they could consider setting up a crowdfunding campaign on websites like GoFundMe or reaching out to local charities for financial assistance to help them purchase essential furniture. 6. Get creative with space: Given that Bailey's house might be small, it's important for them to think creatively about how to use the available space. This could include installing floating shelves, maximizing vertical storage, using foldable or multipurpose furniture, or even DIY projects that customize and optimize the space for their specific needs. In summary, Bailey would be most likely to express their gratitude to the people who helped them acquire the new home and then work on finding ways to furnish it, focusing on affordable and accessible options that would enable them to create a comfortable and personalized space."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: what type of industry is procter and gamble?","output":"To answer this question, I will follow these steps: 1.

Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, which stemmed from a lack of effort and focus. The Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the 2007 NBA Playoffs as the Easts second seed. In Game 5 of the NBA Conference Finals, James notched 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring 29 of Clevelands last 30 points, including the game-winning layup with two seconds left, against the 2006-07 Detroit Pistons season. After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \\"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \\"Michael Jordan-esque\\". In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history. The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the 2006-07 San Antonio Spurs season in the 2007 NBA Finals. During the championship round, James struggled, averaging 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting, and Cleveland was eliminated in a Whitewash (sport). Question: In which categories did James' average higher in the championship round compared to his season average? Answer:","output":"During the championship round of the 2007 NBA Finals, LeBron James saw an increase in his average in certain statistical categories compared to his season average. Specifically, his rebounds and assists per game saw an increase in the championship round. In the 2006-07 NBA regular season, LeBron James had the following averages per game: - 27.3 points - 6.7 rebounds - 6.0 assists - 1.6 steals In the 2007 NBA Finals championship round, James had the following averages per game: - 22.0 points - 7.0 rebounds - 6.8 assists - an unspecified number of steals (but not mentioned as increased, so we assume it's less or equal to 1.6) Comparing these two sets of averages, we can determine the categories in which James had higher averages during the championship round: - Rebounds per game: James saw a slight increase in his rebounding average, going from 6.7 during the regular season to 7.0 in the championship round. - Assists per game: Similarly, his assists average also increased, from 6.0 in the regular season to 6.8 in the championship round. It is important to note that despite these increases in averages, LeBron James' overall performance in the 2007 NBA Finals was not as effective as it was during the regular season, as evidenced by his reduced shooting percentage (35.6%) and scoring average (22 points) in the Finals. The Cleveland Cavaliers were eventually swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the series, signifying that the increased averages in rebounds and assists were not enough to secure a championship for the team."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about the following things: party, plan, tip","output":"A party is a fun gathering of friends, a plan is a way to decide what to do, and a tip is a small present you give to someone who does a good job."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between being British and being English?

Gold continued to be minted until the end of the 7th century, when it was replaced by silver coins. The basic Frankish silver coin was the denarius or denier, while the Anglo-Saxon version was called a penny. From these areas, the denier or penny spread throughout Europe during the centuries from 700 to 1000. Copper or bronze coins were not struck, nor were gold except in Southern Europe. No silver coins denominated in multiple units were minted.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"The various Germanic states based their currency on the existing Roman and Byzantine coinage systems. During this time, the Germanic states, such as the Frankish and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, heavily influenced by the Roman and Byzantine empire's established forms of currency, created their own imitations. The widespread coinage type across Europe during the 7th to the 10th century was silver, as gold was replaced by silver coins by the end of the 7th century. The basic Frankish silver coin was the denarius or denier, which was derived from the Roman denarius, a small silver coin that was a vital component of Roman currency. The denarius maintained its significance in the medieval period, particularly among the kingdoms that originated from the former Western Roman Empire, such as the Frankish kingdom. The Frankish denier was widely circulated and served as a crucial point of reference for other European currencies that emerged during this period. Similarly, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms adopted the Roman and Byzantine influence and introduced their own version of the denarius, known as the penny. The Anglo-Saxon penny was a silver coin similar in size and weight to the denarius, and it served as the principal unit of currency in Anglo-Saxon England. Like the denier, the penny spread throughout Europe between 700 and 1000 AD, further solidifying the influence of Roman and Byzantine coinage systems on emerging Germanic states. At this time, copper or bronze coins were not minted in Germanic states, and gold coins were only seen in Southern Europe. This could be attributed to the scarcity of gold resources in the region and the shift in focus to silver as the primary metal for coinage. Additionally, no silver coins were produced with multiple units to represent higher denominations – a clear deviation from Roman coinage, which often featured several denominations. In conclusion, the Germanic states, including the Frankish and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, based their currency on the Roman and Byzantine coinage systems. Gold was replaced by silver as the primary metal for coins, and the denarius or denier, along with the Anglo-Saxon penny, became the standard units of currency. These coins gained widespread acceptance and circulation throughout Europe between 700 and 1000 AD, demonstrating the pervasive influence of Roman and Byzantine currency forms on the developing Germanic states."},{"instruction":"Voyons une liste sans ordre, ni priorité, des plus courantes.

Eventually, Paddy dies in a drunken binge, leaving Emmeline and Michael all alone with each other. Together, they survive solely on their resourcefulness, and the bounty of their remote paradise. Years pass and both Emmeline and Michael become tanned, athletic and nubile young adults. Eventually, their relationship, more along the lines of brother and sister in their youth, blossoms into love, and then passion. Emmeline and Michael have their baby boy, and they live together as common-law husband and wife, content in their solitude. But their marriage is threatened by the arrival of two evil traders, who force the child to dive for pearls at gunpoint, before killing each other off. Emmeline is reminded of the outside world and wants to leave the island. She fears for the child if she and Michael should die, and begins to think of his future. Michael finally succumbs to her pleading and they pack a small boat and leave the island. But becalmed in the middle of the ocean, they succumb to exposure. They are found by a British ship, but the film leaves their fate ambiguous. The answer is:","output":"Emma and Dean learn to survive together on a deserted island by relying on their resourcefulness and the natural resources the island provides.

Movie title: Von Ryan's Express Movie plot: August 1943- Nazi-occupied Italy. An American P-38 Lightning fighter plane with smoke trailing from one of its engines sputters and loses altitude above an Italian coastal town. A pair of German officers abruptly interrupt their lunch to catch up with the rapidly descending plane. When the Germans arrive at the crash site, they encounter a burning fuselage surrounded by Italian soldiers. The soldiers explain that the pilot was killed in the crash. Satisfied, the Germans leave. As soon as they are gone, the Italians mock their imperious occupiers and part ranks to reveal a hidden and slightly injured American flyer, Colonel Joseph Ryan (Frank Sinatra).Ryan is taken to an Italian POW camp filled with British and American prisoners. Italian discipline over the camp is lax and the prisoners are filthy and ragged. Constant escape attempts have enraged the Italian commandant and resulted in the withholding of clean clothes, hot water, razors, and food parcels. The ranking British officer has just died while imprisoned in the camp sweat box. Command has fallen to the irascible British Major Fincham (Trevor Howard) of the Ninth Fusiliers. The pragmatic Ryan and the inflexible Major Fincham immediately clash, with Ryan outranking Fincham and able to coutermand his orders.With the Americans only weeks from liberating the camp, Ryan wants all futile escape attempts stopped. He betrays the active escape tunnels to the Italian commandant, Major Battaglia (Adolfo Celi), earning both the enmity of the British prisoners and the scornful nickname \\"Von Ryan.\\" As a reward for Ryan's cooperation, Battaglia turns the showers back on and issues razors and Red Cross parcels. But he balks at issuing clean clothing, since he is selling the donated clothes on the black market. Ryan orders the men to strip and burn their filthy clothes. As punishment, Ryan is placed in the sweat box while the men receive their clean clothing.Some time later, Ryan's fellow inmates release him from the box with the welcome news that the Allies have... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Von Ryan's Express,\\" the prisoners, led by Colonel Joseph Ryan (Frank Sinatra) and Major Fincham (Trevor Howard), devise a daring and carefully planned escape from the train cars. The escape plan involves several key steps, which I will outline below: 1. Gathering Information and Resources: The prisoners start by gathering as much information as possible about the train and its route. They study the schedules, guard patterns, and the train's layout. They also procure necessary tools and equipment to aid in their escape, such as lock picks, makeshift weapons, and uniforms of German soldiers. 2. Creating a Distraction: The prisoners devise schemes to divert the attention of the German guards, such as faking illnesses, staging fights, or creating chaos within the train cars. This serves to distract the guards and provides opportunities for the prisoners to make their moves. 3. Neutralizing the Guards: Once the distractions are in play, the prisoners work together to neutralize the German guards on the train. They do this by ambushing the guards as discreetly and quietly as possible, using their makeshift weapons and hand-to-hand combat skills. They then take the guards' uniforms and weapons, which they will use later to blend in and evade suspicion. 4. Unlocking the Train Cars: With the guards neutralized, the prisoners can begin picking the locks on the train car doors. They must work quickly and quietly to avoid detection by any remaining guards or the train's driver. Once the locks are open, the prisoners can start to make their move. 5. Exiting the Train and Sabotaging the Tracks: The prisoners use the stops at stations or slower parts of the route as their opportunity to exit the train. They carefully time their jumps, ensuring they land safely and avoid capture. Once off the train, the prisoners split into smaller groups and proceed to sabotage the train tracks, making it difficult for the train to continue on its intended path or for any pursuers to follow them. 6. Evasion and Regrouping: After successfully exiting the train and sabotaging the tracks, the prisoners must evade capture by the Germans and blend into their surroundings. They utilize their stolen uniforms, deception, and knowledge of the terrain to elude any pursuers. The prisoners then regroup at a predetermined rendezvous point, where they can make further plans for their escape from occupied Italy. In summary, the prisoners' escape from the train cars in \\"Von Ryan's Express\\" is a meticulously planned and executed operation. Through a combination of distractions, stealth, quick thinking, and teamwork, they manage to break free from captivity and continue their journey toward freedom."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Security Council\\" to French?","output":"In French, \\"Security Council\\" is translated to \\"Conseil de sécurité\\".

People think: \\"It's such a big book! It has such a serious theme!\\" The feeling that they are going to be taught a long, hard lesson often puts readers off. But really, War and Peace (1869), which tells the stories of five upper-class families in Russia at the time of the 1812 French invasion, is not to be missed. Reading this novel is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences, like climbing the Great Wall: You will regret it if you do not try. Earlier this month, USA Today reported that a six-episode War and Peace miniseries produced by the BBC would air next year. With a complex plot and so many characters, readers unfamiliar with the work might be most interested in the characters from the financially-troubled Rostov family of Moscow. Count Rostov has four teenage children. Natasha is in love with Boris Drubetskoy, who is about to become an army officer. Nikolai Ilyich loves the poor Sonya, a ward of the family, but his family is not happy with their relationship. The proud Vera is about to start a happy marriage with a German-Russian officer. The youngest Rostov is the 9-year-old Petya, who, like his brother Nikolai, has his heart set on fighting for his country. The lives of all are about to be changed by the upcoming great war that involves many other major characters of War and Peace, such as Prince Andrei, who goes into a military career partly in order to get away from his unhappy marriage to the socialite Lise. The novel has a great reputation among many kinds of writers and millions of readers. US writer Ernest Hemingway wrote: \\"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did.\\" A comment by the great 20th-century Russian short-story writer Isaak Babel shows the rich sense of history that Tolstoy's work conveys. \\"If the world itself could write, it would write like Tolstoy,\\" Babel commented.

Especially if they have never been abroad themselves, your parents probably won't understand the changes that living abroad can cause in a person. On the other hand, you may have maintained an ideal mental image of your loved ones while abroad, an image that is broken into pieces when you return.

The film opens in the year 1958, where steel heiress Edna Buxton enters a talent contest. Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit.

It was first recorded near the Beardmore Glacier by Frank Wild on the Nimrod Expedition, and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains. The Prince Charles Mountains contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the oil and natural gas fields found in the Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all mineral resources is banned until 2048 by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Where are oil and gas deposits located near Antarctica?","output":"Oil and gas deposits near Antarctica are primarily located in the southern regions of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. These hydrocarbon reserves are found in various offshore basins surrounding the continent, some of which extend into the Antarctic continental shelf. Here are some major areas where oil and gas deposits have been identified: 1. Ross Sea: The most significant and well-known oil and gas deposits in Antarctica were discovered in the Ross Sea in 1973. This region, located off the coast of the continent's Pacific sector, contains vast hydrocarbon resources that could potentially be recovered for commercial purposes. The Ross Sea is thought to possess natural gas deposits in the Victoria Land Basin and potential offshore oil deposits in the Eastern Basin. 2. Weddell Sea: This sea, located off the coast of the Atlantic sector of Antarctica, is considered to have considerable potential for oil and gas resources. The presence of sedimentary basins in the Weddell Sea region, such as the Falkland Plateau Basin and South Orkney Microcontinent, have led experts to believe that these areas might hold significant hydrocarbon reserves. 3. Amundsen Sea: Substantial hydrocarbon deposits are also believed to be present in the Amundsen Sea region, which is situated in the southeastern Pacific Ocean near West Antarctica. The Bellingshausen Basin and the Amundsen Basin have deepwater sediments that indicate a high probability of oil and gas accumulations. 4. Southern Indian Ocean: The Kerguelen Plateau, located in the southern part of the Indian Ocean, is a large submerged region that has been speculated to possess substantial oil and gas deposits. This region lies between the Antarctic Peninsula and the Kerguelen Islands and stretches across the Indian and Australian tectonic plates. 5. Scotia Sea: The Scotia Sea, located between the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, is another region where hydrocarbons may potentially be found. The region consists of tectonically complex basins such as South Georgia Basin and the South Orkney Microcontinent, which hold the potential for oil and gas deposits. These oil and gas deposits near Antarctica are currently protected under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Any exploration or exploitation of these resources is banned until 2048 when the protocol comes up for review.

Reasoning: The answer \\"it is not possible to tell\\" is justified because weather prediction is inherently complex and relies on numerous variables, such as atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind patterns, and temperature. While meteorologists can develop models and use historical data to make short-term predictions with some accuracy, the further into the future we predict, the greater the margin of error becomes. This is due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere and the difficulty in accounting for all the factors influencing weather patterns on a global scale. As a result, it is not possible to tell with full certainty what the weather will be years in advance."},{"instruction":"Does word \\"see\\" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?

Pet Grooming Services If you have the skills and experience, consider offering pet grooming services as a standalone business or part of your pet care offerings. Pet grooming is essential for maintaining pets' health and hygiene and is a valuable service for busy or inexperienced pet owners. 8. Pooper Scooper Services Free up pet owners' time by offering pooper scooper services. It may not be the most glamorous job, but it is a practical and essential service for maintaining a clean and healthy environment for pets and their families. 9.

The primary function of the red blood cells (RBCs) is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, and if they are defective, the whole process is disrupted. Healthy red blood cells are biconcave in shape and filled with hemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen. The unique shape of red blood cells provides a large surface area for the exchange of gases. The hemoglobin within these cells binds to oxygen molecules in the lungs and carries them to various tissues throughout the body, where they are exchanged for carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide is then transported by the red blood cells back to the lungs, where it is released and exhaled. In the case of defective red blood cells, there may be several issues that can hinder their ability to transport oxygen effectively. Some of these issues include: 1. Abnormal hemoglobin: If the hemoglobin within the red blood cells is abnormal or dysfunctional, its oxygen-carrying capacity may be compromised. An example of this is in sickle cell anemia, where the shape of the red blood cells becomes distorted and they cannot move smoothly through the blood vessels. This can lead to a decreased ability to transport oxygen and thus, less oxygen reaching the body's tissues. 2. Insufficient red blood cells: If the body is not producing enough red blood cells, or if the existing cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced (hemolytic anemia), there may not be enough red blood cells to effectively transport oxygen to the body's tissues. This can lead to less oxygen being available for the body's functions. 3. Decreased red blood cell lifespan: Red blood cells have an average lifespan of approximately 120 days. Any condition that shortens this lifespan can also potentially result in a reduced number of red blood cells available for oxygen transport. In conclusion, if the red blood cells are defective and cannot function properly, it will result in less oxygen reaching the body's tissues and organs. This can lead to a variety of health issues and complications as the body becomes deprived of the necessary oxygen required for its cells to function effectively."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: For the moment, however, the fix is in for the consumer.

Context: Is not necessarily worth two of anything, anywhere else. But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all. So with dead, smelly fish in mind, I persuaded my friend Shan to pick one up when he was down at the Saturday Farmer's Market. He returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid. Shad has even more bones than other fish and you'll never see it featured on any cooking show (except maybe Iron Chef, where the disgusting and unusual seems to be standard). It took me all day to thaw out the fish in the lounge sink?#8364;?an activity which elicited howls of complaint from the guys trying to watch TV.

They shared their living space with around 99 other young adults, and during their time there, they had some conflicts with a fellow housemate named Scut, whom they describe as a large, obnoxious Newfie. The narrator, being a physically smaller and somewhat odd individual, was a target for Scut's abuse. Out of the urge for revenge, they decided to concoct a plan against Scut, which involved seeking help from their friend Shan to obtain a smelly, frozen shad fish from the Saturday Farmer's Market. The task of thawing the fish took place in the lounge sink and caused quite a ruckus among the other residents who were attempting to watch TV. The person's identity beyond being a student and their connection to these events is left unspecified; however, it is clear that they were resourceful and determined to get back at Scut for his mistreatment."},{"instruction":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments.

The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, to be carried further up river to Langport; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton. The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf. Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles, and later cellophane, but those industries have now stopped. With its good links to the motorway system, Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and Gerber Juice. AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town. Many towns have encouraged small-scale light industries, such as Crewkerne's Ariel Motor Company, one of the UK's smallest car manufacturers.

More than £340million worth of songs were illegally downloaded in the UK in the first half of 2012, research revealed yesterday. Millions of Britons are breaking the law rather than paying for music, evidence from the Digital Music Index by analysts Musicmetric has shown. The data suggests that the blocking of Pirate Bay – a file-sharing website – earlier this year, has had little impact on an industry worth £1.2billion a year in exports alone. Slowing market: Record labels recognise that the illegal download business is damaging to their sales. Albums by Ed Sheeran and Rihanna were among the most popular downloads. People looking to download music for free have instead turned to BitTorrent, a network where tunes can be obtained speedily, but mostly illegally, from other users. The sample also reveals how tastes – and the willingness to break the law – differ by region, providing record labels with useful information about file-sharing patterns among consumers. Manchester topped the list of most illegal downloads per capita, with 1.3m in six months, closely followed by Nottingham and Southampton, while London came 20th. The most popular downloads were albums by pop idols Ed Sheeran, Rizzle Kicks and Rihanna, although in retiree hotspot Bournemouth the most popular record was The Discography of the Eagles.

When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé's \\"Halo\\". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent \\"Already Gone\\" from being included on All I Ever Wanted, but it was impossible to make last minute changes, as her album was already being printed when I Am... Sasha Fierce was released. She accused Tedder of using the same arrangement on both \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\", and complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing it from Beyoncé.Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder commented that he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her criticism was \\"hurtful and absurd\\". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" are completely different. Calling \\"Already Gone\\" one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to \\"listen [to the two ballads] and form their own opinions\\". Clarkson also tried to stop her label, RCA, from releasing \\"Already Gone\\" as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, \\"It's one of those things I have no control over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it.\\" Clarkson later told James Montgomery of MTV News that it was unfortunate \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing the arrangement for \\"Already Gone\\" from Beyoncé?

The main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their waste. The rivers then empty into the ocean, often also bringing chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake, sea, ocean, or waterway. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.In addition, the Pacific Ocean has served as the crash site of satellites, including Mars 96, Fobos-Grunt, and Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. Now, I have a new situation: Ecuador and Panama both had beautiful rivers flowing into the Pacific ocean. Ecuador uses their river to dispose of their waste while Panama is very eco-friendly and doesn't do that. Answer this question please: Which country dumps more chemicals into the ocean? The answer to this question is:","output":"Ecuador dumps more chemicals into the ocean than Panama. As the background information provided states, Ecuador uses its rivers to dispose of its waste, which ultimately flows into the Pacific Ocean. This waste could contain various chemicals and harmful particles that contribute to marine pollution. The rivers can also transport agricultural fertilizers, which have a detrimental impact on the ocean's ecosystem due to the presence of oxygen-depleting chemicals. These chemicals can lead to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones in the ocean. On the other hand, Panama is described as being very eco-friendly and does not use its rivers to dispose of waste in the same manner as Ecuador. While it is still possible that some amount of chemicals or pollutants could inadvertently enter the water system, Panama's eco-conscious approach likely results in a much lower overall contribution of harmful substances to the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, given the different waste disposal practices of the two countries, Ecuador dumps more chemicals into the ocean compared to Panama.

Recent studies have shown that engaging in physical activities can boost brain health and cognitive abilities. However, the specific relationship between memory retention and exercise is yet to be well established. Various factors, such as the type, intensity, and duration of exercise, as well as the age and general health of the individual might play a significant role in this relationship.

Article: When an NBA player is young he thinks he can win the championship by himself. It is only later when he has aged and been through many battles that he learns an important lesson: there is no \\"I \\" in \\"team\\". There is no better example of the value of teamwork than the Boston Celtics. Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett were all superstars on three different teams. Yet, none of them had any titles to show for it. Then, last season, they decided to sacrifice money and individual statistics to play together. Garnett and Allen joined Pierce on the Celtics and changed the NBA in the process. It started in simple ways. Garnett and Allen are two of the most intense athletes in the world. They treat every second of every practice like it is the NBA championship. If you want to play alongside them then you will have to do the same. So, the young guys on the Celtics started giving their full effort too. Pierce had been the star of the Celtics for many years. He used to shoot the ball many times a game. But with the addition of Allen and Garnett he shot less and focused on defense. His selflessness showed the young players that doing what made the team better was the only thing that mattered. When the Celtics were winning and the game was almost over, Garnett, Pierce and Allen would come out of the game. But they wouldn't just sit on the bench. Instead, they stood and cheered and screamed for their teammates. They wanted to support their friends and teammates. Now, the guys who don't play know they can still affect the game by cheering so they scream and cheer when Garnett, Allen and Pierce are playing. The Celtics have developed a strong relationship. They are more than just teammates. They are brothers. The result: the Boston Celtics won the championship and are considered the favorites to win the Eastern Conference championship again this year. There is a saying that goes, \\"A successful team beats with one heart.\\" If that is the case, the Celtics may have the biggest heart in the NBA.

Rob Cooper. Last updated at 5:15 PM on 2nd December 2011. A gang of armed robbers dressed up as firefighters as a ruse to gain access to safe rooms before holding up shops at gunpoint. Darren Lloyd, 35, was the mastermind who led the group as they repeatedly raided cash-in-transit deliveries in east London, using stolen cars and false number plates. The robbers, who included a former police officer, were being watched by Flying Squad detectives as they staked out targets throughout the summer and autumn of last year. Hold-up: An armed robber, dressed in a real fireman's uniform, holds up a Co-op store after talking his way into the backroom. Today Lloyd was facing years behind bars after being found guilty of 12 counts of conspiracy to rob. Six other men had already admitted similar offences. By December the gang changed their strategy by deploying a robber inside shops, dressed in the distinctive maroon firefighter's uniform and yellow helmet to gain access to safe rooms. Lloyd planned 12 separate raids which netted at least £43,000. Some of them were cancelled at short notice. London fireman Russell Williams, 39,. was recruited to supply bona fide uniforms to ex-police officer Gary. Griffiths, 42, who wore the distinctive kit and armed himself with a. pistol to threaten shop staff and demand cash. Griffiths was caught after a detective spotted the 'distinctive features' of his former colleague on CCTV. A shopworker hands over the money to the bogus firefighters who typically used the ruse that they had been alerted to an alarm going off. Weapon recovered: An imitation firearm found in December last year as police arrested ringleader Darren Lloyd. Darren Lloyd was arrested by armed officers in December last year when he was caught red-handed as he scrambled from the wreckage of a high-powered Volvo getaway car, having crashed in to a garden during a police chase. Two imitation handguns he had discarded were found nearby and a shop till was still inside the vehicle. Lloyd's capture ended a year-long Flying Squad operation to round-up members of the robbery team, who had been committing crimes just a few streets away from their own homes in east London. Prosecutor Michael Shaw said: 'They were a pretty close-knit bunch and generally robbed locations close to where they lived, venues they were familiar with and knew how to get away from.' The robberies were clustered around Dagenham and Chadwell Heath in London. Lloyd, from Dagenham, Essex, was. convicted of 12 counts of conspiracy to rob between July 1 and December. 14 last year and four counts of having an imitation firearm with intent,. after a month-long trial at the Old Bailey. Five. others - Griffiths, Joshua McEvilley, Ben Garforth, Jason Stacey and. Peter Henderson have all admitted their involvement in the conspiracy. and will be sentenced alongside Lloyd on a date to be fixed. Facing jail: Darren Lloyd, 35, who was the mastermind behind the robberies, left, is facing a lengthy jail term after being found guilty at the Old Bailey. Gary Griffiths, right, a former Met Police officer is also facing jail for his role in the conspiracy. Facing custody: Ben Garforth and Peter Henderson have also both admitted their role in the conspiracy and will be sentenced on a date to be fixed. An. eighth man, Russell Williams, a firefighter, 39, from Cheshunt,. Hertfordshire, had previously pleaded guilty to assisting an offender. The court heard Griffiths, 42, was captured on camera inside Premier Foods in Dagenham, Essex, posing as a firefighter on December 5 last year and stealing £2,000 in takings. Griffiths could be seen asking to be directed in to a back room where he brandished an imitation firearm and took the cash. Shop assistant Sivavakeethar Sivakumaran said: 'He asked if there was a fire alarm going on and said they had some alarm on their system. 'He was in uniform and I didn't even think about it. I just thought it was a fireman. Then he came to the office and pulled a gun on me and asked for the safe.' On that occasion Lloyd, the second robber, wearing a distinctive patterned bandana across his face, waited at the front door of the shop to make sure they were not disturbed. Awaiting sentence: Frank Nesbitt, left, and Joshua McEvilley who are both likely to be jailed when they are sentenced. Both men then fled in a black VW Passat which was waiting outside. Detective Constable Andy Burrows later spotted Griffiths, who he first met when he joined the Metropolitan Police in 1994, on the footage. Facing jail: Jason Stacey was the final man caught after the year-long police investigation. 'When I began I was based at Bethnal Green police station,' said Det Con Burrows. 'I met Gary Griffiths there. We both played rugby for the station side and I played against him in Sunday matches. 'He is known to me as an associate and from looking at the CCTV the person wearing the uniform is Gary Griffiths. 'There are several points in the footage when his face is directed towards the camera and it is from these shots of his face that I can recognise him. 'His face has distinctive features, especially his nose, which is broken in a few places.' After the verdict, Detective Superintendent John Kielty, from the Flying Squad, said: 'These men made a lucrative career of carrying out robberies and were a highly organised and violent team. They carefully planned their actions and targets using disguises and firearms during offences. 'The Flying Squad began a proactive operation against these armed criminals to make sure they were held to account for the fear they subjected their victims to during these robberies. 'The gang were responsible for a significant number of crimes in Dagenham and the surrounding areas and I'm very pleased at today's convictions which bring an end to this complex investigation by the Flying Squad.' Dave Brown, Assistant Commissioner for the London Fire Brigade's Operations and Mobilising, said: 'If members of the public have any concerns about the identity of our staff they should ask to see their ID card. If people are still unsure they can call the number on the card to verify the identity of the firefighter.'

Even though attacking Tbilisi was not a primary goal for the Armenians it was an alarming immediate threat to the Georgian government. The mobilization order was not issued earlier than December 18 and approved only 2 days later. Commander Jugheli was put in charge of the ill-disciplined Georgian National Guard troops in Katharinenfeld while general Akhmetashvili was appointed commander in chief of the Georgian army forces in the Lori theatre. Jugheli's 600 men encamped in a poorly and carelessly organised position without even posting guards allowing Armenian militia to sneak up on them overnight and capture several canons and machineguns and position themselves on the roofs to surprise the Georgians. However, despite the momentum the Armenians had gained, the Georgians with Jugheli leading them while under attack managed to recapture the equipment in close combat and forced the Armenians out of town, but with heavy casualties, losing 30 killed and 70 wounded. The Armenians also suffered heavy losses during retreat with 100 killed and 100 taken prisoner when they were run down by Georgian cavalry led by Colonel Cholokashvili. Georgian troops crossed the river Khrami with the first main objective to crush the Armenian force in the Dagheti-Samshvilde area. The Armenian troops including 500 well-entrenched militia were engaged by Georgian artillery and on 24 December the villages Dagheti, Bolnisi, Khacheni and Samshvilde were captured by the Georgian army eliminating most of the resistance in the process. how many Armenians were lost before December 24?","output":"Before December 24, 100 Armenian soldiers were killed and 100 were taken prisoner."},{"instruction":"While preparing for a meeting, Bill fills Dixie cups with water from out of a water cooler.

If Bill fills one cup of water per each meeting chair, and there are 5 rows of meeting chairs with 10 chairs in each row, then how many ounces of water will be left in the cooler after all cups have been are filled? (There are 128 ounces in a gallon.) Let's think first. Chain of thought:","output":"1. Determine the total number of chairs in the meeting room: There are 5 rows of chairs with 10 chairs in each row, so there are 5 * 10 = 50 chairs in total. 2. Calculate how much water Bill needs to fill all the cups: Since each Dixie cup holds 6 ounces of water and there are 50 chairs, Bill will need 6 * 50 = 300 ounces of water to fill all the cups. 3. Determine the initial amount of water in the water cooler in ounces: The water cooler initially contains 3 gallons of water, and since there are 128 ounces in a gallon, then the water cooler initially contains 3 * 128 = 384 ounces of water. 4. Calculate the amount of water left in the cooler after all cups have been filled: To determine how much water will be left in the cooler, subtract the amount of water Bill needs to fill the cups (300 ounces) from the initial amount of water in the cooler (384 ounces).

Q: Background Paragraph: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Story: Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land.

Given the context: What will Casey want to do next? Possible answers: not a man of good character, laugh next, express anger next Answer:","output":"In this situation, Casey would most likely want to express anger next. This is because Robin has forcefully imposed himself upon them, despite their immediate and strong resistance. Such behavior is a direct violation of Casey's personal boundaries, autonomy, and consent. As a result, Casey is likely to feel threatened, disrespected, and violated. Expressing anger is a natural response to such a situation as it is a way for an individual to assert their boundaries and convey their feelings of discomfort and violation. Casey would want to communicate their disapproval of Robin's actions and make it clear that such behavior is unacceptable. It is important to recognize that the answer options provided imply different reactions from Casey. Here's a brief analysis of the other two possibilities: 1. Not a man of good character: This statement seems to be a judgment of Robin's character rather than a direct response to the situation. While Casey might certainly feel that Robin's actions reflect poorly on him and form a negative opinion about his character, it does not address Casey's immediate reaction to the act. 2. Laugh next: This response would be highly unlikely in this context. Laughter is typically associated with humor, amusement, or relief, none of which are relevant emotions for Casey to experience given the situation. In fact, laughing in response to such an act might be misinterpreted as condoning or downplaying the severity of Robin's actions, which would be contrary to Casey's feelings of discomfort and the need to convey their disapproval. In conclusion, given the context of the situation, Casey would most probably want to express anger next as it allows them to assert boundaries, convey feelings of violation, and communicate their disapproval of Robin's actions. This reaction would be more in line with their emotions and overall response in comparison to the other answer options provided."},{"instruction":"Allen Welsh Dulles (; April 7, 1893 - January 29, 1969) was an American diplomat and lawyer who became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), and its longest-serving director to date. As head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the early Cold War, he oversaw the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat, Operation Ajax (the overthrow of Iran's elected government), the Lockheed U-2 aircraft program and the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Dulles was one of the members of the Warren Commission. Between his stints of government service, Dulles was a corporate lawyer and partner at Sullivan & Cromwell. DCI Smith recruited Dulles to oversee the agency's covert operations as Deputy Director for Plans, a position he held from January 4, 1951. On August 23, 1951, Dulles was promoted to Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, second in the intelligence hierarchy. After the election of Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, Bedell Smith shifted to the Department of State and Dulles became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence. The Agency's covert operations were an important part of the Eisenhower administration's new Cold War national security policy known as the \\"New Look\\". At Dulles' request, President Eisenhower demanded that Senator Joseph McCarthy discontinue issuing subpoenas against the CIA. In March 1950, McCarthy had initiated a series of investigations into potential communist subversion of the Agency. Although none of the investigations revealed any wrongdoing, the hearings were potentially damaging, not only to the CIA's reputation but also to the security of sensitive information. Documents made public in 2004 revealed that the CIA, under Dulles' orders, had broken into McCarthy's Senate office and fed disinformation to him in order to discredit him, in order to stop his investigation of communist infiltration of the CIA. In the early 1950s, the United States Air Force conducted a competition for a new photo reconnaissance aircraft. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation's Skunk Works submitted a design number called the CL-282, which married sailplane-like wings to the body of a supersonic interceptor. This aircraft was rejected by the Air Force, but several of the civilians on the review board took notice, and Edwin Land presented a proposal for the aircraft to Dulles. The aircraft became what is known as the U-2 'spy plane', and it was initially operated by CIA pilots. Its introduction into operational service in 1957 greatly enhanced the CIA's ability to monitor Soviet activity through overhead photo surveillance. The aircraft eventually entered service with the Air Force. The Soviet Union shot down and captured a U-2 in 1960 during Dulles' term as CIA chief. Dulles is considered one of the essential creators of the modern United States intelligence system and was an indispensable guide to clandestine operations during the Cold War. He established intelligence networks worldwide to check and counter Soviet and eastern European communist advances as well as international communist movements. What was \\"New Look\\" about?","output":"The \\"New Look\\" was a national security policy adopted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration in the United States during the early years of the Cold War. This policy aimed to address the growing tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union by focusing on a cost-effective strategy that relied on nuclear deterrence and a strong, technologically advanced military. The New Look policy sought to achieve several objectives: 1. Reduce defense spending without compromising national security: By prioritizing the development of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, the U.S. could maintain a strong military deterrent against the Soviet Union with a smaller, more affordable military force. 2. Maintain a strong nuclear deterrent: The policy emphasized the importance of a powerful nuclear arsenal for both offensive and defensive purposes, recognizing that the threat of mutually assured destruction would discourage aggression from both superpowers. 3. Utilize covert operations to counter Soviet influence: Under the New Look policy, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was given a more prominent role in international affairs, conducting covert operations to counter Soviet influence and support friendly governments around the world. 4. Form alliances with friendly nations: The policy promoted the formation of alliances with other countries, such as NATO and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), to strengthen collective defense efforts and provide a buffer against Soviet expansion. Overall, the New Look policy represented a shift in U.S. defense and foreign policy strategies, emphasizing the importance of nuclear power and covert operations while reducing conventional military forces."},{"instruction":"Solve 6*o - 2*o + 24 = 0 for o. Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the given equation, 6*o - 2*o + 24 = 0, for variable o, we'll use basic algebraic concepts and operations step by step as follows: Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining the like terms. The like terms are terms with the same variable, in this case, 6*o and -2*o. Add them together. 6*o - 2*o + 24 = (6 - 2) * o + 24 This simplifies to: 4*o + 24 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable o. Next, we'll get the variable o by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll move the constant term to the other side of the equation (opposite side). To move the 24 to the other side, we subtract it from both sides of the equation: 4*o + 24 - 24 = 0 - 24 This simplifies to: 4*o = -24 Step 3: Solve for o. Now, we just need to get o by itself (without the coefficient 4). To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 4: 4*o / 4 = -24 / 4 This simplifies to: o = -6 So, the solution for o is -6."},{"instruction":"Do these questions have the same meaning? Which famous Indians are on Quora? Which Indian celebrities are on Quora?","output":"While these two questions seem similar at first glance, they do not have the exact same meaning. However, they do share some overlap in the possible answers that could be generated. Let us break down each question and see what exactly differentiates them. Question 1: \\"Which famous Indians are on Quora?\\" This question is seeking information about famous individuals from India who are active on Quora, one of the popular question-and-answer platforms. The term \\"famous Indians\\" here encompasses a broad range of people who have gained popularity or recognition in various fields. This could include well-known figures from politics, science, technology, business, sports, entertainment, and more. The main criteria for inclusion in this category is that the individual is widely recognized, and they are of Indian origin or nationality. Some possible answers to this question might include: 1. Anand Kumar - An Indian mathematician and founder of the 'Super 30' program that helps underprivileged students get into IITs. 2. Shashi Tharoor - An Indian politician, author, and former United Nations diplomat. 3. Chetan Bhagat - An Indian author, columnist, and motivational speaker. Question 2: \\"Which Indian celebrities are on Quora?\\" This question is specifically asking about Indian celebrities who are active on Quora. The term \\"celebrity\\" often refers to individuals who are famous in the entertainment industry, such as actors, singers, musicians, and television personalities. Additionally, celebrity status can sometimes extend to sports stars, social media influencers, and other public figures whose fame is primarily derived from their work in entertainment or related fields. Some possible answers to this question might include: 1. Kailash Kher - An Indian playback singer and music composer. 2. Biswapati Sarkar - An Indian writer and director known for his work with the digital comedy platform 'The Viral Fever.' Despite having different meanings, both questions can lead to overlapping answers. For instance, some answerers consider a famous Indian who is popular for their work in the entertainment industry as both a \\"famous Indian\\" and a \\"celebrity.\\" Essentially, the difference lies in the scope and the focus of the questions. The first question has a wider scope, asking for famous Indians from all walks of life, while the second question is more focused, specifically asking for Indian celebrities, who are usually associated with the entertainment industry. In conclusion, while there is some overlap in the potential answers to the questions, they do not have the same meaning. Each question is seeking information about specific subsets of well-known Indian figures, with one inquiring about famous Indians from various fields, and the other focusing primarily on celebrities from the entertainment industry."},{"instruction":"Given the question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Police say they were first called out to the 2300 block of Wildwood Road Wednesday around 3:35 p.m. to perform a welfare check on an individual. Upon arrival, police discovered the body of 22-year-old Landon Dooley inside. The residence was the home of Landon, his parents and his sister. Further investigation led officers about a block away to the home of Landon's grandmother, not far from the Portsmouth city line at the intersection of George Washington Highway North and Wintergreen Drive. An armed person -- later identified as 26-year-old Cameron Dooley -- was barricaded inside. Cameron and Landon are brothers. A police department spokeswoman says officers negotiated with the suspect for hours, and witnesses say they saw the SWAT team outside of the home. Police made their way inside early Thursday morning, where officers found five more bodies, including Cameron's. Friends and neighbors tell 13News Now all six people were members of the Dooley family, who were prominent in the community and members of the Temple Baptist Church of Chesapeake. On social media, friends and surviving relatives have shown outpouring of grief and condolences for the Dooley family. In addition to Cameron and Landon, police say the other victims were their parents, 50-year-old Steven Todd Dooley and 54-year-old Lori Dooley, as well as their sister, 17-year-old Brooke Dooley.

One person tweeted that the \\"tears are just flowing\\" Thursday at Deep Creek High, and that there is a just an overwhelming sense of sadness. Among the victims was a cheerleader from Deep Creek High School. From what we've gathered through social media, we know that Brooke was a girl who was dearly loved. She appeared to have a lot of friends, was on the cheerleading team, and seemed to be very involved. The cheer squad has its own Facebook page, and its profile picture was recently changed to a picture of Brooke, with comments from people talking about how great of person she was and how she will be dearly missed. The father of Brooke's boyfriend says it is tough and the community is hurting, but could not comment any further. 13News Now reached out to the school district to see if grief counselors were on site, but they said no information could be given, because this is an active and ongoing police investigation.

Their daughter – a cheerleader – and their son, painted purple at football games in yearbook photos. A grandmother who helped build up the community’s church. Three generations of one family are gone, killed in a murder-suicide that spanned two crime scenes a block apart in Deep Creek. Police said Thursday that Cameron Dooley, 26, shot and killed his father, Steven Todd Dooley, 50; mother, Lori Dooley, 54; brother, Landon Dooley, 22; sister, Brooke Dooley, 17; and a fifth person neighbors identified as his grandmother, Doris Dooley. Then, after negotiating with police for hours through the night, Cameron fatally shot himself. It’s not clear when he fired the shots that killed his family. Monday was the last day Brooke was seen at school and the last time Todd showed up for work. He retired less than three months ago, after 25 years with the Chesapeake Police Department, and had started working at a dive shop in Virginia Beach. Neighbors said they felt stunned Thursday as the news spread through the community. Teenagers shared stories about Brooke. New co-workers spoke of Todd’s passion for diving. A lifetime of friends gathered at the church that Doris’ late husband led for decades. All asked why, but none had an answer. Related +4 Deep Creek community comes together at service for Dooley family A long line of people from the Deep Creek community joined together at Temple Baptist Church Thursday night to pray, hug and cry. The group supported one another and remembered members of the Dooley family, who died in a murder-suicide. ___ It began with a call to police Wednesday afternoon, someone asking for an officer to check on Todd and Lori’s house in the 2300 block of Wildwood Road. When officers arrived, they found Landon’s body inside. At 7 p.m. – about three and a half hours later – the investigation led police to his grandmother’s house one block away, at George Washington Highway and Wintergreen Drive. Cameron was barricaded inside, police said. Cheryl Harris, who lives on nearby Ferndale Road, said she was sitting in her living room Wednesday evening when she saw blue lights: police, fire, EMS. “I knew it was a bad situation because they all came in without sirens,” said Harris, a retired Portsmouth dispatcher. She watched as officers set up barricades and shut down traffic near the two houses. For hours, a negotiator spoke to Cameron over a loudspeaker, trying to get him to come outside. “Let’s talk,” Harris said she heard the negotiator saying. “We can work this out.” Harris heard no gunshots. About 2:10 a.m. Thursday, officers went in and found Cameron and the others dead. They said they think Cameron killed his family before police arrived at the scene. ___ Desiree Darst and her husband, who live a few doors down, couldn’t tell for sure which house police had surrounded Wednesday night because officers had blocked off much of the street. They were stunned when they realized it was the Dooley house on the corner. “I knew Todd, I used to babysit him,” Darst said. “He was really good friends with my brother.” Doris and her late husband, the Rev. Allen Dooley, moved to Chesapeake in the late 1960s. Allen was pastor of Temple Baptist Church down the street, and the couple built up the church community during their years there. Many Brentwood residents, including Darst’s grandfather, attended services there, she said. In the years after Allen died, Doris’ health began to decline, Darst said. Cameron moved in to help take care of her. He would walk from his grandmother’s house to his parents’ home about a block away. “That’s how we know him,” Darst said. “He’d stop by and talk. He’d come in and chit-chat.” They last saw him five days ago. Doris was planning to sell her house and move in with her daughter, Darst said. Relatives from North Carolina had been in town recently to help clear some items from the house. “It hasn’t sunk in yet,” Darst said. The old Deep Creek neighborhood, where residents all know and look after one another, is “still hanging on,” she added. “It won’t be the same.” Related +7 About the Dooley family Chesapeake police say six members of the Dooley family were found dead this week in a murder-suicide that took place at two houses in Deep Creek. This is what we know about them. ___ Todd Dooley had been an active member of the Police Department’s dive team and Marine Patrol unit. He retired on Nov. 1, said police spokeswoman Kelly O’Sullivan. This past fall, Todd started working full time at Lynnhaven Dive Center in Virginia Beach. Owner Lindsey Hillier Hotchkiss and service department manager Blake Hughes had known him for nearly 14 years. He came in a lot for recreational diving and to drop off equipment to be serviced for police. “We had been talking about him coming to work here for the past couple of years,” Hillier Hotchkiss said. “He was very excited about it.” Todd serviced the scuba equipment that was brought in by recreational divers and by public safety and military dive teams that they work with, Hillier Hotchkiss said. He already knew how to do a lot of it from his work with the police dive team. “He fit in perfect,” she said. “He was such a good team player and team member.” Todd liked to dive locally, as well as in the Florida Keys and at Bonaire in the Caribbean. He loved Jimmy Buffett and would go see him every time he came to town. Neither Hillier Hotchkiss nor Hughes knew why Todd didn’t come to work Tuesday or Wednesday. The center is laid back, and it’s not a big deal if someone doesn’t come in. Todd had been sick a couple of weeks ago and was out for a week then. He also had taken time off when his daughter was sick. “It was peculiar, but I didn’t think anything of it,” Hughes said. He just assumed Todd wasn’t feeling well. Luke Gray, a sales associate at the center, said Todd’s wife, Lori, worked at an orthodontist’s office in Virginia Beach. Gray was a patient of the office, and his sister works there. Lori was the one who put on his braces and took them off. “Lori was a very heartwarming, lovable person,” Gray said. “She had nothing but a smile on her face every time that I saw her. … She was like the mother hen of the office. She looked out for everyone.” Related Kerry Dougherty: The horror in Chesapeake There are no answers today. There may never be. A week, a month, a year from now, we’ll still struggle to understand what triggered the ghastly events in two Chesapeake houses this week. ___ Chesapeake Public Schools did not have any record of Cameron Dooley attending school in the division, spokeswoman Kellie Goral wrote in an email. Police have not said what may have motivated the shootings or how Cameron got the gun. Landon Dooley graduated from Deep Creek High School in 2012, according to a school yearbook. Pictures show him dressed up for skits at pep rallies and painted purple at football games. Brooke Dooley, who was studying nursing at Deep Creek High’s Science and Medicine Academy, would have turned 18 in February, according to her mother’s Facebook page. She was a varsity cheerleader at the high school. Deep Creek High graduates Devin Perkins and Marissa Bolen, who became good friends with Brooke several years ago, said she was goofy and talkative. “You wouldn’t be able to get a word in,” Bolen said. Often, she would get so excited when telling a story that she stuttered in an effort to talk faster. “We’d have to tell her to calm down,” Bolen said, laughing. The Dooleys treated Brooke’s friends like family and welcomed the teens into their home. “They were a church-oriented, loving family,” Perkins said. “You never went in that house and felt judgment.” On Thursday, purple paint stained the Dooleys’ driveway on Wildwood Road – remnants of an afternoon six years ago when Marissa and Brooke doodled on the concrete. Todd was mad at Brooke when he saw it, but not for long. “She had him wrapped around her finger,” Bolen said. “She was daddy’s little girl.” Pilot writers Cindy Clayton, Mike Connors, Mary Beth Gahan and Jane Harper contributed to this report. ||||| CHESAPEAKE, Va. (WAVY) — Forensics investigators were back at the scene Friday collecting more evidence from a Chesapeake home where a family was killed. Six members of the same family were found dead early Thursday morning following an apparent murder-suicide in the Deep Creek section of Chesapeake. The suspect has been identified as 26-year-old Cameron Dooley. He is accused of killing his 17-year-old sister Brooke, his 22-year-old brother Landon, his mother Lori, his father Steven “Todd” and his grandmother Doris Dooley. All of the victims were shot, according to police. Brooke Dooley and her father Todd Dooley were victims of a murder-suicide in Chesapeake, Va., according to a reliable WAVY News 10 source.

(Photo courtesy: Facebook) Investigators are now working to put together the timeline of the incident as well as a possible motive for the shooting. On Thursday, police released a preliminary timeline of the events leading up to the discovery that the family members had been killed. According to Kelly O’Sullivan with Chesapeake Police, officers were called to the 2300 block of Wildwood Road around 3:35 p.m. Wednesday to check on the welfare of a person. That is when they found Landon Dooley dead inside the home. Photos: Six dead in Chesapeake murder-suicide Further investigation by police at Wildwood Road led them to another home at the intersection of North George Washington Highway and Wintergreen Drive — a few blocks from the first scene. Once there, officers found an armed person who would not come out of the home, now identified as Cameron Dooley. Police blocked off the neighborhood and tried to negotiate with the person to get him to come out of the house. After several hours, officers entered the home in the early morning hours of Thursday, and found five people dead — including Cameron, who shot himself. According to O’Sullivan, investigators believe Cameron killed his family members before officers got to the home Wednesday evening. “We lived across the street from them about eight years ago or seven years, and I knew them and I went to school with them, and it was like I didn’t believe it,” said Brittni Phillips who attended Deep Creek High School with Cameron Dooley. Phillips added, “They were a church family. It’s something that you don’t expect coming from a family like that. They were a very close-knit family and had a lot of ties to the community. A WAVY Viewer sent 10 On Your Side an 18-minute video from the night of the incident: “I heard the loud speakers from the SWAT team. I heard some shots,” said Kimberly Karika, who lives nearby. “I live on Canal and so I heard most of what went on, so I was up a lot of the night and heard everything that was going on…I just couldn’t believe it; I was in complete shock.” Investigators say they believe this all stemmed from a domestic incident. Medical examiners arrived on the scene at Wintergreen Drive around 6:45 a.m. to remove the victims’ bodies from the home. At one point, a local chaplain went out to the scene to talk to police officers. The deadly shooting has left residents of the Deep Creek community shocked. Ben Pilkington was friends with the youngest victim, 17-year-old Brooke Dooley, who was a cheerleader at Deep Creek High School. He said, “She was a great person and never hurt anybody.” Todd Dooley was a former Chesapeake Marine Police Officer. “I describe him as an all round great guy,” said Lindsey Hillier-Hotchkiss. “He was a church going, good family man and loved his work as a police officer.” Todd retired from the department and started working at the Lynnhaven Dive Center in Virginia Beach in October. He didn’t show up for work on Tuesday. It is unknown why. Family friends said the grandmother, Doris Dooley, was very involved in her church Temple Baptist right down the street from her home. Her late husband was once pastor of the church. A neighbor across the street talked to 10 On Your Side’s Rico Bush, and gave his reaction to the traumatic events. “It’s crazy, it’s too much. I’m right beside it,” Demetrius Peacock said. “My family and I don’t feel safe.” A man who lives near the house on Wintergreen said, “It hits Deep Creek hard. But, knowing Deep Creek, we’re going to be able get through this. We just have to be able to get away from the sad parts, and look at the memories of Brooke her family — and remember the good things about them.” A vigil was held for the family Thursday night at the Temple Baptist parking lot. A GoFundMe account has been set up to help the family pay for funeral expenses, according to family members. 10 On Your Side’s Andy Fox is in Chesapeake working to get more information.

The paper, published this March in Psychology and Aging, examined health and welfare surveys from roughly 40,000 Germans between ages 18 and 96. The surveys were conducted every year from 1993 to 2003. Survey respondents were asked to estimate their present and future life satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10, among other questions. The researchers found that young adults (age 18 to 39) routinely overestimated their future life satisfaction, while middle-aged adults (age 40 to 64) more accurately predicted how they would feel in the future. Adults of 65 and older, however, were far more likely to underestimate their future life satisfaction. Not only did they feel more satisfied than they thought they would, the older pessimists seemed to suffer a lower ratio of disability and death for the study period. \\"We observed that being too optimistic in predicting a better future than actually observed was associated with a greater risk of disability and a greater risk of death within the following decade,\\" wrote Frieder R. Lang, a professor at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. Lang and his colleagues believed that people who were pessimistic about their future may be more careful about their actions than people who expected a rosy future. \\"Seeing a dark future may encourage positive evaluations of the actual self and may contribute to taking improved precautions ,\\" the authors wrote. Surprisingly, compared with those in poor health or who had low incomes, respondents who enjoyed good health or income were associated with expecting a greater decline. Also, the researchers said that higher income was related to a greater risk of disability. The authors of the study noted that there were limitations to their conclusions. Illness, medical treatment and personal loss could also have driven health... What is the clear conclusion of the study? A) Pessimism guarantees chances of survival.

Translate to English English:","output":"The economic potential of the temporary movement of service providers is particularly emphasized in the European migration program (11). The European migration program highlights the significance of temporary movement of service providers in terms of economic potential. This program aims to facilitate and encourage a more efficient allocation of resources, promote economic development, and foster growth within the European market. By allowing service providers to temporarily move and work in different countries, the program supports the exchange of knowledge, skills, and expertise among various regions. This, in turn, contributes to the overall competitiveness and innovation within the European economy. Within the context of the European migration program, the temporary movement of service providers may take several forms. This includes intra-corporate transfers of employees from one branch to another, self-employed individuals providing services to clients in other Member States, and temporary work assignments for professionals in sectors such as ICT, healthcare, research and development, and engineering. One of the key benefits of the temporary movement of service providers is the opportunity for companies to access a wider range of skills and competencies. When professionals move from one country to another, they bring with them expertise that may be scarce or unavailable in the local labor market. This, in turn, can help address skills gaps and drive innovation in the receiving country. Furthermore, the temporary movement of service providers can contribute to greater economic integration within the European Union. This is achieved by fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among companies and professionals from different Member States. As a result, the European market becomes more connected, benefiting from increased competitiveness and economies of scale. As the temporary movement of service providers is an important aspect of the European migration program, several measures have been put in place to support this type of mobility. These include the EU Blue Card Directive, which aims to facilitate the entry and residence of highly-skilled, non-EU workers, and the Posted Workers Directive, which ensures fair working conditions for employees temporarily working in another Member State. In conclusion, the economic potential of the temporary movement of service providers is a key aspect of the European migration program. By fostering greater mobility among professionals, this program aims to promote economic growth, competitiveness, and innovation within the European market. Furthermore, the temporary movement of service providers contributes to addressing skills gaps and fostering greater economic integration among Member States."},{"instruction":"Given the rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer.

Al-Nimr's final appeal has been rejected and he could be executed any day. \\"For other people every hour is composed of 60 minutes, but for me every hour is 60 beats of pain,\\" his mother says. She says her son, now 21, was protesting peacefully and was tortured so badly in custody that she didn't recognize him at first.

Expand this summary.","output":"In a heart-wrenching appeal to the international community, a Saudi Arabian mother is pleading for intervention on behalf of her son, Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, who faces a gruesome punishment of beheading and crucifixion of his corpse. Nusra al-Ahmed, the mother of the accused, has solicited help from President Obama in particular, as she believes he can use his global influence to save her son. The incident that resulted in al-Nimr's conviction occurred when he was just a 17-years-old, participating in anti-government protests. His mother claims that her son was protesting peacefully and did not steal any property or commit violent acts. Although al-Nimr's final appeal has been rejected, his mother remains hopeful as she describes the emotional turmoil her family is in. Describing her son's torture in custody, she recalls not recognizing him when she visited him in prison. Advocates for al-Nimr argue that he is being subjected to such a severe punishment only to deter other protesters, and criticize Saudi Arabia for its treatment of a juvenile whose actions were non-violent. While President Obama has yet to publicly respond to the plea, an Obama administration official has mentioned that the United States is \\"deeply concerned\\" about the case and has urged the Saudi government to \\"respect universal human rights and its international obligations.\\" Ali Mohammed al-Nimr's case has brought significant attention to the overall human rights situation in Saudi Arabia, with various international human rights organizations stating that the Saudi government has been using executions to suppress dissent, quell protests, and silence political opponents. Additionally, the case has raised questions about rules and regulations surrounding juvenile convicts internationally. As Nusra al-Ahmed appeals to President Obama and the international community, it is a potent reminder of the strength and courage shared by families who face such harrowing circumstances. She speaks with humility and sincere belief in the inherent goodness of people, hoping her pleas will be heard and that her son will be rescued from what she terms as a \\"great tragedy.\\" Whether or not President Obama chooses to interfere in this case, his decision could determine the fate of Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, and set a precedent for how the international community handles such human rights violations in the future."},{"instruction":"Do these questions have the same meaning? How do I start acting career? How should I start my acting career?","output":"While both questions aim to gather information about beginning an acting career, they differ slightly in their focus and tone. 1. \\"How do I start acting career?\\" This question is less specific and more general, focusing on the overall process and steps to start an acting career. It implies that the person asking the question might want to learn about the basics of entering the acting industry and the expectations they should have. The question almost sounds like the person is newly considering an acting career and might not have a solid plan in place. A detailed response to this question might include: To start an acting career, you need to follow these steps: a. Research and learn about the acting industry: Familiarize yourself with the acting terminology, job titles, working environment, and overall structure of the industry. This will help you understand what to expect as you begin your career. b. Develop your acting skills: Attend acting classes, workshops, or join a local theater group to gain practical experience and improve your skills. You can focus on different styles/genres of acting (i.e., theater, film, television, commercials, etc.) or on specific areas such as voice training, accents, or physical acting techniques. c. Build a portfolio: Create an acting resume showcasing your training, skills, and any acting experiences you have had. Hire a professional photographer to take high-quality headshots that accurately represent your look and personality. Make sure to include essential contact information, such as your name, phone number, and email address, on both your resume and headshots. d. Networking: Attend industry events, such as workshops, conferences, and networking gatherings, to meet people working in the acting field. Establish connections with casting directors, agents, fellow actors, and other professionals in the entertainment industry. e. Find auditions: Look for casting calls and acting auditions on various platforms, such as casting websites, social media groups, and industry publications. Be persistent in submitting your resume and headshots to secure auditions. f. Get representation: Having an agent or manager can be beneficial for your acting career. They can help you find suitable roles, negotiate contracts, and offer guidance and support as your career progresses. g. Develop a professional online presence: Create a personal website showcasing your headshots, acting resume, and a reel (if you have one). Also, consider using social media platforms to market yourself and connect with others in the acting community. h. Keep learning and growing: Always look for opportunities to improve your acting skills and stay updated on industry trends and best practices. Progress in the acting industry is often gradual, so remain patient and persistent as you work towards your dreams. 2. \\"How should I start my acting career?\\" This question is more personal, as it uses the word \\"my,\\" implying that the person asking may already have some experience or personal preferences when it comes to acting. They might be seeking more tailored advice, taking into account specific information about their background, aspirations, location, age, and other factors relevant to their unique situation. A detailed response to this question might include the steps mentioned above, along with personalized advice taking into consideration the individual's specific circumstances and goals. For example: - If they live in a small town or a city without a thriving entertainment industry, they could start by joining local theater productions or acting groups to build up their experience. - If they have aspirations to work in film and television, it may be useful for them to consider relocating to a city such as Los Angeles, New York, London, or any other place with a more established acting community. - Depending on their age, they might look into specific opportunities, such as youth theater programs or community college classes, to cultivate their acting skills. In conclusion, while both questions revolve around the idea of starting an acting career, the first one is more general and focuses on the overall process, while the second one is directed towards personal advice tailored to the individual's unique circumstances and aspirations."},{"instruction":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Movie title: Deepstar Six Movie plot: DeepStar Six is an experimental deep sea US Naval facility, crewed by a mix of military and civilians, now in the final week of their tour. The project is headed by Dr. Van Gelder, in order to test underwater colonization methods, while overseeing the installation of a new nuclear missile storage platform. Already nearing his deadline, Van Gelder's plans are threatened when geologist Burciaga (Elya Baskin) discovers a massive cavern system under the site. Van Gelder orders the use of depth charges to collapse the cavern, to the dismay of Dr. Scarpelli (Nia Peeples), who want to study the potentially primordial ecosystem inside. The ensuing detonation collapses part of the seabed, forming a massive fissure in the ocean floor. Submarine pilots Osborne and Hodges (Ronn Carroll, Thom Bray) send an unmanned probe to explore, but lose contact and venture in after it. Upon finding the probe, they detect a large sonar contact moments before being attacked and killed by an unseen force. The aggressor then attacks the observation pod, leaving Joyce Collins (Nancy Everhard) and a dying Burciaga trapped inside as it teeters on the edge of the ravine. Captain Laidlaw (Taurean Blacque) and submarine pilot McBride (Greg Evigan)- who is also Collins' paramour -attempt a rescue. They dock with the pod and rescue Collins, but the unstable hatch door closes on Laidlaw. Mortally wounded, he floods the compartment, forcing McBride and Collins to return and leave without him. The remaining crew now prepare to abandon the base, but the missile platform must first be secured. Without Laidlaw, facility technician Snyder (Miguel Ferrer) is forced to interpret the unfamiliar protocol. When prompted by the computer to explain the reason, Snyder reports \\"aggression\\" (due to the creature), which the computer interprets as an enemy military force and advises to detonate the missile warheads.

After high school, he wanted to join the U. S. Air Force but he failed because of his poor eyesight. However, his dream remained. At the age of 33, Ted was a truck driver in Los Angeles. One day, while sitting outside in his garden, he watched planes fly overhead and an idea came to him: to use balloons to fly. A few weeks later, Ted bought 42 huge balloons. He tied them to a chair and then he sat down in the chair with some beer, sandwiches and a gun. His plan was to fly to 10 meters above his garden, enjoy a few hours in the air, and then shoot some balloons with his gun to get back down. But things did not go as he planned. Once his friends cut the ropes under Ted's chair, the 42 balloons flew into the sky at an astonishing speed until about 4000 meters above the ground with Ted and his chair. He didn't shoot any of the balloons because he was afraid he might break the balanee of his \\"plane\\". Ted stayed in the sky with his beer and sandwiches for 14 hours, cold and frightened. Planes heading towards Los Angeles' busy international airport reported the strange sight. And Ted' s balloons caused great danger to them. At last, Ted gathered his courage to shoot a few balloons and slowly landed on the ground, where many policemen were waiting for him. Ted made his dream come true, but it cost him: he was fined 1,500 for breaking the law about air safety. When asked by a reporter why he had done it, Ted answered, \\"A man can't just sit around and do nothing; he should have his dream and go for it. \\" Question: Why couldn't Ted join the American Air Force? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Because there was problem with his eyes.\\"?

The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. Question: \\"What gave the OFAC the ability to search for and freeze any Al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system?\\" Response: \\"The Embassy bombings of 1998\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

The patient, a 62-year-old man, was made to sleep, tied with blue drapes and lying face up on a narrow table. But no one was touching him. Instead, the operation was being performed by a robot, whose three metal arms went through pencil-sized holes in the man's chest. At the ends of the robot's arms were tiny metal fingers, with turning wrists, which held a tiny instrument, a light and a camera. The robot's arms and fingers were controlled by Dr. Randall K. Wolf, sitting at a computer in a corner of the operating room about 20 feet away. This sort of operation, heart surgeons say, is the start of what may be the biggest change in their profession since heart bypass surgery began nearly 30 years ago. \\"The reason we make cuts is that we have big hands,\\" said Dr. Wolf, the director of the surgery at Ohio State. The robot's _ fingers, no longer than a nail on the small finger, at the end of the long sticks could work better. Eventually, surgeons believe, most heart surgery will be done by robots whose arms are put in through pencil-sized holes punched in patients' chests. Instead of directly staring into a patient's body, surgeons will view magnified images of the operation on computer screens. In theory, the doctor would not have to be in the same room, or even the same country, as the patient.

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Guyana and Nigeria had thriving economies. Guyana's economy was based on conventional agriculture, while Nigeria attracted an enormous number of tourists to its splendid beaches each year. Which country caused more marine debris? The answer to this question is:","output":"It is difficult to determine definitively which country, Guyana or Nigeria, caused more marine debris without specific data on the waste production and management practices of both countries. However, we can discuss some factors that may contribute to marine debris in both countries. Guyana, located on the northeastern coast of South America, has a smaller population (around 790,000) compared to Nigeria, which is situated in West Africa and has a population of more than 200 million. Guyana's primarily agricultural economy may contribute to marine pollution through the use of agricultural chemicals and waste entering water systems, but the country's smaller population and lack of industrialization may limit the amount of overall debris. Nigeria, on the other hand, has a large population and a more diverse economy that includes tourism, oil, and agriculture. Nigeria's numerous beaches, coupled with the country's thriving tourism industry, could potentially lead to a higher rate of marine debris due to increased human activities along the coastlines. In addition, Nigeria has a large oil industry, which may contribute to marine pollution from spills or offshore drilling operations. Based on population size and economic factors, it can be hypothesized that Nigeria may contribute more to marine debris than Guyana.

Part 1: Reunion and Discovery The six friends, bound together by their shared past, gather for their annual weekend reunion at the peaceful Pine Grove Resort. Tensions and unresolved conflicts from the past quickly resurface as they catch up on each other's lives. One night, after venturing deep into the surrounding woods for an impromptu game of Truth or Dare, the group inadvertently stumbles upon a cabin hidden just outside the town's limits. Curiosity piqued, they manage to break into the cabin only to find a tightly locked room inside. Scared but morbidly fascinated, they finally manage to pry it open, revealing a gruesome surprise - a dead body, decomposing and riddled with bullet holes. Part 2: Whodunit and Investigation Shocked by the grisly discovery, the friends immediately contact the local authorities. The police begin an investigation, and the once quaint town is now filled with fear and confusion. During the course of the investigation, it is revealed that the dead body is that of Richard, a man who disappeared ten years ago under mysterious circumstances. Between assisting the police during the investigation and speculating on the killer's identity, the friends struggle to trust one another as the revelation of long-held secrets dredges up suspicions of betrayal, hidden motives, and concealed guilt. As the secret-laden narrative unfolds, it becomes apparent that each of the friends has something to hide, further complicating the investigation and deepening the rifts within the group. Part 3: Downward Spiral As the police push forward with their investigation, pieces of evidence point in different directions, implicating different friends and suggesting alliances and betrayals none of them were aware of. The central question becomes not just about solving the murder and bringing the killer to justice but about preserving the rapidly deteriorating bonds within the group. Part 4: Climactic Twist and Resolution On the verge of solving the case, the police unexpectedly discover that the locked cabin was owned by the victim, Richard, himself. Richard was in fact compiling damning evidence against a prominent local figure (perhaps a politician or a businessman) with deep ties to organized crime. Unable to bear the death threats and knowing his life was in danger, Richard had chosen to fake his disappearance and hide in the locked cabin to continue his secret investigation. Tragically, however, his past relationship with one of the childhood friends had placed them both in danger, ultimately leading to his murder and the friend's unwitting involvement in a complex and dangerous conspiracy. The film ends with the killer's arrest and the exposure of the criminal organization, while the surviving friends - shaken by the truth and the realization that their long-standing friendship was used as a pawn in a dark game - attempt to come to terms with their guilt, grief, and loss.

The authorities said the pair were engaged in a scheme to sell more than 1m (£603,000) in bitcoins to users of online drug marketplace the Silk Road. The site was shut down last year and its alleged owner was arrested. Mr Shrem, 24, was arrested on Sunday at New York's JFK airport. He was expected to appear in court on Monday, prosecutors said.

Bitcoin exchanges are services that allow users to trade bitcoins for traditional currencies. Mr Shrem is accused of allowing Mr Faiella to use BitInstant to purchase large quantities of bitcoins to sell on to Silk Road users who wanted to anonymously buy drugs. HOW BITCOINS WORK Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be better to think of its units as being virtual tokens that have value because enough people believe they do and there is a finite number of them. Each bitcoin is represented by a unique online registration number. These numbers are created through a process called \\"mining\\", which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. Each time a problem is solved the computer's owner is rewarded with bitcoins. To receive a bitcoin, a user must also have a Bitcoin address - a randomly generated string of 27 to 34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins contained. The authorities said Mr Shrem was aware that the bitcoins were being used for such purchases, and therefore he was in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. The Act requires financial institutions in the US to alert authorities to any suspicious activity that may suggest money laundering is taking place. Emily Spaven, managing editor of news site Coindesk, told the BBC: \\"Since the closure of Silk Road and arrest of alleged owner Ross Ulbricht, we always knew more arrests would follow. \\"It is unfortunate Silk Road continues to make the headlines in association with Bitcoin - this is the dark side of Bitcoin, which the vast majority of digital currency users have no association with.\\" 'Feigning ignorance' Following the arrests, James Hunt, from the US Drug Enforcement Agency, said in a statement: \\"Hiding behind their computers, both defendants are charged with knowingly contributing to and facilitating anonymous drug sales, earning substantial profits along the way. \\"Drug law enforcement's job is to investigate and identify those who abet the illicit drug trade at all levels of production and distribution, including those lining their own pockets by feigning ignorance of any wrong doing and turning a blind eye.\\" Mr Shrem was a founding member and vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group set up to promote Bitcoin as an alternative currency - but following his arrest he has since resigned. \\"We are surprised and shocked by the news,\\" said a spokesman for the organisation. \\"As a foundation, we take these allegations seriously and do not condone illegal activity.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Rory Cellan Jones explains how Bitcoin works BitInstant was one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges on the internet. However, the service has been inaccessible for some time, explained Mike Hearn, another member of the Bitcoin Foundation. \\"Charlie's impact on the Bitcoin community has been hovering near zero for a long time now,\\" Mr Hearn told the BBC via email. \\"If the allegations are true, it's part of a phase of Bitcoin's life that the project is rapidly leaving behind (and good riddance).\\" 'Deeply concerned' BitInstant's investors include Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss - the twins who previously sued Mark Zuckerberg claiming he had stolen their idea for Facebook. In a statement issued to the BBC, the twins said: \\"When we invested in BitInstant in the fall of 2012, its management made a commitment to us that they would abide by all applicable laws - including money laundering laws - and we expected nothing less. \\"We are obviously deeply concerned about [Mr Shrem's] arrest. We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials. \\"We fully support any and all governmental efforts to ensure that money laundering requirements are enforced, and look forward to clearer regulation being implemented on the purchase and sale of bitcoins.\\" Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC ||||| Charlie Shrem, the CEO of Bitcoin exchange company BitInstant and a well-known voice in the virtual currency community, has been charged with scheming to sell and launder 1 million worth of Bitcoin to users of the illegal drug website Silk Road.

Hunt, the Acting Special-Agent-in-Charge of the New York Field Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), and Toni Weirauch, the Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (“IRS-CI”), announced the unsealing of criminal charges in Manhattan federal court against ROBERT M. FAIELLA, a/k/a “BTCKing,” an underground Bitcoin exchanger, and CHARLIE SHREM, the Chief Executive Officer and Compliance Officer of a Bitcoin exchange company, for engaging in a scheme to sell over 1 million in Bitcoins to users of “Silk Road,” the underground website that enabled its users to buy and sell illegal drugs anonymously and beyond the reach of law enforcement. Each defendant is charged with conspiring to commit money laundering, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. SHREM is also charged with willfully failing to file any suspicious activity report regarding FAIELLA’s illegal transactions through the Company, in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. SCHREM was arrested yesterday at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, and is expected to be presented in Manhattan federal court later today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman. FAIELLA was arrested today at his residence in Cape Coral, Florida, and is expected to be presented in federal court in the Middle District of Florida. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: “As alleged, Robert Faiella and Charlie Shrem schemed to sell over 1 million in Bitcoins to criminals bent on trafficking narcotics on the dark web drug site, Silk Road. Truly innovative business models don’t need to resort to oldfashioned law-breaking, and when Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act. We will aggressively pursue those who would coopt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.” DEA Acting Special-Agent-in-Charge James J. Hunt said: “The charges announced today depict law enforcement's commitment to identifying those who promote the sale of illegal drugs throughout the world. Hiding behind their computers, both defendants are charged with knowingly contributing to and facilitating anonymous drug sales, earning substantial profits along the way. Drug law enforcement’s job is to investigate and identify those who abet the illicit drug trade at all levels of production and distribution including those lining their own pockets by feigning ignorance of any wrong doing and turning a blind eye.” IRS Special-Agent-in-Charge Toni Weirauch said: “The government has been successful in swiftly identifying those responsible for the design and operation of the ‘Silk Road’ website, as well as those who helped ‘Silk Road’ customers conduct their illegal transactions by facilitating the conversion of their dollars into Bitcoins. This is yet another example of the New York Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Force’s proficiency in applying financial investigative resources to the fight against illegal drugs.” According to the allegations contained in the Criminal Complaint unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: From about December 2011 to October 2013, FAIELLA ran an underground Bitcoin exchange on the Silk Road website, a website that served as a sprawling and anonymous black market bazaar where illegal drugs of virtually every variety were bought and sold regularly by the site’s users. Operating under the username “BTCKing,” FAIELLA sold Bitcoins – the only form of payment accepted on Silk Road – to users seeking to buy illegal drugs on the site. Upon receiving orders for Bitcoins from Silk Road users, he filled the orders through a company based in New York, New York (the “Company”). The Company was designed to enable customers to exchange cash for Bitcoins anonymously, that is, without providing any personal identifying information, and it charged a fee for its service. FAIELLA obtained Bitcoins with the Company’s assistance, and then sold the Bitcoins to Silk Road users at a markup. SHREM is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and from about August 2011 until about July 2013, when the Company ceased operating, he was also its Compliance Officer, in charge of ensuring the Company’s compliance with federal and other anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws. SHREM is also the Vice Chairman of a foundation dedicated to promoting the Bitcoin virtual currency system. SHREM, who personally bought drugs on Silk Road, was fully aware that Silk Road was a drug-trafficking website, and through his communications with FAIELLA, SHREM also knew that FAIELLA was operating a Bitcoin exchange service for Silk Road users. Nevertheless, SHREM knowingly facilitated FAIELLA’s business with the Company in order to maintain FAIELLA’s business as a lucrative source of Company revenue. SHREM knowingly allowed 2 FAIELLA to use the Company’s services to buy Bitcoins for his Silk Road customers; personally processed FAIELLA’s orders; gave FAIELLA discounts on his high-volume transactions; failed to file a single suspicious activity report with the United States Treasury Department about FAIELLA’s illicit activity, as he was otherwise required to do in his role as the Company’s Compliance Officer; and deliberately helped FAIELLA circumvent the Company’s AML restrictions, even though it was SHREM’s job to enforce them and even though the Company had registered with the Treasury Department as a money services business. Working together, SHREM and FAIELLA exchanged over 1 million in cash for Bitcoins for the benefit of Silk Road users, so that the users could, in turn, make illegal purchases on Silk Road. In late 2012, when the Company stopped accepting cash payments, FAIELLA ceased doing business with the Company and temporarily shut down his illegal Bitcoin exchange service on Silk Road. FAIELLA resumed operating on Silk Road in April 2013 without the Company’s assistance, and continued to exchange tens of thousands of dollars a week in Bitcoins until the Silk Road website was shut down by law enforcement in October 2013. * * * FAIELLA, 52, of Cape Coral, Florida, and SHREM, 24, of New York, New York, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. SHREM is also charged with one count of willful failure to file a suspicious activity report, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Mr. Bharara praised the outstanding investigative work of the DEA’s New York Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Force, which is comprised of agents and officers of the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the New York City Police Department, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - Homeland Security Investigations, the New York State Police, the U. S.

Article: Getting enough sleep on a regular basis is one important way to protect the health of your heart. Poor sleep is associated with a range of cardiovascular problems, including high blood pressure, heart attack, and heart failure. Both men and women are at increased risk for these conditions. But we continue to learn that when it comes to health problems associated with sleep, the particular risks to men and women are not always the same. A new study suggests that for women who already have heart disease, poor sleep may be particularly dangerous to their heart health. Research indicates that poor-quality sleep--and waking too early in particular--is associated with increased inflammation among women with heart disease. There was no similar association found for men, suggesting that women with heart disease and sleep problems may be at particular risk for inflammation that can be damaging to the heart. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco investigated the relationship between sleep quality and inflammation linked to coronary heart disease. They also sought information about how an association between sleep and inflammation might differ between men and women. Their investigation included 980 men and women at first, and 626 completed the 5-year study. All of those included were suffering for coronary heart disease. The average age of men in the study was 66. Women were slightly younger, with an average age of 64. Researchers measured sleep quality by asking participants to rate their sleep over the previous month. They also asked for reports of some of the most common sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking frequently throughout the night, and waking too early in the morning. After 5 years, researchers repeated tests for inflammation and once again sought reports on sleep quality and sleep problems. When they analyzed data for both men and women together, researchers found no links between inflammations and sleep quality. However, when they...

When used without qualification it refers to the best-selling or most frequently broadcast popular music. The term is derived from record music charts, a few of which traditionally consist of a total of 40 songs. Top 40 is also an alternative term for the radio format of such music, also known as Contemporary hit radio. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - David Louis \\"Dave\\" Bartholomew (born December 24, 1918) is an American musician, bandleader, composer, arranger and record producer, prominent in the music of New Orleans throughout the second half of the 20th century. Originally a trumpeter, he has been active in many musical genres, including rhythm and blues, big band, swing music, rock and roll, New Orleans jazz and Dixieland. He has been cited by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a key figure in the transition from jump blues and swing to R&B and as \\"one of the Crescent Citys greatest musicians and a true pioneer in the rock and roll revolution.\\" - Swing music, or simply swing, is a form of American music that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. Swing uses a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophone and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a \\"lilting\\" swing time rhythm. The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the offbeat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb \\"to swing\\" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Woody Herman, and Artie Shaw. - A big band is a type of musical ensemble associated with playing jazz music and which became popular during the Swing Era from the early 1930s until the late 1940s. Big Bands evolved with the times and continue to today. A big band typically consists of approximately 12 to 25 musicians and contains saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. The terms jazz band, jazz ensemble, stage band, jazz orchestra, and dance band are also used to refer to this type of ensemble. This does not, however, mean that each one of these names is technically correct for naming a \\"big band\\" specifically. - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. - \`\` I 'm Walkin ' '' is a 1957 song by Fats Domino , written together with Dave Bartholomew . The single was Fats Domino 's third release in a row to reach number one on the R&B Best Sellers chart , where it stayed for six weeks . The single also continued Fats Domino 's crossover appeal when \`\` I 'm Walkin ' '' peaked at number four on the pop singles chart . The song was featured in The Blues Brothers movie , during the scene in which the orphanage kids help spread the word of the band 's revival concert . - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Jump blues is an up-tempo style of blues, usually played by small groups and featuring saxophone or brass instruments. It was popular in the 1940s and was a precursor of rhythm and blues and rock and roll. Appreciation of jump blues was renewed in the 1990s as part of the swing revival. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home.

John's behaviour after his second marriage to Isabella of Angoulême is less clear, however. None of John's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried, and there is no actual documentary proof of adultery after that point, although John certainly had female friends amongst the court throughout the period. The specific accusations made against John during the baronial revolts are now generally considered to have been invented for the purposes of justifying the revolt; nonetheless, most of John's contemporaries seem to have held a poor opinion of his sexual behaviour.[nb 14] How many of John's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried?","output":"None of John's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried."},{"instruction":"Datong () is a prefecture-level city in northern Shanxi province, People's Republic of China, located in a basin at an elevation of 1040 m and bordering Inner Mongolia to the north and west and Hebei to the east.

This is not to say that the other choices are not possible outcomes as well, but they are generally less likely or less common. Broken bones are less probable in a small fall, especially for younger and healthy individuals, as they would require a greater impact or fall from a higher distance. However, for the elderly or those with weakened bones, this possibility increases. Injury and getting hurt are somewhat synonymous, but again, this is not a guarantee in every small fall. Sometimes, people can fall and experience minimal to no injury at all. Going down, which implies a person falling, is more of a description of the action itself rather than an outcome or consequence of the fall. In conclusion, pain is the most likely result of a small episode of falling, as it is a natural response to the impact and stress of the event. Other possibilities, such as broken bones or injury, are less likely or less common in such scenarios."},{"instruction":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: Who does Paul look for after escaping Uxia?

Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible.

As the clock struck 2:00 AM, the bar began closing for the evening. Jeffrey, knowing that it was time to pay his tab and say his goodbyes, signaled to Leslie for the check. With a smile, Leslie promptly prepared Jeffrey's bill, including all of the beers he had consumed throughout the night. Upon receiving the bill, Jeffrey took a moment to review it and then reached into his wallet. He decided that due to the excellent service, engaging conversation, and overall enjoyable experience he had had that evening, he would leave a generous tip for Leslie. Pulling out a few extra bills, he folded them neatly and placed the cash on top of the check, exhibiting his gratitude for the pleasant evening. Leslie, who had been keeping a discreet eye on Jeffrey, noticed the larger-than-average tip and her eyes lit up with appreciation. Tips, after all, play a crucial role in a bartender's income, and receiving a generous one not only meant validation of her skills and customer service efforts, but also a small financial boost that would ultimately make a difference in her day-to-day life. As Leslie approached Jeffrey to collect the check, she made sure to express her sincere gratitude for his kindness and generosity. She thanked Jeffrey for the tip and mentioned how much she enjoyed the conversation and his company throughout the evening. In turn, Jeffrey smiled and thanked her for making his night at the bar a memorable experience. In the end, it was Leslie who was grateful for the tip that Jeffrey had offered, as it not only symbolized recognition of her hard work, but also demonstrated the impact that a positive attitude and strong customer service skills can have on a bartender's livelihood. Jeffrey's generous tip and their memorable exchange truly made a difference in Leslie's night, bolstering her motivation to continue providing outstanding service to patrons and leaving both parties looking forward to their next encounter."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text.

I expanded on Kenneth's point of view by stating that gnats are bothersome because they are constantly buzzing and making life uncomfortable. Step 4: Continue the text by elaborating on Aaron's stance. I explained Aaron's perspective by mentioning that he finds gnats interesting because they serve a purpose in the ecosystem. For Kenneth, their incessant buzzing and habit of swarming around people was nothing but an annoyance, one that could spoil a peaceful day outdoors. He never understood why such tiny creatures had to be so disruptive, and he often found measures to keep them at bay, using repellents and fans to ensure a gnat-free environment. On the other hand, Aaron appreciated their role as food for other creatures, such as birds and frogs. He saw the presence of gnats as an indication of a healthy and thriving ecosystem. Additionally, he took an interest in the way they navigated the world, creating intricate flight patterns and avoiding obstacles with speed and agility. Step 5: Create a contrast between the characters' reactions to gnats. I contrasted Kenneth's annoyance and efforts to avoid gnats with Aaron's appreciation for their ecological role and interest in their flight patterns. Over time, their conversations about gnats led to deeper discussions about the interconnectedness of nature and the varying perceptions of creatures that coexist within it. While Kenneth ultimately became more tolerant of the tiny insects, he still couldn't help but swat at them when they hovered too close. As for Aaron, he continued to marvel at the intricacies of life and the importance of every creature, no matter how small and seemingly insignificant. Step 6: Show the development in the characters. I showcased how their discussions about gnats opened up deeper conversations about nature, and also presented a slight change in Kenneth's opinion and Aaron's enduring fascination with all living beings."},{"instruction":"Information: - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor. - Orestis Makris ( Greek : ; September 30 , 1898 -- January 29 , 1975 ) was a Greek actor and tenor . He graduated from the Greek Odeum of Athens and first entered the scene as a tenor in the troupe of Rosalia Nika in 1925 . He later joined the Papaioannou troupe , before moving to more comedic roles . Makris excelled in the portrayal of folk characters , especially the stock role of the \`\` drunkard '' . Makris also participated in about forty movies , mostly as an over-strict father . He is considered one of the most significant modern Greek actors . He was decorated with the Order of the Phoenix . He died on January 29 , 1975 in Athens and is buried at the First Cemetery in a family grave . - Vocal range is the measure of the breadth of pitches that a human voice can phonate. Although the study of vocal range has little practical application in terms of speech, it is a topic of study within linguistics, phonetics, and speech and language pathology, particularly in relation to the study of tonal languages and certain types of vocal disorders. However, the most common application of the term \\"vocal range\\" is within the context of singing, where it is used as one of the major defining characteristics for classifying singing voices into groups known as voice types. - Spinto (from Italian, \\"pushed\\") is a vocal term used to characterize a soprano or tenor voice of a weight between lyric and dramatic that is capable of handling large musical climaxes in opera at moderate intervals. (Sometimes the terms \\"lirico-spinto\\" or \\"jugendlich-dramatisch\\" are used to denote this category of voice.) - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted. - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock. - In music, an octave (: eighth) or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. It is defined by ANSI as the unit of frequency level when the base of the logarithm is two. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the \\"basic miracle of music\\", the use of which is \\"common in most musical systems\\". What entity does 'orestis makris' has the relation 'genre' with?","output":"Orestis Makris is associated with the genre of Greek theater and film, particularly in comedic roles and musical productions as a tenor singer. His repertoire includes folk characters, and he has participated in around forty movies."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a sentence in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.

A major analysis of 51 million English language tweets revealed that one in 13 contains a curse. Researchers were also able to rank the most popular words, finding f**k was the most popular - and the top seven accounted for over 90% of offensive tweets. The most popular curse words on Twitter: Researchers examined a random one-month sample of 51 million English-language tweets from 14 million distinct user accounts. People curse more and more as the day passes, reaching a peak at 12 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. just before they go to bed, the researchers found. They also found people swore earlier in the week - Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays contained the most curse words relative to tweet volume. 'It’s a sizable fraction of the words we use,' Wenbo Wang, a PhD researcher at Wright State University who led the study, told Fastco.

'We found that the curse words occurred at the rate of 1.15% on Twitter, and 7.73% of all the tweets in our dataset contained curse words,' the team wrote in their paper, which was presented this week at the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing. 'We also found that seven most frequently used curse words accounted for more than 90% of all the cursing occurrences.' The team say they wanted to find out it we cursed more on Twitter. 'Cursing is not uncommon during conversations in the physical world: 0.5% to 0.7% of all the words we speak are curse words, given that 1% of all the words are first-person plural pronouns (e.g., we, us, our),' the researchers wrote. Lack of imagination: The top seven curse words accounted for 90% of all curses, the researchers found. 'On social media, people can instantly chat with friends without face-to-face interaction, usually in a more public fashion and broadly disseminated through highly connected social network.' They also classified the cursing, and identified five different emotions from tweets - anger, joy, sadness, love, and thankfulness. 'Based on the classification results, we found that cursing on Twitter was. most closely associated with two negative emotions: sadness and anger. 'However, curse words could also be used to emphasize positive emotions such as joy or love.' Other insights in the paper involved timing, location, gender, and level of influence of the tweeters. People curse more and more as the day passes, reaching a peak at 12 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. before bedtime, and Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays contain the most curse words relative to tweet volume.

A dark-haired woman (Harring) escapes her own murder, surviving a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Injured and in shock, she descends into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment that an older, red-headed woman has just vacated. An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at the same apartment and finds the dark-haired woman confused, not knowing her own name. The dark-haired woman assumes the name \\"Rita\\" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda (1946), starring Rita Hayworth. To help Rita remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key. In what seems to be a scene from a different narrative, set at a diner called Winkies, a man (Patrick Fischler) tells his companion (Michael Cooke) about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. As the principal narrative resumes, Hollywood director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) has his film commandeered by apparent mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) as the lead in his film. After he resists, he returns home to find his wife having an affair and is thrown out of his house. He later learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Later, a bungling hit man (Mark Pellegrino) attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead. Trying to learn more about Rita's accident, Betty and Rita go to Winkies and are served by a waitress named Diane, which causes Rita to remember the name \\"Diane Selwyn\\".

After running about a mile he reached a place with two signs, sign A and sign B. Sign A says that it's a quicksand. But sign B says that it's not a quicksand. He has to decide which way to go. In which way Rob would not sink, sign A or sign B? Hint: Quicksand forms in saturated loose sand when the sand is suddenly agitated. When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an artesian spring). In the case of upwards flowing water, forces oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles. The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy. Answer:","output":"Based on the hint provided, we have a better understanding of quicksand behavior and formation. Since Rob has reached a place with two signs, the best approach for him to ensure his safety would be to carefully evaluate both options. He could try to assess the condition of the sand in both areas while keeping in mind the characteristics of quicksand, as described in the hint. However, signs are usually placed with a purpose - either to provide information or present a warning. If Rob encounters a quicksand warning, it would be wise to take the warning seriously and avoid that indicated area. Now, considering the two signs: - Sign A says that it's quicksand. This sign is most likely a caution sign to warn Rob and other runners to avoid the area. - Sign B says that it's not a quicksand. This sign might have been placed to tell runners that it's safe to pass and continue with the race. Based on this information and the inherent dangers of quicksand, Rob would be safer choosing the path indicated by sign B, which says it's not a quicksand. Although there's no guarantee that sign B is accurate, it would be a more reasonable choice considering the risks tied to running into quicksand. It's important to note that while running in a cross-country race, it would be helpful for Rob to have knowledge about the course and its potential pitfalls in advance, either through maps or other resources provided by the race organizers. Always remember that safety comes first, and even though it's a competition, Rob should prioritize his well-being over winning the race. In conclusion, Rob should choose the path indicated by sign B to ensure his safety and avoid the possibility of encountering quicksand. Remember that quicksand is a dangerous phenomenon, and it's crucial to take cautionary signs and information about the surrounding environment seriously to avoid accidents and ensure a successful cross-country race experience."},{"instruction":"The Bee Gees were a pop music group formed in 1958. Their lineup consisted of brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb. The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid-to-late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s. In an interview with Easy Mix radio host Tim Roxborough on 1 September 2009, Barry's 63rd birthday, Barry commented on future tours saying that \\"they will be back\\"; but in an agreement with Warner/Rhino they would not make an announcement at that time. On 7 September 2009, Robin disclosed to Jonathan Agnew that he had been in touch with Barry and that they had agreed that the Bee Gees would re-form and \\"perform again\\". Barry and Robin performed on the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing on 31 October 2009 and appeared on ABC-TV's Dancing with the Stars on 17 November 2009. On 15 March 2010, Barry and Robin inducted the Swedish group ABBA into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On 26 May 2010, the two made a surprise appearance on the ninth-season finale of American Idol. On 20 November 2011 it was announced that Robin Gibb, at 61 years old, had been diagnosed with liver cancer, a condition he had become aware of several months earlier. He had become noticeably thinner in previous months and had to cancel several appearances due to issues with severe abdominal pain. On 13 February 2012, Robin joined British military trio the Soldiers for the Coming Home charity concert at the London Palladium, in support of injured servicemen. It was his first public appearance for almost five months and his final. On 14 April 2012, it was reported that Robin had contracted pneumonia in a Chelsea hospital and was in a coma. Although he came out of his coma on 20 April 2012, his condition deteriorated rapidly, and he died on 20 May 2012 of liver and kidney failure. With Robin's death, Barry became the last surviving Gibb brother, and the Bee Gees dissolved as a musical group.

A). negative. B). positive. Short movie review: meditative Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the term 'meditative', it implies that the critic thought of the movie in a positive light. Meditative films are known for their thoughtful, reflective, and contemplative nature. Such movies typically invite viewers to think about the deeper meanings, various themes, and complex layers hidden beneath the surface of the story. They go beyond straightforward plot narratives and approach storytelling with intricate depth, creating room for personal interpretation and introspection. Hence, a critic labeling a movie as 'meditative' likely appreciated these qualities. In a broader perspective, movies are a form of art and are designed to evoke a wide array of feelings, thoughts, and reactions. Art forms which inspire contemplation are often seen as successful in engaging viewers on a profound level. This resonance and engagement at an intellectual and emotional front make people applaud such pieces of art, considering them effective and impactful. Describing a movie as 'meditative' further suggests that the critic recognized the film's relaxing or soothing rhythm, it’s potential to delve into the psyche of characters, or highlight human behavior and social issues. Often these movies do not rely heavily on action or overt drama, but rather on character interactions, stylistic cinematic techniques, and skillful screenwriting to convey their intentions. Such features can inherently make a film more impactful and stand out for a critic trained to appreciate the art of nuanced storytelling. By choosing the term 'meditative', the critic is indicating that the movie stimulated thought, induced a sense of peace, tranquility, or introspection, and was likely well-crafted—elements that are typically associated with a positive movie review. Furthermore, it’s essential to keep in mind that the critic's positive view does not necessarily dictate the general perception of the movie. Different people may have different reactions to the same movie, depending on individual taste and personal interpretation. Nevertheless, a 'meditative' appraisal implies that there were elements within the movie that provoked careful thought and consideration, and this typically points towards creative success and a positive review from the critic's perspective. Therefore, we can conclude that the critic thought positively of the movie."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - The Notting Hill Carnival is an annual event that has taken place since 1966 on the streets of Notting Hill, and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London, England, each August over two days (the August bank holiday Monday and the preceding Sunday).

It is pastored by Reverend Colin Dye , and is the largest church in its denomination , the Elim Pentecostal Church . - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\". - Notting Hill is an affluent district in West London, located north of Kensington within the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea as well as Westminster. Notting Hill is known for being a cosmopolitan neighbourhood, hosting the annual Notting Hill Carnival and Portobello Road Market. - Carnival (see other spellings and names) is a Western Christian festive season that occurs before the liturgical season of Lent. The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent). Carnival typically involves a public celebration and/or parade combining some elements of a circus, masks, and a public street party. People wear masks and costumes during many such celebrations, allowing them to lose their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity. Excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods proscribed during Lent is extremely common. Other common features of carnival include mock battles such as food fights; social satire and mockery of authorities; the grotesque body displaying exaggerated features, especially large noses, bellies, mouths, and phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms.

Anyway, it was my husband, two boys aged four and two, and myself, seven months pregnant , in an old Volvo station wagon. We had been driving for two days in the middle of winter (that car's heater didn't work), and we had taken a route that was very _ . There was nothing around for miles-no cars, buildings or signs of civilization. Suddenly, our car started losing power and the gauges went all out of order. We saw a light in the distance and managed to roll to a stop in front of this property that looked like a small simple house. Our cell phones had not gotten reception for many miles, and it was freezing outside, so I didn't know if we were going to make it out of this situation alive. My husband got out of the car to see if there was something he could do to get us rolling again, but it was not looking good. A short while later, a man came out of the house and spoke with my husband a bit before inviting us all into his home. He and his wife took us in, fed us, and made us feel at home as we struggled to find some way to get to our destination, which was still a few hours' drive away.

Greater evidence of such a people is found on Mallorca and Menorca than on Ibiza, but one of the Balearics' most important sites is actually on the island of Formentera, where the megalithic monument/tomb of Ca Na Costa has been dated to 2000 b.c. Ibiza's key location between Africa and ancient Iberia made it a convenient stopover for Mediterranean seafarers, such as the Phoenician traders, who called the island Ibosim. The Greeks dubbed it Ebysos, the Romans called it Ebusus, and the Moors, Yebisah. The Carthaginians: A detailed history of the island doesn't begin until it became a colony of Carthage in the 7th century b.c. . The Carthaginians originally came from the area comprising present-day Lebanon, and from their bases in North Africa and what's now Spain, they challenged the Roman Empire for domination of the Mediterranean region. Their interest in Ibiza lay partly in its vast salt flats, which to this day remain the source of a profitable industry. They capitalized on the natural resources by using the salt to cure fish, which they exported to their home country. The Carthaginians also carried out lead mining and continued to be of significance up until this century. It is believed that the lead pellets which were used by the Carthaginian general Hannibal were made on Ibiza. The Carthaginians also considered the island a holy place, and here in great splendour they buried thousands of their citizens in a huge necropolis on the Puig des Molins (Hill of the Windmills) below the Dalt Vila (Old Town) of Ibiza. Under the gnarled olive trees archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of statues, jewellery, pitchers, tools, and coins, which are now displayed in the town's two archaeological museums. The Romans never really infiltrated Ibiza, and even after the defeat of Hannibal in 202 b.c. during the Second Punic War their influence was restrained. Only with the fall of Carthage in 146 b.c. did they manage to make inroads, but, as local historians stress, Ibiza was neither conquered nor annexed by Rome, but confederated, retaining remarkable autonomy. For centuries to come the old Carthaginian traditions were allowed to continue on Ibiza alongside the new Roman way of life.

Step-by-step explanation: 1. Waves hit the coast: Ocean waves generated by wind or other sources travel towards the shoreline and impact the coast. 2. Waves have energy that pushes the water and sediment: The force and energy of the waves cause water and sediment (like sand, pebbles, and rocks) near the shore to move. 3. The sediment can help erode land like sandpaper: When sediment is moved and pushed by the waves, it contributes to the erosion of the coastline by abrasion, as if a sandpaper is rubbing against the land. 4. Water washes the sediment back: After the erosion has taken place, the waves and water currents can carry the sediment back towards the coast or along the coastline. 5. Redistribution and deposition of sediments along the coast: The final step is where the water currents and waves redistribute the eroded sediment and deposit it in new locations along the coast, often forming various coastal features, such as beaches, sandbars, or dunes.

But I can use this background: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one. What is an answer for this question: Who will develop infections less frequently? Answer:","output":"Based on the given background information, it can be inferred that Robert, who has been infected with HIV for many years, is more likely to have a lower number of helper T cells and a weaker immune system.

Options: (A). yes; (B). it is not possible to tell; (C). no;","output":"(C) No. The statement \\"their 4,000 deduction would cost the public 75 per household\\" does not necessarily follow from the provided information. In order to assess whether the deduction would cost the public 75 per household, one needs to have a clearer understanding of the distribution of the cost among different households and general population. The given scenario mentions that the hypothetical couple is in the highest income tax bracket and contributes all-new saving, which costs the government 1,584 and adds 2,416 to national saving. However, this information does not provide the relevant context to determine the average cost per household of the 4,000 deduction. Moreover, the specific cost per household will vary based on the method through which the government compensates for the revenue lost from the deduction. This can be done through spending cuts, by raising taxes elsewhere, or increasing debt. Each of these options can impact households differently based on their income and the public services they rely on. Furthermore, the statement assumes that the cost of this tax deduction is equally distributed among all households. This is an unrealistic assumption, as tax burdens vary across households depending on their income levels and the overall tax system's structure. This means that the cost of this deduction, as well as the benefits from it, would likely be unevenly distributed across the population. In conclusion, based on the available information, it is not possible to infer that the hypothetical couple's 4,000 deduction would cost the public 75 per household.

In summary, the statement \\"Ducklings need time between hatching and brooding\\" is true as they require a short adaptation period before moving to their brooder. Providing this time ensures that they have the opportunity to undergo critical early developments and establish a strong foundation for their future growth."},{"instruction":"Article:The Institute of Public Policy Research suggests if excluded students with undiagnosed problems were included, the rate would be much higher. This figure compares with one in 50 pupils in the wider population who have a mental health condition. The government said it would be publishing plans to improve mental health services later in the year. The research comes as the number of fixed term and permanent exclusions is rising. Figures just published show that last year, some 6,685 pupils were excluded permanently from state primary, secondary and special schools. Some 35 pupils were excluded every day in 2015-16 - five more daily than in the previous year. Eight out of 10 permanent exclusions happen in secondary schools. Here, the rate of permanent exclusions has increased from 0.15% in 2014-15 to 0.17% in 2015-16 - equivalent to 17 pupils per 10,000. Overall, there were 346,000 permanent and fixed-term exclusions handed out to pupils at state-funded schools in 2014-15 - the highest number since 2009. IPPR associate fellow Kiran Gill, founder of The Difference campaign on the issue, said: \\"Theresa May says she is committed to improving mental health of young people. \\"Addressing the most vulnerable children being thrown out of England's schools is a good place to start. \\"Because unequal treatment of mental health may be an injustice, but the discrimination of school exclusions is a crime.\\" Her campaign aims to break the link between school exclusion and social exclusion in \\"a burningly unjust system\\", and ensure vulnerable young people get the good quality schooling they need to change their lives. \\"If the government is serious about real action on mental health, there needs to be dedicated funding and thought-through solutions rather than sticking plasters in the symptoms of the problem,\\" Ms Gill added. Official figures showed 99% of pupils permanently excluded from mainstream schools do not get the five good GCSEs required by many employers. According to the IPPR report, nearly two-thirds of the prison population was excluded from school at some point. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \\"Any decision to exclude must be lawful, reasonable and fair and we are clear permanent exclusion should only be used as a last resort, in response to a serious breach or persistent breaches of the school's behaviour policy. \\"This government is committed to working with local authorities and schools to ensure children in alternative provision receive a high-quality education. \\"We are strengthening the links between schools and NHS mental health staff and have announced plans for every secondary school to be offered mental health first aid training.\\" But Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said the rise in exclusions was a \\"concerning trend\\" and the DfE should consider what was driving the exclusions. \\"NUT members tell us that as the curriculum gets narrower and children's experience of school is ever more focused on preparation for tests and exams, more students are becoming disengaged from school which in turn leads to problems with behaviour and mental health problems.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"A report by the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) has found that one in three permanently excluded UK students have an identified, diagnosed mental health problem. The IPPR theorizes that this rate would be substantially higher if those with undiagnosed issues were taken into account. The study came as the rate of fixed term and permanent exclusions continues to rise, with 6,685 pupils excluded permanently from state schools in the past year and 346,000 permanent and fixed-term exclusions given out in total. The rate of permanent exclusions in secondary schools rose from 0.15% in 2014-15 to 0.17% in 2015-16, with the IPPR also finding that almost two-thirds of prisoners were once excluded from school."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Arabic.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: What proposition is Milk trying to defeat? Movie title: Milk Movie plot: As the opening credits roll, old black and white newsreel footage from what looks like the 50s and early 60s flashes by of men being rounded up (and roughed up) by the police. Newspaper headlines break up the footage, announcing police raids of gay bars: \\"Crackdown of Homosexual Bars\\", \\"Men Charged in Taverns\\", etc. The men are all very well-dressed, clean-cut, and incredibly embarrassed, holding their hands over their faces, some with their suit coats over their heads. They are loaded up into paddy wagons as police push and shove them, snickering. Some of the men sit in large rooms, awaiting questioning and photographic, looking like their whole lives have just been destroyed.The narration of this film is carried out by Harvey Milk speaking into a tape recorded in 1978, dictating a letter to be read (or in this case, listened to) only in the event of his assassination. As he narrates, we catch glimpses of Milk in front of various groups, giving speeches, using attention-getting opening lines that vary with every crowd. In front of Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender (LGBT) crowds, he opens with \\"My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you.\\" In front of burly straight union workers, he opts for, \\"My name is Harvey Milk, and sorry I am not what you expected, but I left my high heels at home\\".In narration, Milk explains gay activists are targets for being so visible. There's a sudden newsreel clip of what looks like actual footage of a very young Diane Fienstein making the announcement both Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone were assassinated (NOTE: for the unaware, that's California's current Senator Diane Fienstein, who in 1978 was president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, who became Mayor upon Moscone's assassination, and later, of course, United States Senator).Milk, narrating his \\"Only Read If I Am Assassinated Letter\\" frames the rest of the movie, taking the audience to important points chronologically, beginning in 1970 New York.Milk, dapper in a very Sears & Roebuck 70s gray suit... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Milk\\", the main proposition that Harvey Milk is trying to defeat is Proposition 6, also known as the Briggs Initiative. This was a ballot measure in California in 1978, which sought to ban gay and lesbian people, as well as their supporters, from working in public schools in the state. The Briggs Initiative was endorsed by conservative politicians and anti-gay activists, who argued that LGBT individuals posed a threat to children. Harvey Milk, who was the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in California, campaigned strongly against Proposition 6. Through a series of powerful speeches and grassroots organizing, Milk worked to rally the LGBTQ+ community, as well as their allies, to stand against this discriminatory measure. Milk was successful in his efforts, as Proposition 6 ultimately failed. This victory was a significant milestone for the LGBTQ+ rights movement, showcasing the power of community organizing and the importance of having openly gay leaders in political positions. Aside from Proposition 6, Milk was also fighting against broader societal discrimination and prejudice against the LGBTQ+ community, which was manifested in police raids on gay bars, public shaming of LGBTQ+ individuals, and widespread discrimination in housing, employment, and other areas. Throughout the movie, Milk is depicted as a courageous and tireless advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, fighting not only against specific discriminatory measures like Proposition 6 but also working to change people's hearts and minds about the LGBTQ+ community."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Process: - Magma is formed when rock melts inside the Earth&#x27;s crust - Magma rises - Collects inside magma chambers underneath a volcano - Pressure builds in the magma chambers as they fill - Gain energy for eruption - Some of the energy is converted into seismic activity (earthquakes) - If the magma building in the volcano is thick and sticky it will trap gases - Results in an explosive eruption when the pressure becomes too intense - If the magma is thin and runs - The magma results in a low-pressure, slow-moving flow of magma instead of a violent eruption - Question: suppose during mealtime happens, how will it affect magma is formed in the ground. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"C: no effect The process of magma formation and volcanic activity is primarily driven by geological and geothermal factors, which are independent of human activities such as mealtime. Magma is formed when rock melts due to high temperatures and pressures within the Earth's crust, and the subsequent movement of this magma through the Earth's crust is dependent on factors such as the temperature and viscosity of the magma, and the Earth's mantle convection. During mealtime, people may be engaging in various activities such as cooking, eating, or washing dishes, but these activities have no significant impact on the formation and movement of magma beneath the Earth's crust. The internal mechanisms that drive the movement and behavior of magma are separated from mealtime by vast distances, measured in miles (or kilometers) rather than feet (or meters). As a result, magma formation and the geological processes that lead to volcanic activity continue uninterrupted regardless of what is happening on the Earth's surface. Additionally, the time scale at which geological processes such as magma formation and volcanic activity occur is far different from the one we experience during our daily lives. Geological processes can take place over hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years, while a mealtime typically lasts only a few minutes to an hour. Consequently, the short duration of mealtime is not a factor that can influence the long-term processes of magma formation and volcanic eruptions. In summary, mealtime has no effect on the formation of magma or the potential for volcanic activity. The processes involved in magma creation and eruption are driven by geological and geothermal factors that are independent of human activities, and they occur on time scales far different from those experienced during our daily routines, including mealtime."},{"instruction":"Here is a goal: cardboard box How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"Accomplishing the goal of creating a cardboard box involves several steps, from designing the box, gathering materials, cutting and folding, to assembling the box. Below is a detailed guide on how to create a cardboard box. Materials and Tools: 1. Cardboard sheet: The primary material for making a cardboard box. You can use a new sheet or reuse an old one. 2. Ruler: To measure and make straight lines on the cardboard. 3. Pencil or pen: For drawing lines and marking measurements. 4. Utility knife or box cutter: For cutting the cardboard along the marked lines. 5. Cutting mat or a protected surface: To protect the work surface while cutting cardboard. 6. Packing tape or glue: To assemble and secure the box. 7. T-square or large right-angle ruler (optional): For ensuring perfect 90-degree angles. Instructions: 1. Determine the dimensions: Before starting, decide on the desired dimensions of the cardboard box. You will need the measurements for length, width, and height. 2. Prepare the cardboard: If you are reusing an old box or cardboard sheet, remove any tape, staples, or labels. Make sure the cardboard is clean and flat. 3. Layout the box design on the cardboard: Lay the cardboard on your work surface and use a ruler, pencil or pen to draw lines according to the dimensions of the box. You will be drawing a large cross shape, consisting of: - One center rectangle representing the base of the box. - Four rectangles, one for each side of the center rectangle, representing the sides of the box. - When the sides are folded up, the adjacent rectangles will make the front, back, and side walls of the box. - Note: Ensure that all sides are the same height and that the width and length of the base match the corresponding dimensions on the side panels. 4. Create flaps for securing the box: To close the top and bottom parts of the box, extend lines from each side panel to create top and bottom flaps. The flaps can be equal in length to half of the length or width of the box, depending on the preferred closing method. 5. Add notches and score lines: - For easy folding, use a ruler and the back of the utility knife to score lightly along the edges where the side panels connect to the base and where the flaps connect to the side panels. - Cut small notches on each corner where the side panels meet. This will help the corners of the box to fold more precisely, creating a clean finish. 6. Cut the cardboard: Carefully cut along the outer lines of the cross shape using the utility knife or box cutter. Be sure to cut the notches as well. 7. Fold the box: Fold the side panels upwards and along the score lines, making a 90-degree angle to form a box shape. Fold the top and bottom flaps along their respective score lines. 8. Assemble the box: Use packing tape or glue to hold the box together. - If using tape, start by taping the bottom flaps together, then do the same for the top flaps once the box is filled. - If using glue, apply it to the edges of the flaps, fold and hold in place till the glue dries. 9. Finish the box: If desired, reinforce the edges and corners with more tape for a sturdier box. After following these steps, you should have successfully created a cardboard box. You can customize the box further by adding labels, printing, or painting it, based on your needs and preferences."},{"instruction":"Classic Rock is the first album in the Classic Rock series by London Symphony Orchestra.

Hamilton's victory cut his deficit to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to just one point in the championship as the German suffered a front-left tyre failure when running third with two laps to go, dropping to seventh. The same problem had hit Vettel's team-mate Kimi Raikkonen the lap before, costing the Finn an almost certain second place, promoting Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas to a Mercedes one-two. Raikkonen recovered to finish third. Following the podiums celebrations, Hamilton went down to see the crowd, surfing on their outstretched hands and high-fiving as he ran past the adoring throng. \\"The support has been incredible this weekend,\\" he said. \\"I am so proud I could do this for you all. Now the plan is to win the championship.\\" The drama all unfolded behind Hamilton, whose 57th career victory was among the most straightforward, on a weekend which he started 20 points behind Vettel and needed everything to go his way. The 32-year-old converted pole position - earned with a spectacular lap on Saturday afternoon - into a first-corner lead and simply drove off into the distance. Hamilton was 1.6 seconds clear after the first lap before the race was neutralised by a safety car following a collision between the Toro Rosso drivers. After the restart on lap five, Hamilton edged clear, building a 3.1-second lead after 12 laps and five seconds after 18, before he began to cut loose as the pit stops approached. Suddenly Hamilton was lapping a second faster than Raikkonen, pulling out five seconds behind Raikkonen made his pit stop on lap 24, Mercedes calling Hamilton in for his stop on the next lap. Hamilton returned to the track with a 10-second lead over Raikkonen and cruised to the flag as attention now turned to the battle for the remaining podium positions. Bottas was on an inverted tyre strategy, starting on the soft tyre from ninth place after a five-place penalty for changing his gearbox. He ran long on his first stint, battling past the cars in front of him and up into fifth place by lap five and then not stopping until lap 32 and rejoined 4.2 seconds behind Vettel with 18 laps to go. Bottas was soon setting fastest laps and was on Vettel's tail by lap 42. A first attempt to pass around the outside of Stowe ended with Vettel forcing him wide, but the Ferrari driver then locked a wheel into the tight Vale corner, damaging a front tyre. Bottas swept by on the Hangar Straight a lap later and set off after Raikkonen. It looked as if the Ferrari driver would hang on until his tyre lost its tread on lap 48, Vettel's going the same way a lap later. Vettel in the early laps of the race had had a tense fight with Red Bull's Max Verstappen, the two banging wheels out of Stowe corner, Vettel forcing the Dutchman wide and the having the favour returned. Verstappen hung on but was passed at the pit stops, but he came home fourth after Ferrari's problems. The Hungarian Grand Prix on 28-30 July is the final race before F1's four-week summer break. It's a tricky circuit with a lot of long corners, and a place where Mercedes might be expected to again have an advantage over Ferrari. It is the perfect opportunity for Hamilton to take the championship lead outright for the first time this year. And Hungary is a race where Hamilton already holds the record for most wins in the history of the sport with five. Bodes well...

Article: On Nov.18th, 1908, three men went up in a balloon. They started early in London. The headman was Augusta Gaudron, and the other two men were Tannar and Maitland. They had a big balloon and they were ready for a long way. Soon they heard the sea. They were carrying the usual rope, and it was hanging down from the basket of the balloon. At the end of the rope they had tied a metal box. This could hold water, or it could be empty. So they were able to change its weight. It was for use over the sea. They were also carrying some bags of sand. After the sun rose, the balloon went higher. It went up to 3,000 meters, and the air was very cold. The water in the balloon became ice. Snow fell past the men's basket, and they could see more snow on the ground. The men tried to throw out some more sand, but it was hard. They tried to break the icy sand with their knives, but it was not easy. The work was slow and they were still falling, so they had to drop some whole bags of sand. One of them fell on an icy lake and made a black hole in the ice. At last they pulled the box into the basket. It was still snowing; so they climbed up to get away from the snow. They rose to 5,100 meters! Everything became icy. They were so cold that they decided to land. They came down in Poland heavily but safely. They had travelled 1,797 kilometers from London!

He is left in the water The answer to this question is:","output":"Step 1: Set the foundation of the story To build a movie plot around the question \\"What happened to Dr. Bedford? He is left in the water,\\" it is important to establish a foundation for the story. This involves creating a setting, introducing central characters, and laying out the central theme or main idea of the film. Setting: The movie is set in a small coastal town known for its mysterious events and complex relationships among its residents. Main Characters: Dr. Bedford is a marine biologist who has been living in the town for ten years. Other central characters include: - Jessie, a local journalist who is determined to uncover the truth about Dr. Bedford's disappearance; - Sarah, Dr. Bedford's estranged wife, who has a complicated history with him; - Alex, a police detective, who is also investigating the case; - Emma, a marine activist, who is helping Dr. Bedford with his research on ocean preservation. Central Theme: The film will revolve around the mystery of Dr. Bedford's sudden disappearance and the impact of his work on the environment, as well as the interconnected lives of the characters in the story. Step 2: Creating the conflict Now that the foundation has been laid, the next step is to introduce a conflict that will drive the plot forward. This should add tension and uncertainty, as well as spark curiosity in the audience. Conflict: Dr. Bedford's disappearance is triggered by the discovery of a rare and dangerous sea creature that poses a threat to the world and is similar to the one Dr. Bedford has been studying. His sudden vanishing leads to Jessie, Sarah, Alex, and Emma forming an unlikely alliance in order to unravel the mystery and find him. Step 3: Developing subplots To add depth to the overall story, subplots involving the central characters' personal lives should be intertwined with the main conflict. This will provide a more comprehensive picture of their motivations and relationships. Subplots: - Jessie's ambition to move up in her career and her growing attraction to Alex; - Sarah's struggle to reconcile with her past and reconnect with her husband; - Alex's dedication to solving the case and his complicated feelings for Jessie; - Emma's constant fight for marine life protection, which unearths some crucial evidence about the sea creature and Dr. Bedford's disappearance. Step 4: Climax and resolution The climax is the pinnacle of the story where all the subplots and main plot culminate. Climax: The group finds Dr. Bedford, barely alive, on a remote island. He tells them that the sea creature is extremely dangerous and must be exposed to the public, despite the risks. Meanwhile, the creature's habitat is under threat from a big corporation that plans to build a construction project near the coastal town. Resolution: With Dr. Bedford's evidence, the group manages to expose the truth about the sea creature and the corporation's negligence, saving the town and the marine life. The ensuing public outrage and the creature's revelation prompt stricter regulations on environmental protection. In the end, characters find closure in their personal lives: Jessie makes peace with staying in the town, Sarah learns to move on, and Alex and Emma find solace in their shared passion for marine life protection. The answer to the question \\"What happened to Dr. Bedford? He is left in the water\\" is that he was stranded on a remote island after encountering the dangerous sea creature. His disappearance and subsequent rescue not only shed light on the threats to the environment but also brought the central characters closer together, leading to personal growth and a newly awakened sense of community responsibility."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a text from tweets and a boolean question whether this tweet has positive sentiment or negative sentiment.

Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to...

For this example, let's pick the topic: \\"The effect of sleep on cognitive performance.\\" Step 2: Define the context Now that we have a topic, we need to establish the context in which the hypothesis will be explored. Let's consider the following background information: - Sleep is essential for maintaining psychological functions. - Various studies have shown that sleep deprivation affects cognitive performance. - There are different stages and cycles of sleep, including REM and non-REM sleep. With this background information, we can define our context as: \\"The importance of sleep in maintaining optimal cognitive performance has been widely established, with various studies examining the effect of sleep deprivation on cognitive abilities. Sleep consists of different stages and cycles, such as REM and non-REM sleep, each of which may have distinct roles in cognitive processes.\\" Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis Now it's time to formulate a hypothesis based on the defined context. A well-formed hypothesis should be testable and falsifiable, meaning it should be possible to design experiments that could potentially disprove it. Based on our context, a suitable hypothesis could be: \\"A higher percentage of REM sleep in an individual's sleep cycle is positively correlated with better cognitive performance.\\" In this hypothesis, we propose that individuals who experience a higher proportion of REM sleep in their sleep cycles will exhibit better cognitive performance. This hypothesis is testable, as we can collect data on individuals' sleep patterns and cognitive performance to examine if there is a positive correlation between the two variables. Furthermore, it is falsifiable, as obtaining contradictory results (i.e. a lack of correlation or a negative correlation) would disprove the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Scaramouche is ofeten beaten by a character believed to have been introduced by whom?

Leinster lost the game 20-10 to Connacht, but the bigger story is the devastating impact Fitzgerald's absence will have on the Irish team's chances in the highly anticipated series. This article will examine the implications of Fitzgerald's injury on the team, the context of his contributions to the squad, and potential replacement options for head coach Joe Schmidt. Background Luke Fitzgerald, a proficient and experienced player, has accumulated 34 caps for Ireland since making his debut in 2006. Known for his versatility, Fitzgerald has donned the Irish jersey on the wing, center, and full-back positions. He was a key member of the squad that won the Grand Slam in the 2009 Six Nations Championship. Nominated for the 'World Rugby's U19 Player of the Year' award back in 2005, it was clear from an early stage that Fitzgerald was destined for greatness. Unfortunately, the road to stardom has been marred by a series of injuries that have prevented him from consistently showcasing his true potential. Impact of Fitzgerald's Injury on Ireland's Tour to South Africa The South Africa tour comprises three tough and closely contested test matches scheduled for June 11th, June 18th, and June 25th. Ireland's hopes of staying competitive and recording victories against the Springboks have undoubtedly been affected by Fitzgerald's injury. His experience, skillset, and leadership on the field will be sorely missed by the squad members, especially against a formidable South African side notorious for their physical, fast-paced style of play. Luke Fitzgerald's injury adds to a growing list of absentees for the Irish team. This list includes Johnny Sexton, Robbie Henshaw, and Sean O'Brien, who are also struggling with injuries. With several of Ireland's key players unavailable for the tour or in less-than-optimal shape, reaching full strength and forming a cohesive unit will be a daunting task for coach Joe Schmidt. Potential Replacements In Luke Fitzgerald's absence, Coach Joe Schmidt will have to find a suitable replacement to fill in the void. Some of the players who could potentially step up and take on the challenge include Craig Gilroy, Matt Healy, and Keith Earls. Craig Gilroy has seized opportunities presented to him in the past, showcasing his ability to score tries and contribute to the team's success. Gilroy's inclusion to Ireland's starting XV would bring speed and agility to the squad, both being vital elements in the fast-paced rugby landscape. Matt Healy, on the other hand, is a relatively inexperienced player on the international stage. However, recent performances for Connacht in the Pro12 have demonstrated his ability to make a difference in crucial games. Healy's sheer pace and finishing skills provide an exciting alternative to Fitzgerald's style of play. Keith Earls, a versatile player capable of switching between wing and center positions, is another option for Coach Joe Schmidt. Earls brings a wealth of experience along with his speed and agility, making him a potential candidate to replace Fitzgerald. Conclusion Luke Fitzgerald's injury is a major setback for the Irish team, but it also provides an opportunity for other talented players to rise to the occasion and make their mark on the international stage. The outcome of Ireland's summer tour to South Africa will largely depend on how well the squad can adapt to these unfortunate circumstances. The team's resilience and adaptability will be put to the test as they brave South African territory without one of their crucial assets, Luke Fitzgerald, by their side."},{"instruction":"former arsenal goalkeeper bob wilson told a match-fixing trial tuesday that bruce grobbelaar would make \`\` spectacularly wrong '' decisions but he did n't think he was guilty of deliberately letting in goals .

Over the next few months, the LDP introduced a series of economic stimulus packages and reforms designed to jumpstart the economy. The new government also reinforced Japan's defense capabilities and engaged in diplomacy to maintain a balance of power in the region, garnering the support of the United States and other allies. Under the LDP's leadership, Japan experienced modest economic growth and improved relations with neighboring countries. The people of Japan expressed cautious optimism about the early successes of the new government, and the LDP as a political force appeared to be reborn, more stable and focused on key issues affecting the nation. While the challenges facing Japan remained significant, the return of the Liberal Democratic Party to power marked a new beginning, one in which the Japanese people hoped to see the reforms and policies needed to establish long-term stability and prosperity in their country.

A man and a woman, both US officials with diplomatic passports, were drugged while they were attending a United Nations anti-corruption conference in November 2015, state news outlet RFE/RL reported, citing unnamed officials. The incident most likely occurred in their hotel bar, investigators concluded. One diplomat had to be treated at a local hospital before being flown out of the country. Investigators were unable to gather evidence from the hospital or hotel, and Moscow said there was no evidence of drugging when Washington served it a formal note of protest. When asked about the drugging incident, spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau declined to comment on specific cases but said the state department was “troubled by the way our diplomatic and consular staff have been treated over the past two years” in Russia. “We have raised our concerns at the highest levels,” Trudeau said at a briefing. “In particular, the harassment and surveillance of our diplomatic personnel in Moscow by security personnel and traffic police has increased significantly.” Western officials and journalists in Moscow have previously reported finding signs that intruders have entered their homes. During Barack Obama’s first term, Russian agents reportedly even broke in and killed the dog of a US defense attache in Moscow. But recent incidents suggest Russian security services are increasingly resorting to bizarre and invasive intimidation tactics as tensions with the west rise. Following sanctions against Russia over the 2014 annexation of Crimea, jingoist rhetoric has grown and President Vladimir Putin has warned about “enemies from abroad” and a “fifth column” sowing unrest in Russia. American officials in Moscow have complained about mysterious nocturnal break-ins during which furniture is rearranged and televisions and lights switched on, the Washington Post reported in June. Officials have returned home to find water faucets left running and, in two cases, human excrement on their floors. US diplomats were also stopped dozens of times by traffic police this spring. The secretary of state, John Kerry, spoke with Putin about the harassment of diplomats during a March visit. But in June, a Russian federal security service guard stationed outside the US embassy in Moscow attacked a US diplomat who was trying to enter, breaking his shoulder. The Russian foreign ministry said the diplomat was an undercover CIA agent. Moscow and Washington responded with tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats. After the June incident, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said: “The more the US damages relations, the harder it will be for US diplomats to work in Russia.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Paektu, North Korea’s Korean Central News Agency reported on Saturday. [YONHAP] North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visited Mt. Paektu on Friday, a sign that he may be planning a significant act in the near future.\\"Kim visited the mountain and ordered the site managers to construct hospitable accommodations on the mountain for visitors,” the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Saturday.A visit to Korea’s most mystical mountain often precedes significant decisions by North Korean leaders.In November 2013, Kim visited the mountain with his aides. It was a month before he executed top officials including Jang Song-thaek, his uncle and political guardian. He visited the mountain again in April 2015, just before executing Hyon Yong-chol, a former defense chief.He had also made a pilgrimage after North Korea’s fifth nuclear test in September 2016.“[Kim Jong-un’s father] Kim Jong-il did the same, he visited the mountain right before announcing in 1974 his list of 10 social decorum [which includes the commandment that the people remain completely loyal to the head of the state],” said a South Korean government insider. “Kim also visited the mountain just before executing Kim Tong-kyu, then-senior official for international affairs, in 1977.“Kim Jong-un is following in his father’s footsteps in visiting the mountain as times of important decisions regarding the state.”It’s impossible to predict if the visit augers another nuclear or missile test, or an action of a completely different sort.North Korea’s latest missile test was on Nov. 29, after a 75-day hiatus of provocations. The Hwasong-15 missile tested on Nov. 29 went farther and higher than any missile tested before and can reach all parts of the United States.Kim has conducted 11 missile tests since South Korean President Moon Jae-in was inaugurated last May, and conducted the country’s sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3.Some analysts cautioned against reading too much into the North Korean leader’s visit to the mountain.“Kim visited the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun [the mausoleum of his grandfather Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong-il] right after the Hwasong-14 missile launch on July 4,” said Yang Mu-jin, a professor of North-South relations at the University of North Korea Studies in central Seoul.“So this visit to Mt. Paektu could also be a celebratory one for the successful launch of the Hwasong-15 missile on Nov. 29.”KCNA reported on Saturday that Kim visited the mountain “after his big achievements in November.”“Kim has a lot on his plate, as next year is the 70th anniversary of the founding of the North Korean government,” said a South Korean government insider. “So he needs to deliver tangible results on the country’s politics, economy and diplomacy. So it is likely Kim thought through what he is going to present as his vision for next year during his visit to Mt. Paektu.”Kim has visited Mt. Paektu five times during his six-year rule, but this is the first time he is making a visit in December. It was around negative 20 degrees Celsius (negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit) on top of the mountain on Friday, according to North Korea’s Korean Central TV.BY JEONG YONG-SU [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr] ||||| SEOUL, Dec. 9 (Yonhap) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has scaled the country's highest mountain to emphasize his military vision, Pyongyang's state media reported Saturday. Kim climbed Mount Paektu with ranking military officials, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, adding that he recalled \\"the emotion-charged days when he realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force,\\" after reaching the peak. North Korea last month claimed that it has successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Hwasong-15, that is capable of hitting anywhere in the U.S., and declared that the launch marks the completion of its nuclear armament. North Korea considers Mt. Paektu a sacred site. The KCNA explained that it is associated with the \\"revolutionary careers of the great leaders and serves as the mental mainstay of the invincible DPRK.\\" DPRK is the abbreviation for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. According to the KCNA, Kim said that a monument to Mt Paektu and an education compound there should be \\"spruced up suited to the dignity of the holy mountain of revolution,\\" while an autograph of his late father Kim Jong-Il should be displayed more \\"heavily and politely.\\" Kim, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), also said there was a need to build a new hotel near Paektu Station, as well as other convenient facilities for visitors, the KCNA reported. He was accompanied by Choe Ryong-hae, vice-chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK, and Kim Yong-su, department director of the WPK Central Committee. The KCNA said Kim also inspected various facilities in Samjiyon County near Mt. Paektu in Ryanggang Province. Kim paid tribute to Kim Jong-il's statue in the county and gave field guidance to the Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism Study Hall, Samjiyon Town Hotel, Samjiyon Town General Store and houses in the town, as well as Samjiyon Youth Railway Station and Lake Samjiyon Shore Railway Station. Kim said to the people of the county that they would \\"fully discharge their honorable mission and duty,\\" and make the place the best mountainous city in the world.

For more on the story here is Zachary Devita. Buzz60 Kim Jong Un smiles after ascending North Korea's Mt. Paektu. (Photo: AP) North Korea has made many incredulous claims about the powers of leader Kim Jong Un and his family. Now it’s boasted of the greatest yet: He can control the weather. After releasing images this weekend of a smiling Kim on top of Mount Paektu, an active volcano on the China and North Korea border, the nation's state media said the \\"peerlessly illustrious commander\\" can control \\"the nature.\\" The evidence for this weather modification? When Kim \\"ascended\\" to the top of the 9,000-foot mountain through thick snow wearing his signature double-breasted winter coat and black leather shoes, a blizzard gave way to \\"fine weather unprecedented.\\" Kim was apparently responsible for this moment of sunshine on what should have been, according to a North Korean government statement, a dreary winter day. \\"Mount Paektu presented charming scenery showing magic peaks and dazzling sunshine on its clear and blue waves,\\" the account of Kim's journey up the mountain published in North Korea's official state newspaper Rodong Sinmun said. According to the account, Kim's trek also put him in a nuclear frame of mind. \\"Imposingly standing on Janggun Peak, the respected Supreme Leader gave a familiar look for a while at the dizzy cliffs and the sea of trees, recalling the emotion-charged days when he realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force without yielding even a moment and with the indomitable faith and will of Paektu.\\" Still, unusual things do apparently happen at Mount Paektu. Kim's father, Kim Jong II, claimed that he was born on a secret military camp on the mountain and that his birth there coincided with the appearance of a double rainbow in the sky. According to his official biography, Kim Jong II also claimed to be a master golfer who shot 11 holes-in-one in his very first game. At various times North Korean state media has reported that his son started driving at age 3 and is responsible for various medical breakthroughs in the treatment of cancer, Ebola and other serious illnesses.

Mount Paektu is a special mountain in North Korea that their leaders visit before making big decisions. Some people believe Kim Jong-un might be thinking of doing another nuclear or missile test. However, others think that he went to the mountain as a way to celebrate the successful launch of a missile in November. No one knows for sure what his plans might be, but it's something we should keep an eye on."},{"instruction":"Consider the question.

The American, named Leo, doesn't fully get what he's doing there. He has come to take part in fixing up the country since, in his mind, it's about time Germany was shown some charity. No matter how that sounds, he is not a Nazi sympathizer or so much as especially pro-German, merely mixed up. His uncle, who works on the railroad, gets Leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car, and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 Germany's horrors and enigmas. This progression starts when Leo, played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor Jean-Marc Barr, meets a sultry heiress on the train played by Barbara Sukowa, an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor. She seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family, which owns the company which manufactures the trains. These were the precise trains that took Jews to their deaths during the war, but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable, and the woman's Uncle Kessler postures as another one of those good Germans who were just doing their jobs. There is also Udo Kier, the tremendous actor who blew me away in Von Trier's shocking second film Epidemic, though here he is mere scenery. Another guest at the house is Eddie Constantine, an actor with a quiet strength, playing a somber American intelligence man. He can confirm that Uncle Kessler was a war criminal, though it is all completely baffling to Leo. Americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades, but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than Leo, who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train. The story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film's Danish director, Lars Von Trier, whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography. He shoots in black and white and color, he uses double-exposures, optical effects and trick photography, having actors interact with rear-projected footage, he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects, caught between glass for our more precise survey. This Grand Jury Prize-winning surrealist work is allegorical, but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer. I interpret it as a film about the last legs of Nazism, symbolized by the train, and the ethical accountability of Americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads. During the time frame of the movie, and the Nazi state, and such significance to the train, are dead, but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexes. The characters, music, dialogue, and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions. The most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones. Two trains halting back and forth, Barr on one and Sukowa on another. An underwater shot of proliferating blood. An uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown. And most metaphysically affecting of all, an anesthetic shot of train tracks, as Max von Sydow's voice allures us to hark back to Europe with him, and abandon our personal restraint.
