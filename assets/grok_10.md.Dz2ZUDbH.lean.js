Contractual requirements totally prevent using her image in the film, so he must re-shoot.

Viktor names his virtual actor \\"Simone\\", a name derived from the computer program's title, Simulation One. Seamlessly incorporated into the film, Simone (Rachel Roberts) gives a fantastic performance, exactly controlled by Viktor. The film is immediately a huge success. The studio, and soon the world, ask \\"who is Simone?\\" Viktor initially claims that Simone is a recluse and requests her privacy be respected, but that only intensifies media demands for her to appear. Viktor intends to reveal the secret of her non-existence after the second picture. To satisfy demand, he executes a number of progressively ambitious stunts relying on misdirection and cinematic special effects technology. Eventually it escalates to simulated remote location video live interviews. In one instance, two determined tabloid reporters discover Viktor used out-of-date stock photography as a background during an interview instead of being on that site as claimed and blackmail him into getting Simone to make a live appearance. He arranges her to perform a song at a stadium event appearing in a cloud of smoke and then using flawless holographic technology. The perception of being in person is reinforced with realtime visualization on the stadium's monitors. Simone becomes even more famous, simultaneously becoming a double winner for the Academy Award for Best Actress, tying with herself in the process.

Article: Mr. Anderson, one of three children, was born on Oct. 14, 1952, in Newport, R.I., and spent much of his childhood on the move, often performing on the streets for money, he told People. He had lived in many cities, including Chicago, New York, St. Louis and New Orleans, by the time he landed in California at age 16. From there he found success as a comic magician, which opened the door to his acting career.      About his mother, he said to People: “She was a hustler, yeah. She did a lot of things. We moved around a lot, and she had a lot of men friends.”      But he said his childhood was not bad, adding that his dubious background should not be viewed any differently from his mother’s.      “I respect my mother; she was very concerned with taking care of us,” he said. “She did what needed to be done to try to keep us together. People find my criminal days amusing, but they find her background shocking. I don’t draw any line.”      Mr. Anderson told People that his father was a salesman who was mostly absent from his life, and that he had not seen him for 15 years before his death.      Mr. Anderson is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Morgan, and two children from his first marriage, to Leslie Pollack: Eva Fay Anderson, a writer and producer in Los Angeles; and Dashiell Anderson, a teacher.      In his late teens and early 20s, Mr. Anderson traveled the country performing magic. During a stint in Austin, Tex., about 45 years ago, he was performing on the street when he met someone else entertaining passers-by: a juggler named Turk Pipkin. ||||| ASHEVILLE, NC (WSPA) - Police officials confirm that actor Harry Anderson died at a home in Asheville on Monday morning.

Hallingse said no foul play is suspected in Anderson's death.

Anderson is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and two children. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Alex Johnson      Harry Anderson, the magician-turned-comic-turned-actor best known for playing a lightly disguised version of himself as a judge on the TV sitcom \\"Night Court,\\" was found dead Monday morning at his home in Asheville, North Carolina, police told NBC News.      Anderson was 65. The cause of death wasn't disclosed, but police said foul play wasn't suspected.      Anderson, who often said he was inspired to pursue magic by Harry Blackstone Sr., the famed stage magician of the last century, grew up in Southern California and began performing at clubs like Dante Magic Club and the Magic Castle while he was still in high school. His stage name was Harry the Hat for the fedora he habitually wore.      Anderson appeared numerous times on Johnny Carson's version of \\"The Tonight Show\\" and \\"Saturday Night Live\\" during the 1980s and soon became a recurring guest star on \\"Cheers,\\" playing a swindler and grifter called, not surprisingly, Harry the Hat.      That led to his starring role beginning in 1984 on \\"Night Court,\\" in which he played Harry Stone, a judge in New York's Criminal Court 2 who traded jokes with a naïve public defender played by Markie Post, a slimy prosecutor played by John Laroquette and three regular bailiffs (Selma Diamond, Richard Moll and Marsha Warfield). Occasionally, they tried a case or two.      Anderson was nominated for Emmy awards three times during the show's nine-season run. Harry the Hat, meanwhile, returned occasionally to \\"Cheers,\\" explaining his extended absences with throwaway lines like \\"Two to 10, with time off for good behavior.\\"      Anderson moved straight from \\"Night Court\\" to \\"Dave's World,\\" playing Dave Barry, the Pulitzer Prize-winning humor columnist for The Miami Herald. The series ran for four years on CBS.      Barry said on Twitter that Anderson \\"was a very talented guy, and, more important, a genuinely nice guy.\\"      Anderson made guest appearances on several TV shows and appeared in several pilots after \\"Dave's World\\" ended. He ran a magic shop and a nightclub in New Orleans before he and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Asheville in 2006 after Hurricane Katrina. He told The New York Times at the time that the depression that gripped the city after the hurricane had depressed both his audience and his outlook on life.      \\"I had more people in my car last night,\\" The Times quoted him as telling his piano player during a performance.      Anderson had a devoted following among fellow performers. An early fan was the actor and writer Judd Apatow, who interviewed Anderson in 1983, before \\"Night Court\\" went on the air, for his book \\"Sick in the Head: Conversations About Life and Comedy.\\" He described Anderson as \\"this demented, semi-famous magician whom I happened to find hilarious.\\"      Apatow said Monday on Twitter that Anderson was \\"a kind talent who made millions so happy.\\"      J. Elvis Weinstein, a co-founder and star of \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000,\\" called Anderson \\"one of the few guys to ever make my 'magicians I like' list.\\"      For all his TV success, Anderson always remained a magician and illusionist at heart. In 1988, he was honored as Magician of the Year by the Academy of Magical Arts, which operates the Magic Castle, following in the footsteps of Blackstone, his idol. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

What is the answer??","output":"In order to solve the given equation, 13 = 10*k - 23*k for k, we will perform the following steps: Step 1: Combine the 'k' terms on the right side of the equation. Since both terms on the right side of the equation contain 'k', we can combine them by treating 'k' as a common factor.  10*k - 23*k = (10 - 23) * k = -13*k So, the equation now becomes: 13 = -13*k Step 2: Isolate the 'k' on one side of the equation. To find the value of 'k', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. In this case, we will isolate 'k' on the right side of the equation. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -13. 13 / (-13) = (-13*k) / (-13) Simplifying the equation: -1 = k Step 3: Write out the answer. The value of 'k' is now isolated on the right side, and we find that k = -1.

Question: \\"Which happened first, the defeat at Yorktown or the Peace of Paris?\\"  Context: \\"During the 1760s and early 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent. This was summarised at the time by the slogan \\"No taxation without representation\\", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms. American independence was acknowledged at the Peace of Paris in 1783.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The defeat at Yorktown happened first, followed by the Peace of Paris. To provide a deeper understanding of these two critical events during the American Revolution and their chronological order, let's delve into the historical context and significance of each. The American Revolution, which began in 1775, was primarily triggered by the Thirteen Colonies' increasing resentment towards Britain's control over their governance and taxation without representation. As a result, the colonies sought to establish their self-governance and declared independence in 1776. France's entry into the war in 1778 played a vital role in shifting the military balance in favor of the Americans. The defeat at Yorktown, also known as the Siege of Yorktown or the Battle of Yorktown, took place in 1781. It is regarded as a decisive event during the American Revolutionary War, where American forces, led by General George Washington, and French forces, commanded by General Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, successfully encircled and defeated the British Army under the command of Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis. This critical turning point proved instrumental in convincing the British government that victory in the American colonies was unlikely. As a direct result of this defeat, British Prime Minister Lord North resigned, and his successor, Lord Rockingham, initiated peace negotiations with the Americans. This ultimately led to the signing of the Treaty of Paris, also known as the Peace of Paris, in 1783. The Treaty of Paris marked the end of the Revolutionary War and formally recognized the United States of America as an independent sovereign nation. The treaty also established the boundaries between the new United States and British territories in North America. In summary, the defeat at Yorktown occurred first in 1781 and dramatically changed the course of the war, ushering in peace negotiations between the American colonies and Britain. The Peace of Paris, signed in 1783, formalized the end of the conflict, acknowledged American independence, and set the stage for the nation's ongoing development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Passage 1: In the United States,the financial crisis has left the country with 11 million fewer jobs than Americans need now.No matter how tough the policy ,we are not going to find 11 million new jobs soon.So common sense suggests we should make some decisions about who should come first:older people,who have already worked three or four decades at hard jobs? Or younger people,many just out of school,with fresh skills and ambitions? The answer is obvious.Older people who would like to retire and would do so if they could afford it should get some help.The right step is to reduce,not increase,the retirement age.As a rough cut,why not make it a law to set a three--year window during which the age for receiving full Social Security benefits would drop to 62----providing a voluntary ,one--time,grab-it-now bonus for leaving work? Let them go home! With a secure pension and medical care,they will be happier.Young people who need work will be happier.And there will also be more jobs.With pension security, older people will consume services until the end of their lives.They will become.each and every one,an employer. Passage 2: Too many people see longer working lives as a worry rather than an opportunity--and not just because they are going to be chained to their desks.Some worry that there will not be enough jobs to go around.This misunderstanding,known to economists as the\\"lump of labour fallacy \\",was once used to argue that women should stay at home and  leave all the jobs for breadwinning males.Now lump-of-labourites say that keeping the old  at work would deprive the young of employment.The idea that society can become better-off by paying more of its citizens to be idle is clearly ridiculous.On that reasoning,if the retirement age came down to 25 we would all be as rich as Bill Gates. Question: What is the author's attitude towards earlier retirement in Passage 2? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The author in Passage 2 exhibits a negative attitude towards the idea of earlier retirement. They believe that promoting longer working lives is an opportunity and argue against the notion that there will not be enough jobs to go around. The author criticizes the \\"lump of labour fallacy\\" and implies that making more people idle by advocating earlier retirement is absurd, as it does not contribute to societal prosperity. They use a sarcastic example, suggesting that if the retirement age was reduced to 25, everyone would be as rich as Bill Gates, which highlights their disapproval of earlier retirement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Condensed milk is cow's milk from which water has been removed. It is most often found in the form of sweetened condensed milk (SCM), with sugar added, and the two terms \\"condensed milk\\" and \\"sweetened condensed milk\\" are often used synonymously today. Sweetened condensed milk is a very thick, sweet product which when canned can last for years without refrigeration if not opened. Condensed milk is used in numerous dessert dishes in many countries.  - Theobroma is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae, that is sometimes classified as a member of Sterculiaceae. It contains roughly 20 species of small understory trees native to the tropical forests of Central and South America. The generic name is derived from the Greek words  (\\"theos\\"), meaning \\"god,\\" and  (\\"broma\\"), meaning \\"food\\". It translates to \\"food of the gods.\\"  - The Brigadeiro ( Portuguese for Brigadier ; also known in some southern Brazilian states as negrinho , literally \`\` blackie '' ) is a common Brazilian delicacy , created in 1940 . It is common throughout the entire country , as well as in Portugal , and is present in practically all the major Brazilian celebrations . Other types of Brazilian delicacies are Cajuzinho and Beijinho . The Brigadeiro is made from condensed milk , powdered chocolate , butter and chocolate sprinkles to cover the outside layer . It can be cooked in the oven or the microwave , in the form of individual little balls . It can also be eaten straight from the pot once it is done cooking . The information regarding when and where the Brigadeiro was invented is uncertain . As far as the creators of this treat , it is also uncertain of the nationality of the individuals .  - Guatemala (, or ), officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the northeast, the Caribbean to the east, Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populated state in Central America. A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City.  - Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - The Aztec people were certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to 16th centuries. The Nahuatl words \\"aztecatl\\" (singular) and \\"aztecah\\" (plural) mean \\"people from Aztlan\\", a mythological place for the Nahuatl-speaking culture of the time, and later adopted as the word to define the Mexica people. Often the term \\"Aztec\\" refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan (now the location of Mexico City), situated on an island in Lake Texcoco, who referred to themselves as \\"Mxihcah Tenochcah\\" or \\"Clhuah Mexihcah\\" .  - Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \\"Vanilla\\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\\"V. planifolia\\"). The word \\"vanilla\\", derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word (\\"vaina\\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \\"little pod\\". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \\"tlilxochitl\\" by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.  - Theobroma cacao is the taxonomic classification for the plant also called the cacao tree and the cocoa tree, which is a small (tall) evergreen tree in the family Malvaceae, native to the deep tropical regions of Central and South America. Its seeds, cocoa beans, are used to make cocoa mass, cocoa powder, confectionery, ganache and chocolate.  - Mesoamerica was a region and cultural area in the Americas, extending approximately from central Mexico to Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica, within which pre-Columbian societies flourished before the Spanish colonization of the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. It is one of six areas in the world where ancient civilization arose independently, and the second in the Americas along with Norte Chico (Caral-Supe) in present-day northern coastal Peru.  - Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of \\"Theobroma cacao\\" seeds, roasted and ground, and often flavored with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as \\"xocoltl\\" , a Nahuatl word meaning \\"bitter water\\". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.  - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners.

The sentiment expressed by the author is unmistakably critical and dissatisfied with the product described. We can analyze the review in terms of the language used, the tone of the author, and the overall narrative to explain why this review has a negative tone. Language analysis: 1. The title of the review, \\"A real piece of junk,\\" uses strong and derogatory language. The word \\"junk\\" implies that the product is worthless or garbage, immediately setting a negative tone from the beginning. 2. The author uses phrases such as \\"fell apart\\" and \\"pole bends over,\\" which highlight the product's lack of durability and poor quality. These phrases convey a sense of disappointment and frustration, contributing to the negative sentiment in the review. Tone of the author: 1. The reviewer seems to express anger or frustration in the review, recounting a specific instance where the product failed when bringing in a fish. This personal anecdote evokes emotions of disappointment and impatience with the item. 2. The reviewer states that the product made them lose a fish, displaying their dissatisfaction with its performance. This experience likely left the author feeling frustrated and upset – emotions that can be felt in the negative tone of their review. Overall narrative: 1. From a broader perspective, this review narrates the tale of a product that failed to satisfy the needs of the author. Losing a fish due to a device's malfunction is likely to displease any customer, especially someone for whom the product is integral to their hobby or passion. 2. The fact that the reviewer had to buy another reel highlights the inconvenience and additional expenses they encountered because of the product's poor quality. Also, the mention of the pole bending over while bringing in a seemingly smaller fish (a bluegill) suggests that the product is not fit for purpose. It reveals that not only the reel but also the pole was unsatisfactory, further adding to the negativity of the review. In conclusion, the language used, the author's tone, and the overall narrative in this product review all indicate a strong negative sentiment.

Summarize this article: 2 years ago      (CNN) - Congressional leaders have been invited to the White House for a meeting at 10 a.m. ET Friday–the day forced spending cuts are scheduled to start taking effect, two sources said Wednesday.      But while President Barack Obama was on Capitol Hill Wednesday for a Rosa Parks statue unveiling, he met with congressional leaders for a brief, minute-long meeting.            Follow @politicalticker      According to an Obama administration official, the president discussed the forced spending cuts and said that during their pending White House meeting on Friday they need to be \\"ready to talk solutions.\\"      Obama met with the following leaders on Capitol Hill: House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Assistant House Democratic Leader James Clyburn.      Asked by CNN if the discussion led to anything, Reid suggested it was just a quick huddle. When pressed on if he was surprised the White House meeting was scheduled for Friday, the Nevada Democrat gave a big smile and said, \\"Nothing surprises me anymore.\\"      Pelosi also told CNN in an exclusive interview that the meeting before the ceremony was brief.      \\"We just came together and talked about looking forward to getting together on Friday,\\" she said.      Pelosi downplayed the timing of the White House meeting saying, \\"I have no idea, I guess it's just a scheduling thing. \\"      \\"I don't have any problem with us meeting on Friday,\\" she added. \\"I think what we're talking about is beyond sequester.\\"      Another Democratic official who was at the short gathering described the setting as “regular protocol” for these events–top leaders typically greet the president in an area off-stage and walk in shortly before the event begins.      A GOP aide told CNN that Republicans do not anticipate the White House meeting to be anything more than optics–an effort, the aide said, by Obama to show he is at least talking to Congress on the day the cuts are supposed to kick in.      But the aide added it wasn't clear what was on the president's agenda.      By the time Obama meets with the leaders, the cuts–85 billion worth over the next seven months–could have already started to take place. It all depends on when Obama issues an order to let them begin. He has until 11:59 p.m. ET on Friday to issue the order, according to an official with the Office of Management and Budget.      A senior congressional Republican chided Obama for the timing of the meeting.      \\"Either someone needs to buy the White House a calendar, or this is just a – belated – farce,\\" the Republican said. \\"They ought to at least pretend to try.\\"      And McConnell released a statement, saying \\"The meeting Friday is an opportunity for us to visit with the President about how we can all keep our commitment to reduce Washington spending.\\"      He continued: \\"With a 16.6 trillion national debt, and a promise to the American people to address it, one thing is perfectly clear: we will cut Washington spending. We can either secure those reductions more intelligently, or we can do it the President’s way with across-the board cuts. But one thing Americans simply will not accept is another tax increase to replace spending reductions we already agreed to.”      Reid, however, took to the Senate floor earlier Wednesday to \\"make sure everyone understands this is not President Obama's sequester.\\"      \\"Congress has the power to (a)void these self-inflicted wounds,\\" he added. \\"But Democrats can’t do it alone. Republicans have to do their part. Compromise is never easy but surely it is better than doing nothing at all.\\"      - CNN's Jake Tapper and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report. ||||| It’s seems like we’ve been here before.

It’s the same day that the sequester will take effect, though, so it’s not going to stop the cuts from happening.      The across-the-board spending cuts — known as the sequester — that Obama said wouldn’t happen and Boehner had promised his members he and Senate leadership would work to sidestep — in fact, will take hold.      Instead of inching closer together in these closing days, the sides are moving farther apart. Obama went to Newport News, Va., Tuesday and called for slashing tax loopholes to offset the cuts. Boehner gave a speech to the Credit Union National Association and said, “Yes, we should close loopholes, but we should do it as part of tax reform that lowers rates and helps create jobs.”      (WATCH: Obama blasts Congress on sequestration)      In short, they are nowhere.      The Senate will try to pass a bill to increase taxes on high-income earners this week. If it gets past the Senate and the likely 60-vote threshold, it still won’t pass the House. Boehner said his chamber shouldn’t have to pass its sequester replacement bill again before the Senate “gets off their ass” and passes a bill.      The real problem: Neither bill would pass the other chamber.      And get this: The House will leave town on Friday — just as the cuts take hold.      Here’s the rub: Republicans really have no idea what to think. They’re tangled in a mix of messaging about Obama crafting the sequester, the cuts being damaging but also seeking praise for having the courage to finally slash spending by at least 2 percent.      (PHOTOS: What they’re saying about sequestration)      Boehner and his team think they’re in a good position: Obama is calling for tax increases to blunt damaging cuts to the Pentagon, while Boehner is standing for cutting spending.      The same week in which bipartisanship seems so out of reach, Boehner is voicing support for the heftiest two-party undertaking: tax reform. He even designated the leadership’s most prized bill title — H.R. 1 — to rewriting the Tax Code.      “Dave Camp, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is continuing a thoughtful and thorough review of the Tax Code with an eye on tax reform, and I fully support his work,” Boehner said at the CUNA convention, according to prepared remarks. “It’s time we shift the balance of power from the tax collector to the taxpayer.” ||||| Steep and harsh federal spending cuts kick in Friday.      And that’s when President Barack Obama has invited Congressional leaders to the White House to try and resolve the standoff.      Text Size -      +      reset POLITICO LIVE: Obama, Boehner to meet      The White House on Tuesday invited House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to trek down Pennsylvania Avenue to meet on the 85 billion across-the-board cuts, known as the sequester.      Republicans on Capitol Hill say the last-minute invitation to the White House Tuesday for a Friday meeting is a sign that the president is not serious about stopping the cuts.      (WATCH: Boehner: White House 'trying to play games')      The Senate is set to unveil competing plans — one Republican and one Democratic — to stop and perhaps give Obama more flexibility to reprogram the spending cuts in the sequester. But those measures, which will get a vote on Thursday, both are expected to need a 60-vote threshold in the Senate, and both are expected to fail.      The White House said Wednesday that it doesn’t expect anything to come of the Senate votes, and press secretary Jay Carney sought to blame Republicans for the massive cuts that will ensue.      “Obviously the Senate will vote on proposals — or at least one proposal that would eliminate, or rather postpone, the deadline for the sequester — a balanced proposal that the president supports, a balanced proposal that a majority of the Senate will support, unfortunately a proposal that, while earning a majority vote is likely to be blocked by Republican leaders who will thereby be making a choice that we should let the sequester go into effect rather than ask that some special interest tax breaks be eliminated,” Carney said.      (Also on POLITICO: Senate GOP ponders ceding power)      “Hopefully that won’t come to pass but certainly, based on what we’ve seen from Republicans thus far, that is a more likely outcome.”      The president spoke briefly with the top four Hill leaders during a statue dedication ceremony for Rosa Parks at the Capitol Wednesday, but Carney didn’t indicate progress. He reiterated the White House’s insistence that revenues be part of any deal and excoriated Republicans for failing to even consider then.      “We remain hopeful that at some point, hopefully soon, Republicans will understand the need to compromise here, and that compromise has balance at its essence,” Carney said. “The president looks forward to a conversation when he has this meeting that is constructive and that includes suggestions by leaders about how we can move forward toward the kind of balanced deficit reduction that this is all about,” he said.      (PHOTOS: What they’re saying about sequestration)      “If the President is serious about stopping the sequester, why did he schedule a meeting on Tuesday for Friday when the sequester hits at midnight on Thursday?” a Capitol Hill Republican sniped. “Either someone needs to buy the White House a calendar, or this is just a — belated – farce. They ought to at least pretend to try.” ||||| Senate GOP divided on sequester plan      By Erik Wasson -      Two days before 85 billion in automatic spending cuts hit the government, Senate Republicans are divided over a bill backed by their leadership that would replace the sequester.      The measure would require that 85 billion in spending be cut, but give President Obama more flexibility in manage the spending reductions than given by the sequester, which requires across-the-board cuts to nearly every part of every agency.      But some Republicans fear it would help the White House use the cuts as a political weapon, while defense hawks worry the Pentagon would not escape harm.      Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) said the plan doesn't address the damage that the sequester cuts would inflict on the military.      “I don’t care how flexible you want to be, the top-line numbers don’t add up to me on defense. That’s my problem,\\" Graham said after a contentious GOP meeting where the plan was discussed.      Coming up with a favored approach is important as both sides try to win public support over how they are handling the sequester.      The Senate is expected to vote this week on rival legislative measures backed by Democrats and Republicans. While both bills are expected to fail, they could help give each party political cover.      Leaders on both sides will be looking at the vote count carefully, raising the stakes for Republicans to rally their members around one alternative.      So far, Senate Democrats look like the more unified side.      Most if not all Democrats are expected to support their conference’s 110 billion sequester replacement bill that would phase in a new minimum tax on those making more than 1 million a year, close corporate tax loopholes, end direct farm payments and delay defense cuts.      Such unity isn’t evident around the likely GOP alternative offered by Sens. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and supported by GOP leaders. The bill, which would give Obama more leeway in carrying out sequestration, was discussed Tuesday in the Senate Republican conference meeting.      In general, Republicans more comfortable with defense cuts supported this effort, while hawks like McCain and Graham were skeptical.      Opponents complain the plan would cede Congress's power of the purse to the president. Others say it does nothing to address the sequester’s damaging cuts to defense and national security.      \\"I've never seen so much passion about something that is not going to pass,\\" Corker said Tuesday after the party’s weekly lunch.      Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) acknowledged Tuesday that the party might have to offer more than one sequester alternative amendment on the Senate floor, if Democrats consent to multiple votes.      \\"Speaking for myself, I would be happy to give the president more flexibility and rely on the agency heads to portion the spending reductions in different ways,\\" McConnell said. \\"There are some members of our conference who are suspicious that the administration would take advantage of such flexibility to punish their political enemies.\\"      \\"We'll see how many votes we'll have. That's up for discussion,\\" McConnell said.      Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Tuesday he would only allow one GOP bill. He has set the Senate up for Thursday votes.      The plan from Toomey and Corker would give the Obama administration more power to choose which federal programs and activities will be slashed to meet the 85 billion target.      The flexibility would apply equally to domestic and defense spending, Corker said, in contrast to an earlier proposal floated by Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) that would have just given flexibility over Pentagon cuts.      Graham said that he would support a deficit grand bargain that raises 600 billion in revenues in exchange for massive entitlement reform. Such a bargain would presumably restore all nine years of defense cuts on the horizon.      The GOP conference is also weighing a proposal from Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) to replace the sequester cuts with a reduction in the overall federal workforce through attrition. McCain and Graham support the Ayotte approach.      Toomey said his proposal preserves the magnitude of the sequester cuts because the nation's budget situation demands it.      He said “given the disastrous fiscal situation we are in, we’ve got to support these cuts.”      The Pennsylvania senator said that the proposal could be redesigned to include a provision giving Congress a final vote to disapprove a presidential sequester plan.      He argued that after Oct. 1, the remaining eight years of automatic spending cuts are accomplished through lower budget caps, not the seizing of funds known as sequestration, so congressional power isn't ceded for long.      Corker concurred, arguing the plan \\"is the best solution for the next seven months. After that it moves to the appropriations process.\\"      Once the sequester takes effect, supporters of the idea said, the flexibility bill could gain traction and could be difficult for Obama to reject.      Democrats showed no signs of supporting any of the GOP ideas.      Sen. Carl Levin (Mich.), the Democratic chairman of the Armed Services Committee, blasted the GOP approach as passing the buck to the White House.      “I think it’s a mistake in general to give the power of the purse to the president and say, ‘Here’s a pot of money; spend it as you wish,' ” Levin said. “That kind of, what’s called ‘flexibility,’ is really an abdication of what the responsibilities of the Congress are.”      Corker said that at this stage, the GOP proposal and a separate Democratic sequester replacement bill that raises taxes will fail in Senate votes this week.      “I can’t imagine either bill is going to pass,” he said. “That’s why I’m booking a flight to head out of town Thursday night.”      This story was posted on Feb. 26 at 4:46 p.m. and has been updated. ||||| In Killeen, Tex., where the country’s largest Army post drives the local economy, automatic federal budget cuts would furlough about 6,000 of Fort Hood’s civil service workers for one day each week. Mayor Dan Corbin predicted home sales and construction would grind to a halt; restaurant and shop owners, he said, are “worried sick.”      Of those who think the reductions wouldn’t have a painful impact, the Republican said: “I don’t know what planet these people are living on.”      That planet is about 200 miles north on the interstate in Collin County: sprawling and well-to-do suburban Dallas. Sure, some federal grants would go away, but County Judge Keith Self said few of Collin’s 800,000-plus residents would notice. “We can handle this,” said Self, also a Republican and the county’s top elected official. “Anything we can cut — sure, absolutely.”      President Obama is painting a dire portrait of across-the-board doom and gloom from the automatic cuts, known as sequestration, set to begin Friday. But the sequester is really like a tornado, scattershot in its course. It would strike some communities and largely bypass others, cutting across class, politics and geography.      Interviews with more than a dozen state and municipal leaders coast to coast show that the sequester would afflict big cities and military communities — because of cuts to social programs and defense — far more than middle-class suburbs or rural areas. The disparity in some ways mirrors the nation’s electoral divide between Democrats and Republicans.      The discrepancies help explain why House Republicans — many of whom represent rural and outer suburban districts — feel little urgency to strike a deal with Obama and avert the sequester. They also suggest that the misery expected Friday would not be universal, meaning that public outcry may not be loud or widespread enough to propel Washington toward a quick solution.      “Until the pain gets hard enough, they probably won’t do anything,” said Steve Bell of the Bipartisan Policy Center.      The sequester is a package of across-the-board, indiscriminate spending cuts that total 85 billion for the current fiscal year and 1.2 trillion over the next decade. The cuts are split evenly between the defense budget and non-defense discretionary spending, which includes many federal grants to state and local agencies. Mandatory programs, including Social Security and Medicaid, are spared.      Military communities would be hit hard with work stoppages. Pay for border patrol agents would be cut. Some funding for teachers would get the ax, and reductions are in store for HIV testing, job-search assistance and Meals on Wheels for senior citizens.      And yet the federal government is so sprawling that millions of Americans may never feel any effect from the cuts.      “This is going to hit some areas and regions much more than others,” Bell said. “This is not a situation where on the second of March the lights are going to go off or people are going to be sent home. This is a slow-moving kind of situation which will aggregate itself.”      In Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest public school district would lose 37 million in federal funding. Schools Superintendent John Deasy said that amounts to about 100,000 per school — “easily an employee or employee and a half.” The budget cuts would specifically impact programs that help impoverished students, many of whom speak Spanish, prepare for kindergarten and learn to read.      “It affects the youth who live in greatest poverty much more so than just across the district,” Deasy said. “The effects are you don’t come to school ready to learn in kindergarten, you don’t learn to read by the end of third grade and you don’t graduate on time.”      Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak (D) said the budget cuts would impact the most vulnerable residents of his city. Head Start and employment training programs would suffer, and some grant money to fight crime in high-impact neighborhoods would disappear.      “Minneapolis is a very successful city on almost every level except we have a very large gap between haves and have-nots, and this will cut exactly those services that help close the gap,” he said.      Besides these cuts, Rybak said any other impact from the sequester would be more indirect — such as a corresponding dip in the consumer economy. He said he worries that Target and Best Buy,which are headquartered in Minneapolis, might have declining sales if customers nationwide spend less amid the uncertainty.      For Hennepin County, which encompasses Minneapolis and many of its suburbs, the impact would be minimal, said Mike Opat, chairman of Hennepin County Board of Commissioners.      “If you’re not receiving a check or food stamps, you’re probably not likely to hear the impact of the sequester immediately,” he said. “If there are teachers that are laid off, that would be one example, but the general middle-class citizen is not going to feel this right away.”      The same cannot be said for military communities like Newport News, where Obama visited a nuclear submarine factory on Tuesday to sound the alarm about deep defense cuts.      In Hinesville, Ga., where Fort Stewart dominates the local economy, Mayor James Thomas Jr. said the sequester would have a 56 million impact, forcing furloughs at the massive Army post. He said it would be the biggest blow to Hinesville’s businesses since the Persian Gulf War in 1990, when thousands of U.S. troops deployed to Kuwait.      “This is serious,” Thomas said, echoing the concerns of Corbin, the mayor of Killeen. “When you have a military installation next to your city, you’ve got to be very concerned about anything that affects them because it affects us all.”      There are similar worries along Arizona’s border with Mexico, where agents with the U.S. Border Patrol are bracing for furloughs. Art Del Cueto, president of Local 2544, the union that represents more than 3,000 border patrol agents, said the forced time off would mean pay cuts of up to 40 percent.      “Who in this country can afford a 40 percent pay cut?” Del Cueto said. “If they’re saying it’s not going to have an impact, that’s lying. They need to come down here and walk in the agents’ boots.”      Discuss this topic and other political issues in the politics discussion forums. ||||| Summary:","output":"Congressional leaders were invited to the White House for a meeting regarding forced spending cuts that were scheduled to start taking effect.

As the 85 billion worth of cuts could have already started to take place, a senior congressional Republican criticized Obama for the timing of the meeting. However, others insist on the importance of cutting Washington spending as the national debt is at 16.6 trillion.

(A) Rhonda (B) Sally.  What is the most sensical answer between \\"Rhonda\\" and  \\"Sally\\"? Answer:","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"Rhonda\\" and \\"Sally\\" is (A) Rhonda.  When comparing the scenario with Rhonda and Sally, the relative strength of each girl's arm is evaluated by their ability to throw a baseball. The distance a baseball is thrown can be influenced by a number of factors including technique, angle of throw, and the power or strength applied during the throw. In the case described in this short story, Rhonda is successful in throwing the baseball over the fence to Sally. It implies that Rhonda has enough muscle strength to propel the baseball a significant distance.  Contrastingly, when Sally attempts to return the ball, her throw does not manage to reach Rhonda, failing to achieve the same distance that Rhonda's throw did. This might suggest that Sally couldn't apply the same amount of force during her throw as Rhonda did. One valid interpretation of this could be that Sally doesn't have the same strength in her arm as Rhonda, or at least not in the context of throwing a baseball. Of course, there could be other factors at play here as well. Maybe Sally doesn't have the same throwing technique as Rhonda, or perhaps the wind was against Sally when she threw the ball. However, based strictly on the information provided, it is most reasonable to conclude that Rhonda has more strength in her arm than Sally, because she was able to throw the ball over the fence, while Sally was unable to replicate the feat. Therefore, the answer should be (A) Rhonda, as she demonstrated a greater ability to throw the baseball."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return.

Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this.

Bu keşif, Türkiye'nin sadece tarihi ve kültürel öneme değil, aynı zamanda sportif açıdan da dikkat çeken bir ülke olduğunu göstermektedir. Marcus Aurelius, MS 161-180 yılları arasında hüküm süren Romalı bir imparator olarak bilinir. Aynı zamanda ünlü bir filozof ve düşünür olan Marcus, doğanın ve insanların mutluluğunu sağlamanın yollarını düşünerek insanlık için büyük bir rol model teşkil etmiştir. Özellikle \\"Meditations\\" adlı eseriyle tanınan Marcus, ahlaki ve düşünsel değerlere sahip olmanın ve insanlarla uyumlu bir yaşam sürmenin önemini işaret etti. Bu heykelin Türkiye'de ortaya çıkarılması, Türk tarihinde ve dünya tarihi açısından büyük bir öneme sahiptir. İlk olarak, Marcus Aurelius'un düşüncelerinin, yönetiminin ve liderliğinin Roma İmparatorluğu'nun sınırlarının ötesine geçerek Türkiye topraklarında da etkisini gösterdiği düşünülmektedir. Bu da, Türkiye'nin tarih boyunca kültürel bir köprü görevi gördüğüne dair güçlü kanıtları bir kez daha ortaya koyuyor. Bunun yanı sıra, heykelin bulunduğu yerde spor etkinliklerinin düzenlendiği ve bu tür etkinliklerin, Roma İmparatorluğu döneminde de Türkiye topraklarında gerçekleştirildiği düşünülmektedir. Çünkü eskiye dair buluntular, çeşitli dönemlerde yapılan olimpiyatların ve spor müsabakalarının Türkiye'deki antik kentlerde yapıldığını göstermektedir. Bu nedenle, Türkiye, dünya tarihinde kültür ve spor alanında da büyük bir etkiye sahip olan bir ülke olarak görülmektedir. Sonuç olarak, Marcus Aurelius heykelinin Türkiye'de ortaya çıkarılması sadece arkeolojik ve tarihi keşifler açısından değil, aynı zamanda kültürel ve sportif öneme de sahip olan olaylarla ilişkili olarak düşünülmelidir. Bu keşif, Türkiye'nin kültür, spor ve tarihine olan ilgiyi ve ülkenin dünya çapında paylaşımını artıracak önemli bir gelişme olarak kabul edilebilir."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Citing states’ rights, jobs and the right to bear arms, congressional Republicans are reversing dozens of Obama-era rules affecting the environment, education and the energy sector. The GOP is using a largely unknown but highly effective legislative tool that allows a simple majority in the House and Senate to overturn regulations that often took years to craft. Indeed, with an overhaul of health insurance going off the rails, Republicans are left pointing to the repeal of various government regulations as their crowning legislative achievement after some 70 days at work. The GOP casts the effort as overturning eight years of excessive government regulation and boosting business. “These things will help get people back to work, and after years of sluggish growth, give a real boost to our economy,” Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said this past week. The president has signed eight resolutions revoking regulations issued during the final months of Democrat Barack Obama’s presidency. Six resolutions have cleared Congress and are awaiting the president’s signature. A couple dozen more are on deck, with last Thursday the deadline for filing more. Trump has signed measures eliminating requirements that mining and oil companies report payments made to foreign governments. The rule was designed to shine a light on how much money foreign governments received for their nation’s resources, thus reducing the prospect of corruption. He also signed another measure reversing an Obama plan to prevent coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby streams. “These actions from Congress and the president are giving hope to businesses that they haven’t had in a long time,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi scoffed at the notion that Republicans were accomplishing anything with the regulatory repeals “because they do not meet the needs of the American people.” “They are about trickle-down. Their life is about giving more money to the high-end and to corporate interests, maybe it will trickle down, that would be good, but if it doesn’t, so be it, that’s the free market,” Pelosi said. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said the regulatory repeals Congress pushed through will actually damage the economy more than it helps. He said that eliminating the stream protection rule may help coal companies, but it hurts other companies that stand to gain through healthier streams and water supplies. “If you look across the terrain of the Congressional Review Act resolutions, they are repeals of public measures that help, consumers, workers and the environment in very substantial ways, but are opposed by powerful corporate interests,” Weissman said. “The Republicans driving these measures are paying back their corporate benefactors at the expense of the public.” In some cases, the regulatory repeal efforts have had nothing to do with the economy, but addressed hot-button social issues that so often dominate Washington politics. Republicans blocked a Social Security Administration rule that would have prevented tens of thousands of mentally disabled beneficiaries from being able to purchase a firearm. The rule was targeted specifically at those beneficiaries with mental disorders who have a third party manage their financial benefits, and it was opposed by the NRA and several advocacy groups for the disabled. The latest repeal effort clearing both chambers required Republicans to bring Vice President Mike Pence to the Capitol so he could cast the tie-breaking vote on the abortion issue. The scrapping of the Health and Human Services rule gave states the go-ahead to deny federal family planning money to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. One of the more closely contested repeals would kill an online privacy regulation. Fifteen Republicans sided with Democrats in opposing the repeal, which Pelosi said would allow internet providers to sell personal information without a user’s consent. “You should be very, very scared,” she said. The ability of Congress to void regulations with a simple majority was created in 1996 when Congress passed the Congressional Review Act. In the 20 years since, Congress was only able to use it once to repeal a regulation. Congress sent five repeal resolutions to Obama, but he vetoed each of them. Trump made clear early on that he would back the efforts of the GOP-led Congress. “I will keep working with Congress, with every agency, and most importantly with the American people until we eliminate every unnecessary, harmful and job-killing regulation that we can find,” Trump said this past week. “We have a lot more coming.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has encouraged the regulatory rollbacks, weighing in with lawmakers on efforts affecting internet providers, federal contractors and energy companies. Neil Bradley, a senior vice president at the Chamber, acknowledges that it’s hard to say how many jobs are created or saved through the repeal of one particular rule, but he says employers of all sizes tell the chamber government regulations are a top concern that makes it harder for them to flourish. “Any time we can roll back these regulations is another step forward to restoring the economic growth that I think is the top priority of the American people,” Bradley said. ____ On Twitter, reach Kevin Freking at https://twitter.com/APkfreking","output":"Congressional Republicans are reversing Obama-era rules affecting the environment, education, and the energy sector, using a legislative tool that enables a simple majority to repeal regulations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. (CNN) -- The last few years have seen the beginnings of an energy revolution in the U.S. The coming of shale gas and now shale oil has transformed not just its energy outlook, but also the climate change debate. The game has changed: Energy independence, the goal first set by Nixon in the early 1970s, looks like being achievable, at least for the North American continent. The game that has changed has profound implications for energy and climate policy. To date it has been based upon two assumptions: The first is that fossil fuel prices would go ever upward as oil (and gas) production peaked and then declined. That, in turn, meant that energy policy should actively try to increase the security of the supply by increasing domestic energy production. The second was that climate change is best addressed by a top down international climate change agreement, and that within that framework, the U.S. should accept a cap on the amount of carbon it would release into the atmosphere. So great are the potential oil and gas reserves that already","output":"some experts are predicting that the U.S. could overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's largest oil producer within the next decade. This newfound energy abundance has the potential to upend traditional geopolitical power dynamics and reshape the global economy. However, this shift also brings with it an array of challenges and potential consequences. For one, a persistent reliance on fossil fuels could impede the development and adoption of clean energy technologies, which are necessary for mitigating the impacts of climate change. Furthermore, achieving energy independence through the proliferation of domestic shale oil and gas production could have environmental and public health consequences if not carried out responsibly. Under these circumstances, it is likely that energy and climate policy will have to evolve to address both the opportunities and challenges presented by the shale revolution. This evolution could take several forms. For instance, policymakers may place greater emphasis on fostering innovation and investment in clean energy technologies to ensure that they remain competitive even as fossil fuel prices stabilize or decline. In addition, there may be a growing consensus that focusing on top-down international climate agreements is not the only approach to combating global warming. Instead, countries might embrace a more flexible, multi-faceted approach that combines national policies, regional initiatives, and collaborative technology development. This could mean greater emphasis on renewable energy targets, emissions trading schemes, and industry-wide partnerships to accelerate the commercialization of low-carbon technologies. Furthermore, the economic benefits of increased domestic energy production could be used to fund investments in infrastructure resilience and climate adaptation measures. These investments will help communities better withstand the impacts of a changing climate, while also creating jobs and boosting local economies. As the geopolitical landscape shifts, the U.S. may find that its energy abundance gives it greater diplomatic leverage in negotiations on climate change and other international issues. By demonstrating that it is possible to achieve energy independence while also transitioning to a low-carbon economy, the U.S. could stand as a global model for the sustainable development of energy resources. However, this requires a careful balance between maximizing the benefits of this new energy landscape and minimizing the environmental and health risks associated with fossil fuel extraction. This might involve the implementation of stringent regulations governing hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and other shale extraction techniques to protect water resources, air quality, and public health. In conclusion, the shale revolution has undeniably changed the game for energy policy and climate change. To successfully navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by this new reality, it is vital for policymakers to adapt and to pursue a diverse and balanced approach to energy production, climate protection, and sustainable development. This will involve investing in clean energy innovation, exploring different strategies for international cooperation, and ensuring the responsible and safe extraction of shale oil and gas resources. Only by embracing such a comprehensive approach can we hope to achieve long-term energy security, protect the planet for future generations, and foster economic prosperity."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Which is safer --- staying at home, traveling to work on public transport, or working at the office? Surprisingly, each of these carries the same risk, which is very low.However, what about flying compared to working in the chemical industry? Unfortunately, the former is 65 times riskier than the latter! In fact the accident rate of workers in the chemical industry is less than that of almost any of human activity, and almost as safe as staying at home. The trouble with the chemical industry is that when things go wrong they often cause death to those living nearby.It is this that makes chemical accidents so newsworthy.Fortunately, they are extremely rare.The most famous ones happened at Texas City (1947), Flixborough (1974), Seveso (1976), Pemex (1984) and Bhopal (1984). Some of these are always in the minds of the people even though the loss of life was small.No one died at Seveso, and only 28 workers at Flixborough.The worst accident of all was Bhopal, where up to 3,000 were killed.The Texas City explosion of fertilizer killed 552.The Pemex fire at a storage plant for natural gas in the suburbs of Mexico City took 542 lives, just a month before the unfortunate event at Bhopal. Some experts have discussed these accidents and used each accident to illustrate a particular danger.Thus the Texas City was caused by tons of ammonium nitrate, which is safe unless stored in a great quantity.The Flixborough fireball was the fault of management, which took risks to keep production  going during essential repairs.The Seveso accident shows what happens if the local authorities lack knowledge of the danger on their doorstep.When the poisonous gas drifted over the town , local leaders were incapable of taking effective action.The Pemex fire was made worse by an overloaded site in an overcrowded suburb.The fire set off a chain reaction of exploding storage tanks.Yet, by a miracle, the two largest tanks did not explode.Had these caught fire, then 3,000 strong rescue team and fire fighters would all have died.

An agricultural farm is giving prizes for the person who makes the largest homegrown project. Porky and a rival neighbor both plan to win the agricultural farm prize, Porky with his garden and the neighbor with his chickens. Porky carefully plans a box of seeds, one by one while the man is busy mixing a bunch of bottles of items together. Porky goes to retrieve something as the man feeds the brand new mixture into the feeding bin for his chickens. But when they try it out, they spit the food out in disgust and seek food elsewhere. Porky grabs his bottle of quick grow, a hair tonic he hopes would work on his garden. To his amazement, it does. But he says nothing of it and heads inside his house. The neighbor checks out his handy work and comments on it, allowing his chickens to come over and eat all of his fruits and vegetables. A little chick and a bigger chicken fight over a watermelon until it flings the chick away. The chick sadly retreats until it sees a bunch of spinach and decides to munch on it instead. The chick then comes back and punches the mean chicken before finishing the watermelon. (The chick eating spinach and then changing is a thinly-veiled Popeye reference). When his garden has almost entirely been eaten, Porky finally notices the chickens and tries to get rid of them. But alas no luck, so he yells at the neighbor to get them back into his yard but the neighbor claims he doesn't know how they got on Porky's property, then attempts to \\"try\\" and make them return. He then leaves while a sad Porky heads to his door, only to find a long vine and follow it to a giant pumpkin.

The atheistic element of communism would be strengthened after his death in some Marxist movements .","output":"Step 1: Identify the main elements in each sentence. Sentence 1:  - atheistic element of communism - would be intensified - in some Marxist movements - after his death Sentence 2:  - atheistic element of communism - would be strengthened - after his death - in some Marxist movements Step 2: Compare the elements for similarities and differences. - Both sentences discuss the atheistic element of communism, so they have a similar subject matter. - The phrases \\"would be intensified\\" and \\"would be strengthened\\" share a similar meaning, as both describe an increase in the atheistic element's influence or importance. - Both sentences mention that this change will occur after the person's death. - The impact is specified to happen within some Marxist movements in both sentences, which indicates that it is not a universal effect. Step 3: Evaluate whether the meanings are the same or different. - All main elements are either identical or very similar in meaning. - The order of some elements is different, but the overall structure of the sentences is similar and effectively conveys the same point. Conclusion: Yes, these two sentences from Wikipedia have the same meaning. They both suggest that the atheistic element of communism would become more prominent in some Marxist movements following the death of an individual. The difference in wording does not significantly alter the intended message."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence: Silicone molds are the best to shape chocolate.  Pick your answer from: A). Yes B). It's impossible to say C). No","output":"B). It's impossible to say Although silicone molds are commonly used and have several advantages when it comes to shaping chocolates, it's impossible to say that they are the best for shaping chocolate without considering factors such as personal preferences, skill level, and the specific type of chocolate being used. There may be cases where metal, plastic, or various other kinds of molds might be considered better, depending on the specific requirements of a project or an individual's preferences. Let's examine some factors that might influence this choice in greater detail: 1. Material properties: Silicone molds are known for their flexibility, which makes them easier to use for removing delicate chocolate shapes with fewer breakages. They are also non-stick, which can help make the chocolate release process easier. However, metal or polycarbonate molds might offer a more rigid and sturdy structure, which could be preferred for some projects or by users who are more comfortable with these materials. 2. Heat resistance: Silicone molds are generally heat resistant and can withstand the temperatures required for melting chocolate. Some other materials, like plastic, might have issues with heat resistance, making them less suitable for certain applications with chocolate. 3. Availability: Silicone molds are readily available in a wide range of shapes and sizes, which makes them accessible for various chocolate projects. Still, individual preferences may lead someone to prefer a specific type of mold that may not be available in silicone. 4. Reusability: Silicone molds are typically reusable, as they can be cleaned easily, thus reducing waste. However, some chocolate makers may prefer other materials that are also reusable, such as metal or polycarbonate, based on their own experiences and preferences. 5. Skill level: Different materials might be more suitable for different skill levels. For example, a beginner might find a silicone mold easier to handle due to its flexibility and non-stick nature, whereas a more experienced chocolatier might prefer the rigidity of metal or polycarbonate molds. In conclusion, while silicone molds have multiple advantages when it comes to shaping chocolates, it's impossible to definitively determine that they are the best for this task without considering various factors. Personal preferences, experience, and specific requirements can all influence what someone might consider the best option when shaping chocolate."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: Mr. Jenkins's class is studying sex chromosomes. He tells his students that the nuclei of human cells have 22 pairs of autosomes. How many sex chromosomes does the human body have? Answer:","output":"Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes, out of which 22 pairs are autosomes and one pair consists of sex chromosomes. Sex chromosomes are the ones that determine an individual's sex or biological gender. In humans, there are two different sex chromosomes: X and Y. These chromosomes are not paired up like the other 22 autosomes, as their pairing varies between individuals depending on their biological gender. In general, females possess two X chromosomes, represented as XX, whereas males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, represented as XY. The presence of the Y chromosome denotes a male, as it contains the necessary genes to trigger the development of male characteristics during the process of embryonic development. In contrast, the absence of the Y chromosome results in the development of female characteristics. Thus, human cells (more specifically, human somatic cells, which make up the majority of body cells other than sperm and egg cells) generally have a total of 46 chromosomes, with 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes. In summary, the human body generally has two sex chromosomes, either XX (female) or XY (male). These sex chromosomes are responsible for determining an individual's biological gender, and they function differently from the 22 pairs of autosomes, which are primarily responsible for dictating other traits and characteristics that define each individual."},{"instruction":"Given a category and a set of five words, find the word from the set that does not belong (i.e. is the least relevant) with the other words in the category.

Britney Spears, despite a distinct lack of tweets actually posted by the singer herself, officially has the most followers on the microblogging site, though the numbers constantly fluctuate. Both are near 5 million followers; at the moment, she has about 3,600 more. “Spears’ Twitter victory flies in the face of conventional wisdom on how to use the social web,” writes Jolie O'Dell on Mashable, noting that her account is mostly promotional (sample tweet: “At my photo shoot for the limited edition collection I designed for Candie’s!”), unlike Kutcher’s (sample tweet: “‘What do U think about Brittney having more followers than u?’ Answer ‘I don't care.’”). Expand this summary.","output":"Just nine days after Mashable's prediction, the inevitable has occurred: Ashton Kutcher, the once reigning superstar on Twitter, has been dethroned. Britney Spears, the pop music icon, has officially taken the crown for having the most followers on the popular microblogging platform. Though the numbers have been continually fluctuating, Spears currently boasts near to 5 million followers, with around 3,600 more than Kutcher's count at the time of this report.  The triumph of Britney Spears on Twitter seems to challenge traditional perspectives on how to harness the power of social media effectively. Jolie O'Dell, a writer for Mashable, points out that Spears' Twitter account is predominantly promotional in nature, with tweets such as, “At my photo shoot for the limited edition collection I designed for Candie’s!” filling up her timeline. This is in stark contrast to Kutcher's account, which is known for its more engaging and interactive content, exemplified by tweets like, “'What do U think about Brittney having more followers than u?' Answer 'I don't care.'” One could argue that Spears' success on Twitter is due to her massive global fame as a pop star, which allows her to attract a significant amount of followers despite the promotional nature of her content. In comparison, Ashton Kutcher, an actor and entrepreneur, relies more on creating a genuine connection with his followers to maintain their interest and loyalty. The rise of Britney Spears on Twitter also highlights the evolving landscape of social media influence. As celebrities and public figures continue to compete for the largest following, the significance of Twitter and other social media platforms in shaping popular culture and the perception of these figures becomes increasingly apparent. This phenomenon underscores the indispensability of social media in today's digital age, particularly for those in the entertainment industry. Furthermore, the constant fluctuations in follower counts for celebrities like Spears and Kutcher demonstrate the volatile and ever-changing nature of social media popularity. While Spears may be reigning supreme today, her position could easily be toppled tomorrow by another celebrity or influencer. In conclusion, the recent overthrow of Ashton Kutcher by Britney Spears as Twitter's reigning superstar highlights the growing importance of social media platforms in shaping popular culture and the public image of famous figures. Despite differing strategies in leveraging their social media presence, both Spears and Kutcher have managed to amass a significant following. The constant fluctuations in follower numbers for these celebrities also reflect the ever-changing nature of social media popularity, emphasizing the need for continual engagement and adaptability in the digital era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Joan Rivers cuts off CNN interview Ladies and gentlemen, Joan Rivers has left the building, er, interview. Rivers’ satellite chat with CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield started off well enough. She was even quoting Winston Churchill about how laughter gives people a vacation from horror. Rivers was on the cable news network Saturday promoting her new book, Diary of a Mad Diva, one day after she said that “we already have” a gay president in Barack Obama and that the first lady is “transgender.” About two minutes into this video, Whitfield asked her if she intentionally wore fur on the book cover, knowing she’d anger animal rights activists. And then it started getting ugly. “Are you wearing leather shoes?” Rivers fired back. The interviewer confessed she was. “Then shut up,” the veteran comedian retorted. Whitfield tried to calm her down but Rivers’ mind was made up. “I’m going,” she said. And she was just getting going. “All you’ve done is negative,” she ranted. “I’ve made people laugh for 50 years. I was put on this earth to make people laugh. My book is funny. I wear fur that was killed 15 years ago. I work for animal rights. Stop it with the ‘you’re mean!’ You are not the one to interview someone who does humor. Sorry!” Then she ripped off the internal feedback device out of her ear and walked off the set. The host, asking laughingly, “Are we serious?” Turns out she was serious, Whitfield noted in an epilogue, who thought it was a stunt. “She didn’t return to the set but she left her mic on as she continued talking and dropped some rather unflattering four-letter words. Yeah, she was serious.” But maybe take that whole episode with a grain of salt. After all, this is the woman who arranged to have Miss Piggy throw food at her a few months ago.

Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine.

Kenlie Tiggeman says she was humiliated by the gate agent's comments to her in front of other passengers last year, and she believes decisions about obese passengers should not be left to the discretion of gate attendants. She says she weighed \\"between 240 and 300\\" pounds at the time, although she has lost weight since. \\"The problem I have with Southwest is not that they want me to purchase two seats,\\" she writes in her blog. \\"It's that sometimes they want that, and other times they don't.

However, she is not seeking monetary compensation. Instead, she wants an industry standard established for fliers who need to pay for extra seats due to their size. ABC reports that Kenlie Tiggeman experienced humiliation when a gate agent made derogatory comments about her weight in front of her fellow passengers last year. Tiggeman believes that decisions regarding obese passengers should not be left to the arbitrary discretion of gate attendants. At the time of the incident, Tiggeman weighed between 240 and 300 pounds. She has since lost weight but continues to push for a standardized rule across the airline industry. According to her blog, Tiggeman's main issue with Southwest is the inconsistency in their policies. She states, \\"The problem I have with Southwest is not that they want me to purchase two seats. It's that sometimes they want that, and other times they don't. I don't know about you, but I fly a lot. And paying double because a gate agent may or may not have something against overweight people is not realistic—nor should it be necessary.\\" Tiggeman's lawsuit seeks to address the lack of a clear, consistent policy regarding passengers who might require additional seating due to their size. Establishing an industry standard would prevent individual gate agents from making decisions based on personal biases or opinions. This standard could also help avoid the public humiliation and embarrassment that Tiggeman experienced in her situation. As more people continue to fly, it is essential for airlines to address the needs of all passengers fairly and consistently. Instituting an industry standard would not only ensure proper accommodation for larger fliers but also protect them from potential discrimination or inconsistencies in airline policies. Tiggeman's fight for change serves as a reminder that the travel industry must continue to adapt and establish clear, compassionate regulations that benefit both the airlines and their diverse array of passengers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Upon returning to Toronto, Jackson published an article about his and Thomson's experience in the Park in the Toronto Sunday World, included in which were several illustrations. After this initial experience, Thomson and another colleague, William Broadhead, went on a two-month expedition, going up the Spanish River and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today Mississagi Provincial Park). Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his own original style of painting became apparent around this time. Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, was lost during two canoe spills; the first was on Green Lake in a rain squall and the second in a series of rapids.In fall 1912, Albert Robson, Grip's art director, moved to the design firm Rous & Mann.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Yet this is just the tip of an iceberg when it comes to UK firms owned by Indian businesses. The visit to the UK by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which starts on Thursday, comes at a time when India is emerging as perhaps the strongest player among the so-called Bric nations - Brazil, Russia, India and China. While the Brazilian, Chinese and Russian economies are all showing signs of slowing, India is booming. Shielded from China's slowdown thanks to its huge domestic market, India's economy is growing at a rate of 7% per year, putting it neck and neck with the Chinese. And some of that Indian growth is finding new markets in the UK. According to a report earlier this year from government department UK Trade & Investment (UKTI), India is now the third-largest source of foreign direct investment into the UK. In 2014 alone, investment from India into the UK increased by 64%, and is now almost level with France, the UK's second-largest investor after the US. Throughout last year, India invested in 122 projects in the UK, compared with 124 for France and 564 for the US. This meant that Indian investment created 7,730 new UK jobs in 2014, and safeguarded a further 1,620, said UKTI. Meanwhile, the UK India Business Council, the non-profit body that aims to boost trade and business links between the two countries, estimates that the total value of Indian investment in the UK in the 2013 to 2014 financial year totalled £1.89bn. Overall there are now more than 800 Indian-owned businesses in the UK, employing more than 110,000 people. In addition to Tata Motors, Indian IT firms Infosys and Wipro have UK operations. Meanwhile, sister Tata business, Tata Global Beverages, owns best-selling Tetley Tea; and Tata Steel has significant UK operations, despite recently announced job cuts due to falling demand and cheaper steel from China. Alpesh Patel, of London-based private equity business Praefinium Partners, says that while the success of companies such as Tata and Infosys is well known, the quality of Indian small to medium-sized enterprises has improved significantly over the past 10 years, and many are looking to enter EU markets using the UK as their gateway. He adds that the ease of doing business in the UK, as well as the English language and familiarity with UK institutions, also makes the UK an attractive proposition for Indian investors. \\"Ease of business here is often overlooked and taken for granted,\\" says Mr Patel. \\"We're used to comparing things in absolute terms - we might say it took ages to fill in a tax return for example - but we don't compare it with the same thing in India where it really is a pain.\\" He adds that one area that particularly appeals to Indian investors is the ease with which they can raise finance in the UK. \\"They're often not looking for money from the UK to go into their company in India, but looking for UK money going into their UK operations. We really overlook the size and strength of our angel investor and venture capital community. \\"Relative to companies in India, we're seen as an absolute haven in terms of access to capital if you've got a good business.\\" Mukesh Rajani, UK India business group leader at accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, says that besides the EU, the UK's historical connections with the rest of the world, including Africa, are key in attracting Indian investment. He adds that Indian firms are also keen to tap into British hi-tech expertise. \\"Advanced engineering is a big strength for the UK,\\" says Mr Rajani. \\"High-end engineering, high-end advanced services, high-end pharmaceuticals are very interesting areas for Indian companies. \\"Clearly at the high-end what is on offer in Britain is in a different league, and these things would take time for India to develop as it acquires its own talent.\\" Richard Heald, chief executive at the UK India Business Council, says that most of the investment in the UK is in the IT sectors and driven by Mr Modi's policy of making India the world's hub for IT industries. He says: \\"A lot of the growth in indigenous Indian industries has to be sustained through technological development. \\"If Modi's policies are to succeed then it needs to have exposure and involvement with a lot of the technological development, incubation, catapult centres, upstream technology companies that we have here. \\"The Indians naturally look to us for that in the form of joint ventures, or acquisitions, or just investment.\\" Mr Heald highlights pharmaceutical firms Piramal and Cipla as two other Indian businesses that have made significant moves into the UK. 110,000 people are employed by Indian companies operating in the UK 13 Indian companies each employ more than 1,000 people in the UK 65,000 people work for Tata Group, which owns 5 of those 13 companies 28,000 of those work for Tata Motors, which owns Jaguar Land Rover But what about UK investment going into India? Between 2000 and 2015, the UK invested 22.2bn (£14.5bn) in India, accounting for around 9% of foreign direct investment in the country, according to a report by UK business group the CBI. This makes the UK the largest foreign investor in India after Singapore and Mauritius. The CBI study added that in total UK companies are estimated to employ 691,000 people in India. That is 5.5% of the organised private sector workforce. Mr Heald says: \\"We estimate that there's been a 300% increase in the number of British companies setting up there in the past 10 years… there's been a huge acceleration. \\"And the type of company is changing too - it's more e-commerce, services, IT and education.\\" Under India's federal system, individual states are now more competitive, and are seeking inbound investment by cutting red tape, and simplifying the country's notoriously arcane state tax systems. Mr Heald adds: \\"The term 'competitive federalism' is now being bandied around… these states really have to compete for the investment pound.\\"","output":"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the UK highlights India's emergence as one of the strongest players among the BRIC nations, with the economy growing at 7% per year, and Indian businesses investing in the UK market; there are now more than 800 Indian-owned businesses in the UK, employing over 110,000 people."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Gothic fiction, which is largely known by the subgenre of Gothic horror, is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror, death, and at times romance. Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel \\"The Castle of Otranto\\", subtitled (in its second edition) \\"A Gothic Story.\\" The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century and had much success in the 19th, as witnessed by Mary Shelleys \\"Frankenstein\\" and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late Victorian era, is Bram Stokers \\"Dracula\\". The name \\"Gothic\\" refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating Gothic architecture, in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German \\"Schauerroman\\" and the French \\"Georgia\\".  - Ragnhild Westgaard Sigland (born November 13, 1976), mostly known by her stage name Nell Sigland, is a Norwegian singer from Hamar, best known as the lead vocalist of Norwegian gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy as a replacement for Liv Kristine, from June 3, 2004 to October 2, 2010. She was also the lead singer for Norwegian gothic rock band The Crest, founded by her husband Kristian Sigland and herself.  - Liv Kristine Espenæs (born 14 February 1976 in Stavanger, Norway), better known as Liv Kristine, is a singer/songwriter who has performed and composed songs mostly for various subgenres of heavy metal music. She is known for her work in close association with her then-husband and leader of the German band Atrocity, Alexander Krull. She started her career in the music industry as a vocalist for the gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy, and is the former lead vocalist for the symphonic metal band Leaves' Eyes.  - Storm is the sixth studio album by the Norwegian gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy , released in March 2006 . It is the band 's first album with a new lead singer Nell Sigland . The song \`\` Storm '' was released as the album 's only single . The album shows something of a return to gothic metal , although its sound is much lighter and more upbeat than that of earlier albums and it still uses modern English lyrics . The band embarked on a European tour to support the release . The cover art was designed by Thomas Ewerhard , who also made the covers for Assembly and Forever Is The World . The song \`\` Senseless '' was originally titled \`\` Seven '' , as it is written in septuple meter and is the seventh track on the album .  - Gothic rock (also referred to as goth rock or simply goth) is a musical subgenre of post-punk and alternative rock that formed during the late 1970s. Gothic rock bands grew from the strong ties they had to the English punk rock and emerging post-punk scenes. Proto-gothic bands include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus and the Cure.  - Stavanger is a city and municipality in Norway. The city is the third-largest urban zone and metropolitan area in Norway (through conurbation with neighbouring Sandnes) and the administrative centre of Rogaland county. The municipality is the fourth most populous in Norway. Located on the Stavanger Peninsula in Southwest Norway, Stavanger counts its official founding year as 1125, the year the Stavanger Cathedral was completed. Stavanger's core is to a large degree 18th- and 19th-century wooden houses that are protected and considered part of the city's cultural heritage. This has caused the town centre and inner city to retain a small-town character with an unusually high ratio of detached houses, and has contributed significantly to spreading the city's population growth to outlying parts of Greater Stavanger.  - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences.  - Death-doom is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic or depressive mood of doom metal with the deep growling vocals and double kick drumming of death metal. The genre emerged in the mid-1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s, but had become less common by the turn of the 21st century. In turn, death/doom gave rise to the closely related genre of funeral doom as well as to the more melodic and romantic gothic metal.  - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Theatre of Tragedy was a Norwegian band from Stavanger, active between 1993 and 2010. They are best known for their earlier albums, which influenced the gothic metal genre.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'genre'.

Premise: \\"uh-huh well that turned out to be a good game\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"It ended up being a decent team.\\"?","output":"If the premise, \\"uh-huh well that turned out to be a good game,\\" is true, the information provided does not necessarily entail or guarantee the hypothesis \\"It ended up being a decent team.\\" There could be various factors contributing to the game ultimately being considered good, and not all of them involve a decent team. To understand this better, let's break down the possible reasons behind a game being considered 'good' and analyze their relationship to the quality of the teams involved. 1. A close and competitive match: One reason a game might be considered good is the level of competition between the teams, with both sides presenting a strong challenge to each other. If both teams were decent, then it likely contributed to the game's excitement and would, to some extent, support the hypothesis. However, it is also possible that both teams were not necessarily decent, but their skills were closely matched, creating a competitive atmosphere. 2. Exceptional individual performances: Sometimes, a game might be considered 'good' because of outstanding performances by individual players, regardless of the team's overall quality. In this case, a game could be exciting and enjoyable to watch due to these remarkable moments, even if one or both teams were not particularly strong. This indicates that the premise doesn't inherently imply a decent team. 3. Unexpected outcomes: A game can be deemed good if there were unexpected twists and turns, such as come-from-behind victories or last-minute plays that determined the outcome. These surprises can make the game memorable and entertaining but do not directly correlate to the quality of the teams involved. 4. High scoring matches: Some spectators might consider a high-scoring game to be good, regardless of the overall skill level or quality of the teams. In these cases, enjoyment might stem from the constant back-and-forth and adrenaline-filled goal-scoring moments. Again, this doesn't necessarily mean that both teams were decent; there might be faulty defenses or goalkeepers at play that led to a higher score. 5. Emotional or rivalry context: A game might be considered good because of the emotions, history, or rivalry between the teams or their fans. In these cases, the game's excitement and \\"goodness\\" might come from the intense atmosphere rather than the quality of the teams themselves. In conclusion, while a good game might indirectly suggest that the teams involved put up a decent performance, the premise does not guarantee or necessarily entail the hypothesis \\"It ended up being a decent team.\\" There are various factors that could contribute to a game being considered good, and not all of these factors depend on the quality of the teams involved. The relationship between a good game and a decent team is not a strict cause-and-effect connection, but rather a multi-factorial scenario that depends on a range of elements, such as competition, individual performances, unexpected outcomes, high-scoring matches, and emotional context."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Q: Párrafo: A medida que el noroeste de Europa comenzó a calentarse lentamente hace 22 000 años, el subsuelo congelado y los glaciares alpinos expandidos comenzaron a descongelarse y las cubiertas de nieve de otoño-invierno se derritieron en la primavera. Gran parte de la descarga se dirigió al Rin y su extensión río abajo. El rápido calentamiento y los cambios de vegetación, para abrir el bosque, comenzaron alrededor del 13 000 BP. Para el 9000 BP, Europa estaba completamente cubierta de bosques. Con la reducción global de la cubierta de hielo, los niveles de agua del océano subieron y el Canal de la Mancha y el Mar del Norte se reintegraron.

She thought it was wonderful because it was so real, \\"Just the way people in the Ohio Valley are!\\" I'm from the area and I experienced the film as \\"Just the way people in California think we are!\\" I've lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there. We laughed a lot, we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age; the young people went out together at night. The older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families. The area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else. Aside from the \\"if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed\\" condescension, the story lacked any elements of charm, mystery or even a sense of dread. Martha's character was the worst drawn. It's doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church, but if she had, she probably would have made friends there. I've read reviews that seem to assume Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was \\"younger, prettier and thinner\\" but if this is the case it isn't shown. All we actually see is Martha learning to dislike Rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender. We see Martha feeling left out during smoking sessions, left out of the loop when social plans are made, used but not appreciated, and finally disrespected and hurt.

Q: To assess if titration of sevoflurane using the bispectral index (BIS) monitor improves the early and intermediate recovery in geriatric outpatients undergoing brief urologic procedures under general anesthesia without muscle relaxants.', 'After a standardized induction with propofol and fentanyl, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted and sevoflurane was administered in combination with 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen for maintenance of anesthesia in spontaneously breathing outpatients. In the Control group (n = 25), sevoflurane and fentanyl were titrated according to standard clinical practice.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon, and SCTV alumnus are all together in a sometimes funny sketch film. However, it is very interesting to watch now, at the start of 2005. Twenty years after this movie is supposed to take place, look at how many of their gags have become absolutely true: There is a mock movie trailer, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, for something called \\"The Pregnant Man\\" which came true with Arnold Schwarzenegger's dumb movie \\"Junior\\" There is a commercial spoof, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, for something featuring Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called \\"Celebrity Wrestling\\" which has now come true with a popular show called \\"Celebrity Boxing\\" There is a mock movie trailer, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, that features John Candy in a movie about a severed head. Watch this trailer and look how similar it's shots and plot are to Frank Hellenlotter's Basket Case!! And finally there is an ad for a late late show documentary about \\"a dead dream, the only two left ...\\" The name of the documentary is ... THE LAST HIPPIES! LOL. Four prophecies come true!","output":"The sentiment of the given review can be considered mixed to positive. The reviewer acknowledges the presence of humor in the sketch film and appreciates the performances of the cast members from Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon, and SCTV, which adds a positive sentiment. Furthermore, the review points out the interesting aspect of how many gags from the film have become true in the span of twenty years. The reviewer provides examples of these gags that have manifested in reality, highlighting \\"The Pregnant Man,\\" \\"Celebrity Wrestling,\\" a plot about a severed head, and \\"The Last Hippies\\" documentary. This revelation adds an element of amazement and appreciation for the film, contributing to the overall positive sentiment. However, the reviewer also indicates that some of the gags \\"probably wasn't even clever at the time,\\" which can be seen as a slightly negative sentiment. This suggests that some jokes may not have made the intended impact on the viewer or may not have aged well. In summary, the overall sentiment of the review is mixed to positive. The reviewer appreciates the humor and performances of the cast members, and is intrigued by the predictions made by the film. While there are some criticisms regarding the cleverness of certain gags, the overall tone remains mostly positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier.

While iterating, check the current index. If the index is less than the calculated index, append the current element to the new list B. 5. In our example,     - At index 0, we have 'p'. Since 0 < 19, we append 'p' to B.     - At index 1, we have 'v'. Since 1 < 19, we append 'v' to B.     - ...     - At index 18, we have '3349'. Since 18 < 19, we append '3349' to B.     - At index 19, we have 'w'. Since 19 is not less than 19, we don't append 'w' to B.     - At index 20, we have 'L'.

Given these facts, what are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do among the following options: - heat or cold  - sensory neurons  - a delta  - gene segments  - A Greek letter  - to move people  - lie detectors  - Electrical energy","output":"Among the given options, \\"gene segments\\" are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do. A detailed explanation is provided below: 1. Heat or cold: Heat and cold are physical temperature sensations that can have an effect on cells and organisms. They are not encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do but can lead to specific cellular responses depending on the conditions. 2. Sensory neurons: Sensory neurons are a type of nerve cell that transmit signals from sensory organs (such as skin, eyes, ears, tongue, and nose) to the brain, where the information is then processed. While sensory neurons are responsible for transmitting information about the external environment to cells, they themselves are not encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do. 3. A delta: A delta is a landform created by the deposition of sediment carried by a river as the flow leaves its mouth and enters slower-moving or stagnant water. This geographical feature is not related to the encoding of instructions for cellular processes. 4. Gene segments: Gene segments are specific regions of DNA molecules that carry genetic information. They are indeed encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do. These instructions translate into the formation of proteins, which then carry out specific functions within the cell, such as providing structure or facilitating chemical reactions. 5. A Greek letter: Greek letters are symbols used in various fields such as mathematics, science, and engineering to represent specific values or concepts. They are not related to cellular instructions and do not contain information that directs cell function. 6. To move people: Moving people refers to the action of transporting individuals from one location to another. This concept is not related to the encoding of instructions within cells and does not have a direct influence on cellular processes. 7. Lie detectors: Lie detectors, or polygraphs, are devices used to measure physiological responses such as heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductivity, to help determine whether a person is being truthful or lying. This technology is not related to the encoding of cellular instructions that direct cell function. 8. Electrical energy: Electrical energy is a form of energy resulting from the existence of charged particles (such as electrons or protons), either statically or as a current. Some cellular processes, like the transmission of nerve impulses, involve electrical energy. However, electrical energy itself is not encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do. In summary, among the options provided, gene segments are the only category directly involved with encoding instructions that tell cells what to do. These segments of DNA molecules carry genetic information that is essential for the formation and function of proteins within cells, ultimately determining an organism's characteristics, growth, development, and overall cellular processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A catcall could be whistling at, making kissing sounds at, or lobbing uninvited comments in a woman’s direction while she is walking about, minding her own business.  “Hey, beautiful,” or “What are you doing later, sweetheart?” are examples of comments you should keep to yourself.  If you see an attractive woman walking around, go about your business and leave her alone. Don’t leer.  Don’t make that gaping-mouthed, wide-eyed caveman face.  If a woman is walking towards you, do not assume it is because she wants to talk to you.  She has somewhere to be and should be allowed to reach her destination without being subjected to your unwanted gaze.  Staring is creepy, irritating, and gross for the woman in question.  If you feel your eyes fixating on someone, just close your eyes or look away. When you’re in a bar or club, sexual harassment often takes the form of unwanted touching or groping.  When alcohol is involved, the likelihood that women will be confronted with unwanted sexual attention increases.  Understand that just as you have a right to dance and drink in public without being accosted, so to do women.  If they rebuff your advances or are unreceptive to your invitations to drink and dance, do not try to coerce them by grabbing them by the arm, around the waist, or engaging in other forms of unwanted touching.  Be respectful of women’s wishes and demands at all times. If you find liquor leads you to sexually harass women, try drinking at home with your friends. The most infamous of this category are so-called “blonde jokes,” whose punchline always drives home that women with blonde hair are stupid.  This kind of gendered humor constitutes sexual harassment.  Other jokes about women revolve around a variety of other traits traditionally considered feminine, such as cooking, cleaning, or caring for children.  If a joke is at the expense of a woman’s integrity or feelings, don’t tell it.  There are plenty of funny jokes which don’t turn women into the punchline. Misogynists and male chauvinists see no problem with sexual harassment.  They think it is their right to touch or talk about women in whatever ways they want.  By being with them, you are more likely to internalize and tacitly approve this behavior as acceptable.  But when you choose not go out with them, you can take the opportunity to explain that  you’re doing so in order to work towards a new life built on respect for, empathy with, and understanding of women.  Hopefully your example will make them consider their behavior too.  Be firm when expressing your disdain for harassment.  Look your friends in the eye so they know you are not joking. Examples of things you can say to chastise your male chauvinist friends include:  How would you like it if people treated you like an object? She's not a dog, don't whistle at her.  What makes you think this kind of behavior is acceptable? Summary:","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of respecting women by not engaging in catcalling, unwanted touching, telling offensive jokes, or tolerating harassing behavior from friends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Crafting and working on DIY projects together can be an exciting and meaningful way to connect with your partner while creating something special. In this article, we will share four unique do-it-yourself projects that you and your significant other can enjoy—making a nail polish remover tub, jumbo crayons, a candle holder, and writing a love medication. 1. Nail Polish Remover Tub: Creating a nail polish remover tub together is a fun way to bond while simplifying your self-care routine. Step 1: Gather materials: You'll need a mason jar with a lid, a kitchen sponge, and nail polish remover. Step 2: Cut sponge: Measure the height and width of the mason jar. Cut the sponge to fit snugly, and push it into the jar while leaving some space at the bottom for the nail polish remover. Step 3: Pour remover: Pour nail polish remover into the jar until the sponge is fully saturated.  Step 4: Use the tub: When ready to remove polish, insert your finger into the sponge and twist. The act of working together on this simple, yet useful project will strengthen your bond with each other while making a practical item for your home. 2. Jumbo Crayons: Creating jumbo crayons can bring out the child in both of you while adding a playful element to your art supplies. Step 1: Collect materials: Gather broken crayons, a silicone mold (preferably a jumbo size), and an oven. Step 2: Sort crayons: Separate crayons by color and remove labels. Step 3: Melt crayons: Preheat the oven to 230°F (110°C). Place crayons in the silicone mold and bake for 10-15 minutes or until completely melted. Step 4: Cool and remove: Allow crayons to cool completely before removing them from the mold. This creative activity can be enjoyed by both artistic and non-artistic couples, sparking conversations and laughter throughout the process. 3. Candle Holder: Making a candle holder together can result in a beautiful piece that adds a warm, romantic ambiance to your space. Step 1: Decide on materials: Choose a glass, ceramic, or other heat-resistant vessel for your candle holder. Step 2: Select embellishments: Gather items to decorate your holder, such as paint, beads, or ribbons. Step 3: Decorate the holder: Work together to create a design that reflects both your personalities and style preferences. Step 4: Add candle: Place a tea light or small pillar candle inside the holder and enjoy the warm glow. This project symbolizes the light that your love for each other brings, making it a perfect sentimental addition to your home. 4. Write a Love Medication: Writing a love medication (love letter or poem) for your partner is an intimate way to express your affection and strengthen your emotional connection. Step 1: Reflect on your relationship: Think about your journey together and what makes your bond unique. Step 2: Draft your message: Write a heartfelt letter or poem that conveys your feelings and appreciation, including sweet memories and shared experiences. Step 3: Share your words: Read your love medication aloud to each other, or surprise your partner by placing it somewhere they are sure to find it. This emotionally engaging activity encourages open communication between partners while reinforcing the importance of your love and commitment to one another. Conclusion: DIY projects offer an engaging and intimate way for couples to connect while creating functional or sentimental items. These four projects – a nail polish remover tub, jumbo crayons, a candle holder, and writing a love medication – provide opportunities for couples to express their creativity, love, and support for each other while crafting shared experiences and memories that will last a lifetime."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The statement provided, \\"oh your in Texas oh okay i was i was going to go goodness they really got uh this out far,\\" offers limited context and information. However, a possible interpretation of the provided statement can help us infer the speaker's thoughts, feelings, or situation. First, let's examine the statement in-depth: 1. \\"oh your in Texas\\" - The speaker acknowledges that the person they are talking to is in Texas.     2. \\"oh okay i was i was going to go\\" - The speaker seems to have had plans or intentions to visit Texas at some point. Their reason for not going is not mentioned. 3. \\"goodness they really got uh this out far\\" - This part of the statement is less clear, but the speaker might be referring to something (an event, news, or even a product) that has reached Texas. It could indicate the speaker is impressed or surprised that whatever they are discussing has made it to Texas. From this interpretation, we can gather that the speaker acknowledges the other person being in Texas, and they themselves had plans to go to Texas. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the speaker still wishes to go to Texas or if they are currently in Texas. Additionally, there is no direct indication of the speaker's emotions or desires in the provided statement. In conclusion, based on the information from the premise, we cannot definitively confirm or refute the hypothesis \\"I am not in Texas but wish I was.\\" The statement offers limited context, leaving room for various interpretations about the speaker's thoughts, feelings, and location."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Minnie continued to record into the 1950s, but her health began to decline. With public interest in her music waning, she retired from her musical career, and in 1957 she and Lawlars returned to Memphis. Periodically, she appeared on Memphis radio stations to encourage young blues musicians. In 1958 she played at a memorial concert for Big Bill Broonzy. As the Garons wrote in Woman with Guitar, \\"She never laid her guitar down, until she could literally no longer pick it up.\\" She suffered a stroke in 1960, which left her confined to a wheelchair. Lawlars died the following year, and Minnie had another stroke a short while after. She could no longer survive on her Social Security income. Magazines wrote about her plight, and readers sent her money for assistance. She spent her last years in the Jell Nursing Home, in Memphis, where she died of a stroke in 1973. She is buried at the New Hope Baptist Church Cemetery, in Walls, DeSoto County, Mississippi.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: There are two major parties in Britain today,the Conservative and the Labour,which have been in power by turns since 1945.The twoparty system of Britain was formed in the course of the development of the capitalist state and the political parties. To strengthen the state machine,the British bourgeosie have let it come into being and exist in one form or another since the 17th century. P.S.Tregidgo once said,\\"The more parties there are,the less likely it is that any one of them will be strong enough in Parliament to control all the others; but when there are only two,one of them is sure to have a majority of seats. This helps to ensure a strong and stable government.\\" This explains why the British have the twoparty system. The division into two parties grew out the establishment of a Protestant Church of England in the 16th century. Because of a purely religious difference of opinion,the Puritans were separated from the broad body of the Anglican Church. The non Puritan Anglicans were on the side of the King and Church,whose supporters were called by their opponents \\"Tories\\".The Puritans were for Parliament and trade,whose supporters are called by the \\"Tories\\" \\"Whigs\\".The Tories and the Whigs were in power by turns for a long time. In 1833,the Tory Party split into two and its name was changed to Conservative. In the 1860s the Whigs became Liberals. Since then,the Liberals and the Conservatives were in office by turns until 1922.They have some different opinions,but were both controlled by the rich. The working class became more and more unwilling to follow the Conservatives and the Liberals. They wanted to have their own party. So the Labour Party was formed by the trade unions. After 1922,the Labour Party gradually replaced the Liberal Party. Options: A Because the trade unions did not do much good for the working people. B Because the Liberal Party were not strong enough to defeat the Conservative Party. C Because the working people would not like to be members outside the Liberal Party. D Because neither of the two major parties was the parties for the working people. Answer: D Because neither of the two major parties was the parties for the working people. Question: The answer to this question is:","output":"Why did the Labour Party gradually replace the Liberal Party after 1922 in Britain's two-party system? A.

She then joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1993 at the age of 21. She was the youngest cast member at the time, and the first bluegrass artist to join the Opry in twenty-nine years. She also collaborated on a project with the Cox Family in 1994, a bluegrass album called I Know Who Holds Tomorrow. Mandolin and guitar player Dan Tyminski replaced Tim Stafford in Union Station in 1994. Late in the year, Krauss recorded with the band Shenandoah on its single \\"Somewhere in the Vicinity of the Heart\\", which brought her to the country music Top Ten for the first time and it won the Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. Also in 1994, Krauss collaborated with Suzy Bogguss, Kathy Mattea, and Crosby, Stills, and Nash to contribute \\"Teach Your Children\\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Oleg Peshkov's body, Sputnik news says      Russia and Turkey have been at loggerheads since Turkey shot down the pilot's jet      Istanbul (CNN) In the bitter debate over where a Russian warplane was flying when Turkish aircraft shot it down, the United States took Turkey's side Monday.      The available information indicates the warplane shot down last week was in Turkish airspace, State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said at a Monday press briefing.      Moscow has steadfastly maintained its jet was over Syria when it was downed.      The State Department announcement came after the body of a Russian pilot who died after the jet was shot down along the Turkey-Syria border was flown back to Russia, according to Russia's Ministry of Defense.      Col. Oleg Peshkov's body arrived Monday at the Chkalovsky military airport near Moscow, according to a statement from the ministry. ||||| ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday called for sanctions against Turkey, following the downing this week by Turkey of a Russian warplane.

(Associated Press)      Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses a rally in Bayburt, Turkey, Friday, Nov. 27, 2015. Russia announced Friday that it will suspend visa-free travel with Turkey amid the escalating spat... (Associated Press)      The decree published on the Kremlin's website Saturday came hours after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had voiced regret over the incident, saying his country was \\"truly saddened\\" by the event and wished it hadn't occurred.      It includes a ban on some goods and forbids extensions of labor contracts for Turks working in Russia as of Jan. 1. It doesn't specify what goods are to be banned or give other details, but it also calls for ending chartered flights from Russia to Turkey and for Russian tourism companies to stop selling vacation packages that would include a stay in Turkey.      Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev earlier in the week had ordered his cabinet to develop a list of goods to be sanctioned.      Putin's decree also calls for ending visa-free travel between Russia and Turkey and orders the tightening of control over Turkish air carriers in Russia \\"for security reasons.\\" The decree was issued \\"to protect Russian citizens from crimes,\\" a Kremlin statement said.      Erdogan's expression of regret Saturday was the first since Tuesday's incident in which Turkish F-16 jets shot down the Russian jet on grounds that it had violated Turkey's airspace despite repeated warnings to change course. It was the first time in half a century that a NATO member shot down a Russian plane and drew a harsh response from Moscow.      \\"We are truly saddened by this incident,\\" Erdogan said. \\"We wish it hadn't happened as such, but unfortunately such a thing has happened. I hope that something like this doesn't occur again.\\"      Addressing supporters in the western city of Balikesir, Erdogan said neither country should allow the incident to escalate and take a destructive form that would lead to \\"saddening consequences.\\"      He renewed a call for a meeting with Putin on the sidelines of a climate conference in Paris next week, saying it would be an opportunity to overcome tensions.      Erdogan's friendly overture however, came after he again vigorously defended Turkey's action and criticized Russia for its operations in Syria.      \\"If we allow our sovereign rights to be violated ... then the territory would no longer be our territory,\\" Erdogan said.      Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu also said he hoped a meeting between Erdogan and Putin would take place in Paris.      \\"In such situations it is important to keep the channels of communication open,\\" he said.      Putin has denounced the Turkish action as a \\"treacherous stab in the back,\\" and has insisted that the plane was downed over Syrian territory in violation of international law. He has also refused to take telephone calls from Erdogan. Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Friday that the Kremlin had received Erdogan's request for a meeting, but wouldn't say whether such a meeting is possible.      Asked why Putin hasn't picked up the phone to respond to Erdogan's two phone calls, he said that \\"we have seen that the Turkish side hasn't been ready to offer an elementary apology over the plane incident.\\"      After the incident, Russia deployed long-range S-400 air defense missile systems to a Russian air base in Syria just 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of the border with Turkey to help protect Russian warplanes, and the Russian military warned it would shoot down any aerial target that would pose a potential threat to its planes.      On Saturday Turkey issued a travel warning urging its nationals to delay non-urgent and unnecessary travel to Russia, saying Turkish travelers were facing \\"problems\\" in the country. It said Turks should delay travel plans until \\"the situation becomes clear.\\"      ___      Heintz reported from Moscow. |||||","output":"Tensions between Turkey and Russia continue to escalate following the downing of a Russian jet by Turkish forces; both countries maintain opposing accounts as to whether the Russian plane was indeed in Turkish airspace at the time of the incident.

SS Cato was built on Clydeside in 1914, and survived her World War One service as an ammunition-carrier. After the Great War she ferried freight across the Irish Sea for the Bristol Steam Navigation Company, and had carried out thousands of crossings by the time of that fateful one in the early hours of 3 March 1940. U-boat U29 had been tasked with attacking the British battleships HMS Hood and HMS Warspite off the coast of Scotland, but when she failed to find them she headed south for the Bristol Channel, where she laid two minefields off Nash Point. Cato's distress call was received by a trawler two miles away, but it had sunk by the time help arrived. Mr Martin said: \\"It's a strange story, as it has two utterly contrasting sides to it; the tragedy felt by the families of the sailors in Bristol, and the pleasure of the people around Porthcawl at their unexpected windfall, at a time when beer of any kind was in very short supply.\\" In his blog, local historian Rob Bowen outlines some of the local legends surrounding the beer barrels and how, despite the best efforts of Customs officials, some were hidden among the dunes by locals who revisited them from time to time armed with jugs and glasses. The commemorations start at 11:15 BST from the Porthcawl Lifeboat Station. There will be a service and the dedication of a plaque, with beer barrels being \\"smuggled\\" to a local pub. Summary:","output":"The SS Cato, also known as the Guinness Wreck, was a merchant vessel that struck a mine off Nash Point during World War II, becoming the first Bristol Channel merchant shipping casualty of the war. Historian Rob Bowen highlights that the ship's cargo included 740 barrels of beer, which washed ashore and were salvaged by locals in a \\"Drunken Dad's Army few days.\\" The vessel was built in 1914 and had served as an ammunition-carrier during World War I. On March 3, 1940, the ship encountered a minefield laid by U-boat U29 and sank before help could arrive.

A:","output":"The first step of the process is when the egg hatches to form a larva, which is commonly known as a caterpillar. This is the initial stage in the life cycle of a butterfly. The butterfly starts as an egg that was laid by an adult butterfly on a leaf or another suitable surface. This is important because the location of the egg determines the type of plant that the caterpillar will feed on as it grows. Female butterflies are typically very selective when choosing the plant on which to lay their eggs. They ensure that the plant can provide ample food for the caterpillars. Different species of butterflies have unique preferences for specific host plants. Once the female butterfly has identified an appropriate plant, it will deposit its eggs, often on the underside of leaves to protect them from predators and the elements. The eggs themselves are generally small and vary in shape and color depending on the butterfly species. They have a hard outer shell called the chorion, which protects the developing larva. Within the egg, the larva starts to develop, undergoing a process known as embryogenesis. During this stage, the basic body plan of the caterpillar is formed, including the development of essential organs. When the development process within the egg is complete, the larva is ready to hatch. This typically occurs within a few days to several weeks, depending on the species and environmental conditions. The tiny caterpillar emerges from the egg using its mouthparts, called mandibles, which help it break through the tough outer shell. Upon hatching, the caterpillar is often no larger than the size of a pinhead. Once the larva is out of the egg, it immediately begins feeding on the host plant, consuming the very leaf on which it hatched. The caterpillar's main goal during this stage is to grow rapidly, and it accomplishes this by consuming large amounts of plant material. As the caterpillar grows, it will undergo several rounds of molting, shedding its old skin to accommodate its expanding body size. This process of growth and molting continues until the caterpillar is ready for the next stage of its life cycle – the formation of the pupa or chrysalis, where it will complete the incredible transformation into an adult butterfly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.  Question: \\"What did the Arawak excel at prior to the coming of the Europeans?\\" Answer: \\"They excelled at thatching, weaving, and farming, and they left some paintings\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

Trivia question: What is the name of the substitute for Silver invented in 1745 by Thomas Bolsover? And the answer is?","output":"The answer is \\"Sheffield Plate.\\" Thomas Bolsover, an English cutler and inventor, discovered Sheffield Plate in 1745. The innovation came about as he was trying to repair a silver knife handle, and accidentally fused a sheet of silver to a piece of copper. Intrigued by the success of this fusion, he continued experimenting and eventually developed a technique to bond thin sheets of silver onto copper, which formed a strong and durable bond.  This new form of plate soon became popular, as it had the elegance and appearance of solid silver while being significantly more affordable. The creation of Sheffield Plate allowed the middle and working classes to enjoy the luxury of silverware without the prohibitive cost of solid silver. It also led to a boom in the production of decorative and functional items made from the material, such as trays, teapots, candlesticks, and cutlery. The Sheffield Plate process usually involved sandwiching a copper sheet between two thin sheets of silver, which were then fused together using heat and pressure. The bonded metal was then rolled to the desired thickness, which allowed for further shaping and design work to be completed. Although it initially thrived, the popularity of Sheffield Plate waned in the 19th century with the introduction of electroplating – an even more cost-effective method of applying a thin layer of silver onto base metals. Despite this, antique Sheffield Plate items are still highly sought after by collectors, and the invention remains an important part of Sheffield's industrial heritage. In conclusion, Thomas Bolsover's invention of Sheffield Plate in 1745 provided a more affordable alternative to solid silver, enabling a wider population to enjoy the elegance and appearance of silverware. Although this technique may not be as popular today due to the advent of electroplating, Sheffield Plate holds an important place in the history of metallurgy and decorative arts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who still appealed in his images and cultural references to an elite humanist and aristocratic audience? is inside the article: Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\".

Hieronymus Bosch was a Dutch/Netherlandish painter from the 15th to 16th century. He became famous for his detailed illustrations of religious stories and narratives, with a specific focus on the themes of sin and morality. His most notable works present intensely symbolic and surrealistic imagery, which have led to a wide array of interpretations throughout history.

Use the same method to teach your dog to jump through hoops.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Master the Art of Jumping: A Comprehensive Guide for Training Your Dog Introduction A well-trained dog is not only a delight to be around, but it also provides a sense of pride and accomplishment to the owner. One captivating and useful skill that you may want to teach your dog is jumping. Whether you're doing it for fun, agility competitions, or simply to keep your furry companion physically engaged, teaching your dog how to jump can be a bonding and rewarding experience. In this article, we will discuss various steps and techniques that will guide you through the process of training your dog to confidently jump over obstacles and through hoops. Step 1: Choose the Right Jumping Equipment  Introducing your dog to jumping begins with selecting the appropriate tools and equipment that will make the process easy and safe for both of you. An adjustable jump is an ideal choice, as it can be altered gradually to accommodate your dog's growing confidence and ability. You can create your own jump using cinder blocks and plywood, or purchase one from a pet store. Step 2: Use Natural Outdoor Obstacles  Taking your dog outdoors provides them with a familiar and conducive environment that encourages them to engage in physical activities. When it comes to jumping, natural outdoor obstacles such as tree logs, park benches, and low walls can help in the initial stages of training. Step 3: Use Treats to Encourage Your Dog We all know that dogs love treats, and using them as positive reinforcement can significantly boost your dog's motivation and performance during training sessions. Set down a treat on the far side of the jump to encourage your dog to go over the obstacle. As your dog begins to associate the successful completion of a jump with a tasty reward, their enthusiasm to perform will naturally increase. Step 4: Begin with the Lowest Level  Before your dog can achieve soaring heights, it's crucial to begin with low jumps and gradually progress. This helps your dog gain the necessary confidence and reduces the chance of injury due to attempting jumps that are too high too soon. Practice at the lowest level until your dog begins to show comfort and ease in executing the jump. Step 5: Gradually Raise the Bar As your dog becomes more comfortable jumping at the lowest level, it's time to challenge them and gradually increase the jump height. This can be done by either raising the adjustable bar on the homemade or purchased jump or by seeking out higher natural obstacles during your outdoor training sessions. Remember to always observe your dog's comfort and progress closely, and never push them to jump higher than they can manage. Step 6: Teach Your Dog to Jump Through Hoops Once your dog has confidently mastered regular jumps, the next step is to introduce them to jumping through hoops. The process remains the same: start with a low hoop and gradually raise it, using treats as an incentive. Your dog's natural agility and newfound jumping prowess will soon have them sailing through hoops with ease. Conclusion Training your dog to jump can be an enjoyable and fulfilling experience for both you and your canine companion. By using adjustable jumps, natural outdoor obstacles, treats, and gradual progression, you'll be able to hone your dog's jumping skills while strengthening the bond between the two of you. Remember that patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement are the keys to success in dog training. So, get ready to hit the jumping trails and watch your furry friend master the art of jumping!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The passage clearly states that the United States wishes to observe and assess the functioning of the court before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction. In particular, the speaker asserts that they will not recommend that their successor submits the treaty to the Senate until their concerns are addressed. Thus, it can be inferred that the United States has not ratified the ICC treaty, thereby indicating that the ICC does not currently have jurisdiction in the United States. The reluctance to submit to the ICC's jurisdiction could be rooted in the desire to protect the country's interests and sovereignty, alongside concerns about the functioning of the court. By observing the functioning of the court before committing to its jurisdiction, the United States aims to mitigate potential risks and ensure its involvement is in the country's best interests.

Roll a soft towel into a ball and stuff it inside your hat to help it keep its shape. This is especially useful for hats that have gone limp after washing, or if you do not have a container on hand to rest your hat on as it dries.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The double helical nature of DNA, together with the findings of Chargaff, demonstrated the base-pairing nature of the bases. Adenine always pairs with thymine, and guanine always pairs with cytosine ( Figure below ). Because of this complementary nature of DNA, the bases on one strand determine the bases on the other strand. These complementary base pairs explain why the amounts of guanine and cytosine are present in equal amounts, as are the amounts of adenine and thymine. Adenine and guanine are known as purines . These bases consist of two ring structures. Purines make up one of the two groups of nitrogenous bases. Thymine and cytosine are pyrimidines , which have just one ring structure. By having a purine always combine with a pyrimidine in the DNA double helix, the distance between the two sugar-phosphate backbones is constant, maintaining the uniform shape of the DNA molecule.

Before too long, both of them are wrapped up in the druggie lifestyle. What starts off as harmless fun and pleasure ends up as pain and misery. Heath Ledger is the poet, Dan is a pretty good con man and works a nice credit card scheme that keeps the cash coming in at a steady rate- for awhile. Then, of course, their luck runs out and it comes down to lying, stealing and manipulating Candy's family for money. Soon, as Dan and Candy sink further and further into a horrific heroin addiction; it comes down to prostitution, degradation and then withdrawal. This is ultimately a very sad story with a bittersweet ending. Dan's devotion to Candy is shown when the two suffer through horrible heroin withdrawal only to decide that they cannot quit the drug cold turkey and turn to methadone. Dan moves them to the country and takes on some menial labor jobs for money to put food on the table. Candy doesn't work and soon becomes more and more depressed and lonely; hanging out and smoking pot with a neighbor. Her behavior becomes more and more erratic and before long she flees the country.

American hazelnuts are typically ripe in september or october. The nuts should start to turn brown, but the leaves around the nut should still be green. Choose from: * They should also have a wilted, almost shriveled appearance. If you have sensitive skin, look for a fresh american hazelnut. * For every 1 pot of hazelnuts you harvest, place an ice cube tray over the fruit and freeze it to halt the harvest for the next batch of hazelnuts. Choose a harvest date that fits with the season. * Ripe hazelnuts are perfect for roast crappie and nuts. Mature hazelnuts can be purchased pre-roasted, or you can take them out of their packaging before the last day of the season. * If you pick the nuts before this time, they won't be ripe enough and won't taste good. The leaves around the nuts are called involucres.","output":"How to harvest hazelnuts Pick American hazelnuts in the fall.  American hazelnuts are typically ripe in September or October. The nuts should start to turn brown, but the leaves around the nut should still be green. If you pick the nuts before this time, they won't be ripe enough and won't taste good. The leaves around the nuts are called involucres. When harvesting American hazelnuts, it is essential to pay attention to the appearance and texture of the nuts. They should have a slight give when pressed, indicating that they are mature enough to harvest. Keep in mind that the quality of the nuts depends on various factors, such as the soil, sunlight, and rainfall that the hazelnut trees receive throughout the year. To harvest hazelnuts, gently pick the nuts from the branches and collect them in a basket or container. Be sure not to squeeze or crush the involucres, as this can damage the nuts inside. If necessary, wear gloves to protect your hands and avoid any potential irritations from the involucres, especially if you have sensitive skin. Once you have gathered the hazelnuts, the next step is to remove the involucres surrounding the nuts. This can be done by gently rolling the nuts between your hands or using a specialized tool like a nutcracker. Be cautious not to apply too much pressure, as this could crack the nutshells and damage the nuts inside.  With the involucres removed, you should lay the hazelnuts out to dry in a cool, well-ventilated area. This process may take a few days to a week, depending on the humidity level in your region. Drying the nuts not only preserves them but also improves their flavor as moisture evaporates. Be sure to check the hazelnuts regularly during the drying process and discard any that appear moldy or have a foul odor.  When the nuts are fully dried, they can be stored in airtight containers for several months at room temperature or frozen for extended storage. Ripe hazelnuts are delicious when used in various recipes, such as roast crappie and nuts, or simply enjoyed on their own as a healthy snack. If you prefer roasted hazelnuts, you can roast them in an oven at home or purchase them pre-roasted from a store. Remember that the quality and taste of store-bought hazelnuts may vary from those you have harvested yourself, so it's always advisable to taste and compare them before using them in recipes. In conclusion, harvesting American hazelnuts requires careful attention to their ripeness, gentle handling during the picking process, and proper preparation to maximize their taste and shelf life. By following these steps, you can enjoy the delicious and versatile hazelnuts in various dishes or as a nutritious snack throughout the year."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years.  He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs.  In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld.  Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages.  Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published.  Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser.  While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions.  Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.

Output:","output":"The task is asking you to find the probability of picking one \\"g\\" and one \\"k\\" when two letters are picked without replacement from a given set. Here are the simple steps to find the answer: 1. Understand the given set: {k: 1, l: 1, g: 1, b: 1, p: 1}. This means there is one of each letter: k, l, g, b, p. 2. Determine the total number of letters in the set, which is 5 (1k, 1l, 1g, 1b, 1p). 3. Find the probability of picking a \\"g\\" (1g) first without replacement. This means once you pick a letter, it is not placed back into the set. There is 1 \\"g\\" out of 5 total letters (1g and 4 non-g letters), so the probability is 1/5. 4. Next, there are 4 remaining letters (1k, 1l, 1b, 1p). Find the probability of picking a \\"k\\" (1k) from the remaining 4 letters. There is 1 \\"k\\" out of the 4 remaining letters (1k and 3 non-k letters), so the probability is 1/4. 5. To find the probability of both events happening (picking 1g and then 1k), multiply the individual probabilities:  (Probability of picking 1g) * (Probability of picking 1k) = (1/5) * (1/4) 6. Multiply the fractions: (1*1)/(5*4) = 1/20 So, the final answer is 1/20, which is the probability of picking one \\"g\\" and one \\"k\\" when two letters are picked without replacement from the given set."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Take bladderworts, a kind of such plant, for example. They appear so small and grow in a quiet pond. \\"But these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom, able to capture a small insect in 1/50 of a second using a trap door!\\" Once the trap door closes on the victim, the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insert. When dinner is over, the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again. Meat-eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn't offer much food nutrition. In such conditions, these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years. North America has more such plants than any other continents. Generally speaking, the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye, like pitcher plants, which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers full of nectar . Hair-like growths along the pitcher walls ensure that nothing can escape, and the digestive enzymes can get to work. A tiny insect can be digested in a few hours, but a fly takes a couple of days. Some of these pitchers are large enough to hold 7.5 liters. Meat-eating plants only eat people in science fiction movies, but sometimes a bird or other small animals will discover that a pitcher plant isn't a good place to get a drink.

Meat-eating plants supplement their nutrient intake with soil nutrients, according to the exhibition. E. The exhibition reports that Asia has the highest number of carnivorous plants. The correct answer is B. The San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers exhibition highlights carnivorous plants such as bladderworts, which are capable of trapping insects extremely quickly. The exhibition informs visitors about these fascinating plants' life cycle aspects, including their unique method of capturing prey using a trap-door mechanism and their ability to digest prey using enzymes similar to those found in the human stomach.  Looking at the choices, option A is incorrect since the exhibition does clearly feature carnivorous, or meat-eating, plants. Option C is incorrect because the information in the article indicates that these plants primarily inhabit wet areas where the soil is poor in nutrients, not dry climates. Option D is also incorrect as the meat-consuming plants are actually found in areas with soil that isn't nutritious, and they've developed their insect-trapping mechanisms as a way to obtain the nutrition they require. Importantly, the text from the article doesn't imply that they supplement their nutrient intake with soil nutrients. In the case of choice E, the text expressly mentions that North America, not Asia, has the greatest number of these plants.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The story opens in the 1950s, after the Korean War; it has been more than a decade since James Whale, director of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, has retired. He lives with his long-time housemaid, Hanna, who loyally cares for him but disapproves of his homosexuality. Whale has suffered a series of strokes that have left him fragile and tormented by memories: growing up as a poor outcast, his tragic World War I service, and the filming of The Bride of Frankenstein. Whale slips into his past, and indulges in his fantasies, reminiscing about gay pool parties and also sexually teasing an embarrassed, starstruck fan who comes to interview him. Whale battles depression, at times contemplating suicide, as he realizes his life, his attractiveness, and his health are slipping away. Whale befriends his young, handsome gardener and former Marine, Clayton Boone and the two begin a sometimes uneasy friendship as Boone poses for Whale's sketches. The two men bond while discussing their lives and dealing with Whale's spells of disorientation and weakness from the strokes. Boone, impressed with Whale's fame, watches The Bride of Frankenstein on TV as his friends mock the movie, his friendship with Whale, and Whale's intentions. Boone assures Whale that he is straight and receives assurance from Whale that there is no sexual interest, but Boone storms out when Whale graphically discusses his sexual history. Boone later returns with the agreement that no such \\"locker room\\" discussions occur again. Boone is invited to escort Whale to a party hosted by George Cukor for Princess Margaret.

Answer the following question: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  The researches studied the atmosphere in Antarctica, and close to Greenland. They found out there's an ozone hole over Antarctica.  Which landmass had higher levels of UV radiation reaching it? Answer:","output":"The landmass that had higher levels of UV radiation reaching it would be Antarctica. The information provided in the text indicates that there is an ozone hole over Antarctica. This hole in the ozone layer allows more UV radiation to reach the Earth's surface. Our understanding is guided by the context given: \\"Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica.

THE ITALIAN PEDLAR   This caitiff monk for gold did swear, That by his drugs my rival fair A saint in heaven should be.--SCOTT  A grand cavalcade bore the house of Quinet from Montauban--coaches, wagons, outriders, gendarmes--it was a perfect court progress, and so low and cumbrous that it was a whole week in reaching a grand old castle standing on a hill-side among chestnut woods, with an avenue a mile long leading up to it; and battlemented towers fit to stand a siege.  Eustacie was ranked among the Duchess's gentlewomen. She was so far acknowledged as a lady of birth, that she was usually called Madame Esperance; and though no one was supposed to doubt her being Theodore Gardon's widow, she was regarded as being a person of rank who had made a misalliance by marrying him. This Madame de Quinet had allowed the household to infer, thinking that the whole bearing of her guest was too unlike that of a Paris _bourgeoise_ not to excite suspicion, but she deemed it wiser to refrain from treating her with either intimacy or distinction that might excite jealousy or suspicion. Even as it was, the consciousness of a secret, or the remnants of Montauban gossip, prevented any familiarity between Eustacie and the good ladies who surrounded her; they were very civil to each other, but their only connecting link was the delight that every one took in petting pretty little Rayonette, and the wonder that was made of her signs of intelligence and attempts at talking. Even when she toddled fearlessly up to the stately Duchess on her canopied throne, and held out her entreating hands, and lisped the word '_nontre_,' Madame would pause in her avocations, take her on her knee, and display that wonderful gold and enamel creature which cried tic-tic, and still remained an unapproachable mystery to M. le Marquis and M. le Vicomte, her grandsons.  1.

Write an article based on this summary: – On April 12, USA Today owner Gannett made a private offer to Tribune Publishing: We want you, for roughly 815 million, or 12.25 per share. USA Today's own report on the offer notes that at 12.25 a share, Gannett is offering a 63% premium over Friday's closing stock price. The Wall Street Journal notes the deal is valued at 400 million, as Gannett would be acquiring Tribune's debt. Gannett CEO Robert Dickey says that after making the offer he communicated with Tribune CEO Justin Dearborn and Chair Michael Ferro via phone. But after what Dickey frames as \\"Tribune's continued refusal to begin constructive discussions with us,\\" Gannett went public with the proposal. \\"What we're hoping for is to sit down with Tribune's board and work out a transaction,\\" says Dickey.

This move comes as Gannett aims to expand its newspaper portfolio and strengthens its presence in the United States. Tribune Publishing, which is the parent company of major newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, and Baltimore Sun, has yet to accept this offer. The acquisition deal, valued at roughly 400 million, includes Gannett taking on Tribune Publishing's debt. Gannett's offer of 12.25 per share represents a 63% premium over the closing stock price of Tribune Publishing on Friday, April 8, as reported by USA Today. This substantial premium demonstrates Gannett's keen interest in acquiring Tribune Publishing and solidifies its position in the market. Since making the private offer, Gannett CEO Robert Dickey has communicated with Tribune CEO Justin Dearborn and Chair Michael Ferro via phone. However, Dickey has expressed concerns regarding what he perceives as Tribune's continued refusal to begin constructive discussions concerning the acquisition. As a result, Gannett chose to go public with its proposal in hopes of gaining momentum for a potential agreement. \\"What we're hoping for is to sit down with Tribune's board and work out a transaction,\\" Dickey stated. With the acquisition of Tribune Publishing, Gannett would be adding 11 daily newspapers, including some major names previously mentioned, to its current roster of 107 local outlets across the US. This would also join the 12% of America's daily newspaper circulation that Gannett already owns, with the 5% that Tribune Publishing commands, further solidifying Gannett's newspaper business. The merger would give Gannett access to a broader market, filling geographical gaps in its current reach. Tribune Publishing would provide Gannett with a presence in key locations within the United States, further enhancing its coverage. Dickey estimates that Gannett will be able to save about 50 million in costs by eliminating overlaps in operations, although the company has no plans to reduce editorial staff at this time. As of now, the fate of the acquisition remains uncertain, with the Tribune Publishing board yet to respond positively to Gannett's offer. The proposed acquisition would be a significant move in the media industry, further consolidating large newspaper companies in the United States. If completed, the acquisition would represent a major growth opportunity for Gannett and an expansion of its impressive portfolio of newspapers, positioning the company to be an even more prominent player in the American media landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: One common form of mate choice, called assortative mating, is an individual’s preference to mate with partners who are what?    Choices:  - close to themselves  - different from themselves  - far away from  - similar to themselves  A:","output":"A: Assortative mating is an individual's preference to mate with partners who are similar to themselves. In this context, \\"similar\\" typically refers to sharing certain traits, such as morphology, behavior, or genetic makeup. This form of mate choice is widespread across many species, from humans to birds and insects. Assortative mating can have various advantages as well as disadvantages. On one hand, mating with a partner who shares similar traits can increase the chances of reproductive success for the offspring. This is because the offspring are more likely to inherit traits that are well-suited to their environment, thereby increasing their survival and reproductive prospects. Additionally, assortative mating can help maintain species boundaries, reducing the chances of hybridization between closely-related species. In humans, assortative mating for certain traits, such as height, intelligence, or social and economic background, has been well-documented. Couples with similar genetic backgrounds are thought to have a higher reproductive success rate. However, assortative mating can also contribute to reduced genetic diversity in a population, which could have negative consequences in the long run. This is because less genetic variability can lead to higher vulnerability to diseases, as well as potentially reduced adaptability to changing environments. On the other hand, individuals who prefer to mate with partners who are different from themselves display what is known as \\"disassortative mating.\\" It is often thought that this strategy promotes genetic diversity, which can be beneficial for the overall health and adaptability of a population. Disassortative mating is also observed in many animal species, sometimes driven by the avoidance of inbreeding, which could lead to the expression of harmful genetic traits. In conclusion, assortative mating is an individual's preference to mate with partners who are similar to themselves. This form of mate choice has its advantages, such as increasing offspring survival and reproductive success, as well as maintaining species boundaries. However, it could also have negative consequences for the genetic diversity of a population. On the other hand, disassortative mating, where individuals seek partners with different traits, can play a role in promoting and maintaining genetic diversity and population health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Nicholas Edward Cave  (born 22 September 1957) is an Australian musician, singer-songwriter, author, screenwriter, composer and occasional film actor, best known as the frontman of the rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Cave's music is generally characterised by emotional intensity, a wide variety of influences, and lyrical obsessions with death, religion, love and violence. Born and raised in rural Victoria, Cave studied art before turning to music in the 1970s. As frontman of the Boys Next Door (later renamed the Birthday Party), he became a central figure in Melbourne's burgeoning post-punk scene. Context: Cave released his first book, King Ink, in 1988. It is a collection of lyrics and plays, including collaborations with Lydia Lunch. In 1997, he followed up with King Ink II, containing lyrics, poems, and the transcript of a radio essay he did for the BBC in July 1996, \\"The Flesh Made Word,\\" discussing in biographical format his relationship with Christianity.  While he was based in West Berlin, Cave started working on what was to become his debut novel, And the Ass Saw the Angel (1989). Significant crossover is evident between the themes in the book and the lyrics Cave wrote in the late stages of the Birthday Party and the early stage of his solo career. \\"Swampland\\", from Mutiny, in particular, uses the same linguistic stylings ('mah' for 'my', for instance) and some of the same themes (the narrator being haunted by the memory of a girl called Lucy, being hunted like an animal, approaching death and execution). On 21 January 2008, a special edition of Cave's novel And the Ass Saw the Angel was released. Cave's second novel The Death of Bunny Munro was published on 8 September 2009 by Harper Collins books. Telling the story of a sex-addicted salesman, it was also released as a binaural audio-book produced by British Artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard and an iPhone app. The book originally started as a screenplay Cave was going to write for John Hillcoat.  Aside from movie soundtracks, Cave also wrote the screenplays for Hillcoat's The Proposition in 2005, and Lawless (based on the novel by Matt Bondurant) in 2011.  As proof of his interest in scripture, so evident in his lyrics and his prose writing, Cave wrote the foreword to a Canongate publication of the Gospel according to Mark, published in the UK in 1998. The American edition of the same book (published by Grove Press) contains a foreword by the noted American writer Barry Hannah.  Cave is a contributor to a 2009 rock biography of the Triffids, Vagabond Holes: David McComb and the Triffids, edited by Australian academics Niall Lucy and Chris Coughran. Question: What else was Nick Cave known for?. Whats the answer?","output":"Apart from being known as the frontman of the rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Nick Cave is also known for his work as an author, screenwriter, composer, and occasional film actor.

Poultry (/ˌpoʊltriː/) are domesticated birds kept by humans for the eggs they produce, their meat, their feathers, or sometimes as pets. These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae (fowl), especially the order Galliformes (which includes chickens, quails and turkeys) and the family Anatidae, in order Anseriformes, commonly known as \\"waterfowl\\" and including domestic ducks and domestic geese. Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat, such as the young of pigeons (known as squabs) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game. The word \\"poultry\\" comes from the French/Norman word poule, itself derived from the Latin word pullus, which means small animal.  The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago. This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity. Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs, but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food. Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises. Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally and, along with eggs, provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat. All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning. 1. When was poultry first domesticated? 2.

Article: In recent years, a growing body of research has shown that our appetite and food intake are influenced by a large number of factors besides our biological need for energy, including our eating environment and our perception of the food in front of us.      Studies have shown. for instance. that eating in front of the TV (or a similar distraction) can increase both hunger and the amount of food consumed. Even simple visual cues( ). like plate size and lighting, have been shown to affect portion size and consumption.       A new study suggested that our shot-term memory also may play a role in appetite.  Several hours after a meal, people's hunger levels were predicted not by how much they'd eaten but rather by how much food they'd seen in front of them --- in other words, how much they remembered eating.       This difference suggests the memory of our previous meal may have a bigger influence on our appetite than the actual size of the meal. says Jeffrey M . Brunstrom , a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Bristol.     \\"Hunger isn't. controlled solely by the physical characteristics of a recent meal. We have identified an independent role for memory for that meal.\\" Brunstrom says. \\"This shows that the relationship between hunger and food intake is more complex than we thought.\\"      These findings echo earlier research that suggests our perception of food can sometimes trick our body's response to the food itself. In a 2011 study, for instance, people who drank the same 380-calorie milkshake on two separate occasions produced different levels of hunger-related hormones, depending on whether the shake's label said it contained 620 0r 140 calories. Moreover, the participants reported feeling more full when they thought they'd consumed a higher-calorie shake.      What does this means for our eating habits? Although it hardly seems practical to trick ourselves in to eating less, the new findings do highlight the benefits of focusing on our food avoiding TV and multitasking while eating.   ... Question: What would happen at meal time if you remembered eating a lot in the previous meal? Options: A: You would probably be more picky about food. B: You would not feel like eating the same food.

The task specifies that the word doesn't have to be an exact match, meaning words with shared roots or similar meanings would count, for example, \\"survival\\" and \\"survive\\". Although, a point to note is that 'little' or 'stop' words, like \\"the\\" or \\"of\\", are not considered significant, so they don't count. Steps to find the overlapping word: 1. Read both sentences carefully. 2. Do not consider 'stop or 'little' words like a, an, the, is, of, among others for this task. 3. Focus on the 'significant' or meaningful words in the sentences. 4. Spot the words that occur in both sentences, they could be exact words or words sharing the same root. Let's practice this approach: Sentence1: Mussels are bivalve mollusks. Sentence2: Most mussels have shells. The significant words in the sentences are 'Mussels', 'bivalve', 'mollusks', 'most', 'have', 'shells'. Among these words, we see that 'Mussels' appears in both sentences. So your overlapping word for these two sentences would be 'Mussels'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: How long ago did Douglas meet Josefa? 5 years Answer:","output":"Title: A Rendezvous in Retrospect A gripping romantic drama, \\"A Rendezvous in Retrospect\\" follows the intertwined lives of two individuals, Douglas Archer and Josefa Morales, who first met five years ago on a fateful summer day in the vibrant coastal city of Barcelona. Background:  Five years ago, Douglas, an aspiring American writer, was backpacking through Europe to seek inspiration for his debut novel when he encountered Josefa, a passionate Spanish flamenco dancer. The two formed an instant connection and fell in love, despite their cultural differences and the limited time they had together. They spent a mesmerizing month together, exploring life, love, and the enchanting streets of Barcelona, before parting ways with the promise to reunite in exactly five years. Present day: The story picks up on the day of their reunion, with Douglas returning to Barcelona after years of anticipation and dedication to his now-successful writing career. However, much has changed during their time apart — Douglas is now engaged to his editor, Ashley, and Josefa has moved up the ranks to become the highly acclaimed lead dancer of her troupe. As the narrative unfolds, the protagonists wrestle with the memories of their passionate past, the current realities, and the complexities of their feelings. Anxious to honor their promise, Douglas sets out to find Josefa, whose whereabouts remain unknown to him. While searching for her, he retraces their past, visiting the iconic places they once shared as a couple, discovering how profoundly she has influenced his writing. Meanwhile, Josefa faces the challenges of fame and her growing estrangement from her inherent love for dancing. She seeks solace in the memory of the long-lost love she shared with Douglas, unaware of his return to Barcelona and his search for her. As the two navigate the city of history, art, and passion on parallel paths, they are continually drawn to each other by fate, circumstance, and their shared connection. Yet, the encumbrance of their present lives threatens to keep them apart. The movie climaxes at a flamenco performance, where Douglas and Josefa finally reunite. With old passions rekindled, the couple is left to grapple with the difficult decision of whether to go separate ways, acknowledging the love they once had and the paths they must travel upon or to give their love another chance and defy the expectations of their present lives. \\"A Rendezvous in Retrospect\\" is a heart-rending exploration of love, memory, and the power of promises that will leave audiences reflecting on the course of true love and the roads we inevitably part to seek our destinies."},{"instruction":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the plate that  loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object? from the following article ?  A number of plates in this group reveal a scepticism towards idolatry of religious images. There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and processional images, are mocked and denigrated. Plate 67, Esta no lo es menos (This is no less curious), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the \\"Virgin of Solitude\\". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, \\"It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations.\\" Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were \\"illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form\\".The published edition of The Disasters of War ends as it begins; with the portrayal of a single, agonized figure. The last two plates show a woman wearing a wreath, intended as a personification of Spain, Truth, or the Constitution of 1812—which Ferdinand had rejected in 1814. In plate 79, Murió la Verdad (The Truth has died), she lies dead. In plate 80, Si resucitará? (Will she live again?), she is shown lying on her back with breasts exposed, bathed in a halo of light before a mob of \\"monks and monsters\\". In plate 82, Esto es lo verdadero (This is the true way), she is again bare-breasted and apparently represents peace and plenty. Here, she lies in front of a peasant. A:","output":"The plate's name mentioned in the article that shows the statue losing its aura and becoming a mere everyday object is Plate 67, Esta no lo es menos (This is no less curious). In this plate, created by the artist Goya, two statues are carried horizontally by two stooped members of the clergy, instead of being carried vertically in a processional triumph. One of these statues is recognisable as the \\"Virgin of Solitude\\". By depicting the statue in this manner, Goya illustrates a deposed, toppled image which loses its powers and connotations, expressing a general statement on the Church's efforts to support and restore the Bourbons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the two names of the large 18-century star fort built by the French in norther New York? from the following article ?  Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the  Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack.  Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...

She covered me with a plastic sheet up to my neck , took a spray bottle and wet my hair down , combed it through , and began cutting . Next , she took her comb and grabbed a hand full of hair on the top of my head . She combed it straight up with one hand while following the comb with my hair between two fingers of her other hand , stopping about two inches short of the ends . She took her scissors and snipped the top two inches of my hair and then grabbed an adjacent handful of hair and repeated this action . During all of this , we chatted about the weather , what kind of food we liked , and some other trivial , but interesting things . Finally , she combed my hair down into the style that I had when I sat down and asked me how it looked . '' \`\` Great ! '' '' , I replied . She rang me up on the register and I swiped my credit card , leaving a tip in the process . We each told the other to '' \`\` Have a good day '' '' and I headed out the door . Question: What did the girl remove? Option1: hair Option2: The author's credit card A:","output":"Part #1: Understanding the passage. Usage: The passage relates a story about the author's haircut at a salon called Supercuts. It goes into detail about the author's experience at the salon, his interaction with the girl who cut his hair, the process of the haircut, and the payment process. In this part of the task, understanding the passage is crucial as it contains the answer to the question. For instance, I can infer from the text that the girl removed some of the author's hair during the haircut operation. Part #2: Understanding the question. Usage: The question is \\"What did the girl remove?\\". It's asking about what specifically the girl at the salon removed or took away during the encounter described in the passage. To answer this, I need to find the part of the passage where the girl removes something. Part #3: Comparing the options with the passage. Usage: Option1 says \\"hair\\", and Option2 says \\"The author's credit card\\". Based on the passage, the girl did cut and therefore remove the author's hair. Although the author swiped his credit card during the payment process, it was the author himself who handled the card, not the girl. So Option1 \\"hair\\" best fits the answer.

Some media outlets reported that Oldman was unhappy with The Contender (2000) because DreamWorks had edited the film to reflect pro-Democratic leanings, stirring controversy. The claims were declared \\"sloppy sensationalism\\" by Oldman's manager, Urbanski, who said that Oldman was \\"the least political person he knew\\", that \\"neither he nor Oldman had made the statements attributed to them,\\" that they had \\"produced the film every last cut and frame,\\" and that \\"DreamWorks did not influence the final cut or have anything to do with it.\\" It has been suggested that Oldman was blacklisted in Hollywood for several years as a result.  In an interview in the July/August 2014 issue of Playboy magazine while promoting Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Oldman criticized what he saw as excessive political correctness in American media and the entertainment industry's own discriminating hypocrisy, and argued in support of former controversial celebrities Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin. He stressed that he did not relate with most of their viewpoints, but regarding the former, agreed, \\"Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews\\" (referring to Hollywood).

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Together with random fertilization, more possibilities for genetic variation exist between any two people than the number of individuals alive today. Sexual reproduction is the random fertilization of a gamete from the female using a gamete from the male.

A:","output":"Title: A Visually Appealing App with Room for Improvement - ★★★★☆ I recently came across the com.seb.SLWP app and decided to give it a try. After having spent ample time exploring the app's various features, I must say that it does exhibit a visually appealing design, followed by responsive performance. This app genuinely manages to stand out in today's saturated app market, earning it a well-deserved four-star rating. Right off the bat, the user interface is well-designed and features a sleek, minimalist look. The use of visually pleasing color combinations and smooth transitions between screens and menus adds a professional touch, contributing to the app's overall appeal. Moreover, the crisp icons and easy-to-read fonts greatly simplifies navigation, making it a breeze to access the different features available. As for the app's functionality, com.seb.SLWP offers a range of versatile features tailored to address various user needs. While navigating the app, I discovered that it is capable of handling a variety of tasks with relative ease. The loading times were reasonable, even with multiple tasks running at once, which speaks to the app's efficiency in managing system resources. Yet, despite the app's many merits, it's important to note that it has some room for improvement. In particular, the app occasionally displays unexpected lags and crashes when juggling high-demand tasks, which can be frustrating. I look forward to seeing future updates that would take care of these minor performance issues and allow the app to run smoothly, even under heavy workloads. In addition, I noticed that some features and tools were not as intuitive as they could be. It would be helpful if the app included a brief tutorial or guide to streamline the learning curve and assist users in getting the most out of the software. This, in turn, would make the app more accessible and user-friendly to a wider audience. Lastly, while the app does offer many useful features, it could benefit from a few additional options. For instance, integrating enhanced customization options for theme colors, icon style, and accessibility settings would grant users a more personalized experience, ultimately improving the app's utility and practicality. In conclusion, com.seb.SLWP is a visually appealing and responsive app that boasts a myriad of features to cater to diverse needs. However, there is room for improvement concerning performance, user-friendliness, and added features. With a little more fine-tuning and expansion, I believe this app has the potential to become a top contender in the market, possibly earning a full five-star rating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Information:  - An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\"  - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor.  - East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA) is an American professional wrestling promotion, founded by promoter Jim Kettner. It is home to the annual Super 8 Tournament, one of the longest-running independent wrestling tournaments in the country.it's also the home of the annual Super 8 ChickFight Tournament. In 2010, Kettner announced his retirement and turned the promotion over to Mike Tartaglia and Joe Zanolle.  - A color commentator is a North American term for a sports commentator who assists the main commentator, often by filling in any time when play is not in progress. In other regions this role is variously referred to as an analyst or summariser. The color analyst and main commentator will often exchange comments freely throughout the broadcast, when the play-by-play announcer is not describing the action. The color commentator provides expert analysis and background information, such as statistics, strategy and injury reports on the teams and athletes, and occasionally anecdotes or light humor. Color commentators are often former athletes or coaches of the sport being broadcast.  - The term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe the unbelievable; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a \\"human interest and a semblance of truth\\" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.  - Professional wrestling is a dramatized athletic performance inspired by competitive combat sports. Taking the form of live events held by touring promotions, it is a unique style of combat based on a combination of adopted styles, which include classical wrestling, catch wrestling and various forms of martial arts, as well as an innovative style based on grappling (holds/throws), striking, and aerialism. Various forms of weaponry are sometimes used. The content  including match outcomes  is choreographed and the combative actions and reactions are performed to appear violent without injuring the wrestlers. Before the 1980s, these facts were kept highly secret, after which they were openly declared. By and large, the true nature of the content is ignored by the performing promotion in official media in order to sustain and promote the willing suspension of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude. Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media (i.e., interviews) will often directly acknowledge the fictional nature of the spectacle, making the predetermined nature of the sport something of an open secret. The presentation of scripted events as legitimate is known as \\"kayfabe\\".  - Open Secret is a 1948 American film noir directed by John Reinhardt, starring John Ireland and Jane Randolph.  - Newark is a small city in New Castle County, Delaware, west-southwest of Wilmington. According to the 2010 Census, the population of the city is 31,454. Newark is the home of the University of Delaware.  - In professional wrestling, kayfabe is the portrayal of staged events within the industry as \\"real\\" or \\"true,\\" specifically the portrayal of competition, rivalries, and relationships between participants as being genuine and not of a staged or pre-determined nature of any kind. Kayfabe has also evolved to become a code word of sorts for maintaining this \\"reality\\" within the direct or indirect presence of the general public. Though the staged nature of professional wrestling had been a frequent topic of conversation among the media and public since at least the latter years of the early 20th century, the professional wrestling industry did not formally acknowledge this until changes in the business during the 1980s professional wrestling boom prompted attitudes within the business to change. In 1989, World Wrestling Federation owner Vince McMahon testified before the New Jersey state senate that wrestling was staged. Long sanctioned by New Jersey and other states as an athletic exhibition for regulation and taxation purposes, McMahon sought to eliminate oversight, and hence taxation, on the WWF's house shows and pay-per-view events held within the state.  - In general, spectacle refers to an event that is memorable for the appearance it creates. Derived in Middle English from c. 1340 as \\"specially prepared or arranged display\\" it was borrowed from Old French \\"spectacle\\", itself a reflection of the Latin \\"spectaculum\\" \\"a show\\" from \\"spectare\\" \\"to view, watch\\" frequentative form of \\"specere\\" \\"to look at.\\" The word \\"spectacle\\" has also been a term of art in theater dating from the 17th century in English drama.  - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage.  - The University of Delaware (colloquially \\"UD\\") is the largest university in Delaware. The main campus is in Newark, with satellite campuses in Dover, Wilmington, Lewes, and Georgetown. It is medium-sized  approximately 18,500 undergraduate and 4,500 graduate students. UD is a privately governed university which receives public funding for being a land-grant, sea-grant, space-grant and urban-grant state-supported research institution.  - A professional wrestling promotion (also federation or fed) is a company or business that regularly performs shows involving professional wrestling. \\"Promotion\\" also describes a role which entails management, advertising and logistics of running a wrestling event (\\"see promoter\\"). Within the convention of the show, the company is a sports governing body which sanctions wrestling matches and gives authority to the championships and is responsible for determining the divisions, rankings, etc. of wrestlers.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What was the name of the person who dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na? is inside the article: The first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded as having arrived in 166 AD by the Book of the Later Han. The embassy came to Emperor Huan of Han China from \\"Andun\\" (Chinese: 安敦; Emperor Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus), \\"king of Daqin\\" (Rome). As Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD, leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and the envoy arrived in 166 AD, confusion remains about who sent the mission, as both emperors were named \\"Antoninus\\". The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by sea), entering China by the frontier of Rinan or Tonkin (present-day Vietnam). It brought presents of rhinoceros horns, ivory, and tortoise shell, probably acquired in Southern Asia. The text states that it was the first time there had been direct contact between the two countries. Yule speculated that the Roman visitors must have lost their original wares due to robbery or shipwreck and used the gifts instead, prompting Chinese sources to suspect them of withholding their more precious valuables, which Yule notes was the same criticism directed at papal missionary John of Montecorvino when he arrived in China in the late 13th century AD. Historians Rafe de Crespigny, Peter Fibiger Bang, and Warwick Ball believe that this was most likely a group of Roman merchants rather than official diplomats sent by Marcus Aurelius. Crespigny stresses that the presence of this Roman embassy as well as others from Tianzhu (in northern India) and Buyeo (in Manchuria) provided much-needed prestige for Emperor Huan, as he was facing serious political troubles and fallout for the forced suicide of politician Liang Ji, who had dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why did the group pick the color orange?

(AP) — Police say officers fatally shot a man outside a suburban Kansas City retail store after he hit one of them with a long wooden rod.      Lenexa, Kansas, police spokesman Dan Friesen says the man was shot near a Wal-Mart in Olathe around 10:30 p.m. Sunday after striking an officer.      Friesen, speaking on behalf of Olathe police, says the rod resembled a martial arts bo stick.      He says officers responded to a report of a man with a weapon and tried to use non-lethal force to subdue him, including an attempt to use a stun gun, but those measures were not effective.      The officer hit with the stick was treated and released at a hospital. Friesen says the dead man's identity was being withheld while authorities searched for next of kin. ||||| A special team of investigators is looking into Sunday night’s fatal shooting of a 50-year-old man by Olathe police.      The shooting happened at the Walmart store near Kansas Highway 7 and Santa Fe Street.      Advertisement      Police said they were called to the store earlier in the evening about a man who was on the premises, but they didn’t find him. When they were called to the store a second time, they found the man around the side of the building.      Police said the man attacked police with a long, cylindrical weapon he had in his hands. Police said it was similar to a martial arts bo staff.      “I don’t know the composition, whether it was wood or metal,” said Officer Dan Friesen, of the Lenexa Police Department. “I think typically, those types of things are made out of wood.”      A witness said police used a Taser on the man, but it didn’t stop him.      At one point, police said the man ran toward the front of the store.      “On my left, I heard a ruckus of people running and people shouting,” said witness Graem Murray, who was coming out of the store.      He said someone told him to back inside. As he did, he said he saw the man running toward the store and holding something. He said he then heard four distinct pops.      “It wasn’t loud. It was jarring,” Murray said.      “He was running away from the officers, but then he turned toward them and attacked them directly,” Friesen said. “I believe that's why they fired.”      The man died of his injuries. He was later identified as Walter R. Echols, 50, of Cypress, Texas.      Murray said he didn’t realize the man had died. He said he’s still trying to process what he saw late Sunday.      “Honestly, when I walked out and saw the Taser leads on the ground, I thought that the dude was just tasered and that was it,” Murray said. “I’m still barely collecting myself this afternoon.”      One officer was treated for minor injuries at a hospital.      Earlier in the day on Sunday, police got a report of a man behaving strangely on a nearby walking trail. They said they’re working to find out whether it’s the same man.

Article: Relation between the United States and Columbia suffered for many years because of an incident involving the Republic of Panama. By the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898, many Americans felt that an easier and faster way was needed to get ships from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Some people in the United States first believed that a canal across Nicaragua was the answer. However, President Theodore Roosevelt decided that a canal through Panama would be a better choice. In order to build the canal , the United States had to negotiate   a treaty with Columbia , which at that time controlled Panama . Roosevelt offered Columbia  10 million plus  250,000 a year for 99 years for a six-mile-wide strip of land across Panama. Columbia rejected the United States' offer. This ranged President Roosevelt, and negotiations with Columbia ended. In 1903, a revolution broke out in Panama. The United States ships were sent by President Roosevelt to protect the Panamanian revolutionaries from Columbian forces. The revolution succeeded, and Panama declared its independence from Columbia. The United States then negotiated with the newly formed government. A treaty was signed, and the United States began building the canal. As a result of the incident, Columbia and the United States remained on bad terms for many years. Not until 1921, when the United States agreed to pay Columbia some compensation   for its territory, did relations between the two countries improve. Question: It can be inferred from the passage that an important reason for the decision of the United States to build a canal was to   _  . - develop trade relations with Europe - improve relations with South American countries - prevent European ships from reaching the Pacific Ocean - reduce travel time for its ships in case of war Answer:","output":"reduce travel time for its ships in case of war"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Computers have beaten human world champions at chess and, earlier this year, the board game Go. So far, though, they have struggled at the card table. So we challenged one AI to a game. Why is poker  so difficult? Chess and Go are \\"information complete\\" games where all players can see all the relevant information. In poker, other players' cards are hidden, making it an \\"information incomplete\\" game. Players have to guess opponents' hands from their actions--tricky for computers. Poker has become a new benchmark for AI research. Solving poker could lead to many breakthroughs, from cyber security to driverless cars. Scientists believe it is only a matter of time before AI once again _ humans, hence our human-machine match comes up in a game of Texas Hold's Em Limit Poker. The AI was developed by Johannes Heinrich, researcher studying machine learning at UCL. It combines two techniques: neural  networks and reinforcement learning . Neural networks, to some degree, copy the structure of human brains: their processors are highly interconnected and work at the same time to solve problems. They are good at spotting patterns in huge amounts of data. Reinforcement learning is when a machine, given a task, carries it out, learning from mistakes it makes. In this case, it means playing poker against itself billions of times to get better. Mr Heinrich told Sky News: \\"Today we are presenting a new procedure that has learned in a different way, more similar to how humans learn. In particular, it is able to learn abstract patterns, represented by its neural network, which allow it to deal with new and unseen situations.\\" After two hours of quite defensive play, from the computer at least, we called it a draw. Question: Why can't the computer beat humans at the poker game? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The computer struggles to beat humans at the poker game primarily because poker is an \\"information incomplete\\" game, unlike chess and Go, which are \\"information complete\\" games. In information complete games, all players have access to all relevant information, making it easier for machines to analyze and strategize. However, in poker, other players' cards are hidden, and players need to guess their opponents' hands based on their actions and betting patterns. This aspect makes it significantly more challenging for computers to navigate and develop reliable strategies. Artificial intelligence has made progress in tackling games like poker through the combination of techniques like neural networks and reinforcement learning. Neural networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain and are adept at identifying patterns in large datasets. Reinforcement learning involves a machine carrying out tasks and learning from its mistakes. For example, playing poker against itself billions of times to improve its gameplay. Even with these advancements, AI has not yet surpassed human intuition and adaptability in the game of poker. Human players have the ability to read their opponents and adapt their strategies throughout the game based on observed behaviors, subtle tells, and deception, which are still difficult for AI to incorporate into its decision-making process. While computers can employ an increasingly sophisticated algorithmic approach to poker, the somewhat unpredictable nature of human play and the nuances of emotions and intuition make it challenging for AI to consistently best human opponents in the game. As AI research and development continue to advance, it is only a matter of time before artificial intelligence will likely surpass human performance in poker. In doing so, this can lead to breakthroughs in various fields, such as cybersecurity and driverless cars, where dealing with incomplete information and adapting to unique situations are critical. However, as of now, the intricacies and incomplete information aspects of poker have prevented the computer from consistently outperforming humans at the game."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed.

Coming off their divisional road win over the Lions, the Vikings played their Week 3 home opener against the San Francisco 49ers. Minnesota opened in the first quarter with quarterback Brett Favre's 30-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Sidney Rice. The Vikings added onto their lead in the second quarter with kicker Ryan Longwell's 40-yard field goal, but the 49ers answered with quarterback Shaun Hill's 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Vernon Davis. Minnesota came back with Longwell's 52-yard field goal, but San Francisco took the lead prior to halftime as cornerback Nate Clements returned a blocked field goal 59 yards for a touchdown. The 49ers increased their lead in the second half with kicker Joe Nedney's 37-yard field goal, but the Vikings immediately responded with rookie wide receiver Percy Harvin returning a kickoff 101 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, San Francisco got the lead again with Hill hooking up with Davis on a 20-yard touchdown pass. Afterwards, Minnesota came up with a dramatic win as Favre completed a game-winning 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Lewis with 2 seconds remaining in the game. The pass was later awarded an ESPY for \\"Best Play\\". The game was also voted as the best game of the regular season by voters on NFL.com. Answer this question: How many more yards was Favre's second pass over his first one?","output":"To determine how many more yards Favre's second pass was over his first one, we need to look at the yardage of both passes mentioned in the text. The first pass was a 30-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Sidney Rice, and the second pass was a game-winning 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Lewis.  To find the difference in yardage between the two passes, subtract the yardage of the first pass from the yardage of the second pass:  32 yards (second pass) - 30 yards (first pass) = 2 yards Favre's second pass was 2 yards more than his first one."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kayla was very tough.; 2). Elena was very tough.;","output":"Opt: 1) Kayla was very tough. Kayla had always been known for her strength and endurance. Growing up on a farm, she had spent most of her childhood working alongside her family, tending to the livestock and performing countless tasks that required physical strength. This had helped her develop a toughness and resilience that many people could only dream of having. Elena, on the other hand, grew up in a city, where her daily activities consisted mainly of attending school and exploring her hobbies and interests. One day, Kayla and Elena had set out on an adventure through the countryside to explore an ancient castle that was rumored to be haunted. Their excitement grew with each step, as the imposing structure slowly came into view. As they started exploring the castle, they found themselves marveling at the intricate details of the architecture and imagining the stories of the people who had lived there long ago. Suddenly, they discovered a secret passage leading deep into the belly of the castle. As their curiosity began to overtake them, they felt compelled to investigate what lay beyond the hidden door. The passage was narrow, dimly lit, and covered in cobwebs, but Kayla and Elena pressed on, fueled by their thirst for adventure. After a while, the passage opened up into a large underground chamber. In the center stood a massive stone statue of a knight, holding a sword and a scroll. Curious, Kayla and Elena approached the statue to examine it more closely. As they reached the base, they found an inscription that read, \\"Only those with the strength of heart and body can claim the prize that lies within.\\" Intrigued by the message, they noticed a sturdy lever at the statue's base. Kayla, with her innate toughness, confidently grabbed the lever and pulled with all her might. As the lever creaked and moaned, the statue slowly began to move, revealing a hidden passage behind it. Elena was hesitant to follow, tired from all the walking and exploring they had done. But she would not let her discomfort stop her from witnessing the mystery that awaited them beyond the statue. She pushed through her discomfort and followed Kayla into the secret chamber. As they ventured further into the dark passage, they stumbled upon a treasure trove, filled with gold, jewels, and precious artifacts. The sight was mesmerizing, with the illumination from their torches reflecting off the shiny surfaces, filling the room with a warm, golden light. Elena felt a sense of awe and wonder, momentarily forgetting her weariness. Suddenly, a ghostly figure materialized before them, introducing itself as the guardian of the treasure. \\"You have proven your worth,\\" it said in a raspy voice. \\"Take one treasure from this room as a token of your bravery and strength.\\" After a moment of contemplation, Kayla selected a small, beautifully crafted wooden box adorned with intricate engravings. The guardian nodded approvingly, and as they left the chamber, the statue returned to its original position, sealing the passage once more. As Kayla and Elena made their way back to the surface, Elena could not help but feel a mixture of admiration and envy for Kayla's toughness. She realized that her friend's physical endurance was a testament to the life she had led and the challenges she had faced. While Elena's strengths lay in other areas, she vowed to learn from Kayla and work on building her own resilience and toughness. Their lives continued to be filled with adventure and exploration, their friendship growing stronger with each passing day. And as time went on, Elena discovered that with determination and practice, she too could develop the remarkable endurance that had once been Kayla's alone. As they continued to face challenges, both mental and physical, Kayla and Elena stood shoulder-to-shoulder, as equal partners, united by their shared spirit of adventure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trine has hardly any large open spaces on the ground. The Jimpy forest, on the other hand, is much more open. It has some large areas in the forest that are perfect for camping or for children to play in due to the lack of trees.  Which forest would require a higher temperature to burn?  Hint: Wildfires occur when all the necessary elements of a fire triangle come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation, that is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 °C (212 °F). Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 °C (450 °F) releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 °C (720 °F) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 °C (1,000 °F). Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 °C (1,470 °F), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from...","output":"Considering the characteristics of the Trine forest and the Jimpy forest, we can evaluate which forest would require a higher temperature to reach the burning point.  Step 1: Assess the forest density and its impact on wildfires - Trine forest is dense and provides more shade, which leads to lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, making it less susceptible to wildfires. - Jimpy forest is more open, and thus it should have higher ambient temperatures and lesser humidity due to the more open space and the presence of grasses and leaves that can ignite more easily. Step 2: Determine the moisture content in the forests - Dense forests, such as the Trine forest, would have a higher moisture content due to shade and humidity, making it harder for materials to ignite and for wildfires to propagate. - In the Jimpy forest, the balance of moisture might not be as well-maintained due to the openness of the area and the presence of more easily ignited materials like grasses and leaves. Step 3: Assess the impact of heat and air on ignition - The heat transfer in the Trine forest would be less effective due to the dense vegetation providing shade and maintaining ambient temperatures lower than in the Jimpy forest. - The Jimpy forest's open structure exposes materials to heat more efficiently, accelerating the pre-heating of flammable materials, and encouraging faster ignition and fire spread. Step 4: Comparing the ignition temperatures in both forests - Based on the information about the ambient temperatures, moisture content, and presence of easily flammable materials, the Trine forest would require higher temperatures to ignite and propagate a wildfire compared to the Jimpy forest. Conclusion: The Trine forest, due to its density, shade, and higher moisture content, would require a higher temperature to burn compared to the more open and less dense Jimpy forest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Negative Review: \\"Alien Planet: Evolution,\\" unfortunately, failed to measure up to the standards set by its science fiction predecessors. This movie is intended to be a drama-filled exploration of extraterrestrial life, but it lacks the emotional depth and texture required to make it truly great. Despite some commendably ambitious CGI, the film is bogged down by mediocre dialogue and two-dimensional characters. The film's emphasis on visual spectacle over substantial storytelling is particularly disappointing. For a movie of this genre to be successful, there needs to be a balance between the visually striking elements and the core narrative. In \\"Alien Planet: Evolution,\\" however, the storyline seems to be sacrificed to extravagancy of its graphics. The performances are largely forgettable, with the cast members giving uninspired performances, unable to infuse their characters with the complexities essential to make them relatable or memorable. The lack of effort put into character development is notably apparent, leaving the viewer feeling detached from the film's events. Additionally, the pacing of the movie is inconsistent. There are several stretches that are agonizingly slow, only to be followed by sequences that are rushed, giving the impression the director was more interested in wrapping up the film than creating meaningful climax and resolution. The film's science element is also poorly executed. The concepts introduced are intriguing, boiling down to basic space travel tropes and uninspired alien life depiction, displaying the lack of research or thoughtfulness in crafting something original. Finally, the movie lacks thematic depth. Where other science fiction narratives use their plots as commentary on human nature or sociopolitical issues, \\"Alien Planet: Evolution\\" falls flat, only offering hollow characters traversing through a beautifully rendered but ultimately shallow alien world. In conclusion, while \\"Alien Planet: Evolution\\" might appeal to those looking for a casual visual sci-fi experience, it doesn't offer much for those seeking effective storytelling, well-rounded characters, a balanced pace, and thematic substance that are the trademarks of a good movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: New research finds a link between poverty and poor decision making. The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship.      Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey.  Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India.       The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs.      The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost  150.  In the second,   1,500.      \\"And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. \\"       Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to  1,500.      \\"Now the poor performed significantly worse. \\" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night.      The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor. The Indian sugar cane farmers earn most of their money once a year, when the harvest comes in. But the money often does not last through the year.     \\"So they find themselves basically rich after the harvest when the income comes in and poor just before the harvest.      The researchers gave them tests similar to the ones taken by the people in New Jersey. They tested the Indian farmers before the harvest and after.      And the results were much the same as with the mall shoppers.      \\"They performed much more slowly and with many more mistakes when they were poorer than when...

Documents leaked by former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden in September have suggested that the NSA spied on Petrobras, Brazil's state oil giant. The allegations caused uproar in Brazil, and prompted President Rousseff to cancel her state visit to Washington, where she had wanted to showcase Brazil's energy riches to potential investors. Even though over a month has passed since the allegations were broadcast on Brazil's TV Globo, the United States has so far failed to reassure Brasilia about the aims of its surveillance programme. The report on TV Globo, co-authored by Rio-based US journalist Glenn Greenwald, raised the question whether the NSA might have been engaging in industrial espionage against Brazil. It is an allegation which has been firmly denied by Washington, but one that has touched a sore spot in Brazil. Petrobras is Brazil's largest company and a major source of revenue for the government. It is also developing Brazil's massive deepwater oil reserves. On 21 October, Brazil will auction off the rights to develop the biggest of these new oilfields, Libra, to international companies. So the allegation that the NSA engaged in industrial espionage - and targeted Petrobras in particular - came at the most sensitive of times. But Timothy Edgar, who was the White House director of privacy and civil liberties from 2006 to 2009, believes the rationale for spying on a country such as Brazil could be better explained by the strict rules within which the NSA operates. \\"I can tell you that the US does not engage in industrial espionage,\\" he told the BBC. \\"If there were security reasons why intelligence was being gathered in Brazil, it would be legitimate if it was done under a framework [of national security]. \\"If it was for industrial purposes, it would be basically a violation of US policy,\\" he explained. He says that, in general, the US intelligence agencies' priorities are about preventing international terrorism, curbing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and fighting international drug trafficking. But information about military and political leaders of other countries - especially those perceived as opponents of the US in the international arena - can also be flagged up as intelligence priorities, according to Mr Edgar. Despite a recent warming of relations between Washington and Brasilia, many analysts say it would not come as a surprise if Brazil had been included among these priorities. Brazil has used its strategic assets, including those in the energy sector, to expand its geopolitical sphere of influence and to strengthen its bonds with other emerging powers in the southern hemisphere. In the process, Brasilia has often gone counter to US interests on issues such as the war in Syria and the containment of Iran's nuclear programme. Mr Edgar says that from the point of view of intelligence-gathering, spying on Brazil would make sense if there was a security-related reason, a \\"legitimate intelligence nexus\\", for example, to understand the energy supplies within the hemisphere. But it is this \\"intelligence nexus\\" which Washington has so far failed to provide. The US intelligence services remained tight-lipped about their reasons for allegedly monitoring Brazil's electronic communications, including those of Ms Rousseff herself. Washington's silence further compounded Ms Rousseff's anger prompting her not only to cancel her state visit scheduled for 23 October, but also to deliver a harsh criticism of the US during the United Nations General Assembly last month. She called the US surveillance programme an attack on the \\"sovereignty and the rights of [Brazil's] people and businesses\\". She also dismissed Washington's explanation that its monitoring of communications was for Brazil's own good, saying emphatically that Brazil \\"knows how to protect itself!\\". President Barack Obama has promised that a current review of NSA procedures will reassure \\"allies\\" such as Brazil, by ensuring that intelligence collected by the secret services amounts to \\"information that's necessary to protect our people\\". It is unclear how long the review will take and whether it will reassure Ms Rousseff. But with Mr Greenwald saying he plans to reveal more information about US surveillance practices in the coming weeks, Ms Rousseff's Washington visit seems unlikely to be rescheduled for the near future. What was that article about?","output":"The article is about allegations that the US National Security Agency (NSA) spied on Petrobras, a major state oil company in Brazil, causing outrage in the country.

As a child, he displayed symptoms of his gigantism very early, reaching a height of 191 cm (6 ft 3 in) and a weight of 94 kg (208 lb) by the age of 12. Andre returned in the winter of 1990, but it was not to the World Wrestling Federation. Instead, Andre made an interview appearance for Herb Abrams' fledgling Universal Wrestling Federation on October 11th in Reseda, California. (the segment aired in 1991). He appeared in an interview segment with Captain Lou Albano and put over the UWF. The following month, on November 30th at a house show in Miami, Florida the World Wrestling Federation announced Andre's return as a participant in the 1991 Royal Rumble (to be held in Miami, FL two months later). Andre was also mentioned as a participant on television but would ultimately back out due to a leg injury.  His on-air return finally came at WrestleMania VII, when he came to the aid of The Big Boss Man in his match against Mr. Perfect. Andre finally returned to action on April 26, 1991, in a six-man tag-team matchup when he teamed with the Rockers in a winning effort against Mr. Fuji and the Orient Express at a house show in Belfast, Northern Ireland. On May 10th he participated in a 17-man battle-royal at a house show in Detroit. (won by Kerry Von Erich). His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, Sensational Sherri, Slick, and Mr. Fuji) trying to recruit Andre one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (e.g. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to Andre and Mr. Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, Jimmy Hart appeared live on WWF Superstars to announce that he had successfully signed Andre to tag-team with Earthquake. However, when asked to confirm this by Gene Okerlund, Andre denied the claims. This led to Earthquake's attacking Andre from behind (injuring his knee). Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing Tugboat and forming the Natural Disasters. This led to Andre's final major WWF appearance at SummerSlam '91, where he seconded the Bushwhackers in their match against the Disasters. Andre was on crutches at ringside, and after the Disasters won the match, they set out to attack Andre, but the Legion of Doom made their way to ringside and got in between them and the Giant, who was preparing to defend himself with one of his crutches. The Disasters left the ringside area as they were outnumbered by the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers and Andre, who struck both Earthquake and Typhoon (the former Tugboat) with the crutch as they left. His final WWF appearance came at a house show in Paris, France, on October 9. He was in Davey Boy Smith's corner as the Bulldog faced Earthquake. Davey Boy hit Earthquake with Andre's crutch, allowing Smith to win.  His last U.S. television appearance was in a brief interview on World Championship Wrestling's (WCW) Clash of the Champions XX special that aired on TBS on 2 September 1992.","output":"The entity this text is about is Andre Roussimoff, also known as André the Giant, a professional wrestler.

Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- Two nongovernmental organizations that worked primarily on promoting democracy abroad were shuttered by the government of the United Arab Emirates this week. The Dubai office of U.S.-based National Democratic Institute was shut down Wednesday, followed by the closure of the Abu Dhabi office of Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, an organization based in Germany, the next day. Both pro-democracy groups saw their offices raided and shut down last year in Egypt. Egyptian authorities accused the organizations of international interference that was stoking continued protests against the current military-led government.

Furious Swansea boss Garry Monk accused Stoke winger Victor Moses and referee Michael Oliver of cheating his team after a controversial penalty decision at the Britannia Stadium on Sunday. Monk, who now faces an FA disciplinary charge, called for Moses to be punished for diving. The Swansea boss added that if he had ‘dived’ in that manner he would have been too ashamed to face his own family. But when Moses tumbled in the penalty area shortly before the break Oliver was convinced and awarded his second spot-kick of the match. The 29-year-old Northumberland official had earlier upset Stoke by penalising Ryan Shawcross for impeding Wilfried Bony at a corner, and the debate completely overshadowed Jonathan Walters’ 76th-minute winner. Jonathan Walters watches as his well-placed header sails past the dive of Lukas Fabianski and into the corner of the net. Walters runs away to celebrate his goal as Stoke earned three points against Swansea at the Britannia Stadium. Charlie Adam scores from the spot to level for Stoke after Victor Moses went down under the challenge of Angel Rangel.

It is true Moses appeared to go down under minimal contact from defender Angel Rangel, allowing Charlie Adam to cancel out Bony’s penalty. ‘He should be punished for diving,’ said Monk. ‘It’s a clear dive, which is cheating. He’s cheated the ref and then the ref’s cheated us. ‘It’s one of the most blatant dives you’ll ever see. You go and watch a million games and you won’t see more of a dive than that. He should be ashamed of himself. I wouldn’t be able to go home to my family and show my face. This is how I live my life. They can do what they want, but for me it’s a disgrace. ‘There was absolute minimal contact with Rangel. (Moses) has thrown himself to the floor. It is more laughable every time I watch it. It’s very hard to take when it’s so blatant and you see him being rewarded for it. ‘Anyone who simulates in training (at Swansea) is fined. I wouldn’t have it. If my player did that he wouldn’t play in the next game. The referee has taken the easy option to give the penalty. It’s a massive game-changing moment, and a disgusting decision. He’s the only guy in the whole stadium that thought that was a clear-cut penalty. I looked straight at their bench and even they couldn’t believe he’d given it. That tells you everything.’ Monk also hit out at referees’ chief Mike Riley for failing to respond to his concerns over decisions he feels have gone against Swansea this season. He said that the club had already gone over Riley’s head before yesterday’s game by sending a letter and DVD of some of the incidents to John Williams, chairman of Professional Game Match Officials Limited, last week. ‘I haven’t had anything back from Mike Riley which is astonishing to me and poor leadership,’ he added.

The penalty was Bony's second goal of the season after breaking his duck against Newcastle before the international break. Bony celebrates his goal but Stoke felt that the penalty was harsh, as the ball was sailing way over the striker's head from a corner.

He’s supposed to be the head of these guys. ‘We’ve sent off a DVD with a letter, (expressing) my disappointment at no contact from Mike Riley. I think it’s about being proactive, but he’s clearly not proactive, so I have to go above him and hopefully that will send the right message and I can get the right answers.’ Stoke manager Mark Hughes was quick to defend Moses and said that Monk, the Premier League’s youngest manager at 35, had showed a lack of experience with his outburst. ‘It’s a situation that he needs to learn from,’ said Hughes. ‘He is disappointed but the longer you’re in this game, the more experience you get and sometimes you have to curb what you really feel. ‘There was no need for that from my point of view. I don’t think he (Moses) dived. I think he felt contact. He was running at pace between two defenders and the onus is on the defender not to go anywhere near him. ‘From the angle I’ve seen, there’s a definite movement from Rangel to put his arm across Victor and knock him off his stride. It’s a soft one and you can argue about it as much as you like. He gave it and that’s the end of it.’ While Monk claimed that Shawcross dragging Bony to the ground was a clear penalty, Hughes is concerned that his captain’s reputation counted against him. ‘For whatever reason, people are trying to highlight Ryan over most defenders in terms of him being more adept at holding people in the box, which is pure nonsense,’ said Hughes. ‘Maybe the referee had seen a bit of the media coverage. Every time there’s a corner against us the cameras go straight to Ryan. The referee will have done his pre-match work and maybe it’s been highlighted to him.’ Amid the controversy, Walters’ winner was almost forgotten after he headed in a cross from Oussama Assaidi, another Stoke substitute. Victory lifted Stoke up to 10th place, level on points with Swansea. So what did Walters make of it all? ‘I think because he gave the first one, he’s given the second one,’ he said with a smile. Adam celebrates his equaliser but Swansea were livid that Moses, a constant thorn in their side, had been awarded the soft penalty. Ki Sung-Yung, who missed a great chance for Swansea in the first half, closes down Stoke striker Peter Crouch.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  A cave family called the Croods survives a natural disaster, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn and stern patriarch named Grug. The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, the given answer does not appropriately address the question about the political conflicts that marked the presidency of William Howard Taft. Let me provide a suitable answer for you. Some of the significant political conflicts that marked the presidency of William Howard Taft (1909-1913) include: 1. Taft's strained relationship with Theodore Roosevelt: Taft had served as Roosevelt's Secretary of War and was his chosen successor, but their relationship grew tense as Taft increasingly diverged from Roosevelt's progressive policies. This ultimately led to a split in the Republican Party, with Roosevelt forming the Progressive Party. 2. Tariff controversies: Taft struggled with the issue of tariffs, which was a major source of political conflict throughout his presidency. The Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909, which aimed to modify import duties, angered both progressives and conservatives, leading to further divisions in the Republican Party. 3. Anti-trust policy: Taft pursued an aggressive anti-trust policy, prosecuting more cases than his predecessor. However, his handling of some cases, like the controversial United States v. U.S. Steel Corporation, led to criticisms from both progressives and conservatives. 4. Conservation policy: Taft faced criticism from conservationists due to his approach to public lands and natural resources. He fired Gifford Pinchot, a dedicated conservationist appointed by Roosevelt, contributing to the widening rift with his former mentor. These are just a few examples of the political conflicts that marked the presidency of William Howard Taft."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Annie liked all foods, whether they were organic or not.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which friend drank less milk from cows treated with antibiotics?  Hint: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? The Maronites are a Christian group who adhere to the Syriac Maronite Church with the largest population around Mount Lebanon in Lebanon. The Maronite Church is an Eastern Catholic sui iuris particular church in full communion with the Pope and the Catholic Church, with self-governance under the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, one of more than a dozen individual churches in full communion with the Holy See. They derive their name from the Syriac Christian saint Maron, whose followers migrated to the area of Mount Lebanon from their previous location of residence around the area of Antioch, establishing the nucleus of the Syriac Maronite Church. Some Maronites argue that they are of Mardaite ancestry, but most historians reject such claims. Phoenicianism is an identity on the part of Lebanese Christians that has developed into an integrated ideology led by key thinkers, but there are a few who have stood out more than others: Charles Corm, Michel Chiha, and Said Aql in their promotion of Phoenicianism. In post civil-war Lebanon since the Taif agreement, politically Phoenicianism is restricted to a small group.  Among leaders of the movement Etienne Saqr, Said Akl, Charles Malik, Camille Chamoun, and Bachir Gemayel have been notable names, some going as far as voicing anti-Arab views. In his book the Israeli writer Mordechai Nisan, who at times met with some of them during the war, quoted Said Akl, a famous Lebanese poet and philosopher, as saying;  Akl believes in emphasizing the Phoenician legacy of the Lebanese people and has promoted the use of the Lebanese dialect written in a modified Latin alphabet, rather than the Arabic one, although both alphabets have descended from the Phoenician alphabet.  In opposition to such views, Arabism was affirmed at the March 1936 Congress of the Coast and Four Districts, when the Muslim leadership at the conference made the declaration that Lebanon was an Arab country, indistinguishable from its Arab neighbors. In the April 1936 Beirut municipal elections, Christian and Muslim politicians were divided along Phoenician and Arab lines in the matter of whether the Lebanese coast should be claimed by Syria or given to Lebanon, increasing the already mounting tensions between the two communities. Phoenicianism is still disputed by many Arabist scholars who have on occasion tried to convince its adherents to abandon their claims as false, and to embrace and accept the Arab identity instead. This conflict of ideas of identity is believed to be one of the pivotal disputes between the Muslim and Christian populations of Lebanon and what mainly divides the country to the detriment of national unity.  In general it appears that Muslims focus more on the Arab identity of the Lebanese history and culture whereas the older, long-standing Christian communities, especially the Maronites focus on their history, and struggles as an ethnoreligious group in an Arab world, while also reaffirming the Lebanese identity, and refraining from Arab characterization as it would deny them their striving achievement of having fended off the Arabs and Turks physically, culturally, and spiritually since their conception. The Maronite perseverance lead to their existence even today.

Answer this question: who was the prime minister of india in 1996??","output":"India had two Prime Ministers in the year 1996, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and H. D. Deve Gowda. Atal Bihari Vajpayee of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was the Prime Minister of India for a brief period in 1996, from May 16 to June 1. The BJP had emerged as the single largest party in the 1996 general elections. However, they were unable to gather enough support and coalition partners to achieve a working majority in the Parliament. As a result, Vajpayee's first term as Prime Minister lasted only for 13 days as he could not prove his majority in the Parliament. He eventually resigned and his government fell, necessitating the formation of a new government. Vajpayee was a prominent leader and had a long and distinguished political career. He was one of the founding members of the BJP, and under his leadership, the party gained political prominence and became a significant force in Indian politics. Vajpayee served three times as India's Prime Minister. His first tenure was in 1996, and his subsequent tenures were from 1998 to 1999, and from 1999 to 2004. Post Vajpayee's resignation, India saw the emergence of a new Prime Minister in H. D. Deve Gowda of the Janata Dal, who headed the United Front coalition government. The United Front was a conglomeration of non-Congress, non-BJP regional political parties. Deve Gowda assumed office on June 1, 1996, and served till April 21, 1997.  H. D. Deve Gowda had an extensive political career primarily in the southern state of Karnataka, before becoming the Prime Minister of India. He served as the 11th Chief Minister of Karnataka from 1994 to 1996 before ascending to the Prime Ministership. His term as a Prime Minister was however short and marked by political instability due to the inherent strains and contradictions in a coalition government. These political oscillations in 1996 underscore the complexities and dynamics of Indian politics, particularly in the context of coalition governments. They highlight the roles that negotiations, alliances, and coalitions have played in shaping the political landscape of the world's largest democracy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Avoid peak sun hours: The sun's rays are most intense between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. During these hours, try to stay indoors or seek shade whenever possible. If you must be outside during peak sun hours, make sure to take appropriate precautions, such as using sunscreen and wearing protective clothing. 2. Use sunscreen: Always use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher, regardless of the weather or season. Apply the sunscreen liberally and evenly to all exposed skin areas 15-30 minutes before going outdoors. Be sure to reapply every two hours, or more frequently if you are swimming or sweating. 3. Wear protective clothing: When possible, wear clothing made from tightly woven, dark-colored fabrics that cover your arms and legs. This type of clothing will provide better protection against the sun's harmful rays. Additionally, invest in a wide-brimmed hat to protect your face, neck, and ears, and consider purchasing sunglasses with UV-blocking lenses to protect your eyes from harmful solar radiation. 4. Avoid tanning beds: Tanning beds emit UV radiation that is similar to, or even stronger than, sunlight and can greatly increase the risk of developing melanoma. Avoid using tanning beds, and opt for sunless tanning products instead if you desire a tan. 5. Perform regular skin checks: Routinely examine your skin from head to toe for any new or changing moles, spots, or growths. This will allow you to detect any early signs of melanoma and seek medical attention promptly if necessary. Consult a dermatologist if you notice any suspicious changes in your skin. 6. Protect children's skin: Children have delicate skin that is particularly susceptible to sunburns and damage from UV rays. Make sure they are also protected from the sun by applying sunscreen, dressing them in protective clothing, and limiting their playtime outdoors during peak sun hours. 7. Know your risk factors: Some people have a higher risk of developing melanoma due to their genetics, skin type, personal or family history of skin cancer, or other factors. Be aware of your own risk factors and take extra precautions to prevent melanoma if necessary. 8. Schedule regular skin cancer screenings: If you have a personal or family history of skin cancer or other risk factors, consider scheduling routine skin cancer screenings with a dermatologist. Early detection and treatment are key to increasing the chances of a full recovery. By incorporating these preventative measures into your daily routine, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing melanoma and maintain your skin's health. Remember, protecting yourself from the sun's harmful rays is not just a matter of vanity — it's an essential step towards ensuring your long-term well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In March 1967, which English football team became the first 3rd Division club to win the League Cup????","output":"In March 1967, the English football team, Queens Park Rangers (QPR), made history by becoming the first Third Division club to win the League Cup. This remarkable achievement took place during the 1966-67 football season. Here's a detailed overview of the event: Background: The Football League Cup, also known as the League Cup, was inaugurated during the 1960-61 season as a knockout competition for English football clubs in the Football League. Throughout the years, it has steadily gained prestige and remains one of the primary domestic cup competitions in English football alongside the FA Cup. 1966-67 Football League Cup: The 1966-67 League Cup witnessed several thrilling matches leading to the final. Queens Park Rangers, an underdog playing in the Third Division (now known as EFL League One), displayed extraordinary determination and skill in overcoming higher-ranked opponents and reaching the final match of the tournament. The Road to the Final: QPR's path to the final saw them defeating Colchester United, Aldershot, Swansea Town, Leicester City, and Birmingham City. One of the most notable victories came in the semifinals against Birmingham City, where QPR emerged winners with an aggregate score of 7-2 after two legs. The Final: The 1966-67 Football League Cup Final took place on March 4, 1967. Queens Park Rangers faced West Bromwich Albion, a team that was part of the English First Division (now the English Premier League) at that time. The match was held at the iconic Wembley Stadium in London, providing a grand stage for this historic event. Queens Park Rangers displayed exceptional grit and determination as they went up against a more accomplished West Bromwich Albion side. Despite being down 0-2 in the first half, QPR managed a phenomenal comeback. In the second half, they scored three goals, securing a 3-2 victory. The goals were scored by Roger Morgan, Rodney Marsh, and Mark Lazarus, who became club legends in their own right. Impact and Legacy: Queens Park Rangers' impressive win in the 1966-67 League Cup Final stands as a landmark moment in the history of English football, illustrating that with hard work and determination, even lower-division clubs can achieve remarkable feats. Their performance in the competition played a crucial role in QPR's eventual promotion to the Second Division at the end of the 1966-67 season. This historic achievement proved to be an inspiration for countless other underdog teams, ushering in an era where clubs outside of top divisions began to establish themselves as formidable opponents in domestic cup competitions. The triumph of QPR in the 1966-67 Football League Cup still resonates as an inspiring tale for aspiring football clubs across the nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So we have: -4256 * o - 90463 = -168718 - 257969 First, let's add those big numbers on the right side: -168718 - 257969 = -426687 Now our equation looks like this: -4256 * o - 90463 = -426687 Next, let's get rid of the -90463 by adding it to both sides of the equation: -4256 * o - 90463 + 90463 = -426687 + 90463 As we are adding and subtracting, the -90463 and 90463 cancel each other out, so we have: -4256 * o = -336224 Now, we need to find out the value of o. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -4256: (-4256 * o) / -4256 = -336224 / -4256 Since we are dividing both sides by -4256, the -4256 on the left side will cancel out, leaving us with just o: o = (=336224 / -4256) Now let's do the division to find the answer: o ≈ 79 So, the answer to this equation is around 79.

A Georgia police chief who bizarrely called 911 to report that he'd 'accidentally' shot his wife 'twice' on at 4 am on New Years Eve is placed on administrative leave as an investigation reveals he shot her just once. At a Thursday afternoon press conference, Peachtree City, Georgia authorities identified the shooter as local Police Chief William McCollom, 57, and the victim as his 58-year-old wife Margaret who is now fighting for her life. As of now police have not announced as to whether or not they suspect the police chief of criminal activity but have said he is fully cooperating with law enforcement. Scroll down for video. What happened? On Thursday, Peachtree City, Georgia authorities confirmed that local police chief William McCollom (right) shot his wife inside their home early New Year's Day. His wife Margaret (left) was last listed in critical condition at Atlanta Medical Center. Scene: McCollom allegedly called 911 shortly after 4am on January 1 to report that he accidentally shot his wife. 'We have no leanings one way or the other at this point because we just don’t know,' Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard said. “As soon as all the facts are known they’ll turn over a file to our office, and we’ll review to see if in fact there’s been any criminal activity.' Margaret McCollom has not been interviewed as of yet. 'He's very, very well-liked,' Mark Brown, of the Peachtree City Police Department, told CBS. 'The department is hurting. We're very concerned for his wife and the chief. We're just trying to make sure everything is done correctly as far as the investigation goes.' The incident happened just after 4am, when officers received a call from the chief, saying he accidentally shot his wife twice at their home on Autumn Leaf using his service handgun, a Glock 17 9mm. Investigators say the woman was shot in the home's bedroom. It was initially reported that the chief shot her two times, according to the 911 recording, but authorities now say she was shot just once. Margaret was flown by helicopter to Atlanta Medical Center, where she was still listed in critical condition Thursday afternoon. The Georgia Bureau of Investigations is taking over the case, and will file a report on the shooting to the District Attorney's office which will decide whether to press charges. GBI Director Sherry Lang said the police chief is being fully cooperative with the investigation. Meanwhile, McCollom has since been placed on paid administrative leave by the City Manager, pending an internal review. Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard said  McCollom has not been arrested or charged with any crime. He had only officially been in the position for two months, but took over as interim police chief in July when the previous chief stepped down. Veteran cop: McCollom has been the police chief of Peachtree City since October, but on Thursday it was announced that he would be placed on leave pending an internal review. Happy couple? One of the McCollom's neighbors described them as 'loving' and that he has 'never seen any problems over there'. William (left) and Margaret McCollom (right) pictured above in a picture posted to Margaret's Facebook. It's unclear what relation the young man in the middle has to the couple. Before that, he served as assistant chief and joined the department in 2012. According to Mrs McCollom's Facebook, she is licensed practical nurse who used to work in an emergency room. A neighbor who lives across the street from the McColloms described them as a 'loving couple' who 'do a lot of things together' and that he says he has 'never seen any problems over there', according to Fox. Peachtree City Police Lt Mark Brown said the department is 'hurting' after the incident and concerned for both the chief and his wife. Lt Brown said the chief was 'well like and well loved' around the department.

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If sunlight becomes so strong that it kills plants, it will have a significant negative effect on oxygen production. Plants are the primary producers of oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. During this process, they convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (energy) and oxygen, which is released as a byproduct.  As plants die due to the intense sunlight, there will be fewer plants available to produce oxygen. Therefore, the supposed perturbation will lead to less oxygen being produced by the remaining plants. This decrease in oxygen production could have detrimental effects on the overall oxygen levels in the atmosphere, and consequently, on all living organisms that rely on oxygen for respiration and survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Back at their house by the cemetery, Paul and Chloe found Bee in her room, what Paul referred to as her sanctum sanctorum - although no one else ever got the joke, and he refused to explain the comic book reference. As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Jennifer's Shadow is set in Argentina & starts as Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips) arrives there after her sister Johanna dies. Jennifer is left Johanna's large house in her will, Jennifer decides to sell the house & head back to Los Angeles even though her Grandmother Mary Ellen (Faye Dunaway) is opposed to the sale. However strange things begin to happen, Jennifer starts having nightmares about Ravens pecking at her & she starts to feel very ill. After a check up in hospital it seems that one of her kidney's have mysteriously disappeared, what is happening to Jennifer? Is it an ancient family curse? Will Jennifer be the next to succumb to it... This Argentinian American co-production was co-written & co-directed by Daniel de la Vega & Pablo Parés & is a really dull waste of ninety odd minutes, a tedious & predictable modern ghost story that I would imagine will put more people to sleep sooner than scare them. The script by Vega, Parés & P.J. Pettiette is pretty slow going & tedious which is not what anyone wants, I mean I'm sure most people don't want to sit down & be bored out of their skulls. The character's are all uninteresting & fairly faceless with little or no motivation for anything they do. For instance who is that graveyard caretaker guy? How did he know about the demons? What is his interest & motivation for getting involved? I couldn't see it. Jennifer herself is a pretty unlikable & bland leading lady, her Grandmother Mary Allen is as clichéd as they come & it's surprising that she is so obviously the villain. I mean for this sort of mystery based horror/ghost story it's surprisingly predictable & routine. There are gaps in both logic & the story which together with the terrible twist ending which isn't much of a twist I didn't like Jennifer's Shadow one iota. Directors Vega & Parés goes down the much used route of bleaching almost all of the colour from the picture which often renders it not too far from black and white, I suspect that they wanted to give it a period Gothic feel but it's been done so many times before & often so much better that it didn't do much for me at all & just makes the whole film look dull & lifeless. There's a definite 40's period look as well, from the costumes to the interior of the large house but again it's rather half hearted & cheap looking. Jennifer's Shadow is well made but it's rather forgettable, it's not scary or creepy & it's rather predictable. If that wasn't enough there's no gore either, there's a few scenes of Ravens pecking away at people & a beating heart but nothing else. With a supposed budget of about 1,000,000 & retitled to The Chronicles of the Raven for it's US & international DVD release this is reasonably well made but a million won't buy you too much these days & Jennifer's Shadow pretty much proves that theory. There are too many scenes of actor's speaking in thick Argentinian accents as well, even though it might be realistic I actually like to be able to understand what people are saying. The acting is alright although Dunaway overacts badly & is obviously there for the money. Jennifer's Shadow is a rubbishy ghost film that I thought was a total bore from start to finish, I would rather watch The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies!!? (1964) again instead. A total waste of time.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? By Paul Hirst, Press Association Daniel Sturridge insists he will not buckle under the pressure of being England's World Cup number nine. Sturridge underlined his status as one of Europe's most promising strikers last season when he scored 21 goals in the Barclays Premier League. The 24-year-old's career has blossomed since he moved to Anfield, where he formed a lethal partnership with top scorer Luis Suarez, but he is yet to repeat that kind of form on the international stage. Sturridge will be the spearhead of England's attack this summer, just as Alan Shearer and Sir Bobby Charlton were when they wore the famous number nine shirt on their back. The forward, who has been deployed in midfield for much of","output":"his international career, is eager to prove his worth as England's leading striker and silence any doubters. Emulating the success of legends like Shearer and Charlton, he understands the weight of expectation that comes with the number nine shirt but is confident in his ability to perform at the highest level. Sturridge will have the support of a talented and dynamic England squad, who share the common goal of making a deep run in the World Cup. With the likes of Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, and Marcus Rashford providing attacking options alongside him, Sturridge knows that the team's collective strength will be crucial to their success in the tournament. Additionally, manager Gareth Southgate's tactical approach and emphasis on teamwork will play a major role in determining England's performance on the international stage. Given his track record at the club level and determination to succeed, there is no reason to believe that Sturridge cannot rise to the occasion and make a significant impact for England in the World Cup. His resilience and self-belief, coupled with the quality of his teammates, make him a key player to watch in the competition, as England aim to make their mark and bring glory on the international stage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick your answer from: - Don't go to elevated mountaintops. - Hike to elevated mountaintops.","output":"To accomplish the goal of avoiding getting struck by lightning, it makes more sense to choose: \\"Don't go to elevated mountaintops.\\" This choice is more logical because: 1. Higher altitudes: Lightning tends to strike at higher altitudes where the air is thinner, making it easier for the electrical discharge to take place. By staying away from elevated mountaintops, you're reducing your exposure to these high-risk locations. 2. Open spaces: Elevated mountaintops generally have fewer trees and open spaces, which increases the chances of being the tallest object around, making you more vulnerable to a lightning strike. 3. Proximity to metal objects: Mountaintops and hiking trails may have metal objects such as fences, poles, and cables that can attract lightning. Avoiding these areas reduces your chances of being near a potential lightning strike. 4. Time and weather conditions: Hiking in elevated areas during thunderstorms puts you at a higher risk of being struck by lightning.

Nelson was so overwhelmed. b. Jeffrey was so overwhelmed.","output":"Nelson had a harder time controlling his emotions than Jeffrey because Nelson was so overwhelmed.  Step 1: Picking up the story from where it left off. Justification: In order to continue the story, we need to begin from the ending of the previous sentence and develop the plot further. Step 2: Providing reasoning for Nelson's overwhelming emotions. Justification: It is important to provide a reason for the character's emotions to make the story more believable and engaging. Nelson's favorite band, The Indie Rockers, had just announced a surprise performance at the local venue in their hometown. He had been looking forward to this day for years, and now that it was finally happening, the butterflies in his stomach multiplied exponentially, making it difficult for him to think clearly. Step 3: Introducing Jeffrey's reaction to the same situation. Justification: Since Jeffrey was mentioned earlier, it is essential to include his response to the event and compare it with Nelson's reaction. Meanwhile, Jeffrey, who was also a fan of The Indie Rockers, seemed to be handling the news a lot better than Nelson. He had always been the more composed one between the two friends, and this was no exception. Jeffrey offered Nelson some reassuring words and told him to relax, as they were bound to have a great time. Step 4: Developing the story by describing the friends' activities leading up to the event. Justification: Expanding on the story by detailing characters' actions and thoughts contributes to creating a richer narrative and keeps the reader engaged. Over the next few days, Nelson and Jeffrey started preparing for the concert. Nelson found it hard to focus on anything else, constantly checking the band's social media accounts and getting goosebumps each time he imagined seeing them live. Jeffrey, on the other hand, took care of the practical aspects: he bought the tickets, figured out how they would get to the venue, and even did some research on parking options. Step 5: Describing the climax of the story - attending the concert. Justification: Reaching the peak moment of the story gives a sense of resolution and completes the narrative arc. Finally, the day of the concert arrived. Nelson was a bundle of nerves, his heart racing as they walked into the venue. As the lights dimmed and The Indie Rockers stepped onto the stage, Nelson's emotions peaked. He could barely contain his joy, tears streaming down his face as he sang along to every song. Jeffrey, happy but more in control of his emotions, enjoyed the energy of the live show, singing and dancing along with Nelson the entire night. Step 6: Wrapping up the story with a reflection or lesson. Justification: Concluding the story with a reflection or a takeaway can make it more meaningful and leave a lasting impression on the reader. After the concert, Nelson finally understood the importance of managing his emotions. He realized that while it was okay to be overwhelmed, it was equally vital to find ways to channel his excitement. Although he still had much to learn about emotional control, this experience taught him that he didn't need to hold back to enjoy life – he just needed to find the right balance. Jeffrey, always there to support him, was more than happy to help Nelson on his journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If you don't feel comfortable outright asking, you may choose to instead ask questions about the other person. Try not to accuse your partner of anything. Instead, say, \\"I feel you are spending a lot of time with this person. This hurts me because you are my partner, and I feel like we are not as close as we used to be.\\" During this conversation, you should remain calm. You will not get anywhere if you are both angry. If your partner denies or admits the closeness to this other person, don't yell and get upset. Instead, take a deep breath before responding. If your partner denies everything, then take the opportunity to discuss the problem in your relationship, like how you feel emotional distance or feel neglected. You may want to figure out why you believe your partner is doing this in the first place. Have they had an emotional or physical affair before? Have other people noticed your partner's behavior? Is this based on your own issues? Determining this can help you figure out how to proceed.  Examine your own feelings. Are you jealous by nature? Are you insecure? Have you been cheated on in the past? These things may make you more sensitive and suspicious. Talk to your partner about your feelings. Sharing your insecurities or past can help you build a stronger future. You may also consider talking with a trustworthy friend or family member about your suspicions.

He told the producers, \\"What is important to me is the era, the internal meaning of each event, the personality of each hero\\", and warned them not to expect mere musical \\"illustrations\\". He attended rehearsals and made detailed notes of the action and the acting. The period setting of the film appealed to Prokofiev; Robinson comments that the Kijé score is one of several works, including the Classical Symphony, The Love of Three Oranges, Cinderella, and War and Peace, that show \\"the composer's fondness for the eighteenth century\\". The language he chose combined elements of humour and romance with an underlying melancholy—he interpreted the story as more tragic than comic. Prokofiev had heard Ravel's Boléro in Paris, and had been much impressed by the French composer's use of the saxophone, an instrument then rarely used in orchestral compositions outside France but which suited Prokofiev's intentions perfectly. The composer Gerard McBurney has pointed out the \\"haunting sounds of the tenor saxophone\\" that punctuate the Kijé music.The critic Ernest Chapman refers to Prokofiev's \\"unfailingly witty and melodious score\\". It comprises only about 15 minutes of music, written as a series of 16 short fragments or leitmotifs which are repeated at appropriate times during the film's duration, to highlight specific moments in the drama. This approach was a departure in film music from the established form of broad symphonic movements, and was described by Prokofiev's biographer Daniel Jaffé as \\"well ahead of its time ... one of the most celebrated [film scores] of that era\\".

Edgar Draque Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Draque Heirloom\\" The story begins in the vibrant art scene of New York City. Nora Avery, a down-on-her-luck artist with an uncanny talent for creating stunning works and capturing life's poignant moments in her canvases, lives in a small apartment cluttered with her art supplies and creations. Amid these artworks is a centuries-old painting she'd inherited from her grandmother, an eccentric old woman with a mysterious past. The painting is said to be a relic of their family, with no known artist or origin.  One day, a wealthy art collector, Edgar Draque, comes upon one of Nora's pieces at a small local gallery and is mesmerized with her raw talent. Intrigued by her artistry and eager to support aspiring artists, he decides to meet her. As he steps into Nora's apartment, among dozens of her artworks, Edgar's eye catches the sight of the old painting. The mysterious artwork evokes a deep sense of familiarity, and he's immediately drawn towards it.  Edgar recognizes the painting as a missing piece from a famous yet elusive collection once owned by his ancestors. The Draque family, once highly influential in art circles, was rumored to have accumulated a priceless collection over the decades. However, following a family feud decades ago, part of the collection was either lost or scattered. Edgar has since dedicated his life to reunite the Draque collection, seeing it as a way to honor his lineage, and the painting in Nora's possession is one of the key missing pieces. Edgar offers Nora a large sum for the painting, an offer that could solve all her financial woes and give her the freedom to focus solely on her art. But for Nora, who has lived with the painting all her life, parting with it would mean losing a piece of her grandmother and their shared love for art. While initially conflicted, Nora decides to turn down the offer, unable to relinquish her grandmother's memory. Edgar, though determined, respects her decision but remains ardent in his quest to bring back his family's legacy. This twist of events leads him and Nora to unravel the shared history between their families, which dates back centuries and involves a bitter rivalry, deep secrets, a doomed love story, and a shared respect for art. Meanwhile, Nora's strength to hold on to the painting against the lure of riches brings her artworks to the spotlight, earning her respect and recognition in the art world. Edgar and Nora gradually forge an unlikely bond as they sift through their intertwined history. The painting becomes a symbol of their shared heritage and the resilience of artists, resonating with Edgar's respect for artistry, and Nora's struggle to sustain her passion. In the climax, it is revealed that Nora's grandmother and Edgar's grandfather were lovers torn apart by their families' rivalry. The painting was gifted to Nora's grandmother as a token of their love. Knowing this, Edgar withdraws his offer, realizing the painting's emotional value. Nora, inspired by the love story encapsulated in the painting, starts a new series of masterpieces capturing her family's untold story and the essence of their intertwined history. \\"The Draque Heirloom\\" is a tale of art, passion, history, and sacrifice, capturing the pricelessness of family heirlooms against the backdrop of the bustling New York art scene. It's a story that showcases how art can surpass mere monetary value and be a timeless medium of pristine emotions and inherited legacies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season.

Choices:  - arctic winds  - equatorial winds  - domestic winds  - global winds  A:","output":"To answer this question, let's first understand the scenario and then analyze the given choices. Step 1: Understanding the scenario When more solar energy strikes the equator than the polar regions, it leads to a temperature difference between these areas. The equator gets warmer due to more direct sunlight, while the poles remain colder as they receive less sunlight. Step 2: Analyzing the choices - Arctic winds: These are cold winds that blow from the polar regions towards lower latitudes. This choice doesn't fit the scenario since we are talking about winds created due to temperature differences caused by solar energy striking the equator more than the polar regions. - Equatorial winds: These winds are typically found around the equator and are driven by the temperature differences between the equator and the poles. This choice seems closer to the correct answer. - Domestic winds: There is no specific definition of \\"domestic winds\\" in meteorology. Hence, this choice is not correct. - Global winds: Global winds are large-scale wind patterns that are driven by the temperature differences between the equator and the polar regions. These winds include trade winds, westerlies, and polar easterlies. This choice seems to fit the scenario as well. Step 3: Choosing the closest answer After analyzing the choices, it is clear that both equatorial winds and global winds are created due to temperature differences caused by more solar energy striking the equator than the polar regions. However, global winds cover a broader range of wind patterns that are caused by this phenomenon.

Process: - Bees go out during the day and gather food - Then while gathering of their food, they make wax, which is the building block of their bee hive - Bees make food called honey - They use a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis as a binding to hold their hives together - Bees produce all of the building blocks to build their hive in their own body -   Question: suppose more salt is needed happens, how will it affect a LARGER hive.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"When discussing the potential effects of an increase in salt on a larger bee hive, it is crucial to delve into the various aspects involved to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue. In the context of this question, the term \\"larger hive\\" refers to a hive housing a greater number of bees, essentially making it a more massive and productive colony.  Bees, like other living organisms, maintain a delicate balance in their bodily functions, and salt plays a crucial role in the process. Sodium is a vital component in cells, acting as an essential electrolyte for hydration and the regulation of nerve and muscle function. Given the dynamic nature of bees, they require adequate amounts of salts and minerals to maintain their day-to-day functions and overall health. However, extreme concentrations of salt could have adverse effects on the bees. Assuming that more salt is required or that the environment has a higher salt content, this development will significantly impact a larger hive. It should be noted that different species of bees have varying tolerance levels to salt, which means the severity of the influence may also differ between species. Here are the possible scenarios for the larger hive based on the increased requirement or availability of salt: 1. Enhanced Foraging Behavior (A: More): An increase in salt might lead to bees venturing out more frequently to search for water or nectar sources that can help the hive maintain an optimal balance of salts and minerals. This increased foraging effort could lead to improved productivity, resulting in a larger hive and a more substantial honey output. The heightened foraging behavior could also enhance the bees' exposure to beneficial micronutrients, further contributing to the growth of the colony. 2. Negative Impact on Colony Health (B: Less): In contrast, excessive salt concentration could negatively affect the health of the bees in the larger hive. Excess salinity can disrupt the delicate balance of salts and minerals in the bees' bodies, potentially leading to dehydration, reduced nectar intake, and weakened immune systems. This scenario may result in fewer worker bees or a decline in the overall number of bees, ultimately affecting the hive's size and productivity. 3. Adaptation of Hive Governance (C: No effect): Depending on the extent of the increase in salt concentrations, the larger colony may be able to adapt and maintain balance without any significant changes. The queen, worker, and drone bees could collectively adjust their routines and resource allocation to compensate for the altered requirements. Bees' remarkable adaptability might make it possible for the larger hive to continue thriving even in conditions with more salt present in their environment. In summary, depending on the level of salt increase and the specific bee species, all three options have the potential to manifest in the larger hive. The bees could either benefit from enhanced foraging behavior and improved nutrient intake, suffer adverse health effects, or adapt their hive maintenance strategies to accommodate the new conditions. The actual outcome will primarily depend on the hive's resilience, adaptability, and species-specific salt tolerances."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Two groups of people when to the doctor. Group A had myopia, while group B had nearsightedness. Both groups got eyeglasses for their conditions.  Which group had their people inherit their condition?  Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20.

Vaslav Nijinsky (also Vatslav; Russian: Vatslav Fomich Nizhinskii; Russian: ['vatsl@f f@'mjitc njI'zinskjIj]; Polish: Waclaw Nizynski; 12 March 1889/1890 - 8 April 1950) was a ballet dancer and choreographer cited as the greatest male dancer of the early 20th century. Nijinsky spent his summer after graduation rehearsing and then performing at Krasnoe Selo in a makeshift theatre with an audience mainly of army officers. These performances frequently included members of the Imperial family and other nobility, whose support and interest were essential to a career. Each dancer who performed before the Tsar received a gold watch inscribed with the Imperial Eagle. Buoyed by Nijinsky's salary, his new earnings from giving dance classes, and his sister Bronia's employment with the ballet company, the family moved to a larger flat on Torgovaya Ulitsa. The new season at the Mariinsky theatre began in September 1907, with Nijinsky employed as coryphee on a salary of 780 roubles per year.  He appeared with Sedova, Lydia Kyasht and Karsavina. Kchessinska partnered him in La Fille Mal Gardee, where he succeeded in an atypical role for him involving humour and flirtation. Designer Alexandre Benois proposed a ballet based upon Le Pavillon d'Armide, choreographed by Fokine to music by Nikolai Tcherepnin. Nijinsky had a minor role, but it allowed him to show off his technical abilities with leaps and pirouettes. The partnership of Fokine, Benois and Nijinsky was repeated throughout his career. Shortly after, he upstaged his own performance, appearing in the Bluebird pas de deux from the Sleeping Beauty, partnering Lydia Kyasht. The Mariinsky audience was deeply familiar with the piece, but exploded with enthusiasm for his performance and his appearing to fly, an effect he continued to have on audiences with the piece during his career.  In subsequent years, Nijinsky was given several soloist roles. In 1910, Mathilde Kschessinska selected Nijinsky to dance in a revival of Petipa's Le Talisman.

Middle Ages The development of a three-field rotation system for planting crops[AA] increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system, with a consequent increase in production. The development of the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently, aided by the spread of the horse collar, which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen. Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture, factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system. Q: What invention led to an increase in efficiency in the farming of heavy soils?","output":"The invention that led to an increase in efficiency in the farming of heavy soils is the heavy plough. This tool made it easier to work with heavier soils, and when combined with the use of horses instead of oxen, it helped make farming more productive during the Middle Ages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Q: Aluminosilicates are formed by replacing some of the si atoms in silicates by which atoms?   A: A:","output":"Aluminosilicates are formed by replacing some of the silicon (Si) atoms in silicates with aluminum (Al) atoms. These complex minerals are a subgroup of silicate minerals that are abundant in the Earth's crust and can be found in various types of rocks, soils, and clays. Structurally, both silicon and aluminum can form tetrahedral units (SiO4 or AlO4), which serve as the basic building blocks of aluminosilicate minerals. The silicon to aluminum substitution in aluminosilicates occurs due to differences in ionic radii and charge between the two elements. Silicon has a larger ionic radius and a +4 charge, while aluminum has a smaller ionic radius and a +3 charge. The substitution process is facilitated by the presence of other cations, such as sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and iron (Fe), which help to compensate for the charge imbalance resulting from the replacement of silicon by aluminum. The substitution of silicon with aluminum in the silicate framework results in a variety of aluminosilicate minerals, which can be classified into different groups based on their structures and compositions. These groups include: 1. Feldspar group: The most abundant aluminosilicate minerals in the Earth's crust. They are characterized by the presence of aluminum and either potassium (K), sodium (Na), or calcium (Ca) as the compensating cation. Examples include orthoclase (KAlSi3O8), microcline (KAlSi3O8), albite (NaAlSi3O8), and anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8). 2. Clay minerals: Aluminosilicates with a layered structure that can adsorb water molecules and swell. They are commonly found in soils and sedimentary rocks and play a crucial role in various geological processes. Examples include kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), montmorillonite ((Na,Ca)0.33(Al,Mg)2Si4O10(OH)2·nH2O), and illite (KAl2(Si,Al)4O10(OH)2·nH2O). 3. Zeolites: Aluminosilicates with a porous, three-dimensional framework structure, formed by the linking of AlO4 and SiO4 tetrahedra. They can accommodate water molecules and cations within their cavities, making them useful in industrial applications such as catalysis, adsorption, and ion exchange. Examples include natrolite (Na2Al2Si3O10·2H2O) and chabazite (CaAl2Si4O12·6H2O). 4. Micas: Layered aluminosilicate minerals characterized by their perfect basal cleavage, which allows them to be split into thin, flexible flakes. They can be found in various types of rocks, especially metamorphic and igneous rocks. Examples include muscovite (KAl2(AlSi3O10)(OH)2) and biotite (K(Mg,Fe)3(AlSi3O10)(OH)2). 5. Amphiboles: Inosilicates with a double-chain structure formed by the linking of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra. They are common in metamorphic and igneous rocks and exhibit a wide range of compositions. Examples include hornblende ((Ca,Na)2-3(Mg,Fe,Al)5(Al,Si)8O22(OH)2) and tremolite (Ca2Mg5Si8O22(OH)2). Overall, the formation of aluminosilicates involves the substitution of some silicon atoms by aluminum atoms in the silicate structure, leading to a diverse group of minerals that play a critical role in various geological processes, and have significant industrial applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force. Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. The shutters were brought down on entrances a further 15 times for other reasons, including staffing issues and strikes, in the 12 months to October. Other major Tube stations Victoria and Waterloo closed five times and once respectively. Transport for London said it recognised Oxford Circus could get \\"very busy\\". More on this story and other news from London TfL blamed the situation on modernisation work at neighbouring Tottenham Court Road and Bond Street stations. A statement said: \\"As part of this work, the Central Line is not currently stopping at Tottenham Court Road, meaning many customers have diverted to Oxford Circus.\\" 113 at Oxford Circus 52 at Bank & Monument (interlinked) 5 at London Bridge 4 at Victoria 1 at Waterloo But the closures - amounting to nearly one every three days - during evening rush hours have frustrated shoppers and commuters using the station, which is at the busy junction of Oxford Street and Regent Street. One Twitter user asked: \\"When will Transport for London sort out overcrowding at Oxford Circus? Closed almost every day at rush hour.\\" Following the terrorist attacks in Paris, another tweeted the overcrowding made \\"everyone jumpy\\". Minor closures were not included in the figures, released to BBC London through a Freedom of Information request. These include times when entrances were closed and stations only used for people to interchange and exit. TfL said these \\"partial closures\\" were \\"treated as 'business as usual' and usually only recorded locally, if at all\\". Oxford Circus is London Underground's busiest station, with nearly 100 million passengers entering or leaving the station in 2014. Stations are closed in order to \\"ensure that platforms are safe to use and there are not too many people on them,\\" a TfL spokeswoman added. Tailor Thomas Church, 25, from West Hampstead, who uses the station every day, said the closures affected surrounding businesses. He said: \\"When it closes I have to cancel appointments and that means I lose money. It can cost us thousands of pounds every time. \\"What I don't get is that London is the world's favourite city and Oxford Circus is at the heart of it - so why hasn't it been upgraded to cope with demand?\\" London Mayor Boris Johnson was forced to defend TfL in response to the figures. \\"Oxford Circus is in line, as you know, for a huge improvement and don't forget that is one of the reasons why Crossrail is so vital,\\" he told LBC. \\"That Central line, that whole network will be radically relieved by Crossrail when it comes in in a couple of years' time.\\" A spokesman for watchdog London TravelWatch said the figures showed the \\"need for continued investment in capacity in the face of ever increasing demand\\". A July report from the watchdog recommended improving how interchanges are shown on Tube and rail maps. It said this could include making it clear where stations are a short walk apart, the interchanges that do not require additional fares and those that require passengers to leave the station. General Secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT) Mick Cash said the underground network was \\"bursting at the seams\\". \\"RMT is now receiving regular reports from our reps of severe overcrowding on both the tube and the commuter rail services,\\" he said. \\"All the indicators are that passenger numbers will continue to surge, cramming more people into a capacity that is already at breaking point. \\"At the moment the transport authorities are winging it and that is a recipe for disaster. \\" \\"I think it needs to be pedestrian-only. There's just too many people. People are walking in the roads, I just walked in the road myself. It's a bit of a joke,\\" said Jonny Button. Isabel Cordwell, who works between Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Circus, said: \\"It stops me getting home in the evening. It's not at the same time every day so it's quite inconvenient. \\"But I'm not sure what can be done to change it - it's just the amount of people trying to get in and out.\\" Rebecca Koczan said: \\"It's pretty rubbish. Often I just walk to Green Park because I can't be bothered to wait. When you're coming home from work, you just want to get home and you can't because of what's happening.\\" \\"You can't get anywhere, can't get home quick enough and it's quite scary. Lots of people bump into you,\\" said Bukky Bello. \\"It's a central place.

Answer:","output":"\\"Roberto Carvalho Cauê\\" is not an immediately recognizable title or name that distinctly fits into any of the given categories. However, upon close analysis, we can infer that it may potentially belong to one of a few categories: 1. Artist or Athlete: \\"Roberto Carvalho Cauê\\" appears to be a personal name, which could indicate that it refers to an individual person. This person might be an artist, such as a musician, painter, or actor, or an athlete, such as a football player, basketball player, or swimmer. It would be necessary to gather more information and context about this individual to determine the specific category and the type of work they are engaged in. 2. Office Holder: If Roberto Carvalho Cauê is an individual person, it's also possible that he is an office holder – perhaps a mayor, legislator, or other public official. In this case, the title would refer to the person's official position and responsibilities. 3. Written Work: In rare cases, \\"Roberto Carvalho Cauê\\" might be the title of a written work – perhaps a book, short story, or essay. Such a title could potentially also be a character's name within the work, or a pseudonym for the author.

Typically, all member universities in a university system share a common component among all of their various names. Usually, all member universities of a university system are governed by a system-wide governing body, such as a board of trustees or a board of regents. In fact, university systems are so common in post-World War II United States that most states have one or two state university systems under which many of their publicly funded universities are aligned, both in name and in governance.

It is an academic discipline and a social science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases. In this field, a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, someespecially clinical and counseling psychologistsat times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a \\"hub science\\", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

Given the question: The two teams took different approaches in reinforcing the highway embankment slopes when building segments of the interstate. Team A led by Chuck relied almost entirely on inspiration and good building materials therefore decreasing slope stability, while team B lead by Mike used nature as an ally by planting tens of thousands of trees and shrubs to prevent slope failures and moderate soil transpiration and evaporation.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which team contributed to strengthening the soil?  Hint: The major effect of transpiration is the reduction of soil pore water pressures which counteracts the loss of strength which occurs through wetting, this is most readily seen as a loss of moisture around trees. However it is not easy to rely on tree and shrub roots to remove water from slopes and consequently help ensure slope stability. The ability to transpire in wet conditions is severely reduced and therefore any increase in soil strength previously gained in evaporation and transpiration will be lost or significantly reduced, consequently the effects of transpiration cannot be taken into account at these times. However it can be assumed that the chance of slope failure following saturation by storm event or periods of extended rainfall will be lessened as a result of transpiration. Moreover, although changes in moisture content will affect the undrained shear strength, the effective shear stress parameters as commonly used in routine slope stability analysis are not directly influenced by changing moisture content, although the water pressures (suctions) used in the analysis will change.[2][3] The answer is:","output":"Team B, led by Mike, contributed to strengthening the soil.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which ice cube will melt faster?  As a science experiment for his school homework, Kendra is putting two ice cubes on separate pans and then putting those pans on burners set to different temperatures. Ice cube A is set on top of a burner set to a low temperature, and ice cube B is placed on a burner set quite a bite higher. One minute later, Kendra begins writing down what she sees happening to the ice cubes.  Hint: For most substances, when the temperature of the solid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a liquid, and when the temperature of the liquid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a gas. We typically visualize a solid as tiny particles in constant motion held together by attractive forces. As we add heat to the solid, the motion, or the kinetic energy, of the particles increases. At some temperature, the motion of the particles becomes great enough to overcome the attractive forces. The thermal energy that was added to the solid up to this point was absorbed by the solid as kinetic energy, increasing the speed of the molecules. The lowest temperature at which the particles are able to exist in the liquid form is called the melting point . Answer:","output":"Ice cube B will melt faster. This is because it is placed on a burner set to a higher temperature compared to the burner for ice cube A. As the temperature of a solid, like an ice cube, increases, the kinetic energy of the particles also increases. When the motion of the particles is strong enough to overcome the attractive forces holding them together, the solid melts and turns into a liquid. In this case, since ice cube B is exposed to a higher temperature, its particles will gain more kinetic energy faster and overcome the attractive forces more quickly, resulting in faster melting compared to ice cube A."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In contrast to the speed of compression, which is proportional to the number of operations required by the algorithm, here latency refers to the number of samples that must be analysed before a block of audio is processed. In the minimum case, latency is zero samples (e.g., if the coder/decoder simply reduces the number of bits used to quantize the signal). Time domain algorithms such as LPC also often have low latencies, hence their popularity in speech coding for telephony. In algorithms such as MP3, however, a large number of samples have to be analyzed to implement a psychoacoustic model in the frequency domain, and latency is on the order of 23 ms (46 ms for two-way communication)).

The process steps themselves are not directly impacted, but the time it takes for each step to occur will be influenced by the decreased rate of erosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences discuss the perceived lack of independence and politicized, opaque decision-making of the CCA as a strong issue. The only difference between the two is the order of the phrases in the sentence. In Sentence 1, the phrase \\"perceived lack of independence and politicized, opaque decision-making\\" is described as a feature of the CCA and is placed in the first part of the sentence. The emphasis is on the CCA's issue. The sentence can be interpreted as: The issue with the CCA is its perceived lack of independence and politicized, opaque decision-making. On the other hand, Sentence 2 focuses on the issue itself and places it in the first part of the sentence. The CCA is mentioned later in the sentence in relation to the issue. The sentence can be interpreted as: The issue of perceived lack of independence and politicized, opaque decision-making is strongly present in the CCA.

Description of the plot: Neutral sentiment (The reviewer simply describes the movie's plot without expressing any strong feeling) 4. Statement about the movie having more of a plot than the Spice Girls movie: Slightly Positive sentiment (While acknowledging that the movie has more of a plot, it still hints at a comparison to the negatively received Spice Girls movie) 5.

If you can appreciate the merits of both, it will probably just annoy you. Answer: A:","output":"Based on the analysis of the given product review, it appears to have a predominantly negative tone. The author has titled their review as \\"Distracting Diatribe,\\" which already indicates a general dissatisfaction or disapproval with the content. Furthermore, the review explicitly highlights some of the key concerns that limit the product's appeal, namely the \\"subtle attacks on Microsoft products throughout the book.\\" This critique points out that the book's focus on discrediting Microsoft products is distracting from its overall message, which is a negative observation. The reviewer then goes on to discuss how the book's content may be perceived by different readers, depending on their affiliations and preferences. For those who are fans of Windows or Microsoft, the author states that they will not find the content enjoyable or agreeable, as it takes a staunchly anti-Microsoft stance. On the other hand, Linux enthusiasts are more likely to appreciate the book's content, as it aligns with their own viewpoints and preferences. This assessment indicates that the review is not entirely negative, as it does find merit in the book for a certain audience - Linux fans. However, the primary issue that seems to drive the reviewer's dissatisfaction is the book's partiality and inability to accommodate readers who have a more balanced perspective on both Microsoft and Linux products. The reviewer explains that those who can appreciate the benefits and drawbacks of each system are likely to be annoyed by the book's one-sided approach. This assertion further reinforces the negative tone of the review, suggesting that the book is not a valuable resource for individuals seeking an unbiased view on the subject matter. In conclusion, the mentioned product review is predominantly negative due to its emphasis on the book's distracting, biased, and potentially irritating content. While the reviewer acknowledges that the book may find favor among those who support Linux products or ideologies, they ultimately critique it for failing to provide a balanced and inclusive viewpoint for those interested in understanding the merits and drawbacks of both Microsoft and Linux products. As a result, the overall impression of the review is negative and, likely, its effect on a potential reader would be discouraging."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What building the architect and owner of Portland's quarries design and build?, using the article: Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645.  In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

Some examples are koi and goldfish. These species tend to grow more slowly and live longer than fish that live in warmer waters, and are generally felt to be easier to keep. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Coldwater fish are generally believed to be easier to keep than tropical fish. Available options: * Yes; * It's impossible to say; * No;","output":"Yes, the next sentence does follow from the preceding text. The text explicitly mentions that \\"Coldwater fish... are generally felt to be easier to keep.\\" This means that they are generally believed to require less maintenance and specific conditions compared to tropical fish, hence confirming that the statement \\"Coldwater fish are generally believed to be easier to keep than tropical fish\\" aligns with the information provided in the initial text.  This belief may be attributed to a number of factors including their slower growth rate and longer lifespan. Slower growth can make them less demanding in terms of food and space requirements, and a longer lifespan can mean that they are less sensitive to diseases and fluctuations in water conditions.  Additionally, coldwater fish are known to tolerate larger temperature variations compared to tropical fish. The optimal temperature for tropical fish is between 24°C and 27°C, whereas coldwater fish can tolerate water temperatures below 20°C. This implies less need for constant water heating and cooling, further adding to the perceived ease of keeping coldwater fish. However, it is also essential to note that the ease of keeping a fish can greatly depend on the specific species, as well as the knowledge and experience of the aquarist. Each species, whether coldwater or tropical, can have unique needs regarding diet, space, social interaction, and specific water parameters such as pH and hardness. Therefore, while the statement does logically follow the initial text, it should not be interpreted as universally true for all cases and situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Identify which answer option should be chosen by analyzing the available options and understanding the context of the initial statement. In the given statement, we're discussing why fewer people prefer to be around Jessica than Cynthia. Answer A states that Jessica liked helping others, while answer B states that Cynthia liked helping others. Step 2: Determine the most logical option based on the context. In this case, it is more logical to choose answer B, since it suggests that people prefer to be around Cynthia because she likes to help others. This would be a valid reason for more people to enjoy her company. Step 3: Continue the story based on the chosen answer. So, the story continues: Less people liked to be around Jessica than around Cynthia because Cynthia liked helping others. Whenever someone needed a helping hand, they knew they could count on Cynthia. She was empathetic, selfless, and genuinely cared about the well-being of others. Over time, Cynthia developed a strong network of friends, all of whom valued her kindness and appreciated the support she offered during tough times. This, in turn, made Jessica feel left out and sad, as she couldn't understand why she wasn't as popular as Cynthia. One day, a mutual friend of theirs approached Jessica and explained the reason behind Cynthia's popularity. Jessica realized that she needed to make an effort to help others just as Cynthia did, not for the sake of being liked, but because it was the right thing to do. From that day forward, she started volunteering at her local community center, lending an ear to friends in need, and being more proactive in lending a helping hand. As Jessica started helping others, people began to appreciate her kindness as well, and her circle of friends expanded. While Cynthia and Jessica still had their differences, they both understood the importance of supporting others and bonded over their shared experiences in lifting up their friends and community."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Which village made less money from sand mining?  Two coastal Canadian towns, Hammond and Soundville decided to start sand mining to bring more money to their budgets. A few months later however, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations and find other sources of income. they wanted to protect the environment.  Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","output":"Based on the paragraph provided, the village that made less money from sand mining is Hammond. This deduction can be made from the statement which says, \\"A few months later, however, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations and find other sources of income.\\" Hammond ceased its sand mining activities and pursued alternative revenue sources to protect the environment, thus making less money from sand mining compared to Soundville, which presumably continued its sand mining activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, subtract 9f from both sides of the equation. This will help eliminate the f term from one side of the equation and keep the equation balanced.  10f - 9f = 9f + 1 - 9f Step 3: Simplify the equation. Now, perform the subtraction on both sides of the equation. (10 - 9)f = 1 1f = 1 Step 4: Solve for f.

There is at least one good reason for the desire to be attractive: beauty is power.Studies suggest that good-looking people make more money,get called on more often in class,and are regarded as friendlier. But what exactly is beauty? It's difficult to describe it clearly,and yet we know it when we see it.And our awareness of it may start at a very early age.In one set of studies,six-month-old babies were shown a series of photographs.The faces on the pictures had been rated for attractiveness by a group of college students.In the studies,the babies spent more time looking at the attractive faces than the unattractive ones. The idea that even babies can judge appearance makes perfect sense to many researchers.In studies by psychologists,men consistently showed a preference for women with larger eyes,fuller lips,and a smaller nose and chin while women prefer men with large shoulders and a narrow waist.According to scientists,the mind unconsciously tells men and women that these traits--the full lips,clear skin,strong shoulders--equal health and genetic well-being. Not everyone thinks the same way,however.\\"Our hardwiredness can be changed by all sorts of expectations--mostly cultural,\\" says C.Loring Brace,an anthropologist at the University of Michigan.What is considered attractive in one culture might not be in another.Look at most Western fashion magazines: the women on the pages are thin.But is this \\"perfect\\" body type for women worldwide?

Does it follow that \\"The country did well during the Waza dynasty.\\"? Pick from: I. yes II. it is not possible to tell III. no","output":"II. it is not possible to tell While it is true that three successive elected kings emerged from the Waza dynasty of Sweden, this alone is not enough to determine if the country did well during their reign. To reach that conclusion, one must examine many factors that contributed to the overall well-being of Sweden during the Waza dynasty, such as the political, social, and economic conditions during their reign. First, it is essential to consider the stability of the government and the effectiveness of the kings in leading their nation. Successive rule by monarchs from the same dynasty can indicate political stability, but it does not necessarily mean these kings were strong, effective leaders in managing the country's administration and ensuring the people's welfare. It is possible that their reign saw significant internal conflict, upheaval, or even poor policy decisions. Secondly, examining the social conditions in Sweden during the Waza dynasty is crucial in determining the country's well-being. Factors such as social inequality, education, and overall living conditions can all contribute to understanding how the population fared during the reign of these three kings. Assessing the social improvement of the majority of the population will provide insight into the quality of life experienced during this era. Economically, the prosperity of Sweden during the Waza dynasty should also be considered to determine if the country did well. This includes analyzing trade, agriculture, industry, and foreign relations, among others. Economic success is essential for a nation's well-being as it impacts various sectors like education, health, and infrastructure, ultimately influencing the population's overall quality of life. In summary, while three successive elected kings from the Waza dynasty may hint at political stability, determining if the country did well during their reign requires thorough analysis of the political, social, and economic conditions in Sweden at the time. Without considering these aspects, it is not possible to conclusively state whether the country did well during the Waza dynasty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person that the sister of the autistic boy throws into the lake?  Tim Warden, a boy with autism, has supposedly witnessed his parents' double murder. Jake Rainer, a former child psychiatrist turned therapist, is called on to probe the child's mind in order to solve the case. The psychological drama is provided by the fact that not even Jake can entice Tim to communicate what he has or has not seen regarding the crime. Tim's sister, Sylvie, is protective of him. She eventually warms to Jake's efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the suicide of another young child who was under his care. Jake gradually befriends Tim. At first, Jake thinks that Tim is trying to communicate by cutting up playing cards, but Sylvie reveals that Tim is good at mimicking voices. Jake is able to trigger Tim's memory so that Tim mimics the voices he heard on the night of the murder by using the trigger phrase \\"God Damn,\\" which were the first words Tim heard from the murder. He attempts to piece together the chronology of the murder, suspecting that Tim interrupted a fight between his parents and an intruder. Sheriff Mitch Rivers threatens to use drugs to get Tim to talk about the murder and Dr. Rene Harlinger successfully hypnotizes Tim into breaking down a locked door. The police chief, seeing this as proof of Tim's strength, concludes that Tim was the murderer, after finding photographs showing that Tim's father was molesting him. That night, Sylvie plans to take Tim away and attempts to convince Jake to run away with them. She fails, and instead paralyzes Jake and throws him into an icy lake to drown him. Tim mimics the police chief's voice over the phone to lure Sylvie to the police station and pulls Jake out of the lake while she is away.

However, as May progressed they began to see bear tracks, and by the end of the month seals, gulls and whales were plentiful. By Nansen's calculations, they had reached 82°21′N on 31 May, placing them only 50 nautical miles (93 km; 58 mi) from Cape Fligely at the northern extremity of Franz Josef Land, if his longitude estimate was accurate. In the warmer weather the ice began to break up, making travel more difficult. Since 24 April dogs had been killed at regular intervals to feed the others, and by the beginning of June only seven of the original 28 remained.  On 21 June the pair jettisoned all surplus equipment and supplies, planning to travel light and live off the now plentiful supplies of seal and birds. After a day's travel in this manner they decided to rest on a floe, waterproof the kayaks and build up their own strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained camped on the floe for a whole month.On 23 July, the day after leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: \\"At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!\\" In the succeeding days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although by the end of July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.Nansen called this first land \\"Hvidtenland\\" (\\"White Island\\").

Summarize this article in one sentence. The claim: Leaving the customs union and striking trade agreements would result in 400,000 new jobs being created. Reality Check verdict: We know nothing about the post-Brexit trade deals that will be done and the 400,000 figure ignores the effect on jobs of increased imports, as well as any effects on trade from leaving the EU. The EU customs union is the area over which goods can move without needing customs checks. It is not the same as the single market - Norway, for example, has access to the single market, but is not part of the customs union and can set its own external tariffs. This debate is important because it is possible that the UK could leave the EU and the single market but still be part of the customs union, which would make it simpler to trade with other European countries but would limit the UK's freedom to make trade deals with the rest of the world. What matters is not only how many new jobs are created, but also the overall effect on jobs. Assuming trade deals with other countries would create jobs, we must also take into account the jobs that would be lost by abandoning the UK's existing free trade deal with the EU and with other countries via the EU. Similarly, we need to look both at the number of jobs that would be created by increasing exports as a result of trade deals and how many would be lost by increased imports under those same deals. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King's College London, told BBC Radio 4: \\"There are costs and benefits and simply counting the benefits without counting the costs is just nonsense.\\" Let's take a look at where the 400,000 figure comes from. Change Britain started from a 2012 European Commission report that investigated how much EU exports would increase if free trade deals were done with six countries (USA, Canada, Japan, South Korea, India and China) and two trading blocs (ASEAN and Mercosur). The first thing to say is that the EU already has a trade deal with South Korea, so the UK is already experiencing the effects of that deal. The key part of this is the conversion from additional exports to additional jobs - this comes from another European Commission report, which found that between 2000 and 2007, three million jobs were created by additional exports outside the EU, at a conversion rate of 16.7 workers per million euros (Â£850,000) worth of extra exports. Taking the experience of the entire EU between 2000 and 2007 and projecting it onto the UK post-Brexit from 2019 onwards, makes very little sense. But this in itself gives too much credence to the use of the Commission's estimates when we do not know how long it would take to reach deals or the terms on which they would be agreed.

Both sentences convey the same overall idea and meaning, but they use slightly different structures and wording to do so.

Sentence 1: \\"Whether classical users know that they are modern or not , does not matter.\\" In this sentence, the writer begins with the conditional phrase \\"Whether classical users know that they are modern or not\\" and follows it with the negation \\"does not matter.\\" This structure emphasizes the element of uncertainty and downplays the importance of the classical users' awareness of their modernity. 2.

Although the positioning of the elements within the sentence has changed, the meaning remains the same. It is worth noting that the word \\"match\\" in Sentence 2 seems to be a typo and should be removed for the sentence to make sense.

The answer to the question: What are the names of the performers who were prevented from preforming songs they had submitted? is inside the article: SVT selects performers for the entries. Artists who perform the demo of a song automatically enter the competition; they must perform their songs if suitable alternate performers cannot be found. The artists' songs risk disqualification if they refuse. In the past, this rule led to the disqualification of, among others, Carola's \\"När löven faller\\" in 2003 and Stephen Simmonds's \\"So Good\\" in 2006. SVT may also give songs to other performers without considering the interests of the demo artist. This prevented the Brandsta City Släckers (in 2004) and Pernilla Wahlgren (in 2005) from performing the songs they had submitted. Replacements for disqualified songs fare unpredictably at the competition. In 2006, \\"Naughty Boy\\" by Hannah Graaf (the replacement for Simmonds' song) finished second to last in its semi-final. In 2002 and 2007, by contrast, the replacements performed by Jan Johansen and Måns Zelmerlöw reached the final ten. The contestants that will perform the twenty-eight qualifiers from the preselection are announced in late November. Singer-songwriters are common. As such, artists often confirm that they will participate before the official announcement. The wildcard (joker) system was introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured. Four artists, one in each semi-final, were invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules.

The leader of the expedition is beheaded before their eyes.Unwilling to bear the guilt of his men's death, Marcus leads the best of his men out of the fort. Using their shields and proven Roman infantry battle tactics, they push back the Celts and defend the prisoners. They have started moving back to the fort when the Druid summons his chariots, which race forward with scythes on the wheels and hack down the retreating men. Marcus grabs a spear, steadies his aim, and launches it toward the Druid. The spear kills the driver, causing the chariot to topple onto Marcus.With his leg badly injured, Marcus is sent to his Uncle (Donald Sutherland)'s house to recover. His captain informs him that Rome has learned of his actions: Marcus has been given an honourable mention for leading his men in a courageous fight to defend the fort, but due to his injury, he has been given an honourable discharge from the Army.Marcus is distraught.

Get ready: Ask an adult to help you with this. You'll need some chicken wings, cooking oil, your favorite seasoning or sauce, a big bowl, and a baking sheet or frying pan. 2. Clean the wings: Make sure to wash your chicken wings under cold water. This helps get rid of any yucky bits. Then, pat them dry with a paper towel. 3. Season the wings: Put the chicken wings in a big bowl and add your favorite seasoning or sauce. Mix them around until the wings are all covered with yummy flavors. You can use salt, pepper, and garlic powder for a simple taste, or something like barbecue sauce for a fun, picnic taste. 4. Cook the wings: Now, you have two options: baking or frying. For baking, set your oven to 375°F (190°C) and let it warm up. Put the wings on a baking sheet in a single layer, and bake for about 45 minutes or until they're crispy and golden brown. For frying, fill a frying pan with cooking oil and heat it up on the stove over medium heat. Carefully place the wings in the oil, and fry them for about 10 minutes each side or until they're crispy and golden brown. Make sure an adult helps you with this part, as the hot oil can be dangerous. 5. Cool and enjoy: Let your chicken wings cool down for a few minutes, so you don't burn your fingers or mouth.

The passage advises on waiting until the evening, specifically when the chickens have entered the roost for the night, before applying any covering. This is because the temperature will be lowest during the overnight, making the chickens more susceptible to frostbite. Considering this information, while the text itself does not state keeping better control over your birds, so they won't cause trouble, taking care of the chickens by applying appropriate covering material and waiting for the right time does imply that you would have better control and protect them from potential harm due to extreme temperatures.

NEW: Adopted Sandusky son disappointed by his parents' smearing of his character, lawyers say. Article:","output":"Title: Sanduskys' Letters to Judge Backfire, Leading to Maximum Punishment Introduction: In a recent turn of events, Jerry and Dottie Sandusky attempted to portray themselves as virtuous victims in letters sent to the judge presiding over their case. Rather than eliciting sympathy, the letters ended up sealing their fate by guaranteeing maximum punishment. Legal observers weigh in on the situation, pointing out the importance of asking for mercy during sentencing instead of attacking others. The adopted son of the Sanduskys has also expressed disappointment over his parents' smearing of his character. Paragraph 1: The Sanduskys, in their bid to paint themselves as martyrs in their legal battle, took the unwise decision to pen letters to the judge. These letters, instead of highlighting their remorse or asking for leniency, aggressively attacked others involved in the trial. Legal experts opine that this move all but guaranteed a maximum punishment, as sentencing is typically a time for defendants to express humility and seek mercy, not to lash out at others. Paragraph 2: An anonymous legal observer explained that \\"sentencing is a time to ask for mercy, not to attack others\\". The expert went on to say that by choosing to assail those involved in their case, the Sanduskys essentially shot themselves in the foot, leaving the judge with little choice but to deliver the harshest possible sentence. Defendants who show genuine remorse and ask for forgiveness have a better chance at earning some leniency. Paragraph 3: The letters also had a negative impact on the Sanduskys' family dynamics, as their adopted son expressed disappointment upon discovering the smearing of his character by his own parents. Lawyers representing the adopted son remarked that he had hoped for a different outcome and now feels deeply hurt by his parents' actions. This further supports the notion that attacking others during sentencing is a counterproductive strategy that only serves to harm one's case. Conclusion: In a misguided attempt to garner sympathy, the Sanduskys' letters to the judge have had the opposite effect, ensuring maximum punishment and damaging familial bonds. Future defendants facing sentencing would be wise to heed the advice of legal experts and choose a path of humility, remorse, and a plea for mercy instead of attacking those around them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which island displayed fewer seismic waves?  A team of geologists studied two islands. Large island had a lot of seismic activity, and Small island that presented almost no seismic activity.  Hint: Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior. Answer:","output":"Based on the paragraph provided, it's clear that the Small Island displayed fewer seismic waves. Geologists usually study seismic waves to understand the dynamics within the Earth's interior. These seismic waves are energy waves generated due to earthquakes. The waves usually go at different speeds when they traverse through different materials and change their speed as they shift from one type of material to another, which in turn leads to them bending. There are, however, certain types of seismic waves which cannot travel through liquids or gases; they simply cease their propagation.  In the context provided, a team of geologists has surveyed two islands: Large Island and Small Island. The Large Island witnessed significant seismic activity, implying that many seismic waves were generated and subsequently studied by the geologists. Conversely, the Small Island presented almost no seismic activity. The term 'seismic activity' is synonymous with the occurrence of earthquakes or miniature earth vibrations, which generate seismic waves. The lack of or 'almost no' seismic activity on Small Island would infer that fewer seismic waves were generated in that location, limiting the geologists' ability to study them extensively. In conclusion, Small Island displayed fewer seismic waves compared to Large Island, as per the evidence provided, which led to a decrease in the seismic activity which can be studied by the team of geologists."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Article: My name is Lucy Smith.Lucy is my first name.Smith is my last name.I'm 13.My favorite color is purple.I'm in No.1 Middle School.I'm in Class2,Grade 7.

A father-of-four from Chepstow in south Wales has become a real-life man who would be king after he was crowned 'King Bazza' to head a tribe in India. English-born Barry Watson, 60, has been given the lofty title by the Yanadi tribe, from Andhra Pradesh, India, who have named a new village after him - Barrypuram. The charity worker and father-of-four, who runs social media company Let Us Be Social, helped rescue the villagers from life on a rubbish tip. Barry Watson, from Chepstow, has become a real-life man who would be king after he was crowned King Bazza to head a tribe in India. Mr Watson, who runs social media company Let Us Be Social, helped rescue the villagers from life on a rubbish tip. He paid £20,000 for land for farmers to construct 31 huts with lighting, install water pumps, a chicken farm, a school and church. The fascinating project began by chance, when ex-insurance broker Mr Watson met Julie Davies, who runs her own Indian village support charity in memory of her 16-year-old daughter, at a meeting. In the 1975 film The Man Who Would be King starring Sean Connery and Michael Caine - Connery's character Danny is crowned leader of a fictional tribe on the Indian sub-continent in a case of mistaken identity. Things soon turn sour however when Danny is found out and killed but unlike the film Barry's 'royal' reign is having a happier ending. He said: 'I love my name King Bazza, I am their guard. I wanted to give them a better life without the trappings of Western civilization, keeping their own cultures. 'On the tip they had nothing, their life expectancy was only about 40.' Mr Watson was inspired by the Elizabeth-Ann charity, so he travelled with the Davies family overseas to see how he could help. The 60-year-old has been given the lofty title by the Yanadi tribe, from Andhra Pradesh, India, who have named a new village after him. Mr Watson is now trying to make the village sustainable, training 16 women to sew for a business and making the buildings more permanent out of stone. As the entrepreneur felt as they were doing an amazing job in Burlavaripalem, he discovered another sector of the community, the Yanadi tribe, could benefit from similar work. Mr Watson founded his charity Help the Village in 2009, a branch of Elizabeth-Ann, and raised funds partly from a trip in Mini cars to France the year after. Since then, the father to twins Kate and Zola, 29, Zak, 23 and Luke, 19, has achieved notable milestones in building the village. Mr Watson, pictured here with members of the community, founded his charity Help the Village in 2009. Mr Watson, at his home in Chepstow, south Wales, with a picture of the Indian tribe. King Bazza on his way to Barrypuram, where the villagers he rescued from a rubbish tip now live. Two months ago, he and 15 others flew to Chennai and rode on rickshaws to Barrypuram, raising £10,000 for locals. The Chepstow businessman is now tasked with making the village sustainable, training 16 women to sew for a business and making the buildings more permanent out of stone. He said: 'India is like Marmite, you love it or hate it. I love the chaos, it's totally different to anything else I have done. Once it's in your blood you have to go back.' Local children the Yanadi in the village in Andhra Pradesh, India. Villagers lived in small huts like this before Barry Watson raised money for construction. Children play on a swing surrounded by rubbish at their former home. Mr Watson said his Indian odyssey actually began in the 1970s when he used take 'hippie' friends to Kathmandu, Nepal, aged 21 as a 'public school idiot' in his own words. Mr Watson said: 'I first went to India as a public school idiot who didn't have a job and saw an advert for overland drivers wanted to go to India, so I applied and they said \\"you're going in a week\\". 'Three years later I came home and vowed I would never return to India until I had a real purpose to go back for. Things turned sour for Sean Connery's character Danny in the 1975 film The Man Who Would Be King. 'Forty years later that purpose happened, when I met a fantastic woman called Julie Davies and she wanted me to go to India with her. When I saw what she had done with one village I told her I wanted to do the same.' Mr Watson said when he first met the Yanadi tribe he was told he was expected. He said: 'They said there was an ancient prophecy one day a white man would come and build them a village. 'It really was I was like Sean Connery and the man who would be king, when I said I was going to build them a village, about half believed me and half didn't.' 'The main man behind all this has been Vinay Kumar who has been able to make everything happen, I couldn't have done it without him.' Mr Watson, who lives with wife Shirley, 47, said in November and December they were returning to the village again to continue the good work. He said: 'We have no aspirations to be a national charity, we just want to help this village, my wife was not too sure at first and said she wouldn't go back after the first visit. 'But now she's coming in December, once you've been to India it's in your blood.'","output":"- Barry Watson, a father-of-four from Chepstow, UK, has been crowned \\"King Bazza\\" by the Yanadi tribe in Andhra Pradesh, India. - Watson, who runs social media company Let Us Be Social, helped rescue tribe members from life on a rubbish tip and provided funds for land, huts, water pumps, and other facilities. - The village has been named Barrypuram in his honor, and Watson is working to make it sustainable through training and business initiatives. - Watson founded the charity Help the Village in 2009, which is a branch of the Elizabeth-Ann charity, and has since achieved numerous milestones in building the village."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Ocean waves hit land - Ocean water pulls sand off of beaches - Ocean water breaks rocks off of cliffs - Ocean water carries sand and rocks into the ocean - Sand and rocks go to other land or the bottom of the ocean.  Question: suppose an underwater earthquake occurs happens, how will it affect ocean waves are smaller.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"An underwater earthquake, also known as a submarine earthquake, is a seismic event that occurs beneath the seafloor and can have significant effects on the surrounding environment, especially on the behavior of ocean waves. The disturbance caused by the underwater earthquake can generate a series of waves which can travel vast distances across the ocean and may even trigger the formation of tsunamis. In this situation, the correlation between ocean waves hitting land, ocean water pulling sand off beaches, and the subsequent processes should be carefully examined to determine how the underwater earthquake might indirectly impact the second effect mentioned. When an underwater earthquake occurs, the sudden release of energy causes the seafloor to move, displacing a substantial volume of water in the process. This results in the formation of primary waves, or P-waves, and secondary waves, also known as S-waves, which propagate through the water in multiple directions. As these waves interact with the surrounding environment, their characteristics, such as amplitude and frequency, may be altered. In some cases, this can lead to an increase in wave height, which can potentially result in larger ocean waves reaching the coast. Assuming an underwater earthquake causes ocean waves to become larger, it might have a more significant effect on the second impact mentioned – that of ocean water pulling sand off beaches. Specifically, larger ocean waves carry greater energy and force when they crash into the shoreline. This increased energy can effectively erode, transport, and deposit sand and rocks, leading to more significant beach sediment removal than smaller waves. Consequently, the overall process of ocean water breaking rocks off cliffs and carrying sand and rocks into the ocean may be intensified. However, it is crucial to note that not all underwater earthquakes will result in larger ocean waves or generate tsunamis. The impact of a submarine earthquake on coastal areas can vary depending on its magnitude, location, depth, and the unique geological features of the region. Therefore, while it is possible that an underwater earthquake might have a more significant effect on the second impact mentioned, it cannot be definitively stated that this will occur in every situation. In summary, an underwater earthquake has the potential to create larger ocean waves by instigating a complex series of seismic and hydrodynamic processes. These larger waves can, in turn, exert more force on the shoreline, leading to increased sand and rock removal from beaches. Therefore, an underwater earthquake may have a more significant impact on the second effect mentioned, depending on its specific characteristics and the factors influencing its propagation throughout the ocean."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

Bradley Manning an idealist who became disillusioned by what was being done in Iraq and elsewhere in the name of U.S. national interests, as the attorney for the former Army intelligence analyst has argued? Or is he, as the prosecution contends, a traitor who leaked classified material to WikiLeaks that he knew could assist terrorists? The formal answers to those questions, at least, will come in the anticipated verdict by a military judge, who will decide Manning's guilt or innocence in a case that has been described as the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history. But, according to court documents and testimony, by the time the world saw the video,","output":"Manning had already grappled with a deep internal conflict over his actions. As someone entrusted with access to classified information, he had witnessed incidents that troubled him and made him question the U.S. military's conduct in Iraq and other areas. He felt compelled to share this information with the public, believing that shining a light on these events could lead to reform and potentially save lives. On the other hand, those arguing against Manning assert that by leaking sensitive documents, he put the lives of U.S. military personnel and allies at risk, as well as potentially jeopardizing national security. They maintain that his actions were motivated not by moral principles, but by a desire to harm the United States and aid its enemies. The case has sparked intense debate about whistle-blowing, government secrecy, and the balance between personal conscience and national security. Some view Manning as a courageous figure akin to Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers, while others see him as a reckless individual who acted irresponsibly. Ultimately, the military judge will weigh the evidence and testimony presented in the trial, seeking to determine whether Manning's actions were driven by idealism or malicious intent. The verdict is likely to have implications not only for Manning's future but also for the broader conversation about the role of whistle-blowers and the boundaries of government transparency. Regardless of the outcome, the Manning case has made a lasting impact on public discourse and may influence future policy and legislation around these critical issues."},{"instruction":"David is interested in how electricity works. One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   If the potential energy between charge A and charge B increases, are they closer or farther?  Hint: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. Answer:","output":"Farther"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Allsion helped Ash to narrow his choices of Colleges he would apply to.  Given the question \\"What will Addison want to do next?\\", is \\"visit colleges alone\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","output":"Yes, \\"visit colleges alone\\" can be a valid answer for what Addison might want to do next after helping Ash narrow down his choices of colleges. However, this response requires some context and an understanding of the motivations and desires of both individuals involved in the situation. Allison and Ash have worked together in the process of narrowing down Ash's college options, indicating that Allison might have some interest in the matter or may simply be a good friend willing to offer her support. It is possible that Addison might have her own reasons and preferences for exploring college options, even if she isn't necessarily applying to those colleges herself. For instance, she might want to gain more knowledge about what various colleges have to offer or use the experience to make better-informed decisions regarding her own future education endeavours. Visiting colleges alone could allow Addison to freely explore her interests and gather information independently, without the influence of Ash or other companions. This might provide her with a more genuine and unbiased perspective of the various colleges and enable her to make her own determinations about their offerings and suitability for her goals. On the other hand, Addison might not want to visit colleges alone due to a variety of reasons. These can include the desire for companionship and support from friends or family during the process, the safety concerns associated with travelling to unfamiliar locations, or a preference for visiting colleges as part of a larger group guided by a representative of the college. In summary, \\"visit colleges alone\\" is a valid answer to the question of what Addison might want to do next after helping Ash narrow down his college options, but the decision ultimately depends on Addison's individual motivations, desires, and comfort levels. It would be helpful to gather more information about Addison and her personal goals before confirming the validity of this response in the given context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can people actively control their emotions? How should I control my emotion? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The first two questions you posed, \\"Can people actively control their emotions?\\" and \\"How should I control my emotion?\\", are related but not identical. They deal with different aspects of the same general topic, which is emotion control. The first is asking whether such control is possible, while the second is seeking advice on how to exert control. To answer the first question, yes, people can actively control their emotions, to a certain extent. This ability is also known as emotional regulation. It's a complex process that involves several different strategies, including: 1. **Cognitive Reappraisal:** Changing the way you think about a situation in order to alter its emotional impact. For example, if you're stuck in traffic, instead of getting frustrated about the delay, you might remind yourself that it's an opportunity to listen to more of your audiobook. 2. **Expressive Suppression:** Making a conscious effort to hide your emotional responses, especially in a social context. For instance, not showing anger or disappointment even if you feel it. 3. **Situation Selection:** Deliberately choosing to place yourself in situations that will provoke desired emotions, and avoiding those that will provoke undesired ones. For example, if you know that certain locations or events trigger negative emotions, you might decide not to go there or attend them. 4. **Distraction:** When you're feeling emotional, distract yourself by doing other tasks you love to get your mind off the negative emotion. To answer the second question, \\"how should I control my emotion?,\\" different strategies work for different people. Some may find distraction effective, whereas others may prefer cognitive reappraisal. The efficacy of these techniques might also depend on the specific emotional experiences and psychological traits of the individual. In general, though, some common strategies include: 1. **Mindfulness:** Cultivating an awareness of your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations in the present moment can help distance you from intense emotional reactions.  2. **Deep Breathing:** This can help calm your body's stress response and make it easier to think clearly about your emotions. 3. **Journaling:** Writing about your feelings can help clarify them and make them less overwhelming. 4. **Physical Activity:** Exercise and other physical activities can help reduce feelings of anxiety and improve mood. 5. **Healthy Sleep and Eating Habits:** Physical health is closely tied with emotional health, so taking care of your body can help regulate your emotions. Additionally, professional help from therapists or psychologists can help you enhance your emotional regulation capabilities. This can be particularly beneficial if you find it hard to manage your emotions on your own. Concerning your third question, \\"Do those questions have the same meaning?\\", no, they do not have the exact same meaning. As mentioned earlier, the first question alludes to the capability of controlling emotions, while the second seeks practical methods on doing so. While they are similar in their focus on emotional control, they address different aspects of the larger topic and therefore, are not the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He successfully used these metal-cylinder rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2 km (1 mi) range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.According to Stephen Oliver Fought and John F. Guilmartin, Jr. in Encyclopædia Britannica (2008):  Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Tipu Sultan, continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.\\", can you guess it ?

Flo Rida's debut studio album, 2008's Mail on Sunday, reached number four in the US. The album was succeeded by R.O.O.T.S., the next year. Flo Rida was born as Tramar Lacel Dillard in Carol City, Florida, on September 17, 1979. His parents raised him and his seven sisters together, some of whom sang in a local gospel group. His brother-in-law was a hype man for local rap group 2 Live Crew, and while in ninth grade, Flo Rida joined an amateur rap group called the GroundHoggz. The GroundHoggz had been a three-man group, with members who lived in the same apartment complex as Flo Rida. They started recording at underground studios in Carver Ranches. The GroundHoggz, in this four-man incarnation, remained together for eight years.  While performing, Fresh Kid Ice of 2 Live Crew took notice and asked him to be his hype man, a shortly after he took him for a show in Hawaii. They developed a long lasting friendship, Flo Rida considers this period as his schooling. He would often bring his group around when performing with him. They were eventually all invited as featured guests on Fresh Kid Ice's fourth album Freaky Chinese (2004).  Flo Rida's work with 2 Live Crew member Fresh Kid Ice, attracted the attention of DeVante Swing, a member of the band Jodeci. However, he was rejected by several of the major labels, so he sought many other jobs outside of music. After graduating from high school in 1998, he studied international business management at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for two months and attended Barry University for two months. He returned to Florida to continue pursuing his music career after receiving a phone call from a representative of the independent label Poe Boy Entertainment.  Flo Rida signed with Hot Boyz, in 2000 and with Poe Boy, in 2004 and began affiliating himself for Cash Money with other Southern hip hop artists, such as Rick Ross, Trina, T-Pain, and Trick Daddy.

How do you do this: How can I make my own chip clips at home?","output":"Creating your own chip clips at home can be an easy and fun activity. You can utilize common, household items that you have lying around, and in the end, you can have unique chip clips that add a personal touch to your kitchen. Here are several methods of creating chip clips from various materials: 1. Clothespins: You can use clothespins as a chip clip. Decorate them with paint, markers, stickers, or washi tape to add a personal touch. Here's a simple process of making these:     - Grab a clothespin.     - Decorate the clothespin as you desire. This could be as simple as coloring it in with a marker, or painting intricate designs on it. If you're using paints, wait for it to dry.     - Voila! You've created a chip clip. Simply clamp the clothespin on the open end of your chip bag to seal it. 2. Binder Clips: These are commonly found in offices, but they make excellent chip clips, and they don't need any modification. If you want to customize them:     - Take a binder clip and some washi tape or decorative duct tape.     - Cut a piece of tape long enough to wrap around both sides of the binder clip.      - Wrap the tape around the binder clip, ensuring it is smooth and without bubbles. Trim any excess tape with scissors.     - Use the binder clip to seal your chip bags. The wire handles can be folded flat against the bag for an even tighter seal. 3. DIY Plastic Chip Clips: These are made from plastic hangers that have clips attached to them for holding pants or skirts.     - Cut each clip off the hanger using a hacksaw or a similar tool.     - Smooth any rough edges with sandpaper.     - Decorate your new clips with paint, markers, or stickers, and let them dry before using. 4. Bottle Cap Clips: Take a plastic soda bottle cap, and a piece of sturdy plastic or metal that’s thin and flexible enough to suit your purpose.

A:","output":"A: The first actor to win an Academy Award (Oscar) for a non-English speaking role was Sophia Loren in the 1961 film \\"Two Women\\" (La Ciociara). Sophia Loren, an Italian actress, won the Best Actress Oscar for her powerful portrayal of Cesira, a widow and mother struggling to protect her daughter during World War II. The film, directed by Vittorio De Sica and based on the novel by Alberto Moravia, was a groundbreaking and significant achievement in the history of world cinema. Born Sofia Villani Scicolone in Rome on September 20, 1934, Sophia Loren began her career as a beauty queen and then started acting in small roles in Italian films. Over time, she grew to be one of Italy's most accomplished and internationally recognized actresses. Loren's compelling performance in \\"Two Women\\" not only established her as a serious and versatile actress but also made her the first person to win an acting Oscar for a foreign language film, in this case, Italian. Loren's victory as the first actress to win an Oscar for a non-English speaking role demonstrated the Academy's willingness to acknowledge and honor international talents who may not have come from Hollywood or the traditional American film industry. This recognition paved the way for future award wins and nominations for actors and actresses in foreign language films, further validating international and diverse voices in cinema. Over time, this has led to a more inclusive and representative Oscars ceremony, celebrating human stories from different corners of the world. Following Sophia Loren's groundbreaking win, a number of actors and actresses have received Oscars for their non-English-speaking roles. Some notable examples include: 1. Roberto Benigni, who won Best Actor for his role in the Italian film \\"Life Is Beautiful\\" (La vita è bella) in 1998. 2. Penélope Cruz, who won Best Supporting Actress for her role in the Spanish film \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" in 2008. 3. Christoph Waltz, who won Best Supporting Actor for his role in the German film \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" in 2009. 4. Marion Cotillard, who won Best Actress for her role in the French film \\"La Vie en rose\\" in 2007. Sophia Loren's landmark victory in 1961 set a precedent for recognizing non-English speaking performances, reflecting the diversity, depth, and rich cultural tapestry of international cinema."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This is a depressingly shallow, naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly improbable relationship between Brooks' psychotic film editor and Harold, his vapid girlfriend. The two have ZERO chemistry together - primarily because Harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking pretty at this stage of her career; but also because Brooks' character is neither interesting nor likeable. There are 15 static, excruciating minutes at the beginning where Brooks, having just broke up with Harold, stumbles about his apartment in a depressed, drugged out state - unbearable.

There is hardly anything going on on the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What tv show did Sarah Price direct that Will Finn did not?","output":"Sarah Price is a director known for her work in documentary filmmaking, while Will Finn is an animator and director predominantly known for his work in animated films. Due to the rather distinct nature of their careers, determining a specific TV show that Sarah Price directed but Will Finn did not requires looking into their individual works. Sarah Price's most notable TV show works include her contributions as a director for the documentary series \\"American Movie\\" (1999) and \\"Grey Gardens\\" (2001). These both focus on real-life subject matter and characters, showcasing her aptitude for documentary filmmaking.  \\"American Movie\\" is a documentary that follows aspiring filmmaker Mark Borchardt as he struggles to complete his horror film, 'Coven’. The documentary highlights the dedication and passion behind independent filmmaking, capturing the various hurdles and challenges that Mark faces in realizing his dream. \\"Grey Gardens\\" is another documentary directed by Price that features the lives of two reclusive women, a mother and daughter, both named Edith Beale. It gives an intimate look into their lives as they reside in a decaying East Hampton mansion named Gray Gardens. The documentary captures their unique personalities, showing their relationship and their eccentric lifestyles. Will Finn, on the other hand, has been involved primarily in the animation industry, working as an animator for Disney and later transitioning to directing roles in animated films. His directorial projects include \\"The Road to El Dorado\\" (2000), \\"Home on the Range\\" (2004), and \\"Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return\\" (2013).

Add spaces: SignalsflowingfromtheEpigenometotheGenome,firstreceivedfromtheLifestylebox,areamixtureofgoodandbad,sothisarrowisalsoyellow.","output":"The sentence \\"SignalsflowingfromtheEpigenometotheGenome,firstreceivedfromtheLifestylebox,areamixtureofgoodandbad,sothisarrowisalsoyellow\\" could be rephrased with spaces to improve readability as follows: \\"Signals flowing from the Epigenome to the Genome, first received from the Lifestyle box, are a mixture of good and bad, so this arrow is also yellow.\\" Here is a more detailed explanation and context around this sentence: In the wide and complex field of genetic science, significant attention is paid towards the relationship between the genome and the epigenome. The genome refers to the overall genetic material or the DNA in an organism, including humans. It contains the hereditary information encoded in genes. On the other hand, the epigenome is a multitude of chemical compounds that inform the genome what to do. The epigenome can switch genes on or off and determine which proteins are transcribed. They're like the body's software that directs the genome's hardware. They can be affected by various lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, stress and other important aspects of our behavior and environment. Often, these 'signals' flowing from the epigenome to the genome, are first received from 'the Lifestyle box' which is a metaphorical term that can stand for the different environmental factors and lifestyle choices an individual makes. For instance, if the lifestyle is filled with positive habits like balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management, then the signals received by the genome from the epigenome are beneficial and promote overall well-being. On the contrary, if this 'lifestyle box' contains unhealthy habits like poor diet, lack of exercise, and chronic stress, these signals could negatively impact our genetic expression and lead to different diseases. Therefore, the signals received are a mixture of good and bad, depending on the individual's lifestyle and environmental circumstances.  The last part of the sentence, \\"So this arrow is also yellow\\", is presumably a reference used in a model, chart or diagram where different types of signals are being represented with different color codes.

When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.  and the situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions.

News article: How do you say “hot rod” in German? 2015 Mercedes-AMG C63 boasts up to 503-hp You may not be able to tell the difference from a regular C-Class at a quick glance, but the three-pointed-star’s new hot sports sedan is a completely different animal. After years of success and international recognition, Mercedes’ in-house performance division finally gets a headline act. All future AMG products drop the badge as an afterthought, and will be sold as Mercedes-AMG products. For 2015, the luxurious entry-level super sedan gets a new name, a new suit, and a new heart. The 2015 Mercedes-AMG C63 features the same twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 powerhouse that can be found in the sultry new GT revealed just a few weeks ago. That means that the C63 makes 469-hp and 479 lb.-ft. of torque in base form, capable of pushing the curvy German to 60-mph in only 4 seconds. But wait, there’s more! If you opt for the C63 S, you get a whopping 503-hp and 516 lb.-ft. of torque, and shave a tenth of a second of the 0-60 time. That’s more power than a compact sports sedan has any business messing around with, but Mercedes has clearly taken an American stance on this one: more power = more awesome. All of this twist is routed to the rear wheels via Benz’s seven-speed AMG Speedshift dual-clutch transmission, which has apparently been retuned for even faster shifts. We’re big fans of this particular transmission, but any improvements are always welcomed and encouraged. In addition to the massive stable of ponies under the hood, Mercedes has added plenty of features to help the C63 manage a corner without too much drama. The C63 uses dynamic engine mounts, a three-stage adjustable damping system, and ceramic-composite brakes to reign in the rampant wave of horsepower. In an age of shrinking engines and over-boosting, it’s refreshing to see Mercedes stick with the V-8 engine in its popular sports sedan, even if it is twin-turbocharged. While it doesn’t have the same raw old-school feel as the outgoing 6.2-liter V-8, the 4.0-liter should be the source of less hair-pulling at the pump. Mercedes hasn’t released pricing for the 2015 C63 yet, but expect it to be very close to the M3’s starting price of 62,000. The C63 is set to hit dealer lots in March of 2015, with the most eager of customers able to get their hands on the exclusive “Edition 1” version upon release. The C63 has always been the roaring muscle car in comparison to the balanced and poised BMW M3, but with improvements to the chassis and suspension, we wouldn’t be surprised to see the C63 hold its own around a track this time around. Time will tell if the benchmark Bimmer has been beaten at its own game. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1. The 2015 Mercedes-AMG C63 is a high-performance sports sedan with up to 503 horsepower, featuring a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine. 2.

In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The process of cell division is how multicellular organisms grow and repair themselves. It is also how many organisms produce offspring. For many single-celled organisms, asexual reproduction is a similar process. The parent cell simply divides to form two daughter cells that are identical to the parent. Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent, whereas sexual reproduction produces a similar, but genetically unique offspring. In sexual reproduction, meiosis produces haploid gametes that fuse during fertilization to produce a diploid zygote ( Figure below ). In other words, a child inherits half of the genetic material from each parent. Look at the family in Figure below . The children resemble their parents, but they are not identical to them.

CHAPTER XV  Now that Gordon was gone, at any rate, gone for good, and not to return, he felt a sudden and singular sense of freedom. It was a feeling of unbounded expansion, quite out of proportion, as he said to himself, to any assignable cause. Everything suddenly appeared to have become very optional; but he was quite at a loss what to do with his liberty. It seemed a harmless use to make of it, in the afternoon, to go and pay another visit to the ladies who lived at the confectioner's. Here, however, he met a reception which introduced a fresh element of perplexity into the situation that Gordon had left behind him. The door was opened to him by Mrs. Vivian's maid-servant, a sturdy daughter of the Schwartzwald, who informed him that the ladies--with much regret--were unable to receive any one.  \\"They are very busy--and they are ill,\\" said the young woman, by way of explanation.  Bernard was disappointed, and he felt like arguing the case.  \\"Surely,\\" he said, \\"they are not both ill and busy! When you make excuses, you should make them agree with each other.\\"  The Teutonic soubrette fixed her round blue eyes a minute upon the patch of blue sky revealed to her by her open door.  \\"I say what I can, lieber Herr.

Question: \\"What was a rejection of the public?\\"  Context: \\"The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic. This can also be said of the Roman upper classes, were Stoicism was dominant, as seen in the Meditations of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the works of Cicero.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"A rejection of the public, in the context of the mentioned philosophical schools and their views, refers to the disapproval or avoidance of participating in public life, civic service, and engagement in the political sphere of the ancient Greek world. In the case of the Epicureans and Cynics, their teachings led them to reject public offices and civic service, which essentially amounted to a rejection of the polis (city-state) itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an ascetic lifestyle focused on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. This philosophy encouraged a more private, individualistic life rather than engaging in public interactions. Similarly, the Cynics, such as Diogenes of Sinope, rejected material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. They believed that personal happiness and freedom could not be achieved by participating in public life and conforming to social norms. In contrast, other philosophical schools like Stoicism, Platonism, and Aristotelianism had a significant influence on the Greek and subsequently, the Roman ruling elite, and these schools did not necessarily reject the public. Stoicism, in particular, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia or happiness because it allowed for living in accordance with nature or Logos. This philosophy encouraged engagement in public life and influenced figures like Marcus Aurelius, a Roman emperor. Overall, the rejection of the public in the context of ancient Greek philosophical schools refers to the distancing or refusal to participate in public life, civic service, and politics, as viewed by the Epicureans and Cynics. This approach stood in contrast to other philosophical traditions that encouraged or, at least, did not reject participation in public life and governance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ripple, of Kansas City, Kan., was arrested after allegedly robbing a bank and then sitting down in the lobby and waiting for the police. (Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office)      Home? Or jail?      Wife? Or sheriff’s deputies? Such choices.      Federal authorities say Larry Ripple chose a life behind bars over another minute at home with the wife. On Friday afternoon, according to a complaint filed in federal court, Ripple, 70, walked into the Bank of Labor in downtown Kansas City, Kan., handed over a note to a teller which said, “I have a gun, give me your cash,” and was given 2,924 in currency from the drawer. (Now is the part where we typically write, “The robber then fled the bank.”)      The robber then took a seat in the lobby and began chatting with the bank security guard, the complaint by Special Agent Eric R. Beltz states. All of this was captured on surveillance video. “I’m the guy you’re looking for,” Ripple allegedly told the guard. The guard took Ripple into custody and retrieved the 2,924, Beltz wrote. The police and FBI were summoned, and Ripple was taken to the police station. (This story was first reported by the Kansas City Star’s ace courts reporter, Tony Rizzo.)      Advised of his Miranda rights, about 45 minutes after the stickup, Ripple agreed to speak to the authorities and said that “he and his wife had an argument at home and Ripple no longer wanted to be in the situation. Ripple wrote out his demand note in front of his wife,” Beltz wrote, “and told her he’d rather be in jail than at home. Ripple then walked to the bank and robbed it.” Further details of the domestic unrest were not reported in the complaint.      Ripple was promptly incarcerated and held in the Wyandotte County jail, charged with one federal count of bank robbery. However . . .      On Wednesday, federal authorities foiled his plot.

Given the question: Information:  - Ayacucho is a region of Peru, located in the south-central Andes of the country. Its capital is the city of Ayacucho. The region was one of the hardest hit by terrorism during the 1980s during the guerrilla war waged by Shining Path known as the internal conflict in Peru.  - El Callao (or ) is the chief seaport of Peru. The city is also called Provincia Constitucional (Constitutional Province), the only province of the Callao Region. The Historic Centre of Callao is located west of Historic Centre of Lima, the country's capital, and is part of the Lima Metropolitan Area. Callao borders Lima Province on the north, east and south, and the Pacific Ocean on the west.  - The Battle of Ayacucho was a decisive military encounter during the Peruvian War of Independence. It was the battle that secured the independence of Peru and ensured independence for the rest of South America. In Peru it is considered the end of the Spanish American wars of independence, although the campaign of the victor Antonio José de Sucre, continued through 1825 in Upper Peru and the siege of the fortresses Chiloé and Callao finally ended in 1826.  - Antonio José de Sucre y Alcalá (17951830), known as the \\"Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho\\", was a Venezuelan independence leader and the second President of Bolivia. Sucre was one of Simón Bolívar's closest friends, generals and statesmen. The city of Sucre, Bolivia's capital, is named for him, as is a state of Venezuela and a department of Colombia.  - \\"This article is about a historical region now in Bolivia. Alto Perú is also the name of a shanty town area just outside Lima, Peru (see Asociacion SOLAC).\\"  - Ayacucho, is the capital city of Huamanga Province, Ayacucho Region, Peru.  - Huamanga is a province in northern part of the Ayacucho Region in Peru. The capital of the province is the city of Ayacucho.  - The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, after the French invasion of Spain during Europe's Napoleonic Wars. Although various regions of Spanish America objected to crown policies the restricted trade and privileged Spanish-born officials over American-born, \\"there was little interest in outright independence; indeed there was widespread support for the Spanish Central Junta formed to lead the resistance against the French.\\" These conflicts started in 1809 with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville. When the Central Junta fell to the French invasion, in 1810, numerous new juntas appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas. The conflicts among these colonies and with Spain eventually resulted in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south to Mexico in the north in the first third of the 19th century. Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until the SpanishAmerican War in 1898.  - The Peruvian War of Independence was composed of a series of military conflicts beginning in 1811 that culminated in 1824 with the defeat of the Spanish Empire in the battles of Junin and Ayacucho. During the previous decade Peru had been a stronghold for royalists, who fought those in favor of independence in Upper Peru, Quito and Chile. The wars of independence took place with the background of the 1780-1781 uprising by indigenous leader Túpac Amaru II and the earlier removal of Upper Peru and the Río de la Plata regions from the Viceroyalty of Peru. Because of this the viceroy often had the support of the \\"Lima oligarchy,\\" who saw their elite interests threatened by popular rebellion and were opposed to the new commercial class in Buenos Aires. Among the most important events during the war was the proclamation of independence of Peru by José de San Martín on July 28, 1821.  - The Historical Sanctum of the Pampa of Ayacucho settled on August 14 , 1980 , by means of Supreme Decree N ° 119 - 80 - AA .

In 1976, he won the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical and the Tony Award for Best Choreography for the musical A Chorus Line.

He studied dance and choreography in his teens and staged a number of shows in his local high school before dropping out to accept the role of Baby John in the US and European tours of West Side Story.  Bennett's career as a Broadway dancer began in the 1961 Betty Comden-Adolph Green-Jule Styne musical Subways Are for Sleeping, after which he appeared in Meredith Willson's Here's Love and the short-lived Bajour. In the mid-1960s he was a featured dancer on the NBC pop music series Hullabaloo, where he met fellow dancer Donna McKechnie.  Bennett made his choreographic debut with A Joyful Noise (1966), which lasted only twelve performances, and in 1967 followed it with another failure, Henry, Sweet Henry (based on the Peter Sellers film The World of Henry Orient). Success finally arrived in 1968, when he choreographed the hit musical Promises, Promises on Broadway. With a contemporary pop score by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, a wisecracking book by Neil Simon and Bennett's well-received production numbers, including \\"Turkey Lurkey Time\\", the show ran for 1,281 performances. Over the next few years, he earned praise for his work on the straight play Twigs with Sada Thompson and the musical Coco with Katharine Hepburn. These were followed by two Stephen Sondheim productions, Company and Follies co-directed with Hal Prince.  In 1973, Bennett was asked by producers Joseph Kipness and Larry Kasha to take over the ailing Cy Coleman-Dorothy Fields musical Seesaw. In replacing the director Ed Sherin and choreographer Grover Dale, he asked for absolute control over the production as director and choreographer and received credit as \\"having written, directed, and choreographed\\" the show.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Where was Bennett born?","output":"Bennett was born Michael Bennett DiFiglia in Buffalo, New York."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the notname of the person who was based in Cologne and was once one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer?  Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral.... Answer:","output":"The notname of the person who was based in Cologne and was once one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer is \\"the Dombild Master\\" or \\"Master Stefan.\\" This notname is associated with Stefan Lochner, a German painter born around 1410 who worked in the \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combined the characteristics of that period, such as long, flowing lines and brilliant colors, with the realism, virtuoso surface textures, and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Lochner was based in Cologne, a significant commercial and artistic hub in northern Europe at the time. His extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs, and illuminated manuscripts, often featuring fanciful and blue-winged angels. It is believed that he was born in Meersburg in southwest Germany and may have received part of his training in the Low Countries. Records indicate that he enjoyed a successful career that was suddenly cut short by his early death, possibly due to the plague that hit Cologne in 1451. The notname \\"Dombild Master\\" originated from the Dombild Altarpiece (also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints), which is still located in Cologne Cathedral. Although extensive historical research has shed light on Stefan Lochner's life and work, attributing specific pieces to him with certainty remains challenging. As a result, for centuries, many associated works were grouped together and attributed to the Dombild Master without a definitive connection to Lochner. It was only during the early 19th-century Romantic period that Lochner's identity and reputation were rediscovered, and the notname became more firmly linked to the historical figure of Stefan Lochner."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Passage: French historians traditionally place the Enlightenment between 1715, the year that Louis XIV died, and 1789, the beginning of the French Revolution. Some recent historians begin the period in the 1620s, with the start of the scientific revolution. The Philosophes, the French term for the philosophers of the period, widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons and coffee houses, and through printed books and pamphlets. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the church, and paved the way for the revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries.

Given the fact \\"a spider web is used to capture food by spiders\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"What is one use of a spider's web?\\"","output":"One use of a spider's web is to capture food for the spider. Spider webs are intricate structures created by spiders using their spinnerets, which are specialized organs capable of producing silk. While there are multiple types of spider webs, their primary function is the same – to catch prey. To effectively capture their prey, spiders spin their webs in strategic locations where the likelihood of capturing their food is high. These locations can include areas near lights that attract flying insects, across narrow gaps that insects might fly through and close to plants where insects gather. Spider webs can take various forms like the classic orb web, the sheet web, and the funnel web, all designed to suit the spiders' unique hunting style. Spider webs are primarily made of a complex protein-based silk, which combines both strength and elasticity. The silk can stretch without breaking, making it an excellent material for capturing prey without losing its structural integrity. This protein-based silk is extruded from the spinnerets and hardens upon contact with the air. In addition to its strength and elasticity, the spider web also incorporates a glue-like substance, which increases its ability to hold onto prey that makes contact with the web. This glue, known as an aggregate, is made of glycoproteins and low molecular weight compounds, and it contributes to the capturing process by immobilizing prey upon contact. Once an insect is caught in a spider's web, the spider senses the disturbance in the web's vibration and quickly locates its prey. Depending on the type of spider, it may either inject venom to paralyze the prey or wrap it in silk to incapacitate it. Once immobilized, the spider transports its captured prey to a secure location to consume it. In many cases, spiders consume their own webs after they have served their purpose, recycling the silk proteins for future web-building activities. In summary, one significant use of a spider's web is to capture food for the spider, allowing the spider to effectively hunt and feed in a strategic and resourceful way. The spider web's remarkable design and construction, combining strength, elasticity, and adhesiveness, enable spiders to capture a wide range of prey, greatly contributing to their survival and success as a species."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 30-year bond US30YT = RR firmed 14 / 32 , taking its yield to 4.19 percent from 4.22 percent . Please tell me if the sentences above mean the same. Pick your answer from: (A). no. (B). yes.","output":"(A). no. The two sentences provided describe similar situations but are not exactly the same. The key differences are in the bond's change in price (firming) and its corresponding yield. In the first sentence, \\"The 30-year bond < US30YT = RR > firmed 24/32, taking its yield to 4.18 percent, after hitting another record low of 4.16 percent.\\" It indicates that the bond's price increased by 24/32 (or 0.75), leading to a yield reduction to 4.18 percent. The sentence also notes that the bond had previously reached a record low yield of 4.16 percent. In the second sentence, \\"The 30-year bond US30YT = RR firmed 14/32, taking its yield to 4.19 percent from 4.22 percent.\\" It indicates that the bond's price increased by 14/32 (approximately 0.44), reducing its yield to 4.19 percent from the previous yield of 4.22 percent. The two sentences portray similar events with both bonds experiencing an increase in price, resulting in a decrease in yield. However, the specifics of the price firming and the resulting yield differ between the two sentences. Consequently, these sentences do not mean exactly the same thing, and the answer is (A). No."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Analyze the actions associated with each subject: The \\"Archaeologists\\" are concluding, while \\"They\\" are hunting for deer. 3.

The answer should be","output":"4). then chops romaine and places them in a silver bin and mixes endive with the romaine. The correct answer is option 4 because it continues the story of the chef preparing a dish, specifically involving the handling and mixing of ingredients. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: 1). This option does not contribute to the progression of the story; it simply describes the chef performing unrelated actions with the bin and does not incorporate any new or relevant information about the dish being prepared. 2). This option, while it may be relevant in a different context, is not the natural next step in the story about preparing a dish. It focuses on a tangent about juices and enjoyment rather than the actual process of handling and mixing ingredients. 3). This option also deviates from the main storyline of the chef preparing a dish.
